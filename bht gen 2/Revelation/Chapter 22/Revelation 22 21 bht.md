# Revelation 22:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May the gracious presence of our Lord Jesus Christ abide with you all. This benediction, commonly used by the sacred writers, signifies the unchanging love and favor of our Lord. As John takes up this mantle from Paul, we witness the New Testament drawing to a close with a blessing rather than a curse. Allow this blessing to influence your heart and mind, deepening your appreciation for the Scriptures and their potential to transform lives. May this endeavor to elucidate the Word be used by the Almighty to convert sinners and edify believers, magnifying His name and hastening His kingdom. Amen.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
The closing benediction, Paul's mark in his Epistles, was after Paul's death taken up by John. The Old Testament ended with a "curse" in connection with the law; the New Testament ends with a blessing in union with the Lord Jesus. (Quote 1)
May the Blessed Lord who has caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning, bless this humble effort to make Scripture expound itself, and make it an instrument towards the conversion of sinners and the edification of saints, to the glory of His great name and the hastening of His kingdom! Amen. (Quote 2)
