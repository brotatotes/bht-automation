## BHT:
In the future, there will be no trace of the curse that originated from sin. The new earth will be free from pain, sorrow, and death, as well as the wrath of God. The redeemed will have the privilege of constant access to the throne of God, where His glorious presence and reign will be established. In this state, the saints will engage in the highest honor and noblest employment - worshipping and serving God, celebrating His perfections, ascribing glory to Him, and magnifying His grace.
