# Revelation 22:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blessed shall see His face, experiencing a divine glory in Christ Jesus that Moses himself was denied. They will intimately know Him as they are known by Him, and as sons of God, their love will flow freely among the members of Christ's family in the new Jerusalem. Their faces will bear His name, openly acknowledged by all, and in this heavenly state, they will reign, forever distinguished from those who were saved as if by fire.

1. "They shall see his face,.... The face of God, so as he is not to be seen now; they shall see him as he is; not only the angels, who always behold the face of God, but all the saints, risen and changed..."
2. "they shall have intimate and familiar communion with him; they shall enjoy his favour, and have the freest and largest discoveries of his love..."
3. "they shall behold Christ and his glory both with the eyes of their understanding, and with the eyes of their bodies..."

### John Wesley:
1. "And shall see his face — Which was not granted to Moses. They shall have the nearest access to, and thence the highest resemblance of, him. This is the highest expression in the language of scripture to denote the most perfect happiness of the heavenly state, 1 John 3:2."
2. "And his name shall be on their foreheads — Each of them shall be openly acknowledged as God's own property, and his glorious nature most visibly shine forth in them."
3. "And they shall reign — But who are the subjects of these kings? The other inhabitants of the new earth. For there must needs be an everlasting difference between those who when on earth excelled in virtue, and those comparatively slothful and unprofitable servants, who were just saved as by fire."
