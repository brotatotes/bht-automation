# Revelation 22:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle, a sincere and trustworthy man, claims to be the one who hears and sees these things, linking the opening and closing paragraphs of the book together. Although he had previously fallen down to worship at the feet of an angel and was corrected for it, it is understandable that he may have made the same mistake again, given the glory of the revelations he had received. This repetition serves as a warning against idolatry and reinforces the importance of not worshiping angels.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Rapturous emotion, gratitude, and adoration, at the prospect of the Church's future glory transport him out of himself, so as all but to fall into an unjustifiable act." 
2. "It is observable that in Revelation 19:10, the language is, 'I fell before his feet to worship him'; but here, 'I fell down to worship (God?) before the feet of the angel.' It seems unlikely that John, when once reproved, would fall into the very same error again." 
3. "John had first intended to worship the angel (Revelation 19:10), but now only at his feet intends to worship (God). The angel does not even permit this."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I saw the parts that were disclosed by pictures, visions, and symbols; I heard the parts that were communicated by direct revelation."
2. "John appears to have been entirely overcome by the extraordinary nature of the revelations made to him, and not improbably entertained some suspicion that it was the Redeemer himself who had manifested himself to him in this remarkable manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I John am he that heard and saw." 
2. "The appeal to hearing and seeing is common to all John's writings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Once more, as at chap. Revelation 1:1; Revelation 1:4, the Seer names himself, thus again binding together the opening and closing paragraphs of his book, a clear proof that by the words ‘these things’ we are to understand the contents of the whole book and not merely those of its latest section."
2. "Once before, at chap. Revelation 19:10, he had done the same thing, and had been corrected for it. We need not wonder that he should do it again; nor is it necessary to think that, having just heard the words ‘Behold, I come quickly, he may have been doubtful whether the angel before him was the Lord Himself or not. Such had been the glory of the revelations that a mistake of this kind might easily be made more than once."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here he claims to be the 'one who hears and sees these things.'"
2. "It was a natural, though a wrong, thing to do, especially after Christ's own voice followed that of the angel 'which showed me these things.'"
3. "It was a natural, though a wrong, thing to do."

### John Gill:
1. "He being an apostle of Christ, and a man of great sincerity and probity, is to be believed." 
2. "What a propensity there is in mankind to idolatry; and very likely this might be suffered, that a second reproof might be given, and repeated instructions be on record, to prevent the worshipping of angels."

### John Wesley:
1. "I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel — The very same words which occur, Revelation 19:10."
2. "The reproof of the angel, likewise, 'See thou do it not,' for I am thy fellowservant, is expressed in the very same terms as before."
3. "May it not be the very same incident which is here related again? Is not this far more probable, than that the apostle would commit a fault again, of which he had been so solemnly warned before?"
