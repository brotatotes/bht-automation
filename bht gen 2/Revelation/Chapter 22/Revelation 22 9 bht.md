# Revelation 22:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel's abrupt phrase, See thou do it not, reflects his strong aversion to being worshipped, even indirectly. This is in sharp contrast to the fallen angel's temptation to Jesus, asking Him to Fall down and worship me. The angel's prohibition is emphasized even more by the omission of the word for, aligning with the earnestness of his command. Ultimately, all creatures must only worship God, as even the angel acknowledges being a fellow servant with John and the prophets.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Literally, "See not"; the abruptness of the phrase marking the angel's abhorrence of the thought of his being worshipped however indirectly."
2. "Contrast the fallen angel's temptation to Jesus, 'Fall down and worship me' (Matthew 4:9)."
3. "For - A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, ANDREAS, and CYPRIAN omit 'for'; which accords with the abrupt earnestness of the angel's prohibition of an act derogatory to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the capacity in which he appeared to John, he belonged to the general rank of the prophets, and was no more entitled to worship than any of the prophets had been."
2. "Like them, he had merely been employed to disclose important truths in regard to the future; but as the prophets, even the most eminent of them, were not regarded as entitled to worship on account of the communications which they had made, no more was he."
3. "The 'sayings of this book' which he says he kept, must be understood to mean those great principles of religion which it enjoined, and which are of equal obligation on human beings and angels."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. See thou do it not [ορα μη] . Lit., see not. Thy brethren the prophets. The spiritual brotherhood of John with the prophets is exhibited in Revelation.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I am a fellow-servant with thee, and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them which keep the words of this book: worship God."
2. "Before God alone must all His creatures bow."
3. "All are only His ‘servants,’ and it is their duty to encourage one another in their mutual service."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "See thou do it not. The angel promptly interposes. Here we have added to the words...the prophets and also 'them which keep the words of this book', the last a repetition from Revelation 22:7."
2. "In both places we have 'Worship God'. And not an angel."

### John Gill:
1. "I am thy fellow servant: of God, and of Christ, and am no more the object of worship than thyself; and both of us are, and ought to be, the worshippers of God, whose servants we are."
2. "And of thy brethren the prophets; the apostles and ministers of the word; for prophesying and preaching are the same thing;"
3. "Worship God; and him only, and that in a spiritual manner, with reverence and godly fear, in faith, and according to his revealed will."

### John Wesley:
1. See thou do it not|-The expression in the original is short and elliptical, as is usual in showing vehement aversion.
