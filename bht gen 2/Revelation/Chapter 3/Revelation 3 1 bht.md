# Revelation 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The statement reveals that the Holy Spirit is the source of all spiritual vitality and strength. The mention of the seven stars signifies those in subordinate positions to Christ. In this passage, the addressed church appears to have had a good reputation or an outward appearance of life, but the call to be watchful suggests a need for self-examination and a deeper connection with Christ. It serves as a reminder that genuine spiritual life and vitality come from an authentic, inward relationship with Christ, rather than relying solely on appearances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that hath the seven Spirits of Godâ€”that is, He who hath all the fulness of the Spirit... proving His Godhead." 
2. "His having the seven stars, or presiding ministers, flows, as a consequence, from His having the seven Spirits, or the fulness of the Holy Spirit."
3. "Sardis was famed among the churches for spiritual vitality; yet the Heart-searcher, who seeth not as man seeth, pronounces her dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There were more varied and more vivid remembrances associated with the sight of Sardis than could possibly be attached to any other spot of earth; but all were mingled with a feeling of disgust at the littleness of human glory. All - all had passed away!"
2. "If the phrase, 'the seven Spirits of God,' as there supposed, refers to the Holy Spirit, there is great propriety in saying of the Saviour, that he has that Spirit, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit is represented as sent forth by him into the world."
3. "The Saviour does not, as in the case of the churches of Ephesus and Thyatira, specify any prevailing form of error or false doctrine; but it would seem that here it was a simple waist of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sardis was in very early times an important commercial city... It was also the place where the metal electrum was procured... The impure worship of the goddess Cybele was celebrated there..."
2. "Be watchful... Lit., become awake and on the watch... Become what thou art not. Strengthen..."
3. "That are ready to die... Read emellon were ready or about (to die)... I have not found thy works... Some texts omit the article before works, in which case we should render, I have found no works of thine... Perfect... Lit., fulfilled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that hath the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars...They that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth." 
2. "That thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead...let such a church remember that the outward is not the inward, and that power and splendour of position have no value in the sight of Heaven compared with spirituality of heart and life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "City of softness and luxury, of apathy and immorality, 'a contrast of past splendour and present unresting decline'." 
2. "A name in contrast with reality."
3. "The paradox of death under the name of life."

### John Gill:
1. "This church represents the state of the church from the time of the Reformation by Luther and others, until a more glorious state of the church appears, or until the spiritual reign of Christ in the Philadelphian period."
2. "Christ's making use of the same title here as in the epistle to the church at Ephesus, which represents the apostolic church, may show that this church state bore some degree of likeness to that, and that it was a sort of renewing of it."
3. "The reformed churches have had a name for spiritual living, by faith on Christ's righteousness only for justification, that article being the great article of the Reformation."

### John Wesley:
1. "The seven spirits of God - The Holy Spirit, from whom alone all spiritual life and strength proceed."
2. "And the seven stars - which are subordinate to him."
3. "Thou hast a name that thou livest - A fair reputation, a goodly outside appearance. But that Spirit seeth through all things, and every empty appearance vanishes before him."
