# Revelation 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word of Christ teaches the need for patience in our lives. It is a word that reminds us of the patience displayed by Christ himself, even in the face of difficulties and humiliations. Those who keep this word, who manifest the patience that Christ requires, will be rewarded. They will be kept from the afflictions and distress that will befall others. In the midst of tribulations, they will experience the joy of exemption. While the world may experience fierce persecution, those who hold fast to the word of Christ will find themselves preserved and protected.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word of My endurance" is My Gospel word, which teaches patient endurance in expectation of my coming ( :-). My endurance is the endurance which I require, and which I practice.
2. Christ Himself now endures, patiently waiting until the usurper be cast out, and all "His enemies be made His footstool." So, too, His Church, for the joy before her of sharing His coming kingdom, endures patiently.
3. The temptation brings out the fidelity of those kept by Christ and hardens the unbelieving reprobates. The particular persecutions which befell Philadelphia shortly after, were the earnest of the great last tribulation before Christ's coming, to which the Church's attention in all ages is directed.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience - My word commanding or enjoining patience; that is, thou hast manifested the patience which I require."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reference is neither to any precepts of Christ concerning patience, nor to any accounts given us of the patience of Christ Himself, but simply to Christ’s ‘word,’ which cannot be kept without much patient endurance on the part of His people."
2. "Out of this trial believers are to be kept, not that they are to be kept in it, when in the course of providence it comes upon the Church as well as others, but that they are to be kept entirely out of it; it shall not touch them."
3. "The trial comes upon the whole inhabited world; no part of the world shall escape it. But at the same time, it comes to try them that dwell upon the earth, not all living men without exception, but, as clearly shown by the use of this expression in the Apocalypse, only the wicked."
