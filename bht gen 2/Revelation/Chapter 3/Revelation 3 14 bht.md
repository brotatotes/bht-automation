# Revelation 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church in Laodicea receives a message from the True One, who is concerned for them as evidenced by Paul's previous letter. The term the Amen signifies that He Himself is the fulfillment of all that God has spoken to His churches, and as the faithful and true witness, His work is to testify of God and His truth. He is also the beginning of the creation of God, not as the first creature, but as the originating source through whom God works in creating all things.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wealth of Laodicea led to a self-satisfied, lukewarm state in spiritual things."
2. "The title 'Amen,' harmonizes with the address. His unchanging faithfulness as 'the Amen' contrasts with Laodicea's wavering of purpose."
3. "As the 'Amen' expresses the unchangeable truth of His promises, so 'the faithful and true witness' expresses the truth of His revelations as to the heavenly things."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'Amen' means 'true,' 'certain,' 'faithful'; and, as used here, it means that he to whom it is applied is eminently true and faithful."
2. "He is a witness for God and his truth, and he can approve of nothing which the God of truth would not approve."
3. "He is 'the beginning of the creation of God,' in the sense that he is the head or prince of the creation; that is, that he presides over it so far as the purposes of redemption are to be accomplished, and so far as is necessary for those purposes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term applied to the Lord signifies that He Himself is the fulfilment of all that God has spoken to the churches." 
2. "The veracity of Christ is thus asserted in the word faithful, true being not true as distinguished from false, but true to the normal idea of a witness."
3. "The beginner, or author; not as Colossians 1:15, the first and most excellent creature of God's hands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord is the Amen...that He is Himself the fulfillment of all that God has spoken to His churches."
2. "Again, He is the faithful and true witness. His work is to be a witness of God, and in that work He has been perfectly 'faithful,' absolutely 'true.'"
3. "Once more He is the beginning of the creation of God...the principle, the initial force, to which the 'creation' of God owes its origin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No praise is bestowed on this church, but only blame for its lukewarmness."
2. "The Amen. Personal (masculine article) name here alone, though in Isaiah 65:16 we have 'the God of Amen' understood in the LXX as 'the God of truth.' Here applied to Christ."
3. "Not the first of creatures as the Arians held and Unitarians do now, but the originating source of creation through whom God works."

### John Gill:
1. "This church represents the state of the church, from the end of the spiritual reign of Christ, till the time of his personal appearing and kingdom, to judge the quick and dead..."
2. "Christ may be so called, because he is the God of truth, and truth itself; and it may be expressive of his faithfulness, both to God his Father, and to his people..."
3. "The beginning of the creation of God; not the first creature that God made, but the first cause of the creation; the first Parent, producer, and efficient cause of every creature..."

### John Wesley:
1. "To the angel of the church at Laodicea — For these St. Paul had had a great concern, Colossians 2:1."
2. "These things saith the Amen — That is, the True One, the God of truth."
3. "The beginning — The Author, Prince, and Ruler. Of the creation of God — Of all creatures; the beginning, or Author, by whom God made them all."
