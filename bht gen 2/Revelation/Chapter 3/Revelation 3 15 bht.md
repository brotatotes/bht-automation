# Revelation 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The lukewarm state, characterized by indifference and a lack of fervor, is not a desirable state. It is a dangerous condition of being attached to the world and actively opposing the Church. Christ desires for individuals to recognize their need for spiritual heat and fervency, as being cold without any thought or profession of religion would be more hopeful for recovery. This lukewarm state masks the need for a true and genuine relationship with God, hindering spiritual growth and leading to a false sense of security.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The lukewarm state, if it be the transitional stage to a warmer, is a desirable state (for a little religion, if real, is better than none); but most fatal when, as here, an abiding condition, for it is mistaken for a safe state."
2. "For then there would not be the same 'danger of mixed motive and disregarded principle.'"
3. "But the lukewarm has been brought within reach of the holy fire, without being heated by it into fervor: having religion enough to lull the conscience in false security, but not religion enough to save the soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The state indicated here...in fact, was deadness and indifference to him and his cause."
2. "Sad as the state is, it is at least honest...we all prefer such a character to one where professions are made which are never to be realized - to a state of insincerity and hypocrisy."
3. "The most hopeless of all persons...is those who are members of the church without any true religion...there are probably fewer persons by far converted... than any other class of persons of a similar number."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cold [ψυχρος] . Attached to the world and actively opposed to the Church."
2. "Inasmuch as a man in earnest, be he right or wrong, is ever a better man than one professing what he does not feel."
3. "Hot [ζεστος] . From zew to boil or seethe."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In no circumstances could either of these states be to the Lord an object of desire, for experience shows that there is none out of which it is so difficult to awaken the heart to a proper reception of the Divine message."
2. "It seems only possible to think of 'coldness' as real attachment to the world, and active opposition to the Church."
3. "The church at Laodicea was neither 'cold' nor 'hot.' It had received the truth outwardly, but no deep impression had been made upon it. Its members were not zealous for the truth, but neither were they zealous against it. It was lukewarm, destitute of enthusiasm for anything whether good or evil."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Old word from ψυχω, to grow cold (Matthew 24:12), in N.T. only Matthew 10:42 and this passage." 
2. "Late verbal from ζεω, to boil, (Romans 12:11), boiling hot, here only in N.T." 
3. "Wish about the present with οφελον (really ωφελον, second aorist active indicative of οφειλω, without augment) with the imperfect ης (instead of the infinitive) as in 2 Corinthians 11:1, when the old Greek used ειθε or ε γαρ."

### John Gill:
1. "She was alive, but not lively: nor was she wholly without spiritual affections and love; to God, and Christ, to his people, ways, truths, and ordinances; she had love, but the fervency of it was abated."
2. "Christ desires not simply that she might be cold, but that she might be sensible of her need of spiritual heat and fervency."

### John Wesley:
1. "I know thy works — Thy disposition and behaviour, though thou knowest it not thyself."
2. "Nor hot — As boiling water: so ought we to be penetrated and heated by the fire of love."
3. "Cold or hot — Even if thou wert cold, without any thought or profession of religion, there would be more hope of thy recovery."
