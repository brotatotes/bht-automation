# Revelation 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A lukewarm professor of faith is one who serves both God and mammon, lacking a genuine understanding of true religion. Indifferent and divided in their allegiance, they find themselves in a state of spiritual mediocrity. This tepid condition is repugnant to Christ, who warns of the impending consequence of being cast out if there is no repentance. The lukewarmness of one's devotion is likened to lukewarm water, which is known to be ineffective.
