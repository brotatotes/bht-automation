# Revelation 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The danger of a lukewarm state lies in the self-sufficiency that can come with it. This is a danger the church in Laodicea faced, as they prided themselves on their material and spiritual riches. However, the possession of wealth can lead to a self-complacent and satisfied attitude, causing one to become lukewarm in their faith and odious to Christ. The reality is that even with material abundance, one can be spiritually poor and miserable. This is the state that the Lord addresses, urging them to recognize their true condition as wretched and pitiable, despite their perceived self-sufficiency.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Self-sufficiency is the fatal danger of a lukewarm state."
2. "The Lord alludes to Revelation 3:17. The riches on which they prided themselves were spiritual riches."
3. "How different Christ's estimate of men, from their own estimate of themselves, 'I have need of nothing!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no doubt that there was much wealth in Laodicea, and that, as a people, they prided themselves on their riches."
2. "The possession of great wealth tends to make a professed Christian self-complacent and satisfied in every respect; to make him feel that, although he may not have much religion, yet he is on the whole well off; and to produce, in religion, a state of just such lukewarmness as the Saviour here says was loathsome and odious."
3. "People may think themselves to be rich, and yet, in fact, be miserably poor... People may have great property, and yet be miserable. There is no more pitiable condition than that where one has great property, and is self-complacent and proud, and who has nevertheless no God, no Saviour, no hope of heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Increased with goods [πεπλουτηκα]. The reference is to imagined spiritual riches, not to worldly possessions." 
2. "Wretched [ο ταλαιπωρος]. ... giving the force of the article, the wretched one. From tlaw to endure, and peira a trial."
3. "Miserable [ελεεινος]. Only here and 1 Corinthians 5:19. An object of pity [ελεος]. Poor [πτωχος]."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was worldly prosperity that had made the church indifferent to the energy and power of Divine truth."
2. "To such a state of mind riches are a bar."
3. "Such is the state of mind which the Lord seems here to address, and hence the powerful language of the following words, 'and knowest not that thou art the wretched one, and miserable, etc.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The church 'carried the pride of wealth into its spiritual life' (Swete)."
2. "This church was in a rich city and was rich in pride and conceit, but poor in grace and ignorant of its spiritual poverty."
3. "The figure completes the picture of actual poverty."

### John Gill:
1. "Riches seldom do any good to the churches of Christ, they did not in Constantine's time; and it seems that even at the close of the spiritual reign of Christ they will be of bad consequence..."
2. "True believers, as considered in Christ, stand in need of nothing indeed, they are complete in him, and have everything in him; but, as considered in themselves, they are daily in need of daily food for their souls, as for their bodies, of fresh light and life, strength and comfort, and of new supplies of grace..."
3. "True believers account themselves wretched, as the Apostle Paul did, on account of indwelling sin, and the plague of their own hearts, which the members of this church, the greater part of them, were ignorant of..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Because thou sayest — Therefore 'I counsel thee,' etc."
2. "I am rich — In gifts and grace, as well as worldly goods."
3. "And knowest not that thou art — In God's account, wretched and pitiable."
