# Revelation 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ advises believers to obtain true riches by having a living faith that is refined in the furnace of affliction. These riches are not obtained through human effort or merit, but are freely given by Christ. They consist of true holiness and spiritual illumination, allowing believers to see clearly and understand the things of God. Material possessions alone do not bring true richness; it is only through an intimate relationship with Christ and His grace that one can be truly rich and spiritually fulfilled.
