# Revelation 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rebuke and chastisement are not rejection from Christ, but signs of His abiding and pleading love. They serve as reminders that His love has no exceptions and that His friends who have gone astray are called back through admonitions and trials. Rather than despairing, we should see rebuke as an opportunity for growth. True repentance requires an earnest and zealous change of purpose. Divine chastening, though painful, teaches us righteousness. Therefore, when we become lukewarm in our service to Christ, we should waste no time in returning to Him with renewed zeal.
