# Revelation 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be watchful to strengthen the things which remain in your soul - the knowledge of the truth, good desires, and convictions - for they are vulnerable to fading away. When pride, indolence, or levity resurface, they can cause the fruits of the Spirit to wither and almost die. Therefore, be diligent in nurturing these remnants, as they hold the potential for growth and vitality in your spiritual life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Strengthen those thy remaining few graces, which, in thy spiritual deadly slumber, are not yet quite extinct." 
2. "The three oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic, read, 'before (in the sight of) MY God'; Christ's judgment is God the Father's judgment." 
3. "Not that either had renounced the appearance of opposition to the world; but neither had the faithfulness to witness for God by word and example, so as to 'torment them that dwelt on the earth'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An important duty in a low and languishing state of religion is, to 'strengthen the things that still survive.'"
2. "In the lowest state of religion in a church there may be a few, perhaps quite obscure and of humble rank, who are mourning over the desolations of Zion, and who are sighing for better times."
3. "It is much to preserve life in grain sown in a field through the long and dreary winter, when all seems to be dead - for it will burst forth, with new life and beauty, in the spring."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Become watchful. Sardis had failed to ‘watch,’ the very sin into which spiritual pride is sure to fall." 
2. "And stablish the things that remain which were ready to die; that is, which were ready, at the moment when the searching eye of her Lord was first directed towards her, to sink into the state characterized as ‘dead.’" 
3. "In no part of the Christian life had Sardis reached that perfect spirituality after which she was to aspire. Spirituality is Christ’s perfection, His consummation in His state of glory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Be thou watchful...for there are vestiges of life." 
2. "Stablish the things that remain...Every new pastor faces such a problem."
3. "For I have not found any works of thine...Their works have not measured up to God's standard."

### John Gill:
1. "Be watchful....to see that the laws of Christ's house are put in execution."
2. "Strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die....by preaching the pure Gospel, by faithfully administering the ordinances of it, and by speaking comfortable and encouraging words."
3. "I have not found thy works perfect before God....they did not carry their works neither with respect to doctrine, and especially with respect to discipline and worship, to a greater perfection, as they ought to have done."

### John Wesley:
1. "The things which remain — In thy soul; knowledge of the truth, good desires, and convictions."
2. "Which were ready to die — Wherever pride, indolence, or levity revives, all the fruits of the Spirit are ready to die."
