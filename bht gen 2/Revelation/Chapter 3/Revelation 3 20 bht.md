# Revelation 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The image of Christ standing at the door serves as a powerful reminder of His constant presence, even in the face of our lukewarmness and carelessness. He graciously knocks, offering us the freedom to receive or reject Him. By opening the door to Christ, we invite Him into every aspect of our lives - His voice, commands, and example find a place in our hearts. This act of admission ushers in the light of His righteousness, transforming us from within. It is a poignant invitation to embrace His friendship and experience the blessedness of fellowship with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The vivid depiction of Christ standing at the door is introduced, to bring home to the lukewarm and careless church the truth of His constant presence, which she was so deeply forgetting."
2. "Our verse is a striking and decisive testimony to the practical freedom of our will to receive or reject the heavenly Guest: without the recognition of which, the love and tenderness of the saying become a hideous mockery."
3. "We then open the door to Christ when we admit Him, His voice, His commands, His example, to a share in our inner counsels and sources of action."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who is Himself 'the Door,' and who bids us 'knock' that it may be 'opened unto' us, is first Himself to knock at the door of our hearts."
2. "If we refuse to answer to His knocking at our door now, He will refuse to hear our knocking at His door hereafter."
3. "The Sun of righteousness, like the natural sun, the moment that the door is opened, pours in His light, which could not previously find an entrance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was still willing to be gracious, though their conduct had been such as to be loathsome."
2. "If admitted, he comes and dwells with us; if rejected, he turns quietly away - perhaps to return and knock again, perhaps never to come back."
3. "The truths, then, which are taught in this verse, are: (1)That the invitation of the gospel is made to all - 'if any man hear my voice'; (2)That the movement toward reconciliation and friendship is originated by the Saviour - 'behold, I stand at the door and knock'; (3)That there is a recognition of our own free agency in religion - 'if any man will hear my voice, and open the door'; (4)The ease of the terms of salvation, represented by 'hearing his voice,' and 'opening the door'; and, (5)The blessedness of thus admitting him, arising from his friendship - 'I will sup with him, and he with me.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He at whose door we ought to stand (for He is the Door, who, as such, has bidden us to knock), is content that the whole relation between Him and us should be reversed, and, instead of our standing at His door, condescends Himself to stand at ours."
2. "Love for men emptied God... and that He may show him the one who loves him, He does all things, and sorrowing, bears and dies."
3. "Christ not only knocks but speaks. 'The voice very often will interpret and make intelligible the purpose of the knock.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure is not intended to convey to the church the thought of the Lordâ€™s constant presence, but rather the assurance that He has taken up a new position, that He is at hand for judgment, and that He will immediately admit His people to the full enjoyment of His promised blessedness."
2. "The words simply show how near Jesus is, and how ready to bless (comp. James 5:9)."
3. "The picture is one of the heavenly reward, and both statements, I will sup with him, and he with me, are to be taken together. The first is not confined to the blessedness of earth, the second to the blessedness of heaven; but the two combined express the glory and joy of the future world, where the believer shall be forever with his Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I stand at the door. Picture of the Lord's advent as in Matthew 24:33; James 5:9, but true also of the individual response to Christ's call."
2. "If any man hear--and open. Condition of third class with ÎµÎ±Î½ and first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of Î±ÎºÎ¿Ï…Ï‰ and Î±Î½Î¿Î¹Î³Ï‰. See John 10:3; John 18:37."
3. "Will sup. Future active of Î´ÎµÎ¹Ï€Î½ÎµÏ‰, old verb, from Î´ÎµÎ¹Ï€Î½Î¿Î½ (supper), as in Luke 17:8. Fellowship in the Messianic kingdom."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase of standing at the door may be expressive of the near approach, or sudden coming of Christ to judgment."
2. "His knocking may signify the notice that will be given of it, by some of the immediate forerunners and signs of his coming."
3. "When he comes in person, he will take them at once into the marriage chamber, and shut the door upon the rest."

### John Wesley:
1. "I stand at the door, and knock â€” Even at this instant; while he is speaking this word." 
2. "If any man open â€” Willingly receive me."
3. "I will sup with him â€” Refreshing him with my graces and gifts, and delighting myself in what I have given. And he with me â€” In life everlasting."
