# Revelation 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He that hath an ear, let him hear... serves as a key message that calls for attentive understanding. It marks a transition between the first three letters and the last four, highlighting a shift in focus. The titles ascribed to our Lord in the initial letters emphasize His authority over the church, while the titles in the subsequent letters highlight His divine glory and unity with the Father and Holy Spirit. The promise of victory and overcoming is reserved for those who possess strong faith and triumph over significant challenges.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "From this point begins the Revelation proper, extending to the end of the book." 
2. "But preparatory to both these series of revelations, we have described to us in chapp. Revelation 4:5, the heavenly scenery which furnishes the local ground for these visions." 
3. "Of these, chap. 4 is properly the scene itself: chap. 5 being a further unfolding of its details with a view to the vision of the seals which is to follow."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "None but those who 'keep themselves' are likely to 'save' others."
2. "But two oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, c., read, 'convict', 'reprove to their conviction'; 'confute, so as to convince.'"
3. "The oldest manuscripts and versions read the accusative for the nominative, 'when separating themselves' [WAHL], referring to Judges 1:19; or 'when contending with you,' as the Greek is translated, Judges 1:19."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The captivity or ruin of the seven churches of Asia was consummated; and the barbarous lords of Ionia and Lydia still trample on the monuments of classic and Christian antiquity."
2. "There is perhaps no part of the New Testament more searching than these brief epistles to the seven churches."
3. "It is a consideration of as much importance to us as it was to these churches, that the Saviour now knows our works; that he sees in the church, and in any individual, all that there is to commend and all that there is to reprove; that he has power to reward or punish now as he had then; that he who overcomes the temptations of the world will find an appropriate reward; that those who live in sin must meet with the proper recompense, and that those who are lukewarm in his service will be spurned with unutterable loathing." (139 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That they are intended to be thus looked at is allowed by every interpreter. We have not merely before us seven letters to seven individual churches, which no inner bond connects with one another, and where there is no thought of any general result; we have a representation or picture of the Church at large."
2. "When we turn to the churches of the second group we enter upon a different field. The Church is now in actual contact with the world, and, forgetting her high calling to be Christâ€™s witness in and against the world, she yields to its corrupting influences."
3. "Such appears to us to be a general outline of the course of thought embodied in these seven Epistles. But it is not easy to speak with confidence regarding it. The general conception of the two groups of three and four may perhaps be accepted as correct."

### John Gill:
1. He that hath an ear, let him hear,.... :-.

### John Wesley:
1. "He that hath an ear, let him hear, â€¦ â€” This stands in the three former letters before the promise; in the four latter, after it; clearly dividing the seven into two parts"
2. "The titles given our Lord in the three former letters peculiarly respect his power after his resurrection and ascension, particularly over his church; those in the four latter, his divine glory, and unity with the Father and the Holy Spirit."
3. "It should be observed, that the overcoming, or victory, (to which alone these peculiar promises are annexed,) is not the ordinary victory obtained by every believer; but a special victory over great and peculiar temptations, by those that are strong in faith."
