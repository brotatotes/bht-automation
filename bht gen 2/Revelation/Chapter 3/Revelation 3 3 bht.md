# Revelation 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What Sardis is to 'remember' is, not how joyfully she had received originally the Gospel message, but how the precious deposit was committed to her originally, so that she could not say, she had not 'received and heard' it."
2. "Christ applies the language which in its fullest sense describes His second coming, to describe His coming in special judgments on churches and states...these special judgments being anticipatory earnests of that great last coming."
3. "The Greek proverb was that 'the feet of the avenging deities are shod with wool,' expressing the noiseless approach of the divine judgments, and their possible nearness at the moment when they were supposed the farthest off."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is always well for Christians to call to remembrance the 'day of their espousals,' and their views and feelings when they gave their hearts to the Saviour, and to compare those views with their present condition, especially if their conversion was marked by anything unusual."
2. "Hold fast what remains of true religion among you."
3. "No one can have any basis of calculation that he will be spared; no one can flatter himself with any probable anticipation that he will have time to repent when God comes to take him away."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou hast received the truth as a permanent deposit. It remains with thee whether thou regardest it or not."
2. "Thief, as distinguished from a robber, a plunderer on a larger scale, who secures his booty not by stealth, but by violence."
3. "The Greek proverb says that the feet of the avenging deities are shod with wool. The sentiment is voiced in the two following fragments from Aeschylus: 'Whether one sleep or walk or sit at ease, Unseen and voiceless Justice dogs his steps, Striking athwart his path from right or left; Nor what is foully done will night conceal: Whate'er thou doest some God beholdeth thee'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exhortation to Sardis is to remember, not the simple fact that she had received, but how she had done so, after what manner thou hast received, the earnestness, the faithfulness, and the zeal which had marked the first stages of her spiritual life."
2. "But she no longer ‘heard’ in that sense of obeying so common in the writings of St. John; hence the aorist pointing to a specific moment of the past."
3. "It is not the suddenness or unexpectedness of the hour only that is thought of under the image of a ‘thief,’ for that image has rather its expression in the last clause of the verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Keep in mind, as in Revelation 2:5." 
2. "Turn at once." 
3. "As Jesus had already said (Matthew 24:43; Luke 12:39), as Paul had said (1 Thessalonians 5:2), as Peter had said (2 Peter 3:10), as Jesus will say again (Revelation 16:15)."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of the advice is to put this church in mind of the doctrines of grace she had heard at the beginning of the Reformation."
2. "Very few attend to the doctrines of the Reformation. This is exactly our case."
3. "It looks as if there was danger, as there is, that they would be entirely wrested out of her hands."

### John Wesley:
1. "Remember how - Humbly, zealously, seriously. Thou didst receive the grace of God once, and hear - His word."
2. "And hold fast - The grace thou hast received."
3. "And repent - According to the word thou hast heard."
