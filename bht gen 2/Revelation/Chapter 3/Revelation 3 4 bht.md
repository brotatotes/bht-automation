# Revelation 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even in the midst of a church plagued by apathy and moral decline, there were a few individuals who remained faithful and untainted by the prevailing corruption. Although they were a small minority, they had not separated themselves from the rest of the church, demonstrating that the Lord had acknowledged and approved of their unwavering commitment. Their reward for keeping their garments undefiled would be to walk with Christ in perfect holiness, joy, and glory, as symbols of purity and as participants in His divine nature.
