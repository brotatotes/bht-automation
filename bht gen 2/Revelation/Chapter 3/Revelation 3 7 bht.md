## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Philadelphia...built by Attalus Philadelphus, king of Pergamos...nearly destroyed by an earthquake...The connection of this Church with Jews there causes the address to it to have an Old Testament coloring..."

"He that hath the key of David...Christ, the Heir of the throne of David, shall supplant all the less worthy stewards who have abused their trust...deciding who is, and who is not, to be admitted...The power of the keys was given to Peter and the other apostles, only when, and in so far as, Christ made him and them infallible."
