# Revelation 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I know your deeds, which include acts of faith, love, and patience. Your works are centered around preaching, professing, and upholding the Gospel, as well as showing charity to one another. God has provided you with an open door, granting you the privilege of entering into His joy and allowing you to continue unhindered in your good works. Although you may feel weak and insignificant outwardly, you have faithfully kept God's word in both your judgment and actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The opening of a door by Him to the Philadelphian Church accords with the previous assignation to Him of 'the key of David.'"
2. "Being consciously weak herself, she is the fitter object for God's power to rest on, that so the Lord Christ may have all the glory."
3. "The littleness of thy strength becoming the source of Almighty power to thee, as leading thee to rest wholly on My great power, thou hast kept My word."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'open door' here evidently refers to the enjoyment of some privilege or honor."
2. "It may mean that they had before them an open way of egress from danger and persecution."
3. "Although they had not the highest degree of energy, or had not all that the Saviour desired they should have, they were not wholly dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An open door (quran ajnewgmenhn). Rev., more literally, a door opened. This is variously explained. Some refer it to the entrance into the joy of the Lord; others to the initiation into the meaning of scripture; others again to the opportunity for the mission - work of the Church."
2. "I have given is appropriate, since all opportunities of service are gifts of God."
3. "A little strength [μικραν δυναμιν] . This would mean, thou hast some power, though small. Many, however, omit the indefinite article in translating, and render thou hast little strength; i.e., thou art poor in numbers and worldly resources."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There can be no doubt that the verb ‘to give’ is a very important one in the writings of St. John, and not least so in these seven Epistles, in every one of which it has a place." 
2. "The Lord does not merely do certain things for His people: in the doing of them He bestows His ‘gifts.’"
3. "The ‘opened door,’ then, is no other than that by which the faithful enter into the enjoyment of the heavenly glory, as well as that by which those spoken of in Revelation 3:9 enter, so far at least as to see them, in order to pay them homage while they sit upon their throne."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I have set [δεδωκα]. Perfect active indicative of διδωμ, 'I have given' (a gift of Christ, this open door)."
2. "The metaphor of the open door was a common one (John 10:7-9; Acts 14:27; 1 Corinthians 16:9; 2 Corinthians 2:12; Colossians 4:3; Revelation 3:20; Revelation 4:1). Probably it means here a good opportunity for missionary effort in spite of the Jewish hostility."
3. "A little power [μικραν δυναμιν]. Probably 'little power,' little influence or weight in Philadelphia, the members probably from the lower classes (1 Corinthians 1:26)."

### John Gill:
1. "I know thy works,.... Good works, of faith, love, and patience; and which lay much in preaching, professing, and maintaining the pure Gospel, and in acts of charity to one another."
2. "This "open door" may design an uncommon opportunity of preaching the Gospel; and a very great freedom of mind in the preachers of it, and great attention in the hearers, whose hearts will be opened to observe, receive, and embrace it."
3. "For thou hast a little strength; which is not to be understood of inward spiritual strength, for of this the church in this period will have a great deal, as well as of courage and fortitude of mind, but outward power and authority."

### John Wesley:
1. "I have given before thee an opened door — To enter into the joy of thy Lord; and, meantime, to go on unhindered in every good work." 
2. "Thou hast a little strength — But little outward human strength; a little, poor, mean, despicable company."
3. "Yet thou hast kept my word - Both in judgment and practice."
