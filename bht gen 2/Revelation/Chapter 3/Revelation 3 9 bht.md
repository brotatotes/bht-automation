## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The promise to Philadelphia is larger than that to Smyrna."
2. "Translate, '(some) of the synagogue.' For until Christ shall come, and all Israel then be saved, there is but 'a remnant' being gathered out of the Jews 'according to the election of grace.'"
3. "This is an instance of how Christ set before her an 'open door,' some of her greatest adversaries, the Jews, being brought to the obedience of the faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet...So far as the word is concerned, it may refer either to spiritual homage, that is, the worship of God; or it may mean respect as shown to superiors. The latter is the probable meaning; that is, that they would be constrained to show them honor and respect...The truth taught here is, that it is in the power of the Lord Jesus so to turn the hearts of all the enemies of religion that they shall be brought to show respect to it..."
2. "And to know that I have loved thee - This explains what he had just said...The enemies of his church will yet be constrained to acknowledge that it enjoys the smiles of God, and that instead of being persecuted and reviled, it should be respected and loved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I will make them to come [ποιησω αυτους ινα ηξωσιν] Lit., I will make them that they shall come."
2. "Worship before thy feet. Compare Isaiah 60:14; Isaiah 49:23."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is impossible to take such a view, for not only do the prophecies upon which the language before us rests, if it be a prophecy (Isaiah 2:3; Isaiah 49:21-23; Isaiah 60:14-16; Zechariah 8:20-23), refer to the coming in of the Gentiles rather than of the Jews; but there is nothing in the words in the least degree resembling a promise of conversion."
2. "They speak only of constrained submission to a Church which has been hitherto disowned, and of acknowledging what has been hitherto denied, that Christians are the object of God’s love."
3. "What we read of is simply the bowing down of the Church’s enemies before her feet. The outward progress of the Church, as illustrated by the case of Philadelphia, is again worthy of notice."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These Jewish converts are a gift from Christ." 
2. "The Jews expected homage from the Gentiles, but it will come to the Christians at last." 
3. "Probably a reminiscence of Isaiah 43:4 in 'I loved thee', first aorist active indicative."

### John Gill:
1. "The men that assemble in them are of their father the devil, and do his works, and will do them."
2. "The convinced and converted Jews shall come to the church, and in the most lowly and contrite manner acknowledge their former blindness, furious zeal, and violent hatred of the Christians."
3. "The Gentile church, and the members of it, [are loved by God] in assuming human nature, and dying for, and redeeming them, as well as the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold, I — who have all power; and they must then comply."
2. "I will make them come and bow down before thy feet — Pay thee the lowest homage."
3. "And know — At length, that all depends on my love, and that thou hast a place therein. O how often does the judgment of the people turn quite round, when the Lord looketh upon them!"
