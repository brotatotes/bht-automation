# Revelation 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The four living creatures, symbolizing the ministers of the Gospel, begin the worship of God and take the lead in it, falling down before Him who is seated on the throne. They acknowledge that all their kingly dignity and authority come from God, who is the King of kings and Lord of lords. The elders, representing redeemed men, also join in this act of homage. They cast their crowns before the throne, recognizing that everything they have received, including their crowns, is from Him. In doing so, they demonstrate their submission and subservience to Him as their King and lawgiver.
