# Revelation 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle John is transported into a heavenly realm, where his spirit is immediately captivated by the visions before him. At the center of this realm is a majestic throne, signifying the authority of God. Though there is no detailed description of the One sitting on the throne, it represents the presence of God the Father. This scene is reminiscent of Isaiah's vision, including the declaration of God's holiness. It reminds us of God's sovereignty over all creation, and as we witness the fulfillment of His plans, let us honor Him for His faithfulness, wisdom, and power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Immediately I was (became) in the Spirit... and behold, a throne stood in heaven... one sitting..."
2. "He that sat... like in appearance to a jasper and sardine stone... and a rainbow round about the throne."
3. "So far at least we may be sure of as to the symbolism of this appearance of Him that sitteth on the throne: that the brightness of His glory and fire of His judgment is ever girded by, and found within, the refreshment and surety of His mercy and goodness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I was completely rapt in vision into the heavenly world."
2. "The Father in essence is invisible, but in Scripture at times is represented as assuming a visible form."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He does not affirm that he was caught up into heaven, nor does he say what impression was on his own mind, if any, as to the place where he was; but he was at once absorbed in the contemplation of the visions before him."
2. "And, behold, a throne was set in heaven - That is, a throne was placed there. The first thing that arrested his attention was a throne."
3. "It is remarkable that John gives no description of him who sat on the throne, nor does he indicate who he was by name. Neither do Isaiah or Ezekiel attempt to describe the appearance of the Deity, nor are there any intimations of that appearance given from which a picture or an image could be formed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I was in the Spirit [...] I found myself in. Appropriate to the sudden and unconscious transportation of the seer into the ecstatic state."
2. "A throne. See Ezekiel 1:26-28. Was set [ÎµÎºÎµÎ¹Ï„Î¿] . Denoting merely position, not that the seer saw the placing of the throne."
3. "One sitting. He is commonly understood to be God the Father; but some understand the triune God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. John is prepared for them by passing into the spiritual or ecstatic state."
2. "The verb 'set' seems to express not merely that the throne was there, but that it was so by the Divine appointment and arrangement."
3. "The whole scene is founded upon Isaiah 6:0, where we have not only the throne high and lifted up, the seraphim, and the train filling the temple, but also the Trisagion, 'Holy, holy, holy,' etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "At once I found myself in the Spirit" (Swete), not "I came to be in the Spirit" as in Revelation 1:10.
2. "God is spirit. The picture of God on the throne is common in the O.T. and the N.T."
3. "The use of ÎºÎ±Î¸Î·Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï‚ (sitting) for the name of God is like the Hebrew avoidance of the name Jahweh."

### John Gill:
1. "...his soul or spirit was immediately taken from the consideration of all sensible objects, and was fixed and intent upon the things presented to it in the vision, so that it was as if it was out of the body."
2. "Here he exercises a jurisdiction and government; he is King and lawgiver in it; he has enacted laws, and he writes them on the hearts of his people, and puts his Spirit within them, and makes them both able and willing to obey them."
3. "God the Father is designed, who sits on the throne, though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, yet in distinction from them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The court of heaven is here laid open; and the throne of God is, as it were, the centre from which everything in the visible world goes forth, and to which everything returns."
2. "This describes, not barely what good or evil is successively transacted on earth, but how each springs from the kingdom of light or darkness, and continually tends to the source whence it sprung."
3. "The more, therefore, we observe the accomplishment of it, so much the more may we praise God, in his truth, wisdom, justice, and almighty power, and learn to suit ourselves to the time, according to the remarkable directions contained in the prophecy."
