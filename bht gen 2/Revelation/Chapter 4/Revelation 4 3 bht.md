## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the watery brightness represents God's holiness, so the fiery red His justice executing fiery wrath."
2. "The same union of white or watery brightness and fiery redness appears in Revelation 1:14; Revelation 10:1; Ezekiel 1:4; Ezekiel 8:2; Daniel 7:9."
3. "Moreover, the rainbow was the appointed token of God's covenant with all flesh, and His people in particular. Hereby God in type renewed to man the grant originally made to the first Adam."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He does not describe his form, but his splendor."
2. "The appearance of the rainbow, therefore, around the throne, was a beautiful emblem of the mercy of God, and of the peace that was to pervade the world."
3. "The emerald is green, and this color so predominated in the bow that it seemed to be made of this species of precious stone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The stone itself was of different colors, the best being purple. According to chapter Revelation 21:11, it represents a crystalline brightness."
2. "The exact meaning of the symbolism must remain uncertain, owing to our ignorance of the precise meaning of 'jasper,' a name which seems to have covered a variety of stones now known under other classifications."
3. "One notes, not without satisfaction, that Dante shrinks from the anthropomorphism of Byzantine and early Western art, in which the Ancient of Days was represented in the form of venerable age. For him, as for the more primitive artists, the rainbow reflecting rainbow is the only adequate symbol of the 'God of God, Light of Light' of the Nicene Creed, while the fire of love that breathes from both is that of the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The analogy of Ezekiel 1:27 seems to warrant the inference that the colours of the two stones were not mixed throughout."
2. "The colour of the jasper was a bright sparkling whiteness, while that of the sardius was a fiery red."
3. "The object itself, its colour, its Old Testament history, and even the mode of its formation in nature, combine to suggest the meaning of the rainbow, the holiness and wrath of God encompassed by His covenant grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To look upon (ορασε). Locative case of ορασις, old word (from οραω, to see) for appearance (in appearance) as in Ezekiel 1:5; Ezekiel 1:26."
2. "Like a jasper stone (ομοιος ιασπιδ). Associative-instrumental case of ιασπις, old word (Persian), used for stones of different colors, one opaque like opal, one translucent (Revelation 21:11; Revelation 21:18, possibly here, only N.T. examples), one a red or yellow stone (Isaiah 54:12). Some even take it for the diamond. Certainly not our cheap modern jasper."
3. "An emerald (σμαραγδινω). Adjective (from σμαραγδος, Revelation 21:19), of emerald (supply λιθω), in associative instrumental case after ομοιος. John sees no form for God (Exodus 24:10), but only the brilliant flashing gems. 'In the vision the flashing lustre of the ιασπις and the fiery red of the σαρδ are relieved by the halo (ιρις) of emerald which encircled the Throne' (Swete). A complete circle."

### John Gill:
1. "For the brightness, glory, and majesty of his countenance, and for his being light itself, clothed with it, and dwelling in it."
2. "The rainbow is a reverberation, or a reflection of the beams of the sun upon a thin watery cloud; and the covenant of grace is owing to Jesus Christ, the sun of righteousness."
3. "The emerald is very bright, clear, and transparent; it is reported of Nero that he could see in his emerald the combat of the gladiators in the theatre; in the covenant of grace, as in a glass, may be seen the glory of all the three Persons in the Godhead."

### John Wesley:
1. "Shone with a visible lustre, like that of sparkling precious stones."
2. "The jasper, which is transparent and of a glittering white, with an intermixture of beautiful colors, may be a symbol of God's purity, with various other perfections, which shine in all his dispensations."
3. "An emerald, being green, may betoken favor to the good; a rainbow, the everlasting covenant."
