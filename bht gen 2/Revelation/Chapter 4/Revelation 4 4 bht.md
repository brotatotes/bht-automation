# Revelation 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The twenty-four elders are not angels, but rather representatives of the Church who symbolize the Old Testament patriarchs and New Testament apostles. They are depicted as triumphant and adorned with white robes and crowns, signifying their endurance and redemption. These elders, as part of the glorified Church, offer praise and honor to God alongside the heavenly hosts, acknowledging His power and dominion. Their position near His throne reflects their victory over enemies and unity with the universe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These 24 elders are not angels...but representatives of the Church...the rewards of endurance."
2. "The key to the interpretation being the analogy with the sayings of our Lord to the Apostles."
3. "Various other interpretations have been...the 24 courses of priests and their heads...these elders are not priests...their occupation...being simply connected with their representative character."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The tabernacle was a 'pattern' of the heavenly antitype; the holy place, a figure of HEAVEN ITSELF."
3. "The 'four living creatures' answer to the cherubim over the mercy seat. So the twenty-four throned and crowned elders are typified by the twenty-four chiefs of the twenty-four courses of priests, 'Governors of the sanctuary, and governors of God'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design, therefore, is to represent the church triumphant - redeemed - saved - as rendering praise and honor to God; as uniting with the hosts of heaven in adoring him for his perfections and for the wonders of his grace."
2. "As representatives of the church, they are admitted near to him; they encircle his throne; they appear victorious over every foe; and they come, in unison with the living creatures, and the angels, and the whole universe, to ascribe power and dominion to God."
3. "The word 'elders' here seems to be used in the sense of aged and venerable men, rather than as denoting office. They were such as by their age were qualified to preside over the different divisions of the priesthood."

1. "The twenty-four elders are usually taken to represent the one Church of Christ, as at once the Church of the old and of the new Covenant, figured by the twelve patriarchs and the twelve apostles."
2. "Better, as indicating a more solemn investiture."
3. "The crown in this passage is the crown, not of kinghood, but of glory and immortality."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is important to observe the word â€˜thronesâ€™ here used by St. John, for there can be no doubt that it is deliberately chosen in order to bring out the fact that the glorified Church of Christ is placed in no lower position than that of the Saviourâ€™s and the Fatherâ€™s throne."
2. "The twenty-four elders, thus embodying the conception of the Church of Christ in her perfected condition, have three characteristics. (1) They are sitting, the attitude of rest and honour. (2) They are clothed in white garments, the robes of perfect purity, the robes of priests. (3) They have on their heads golden crowns, those of chaps. Revelation 2:10, Revelation 3:11, and Revelation 14:14, in which last passage the same â€˜golden crownâ€™ is assigned to the Son of man. Like Him, they are not only priests but kings."
3. "The Church is before us in her triumphing condition."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Round about the throne."
2. "Four and twenty thrones...beyond the great throne."
3. "I saw four and twenty elders...we do not really know why this number is chosen."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom are not meant the twenty four books of the Old Testament... for the things said of them are such as cannot be applied to inanimate things, such as sitting on seats, being clothed with white raiment, having golden crowns on their heads, falling down before the throne, and worshipping him that sat on it."
2. "Rather, the members of the Gospel church state, throughout the whole of it, in every succession and period of time, are here meant; and are expressed by the number 'twenty four', in allusion to the twenty four courses of the priests, into which they were divided by David."

### John Wesley:
1. "The most holy of all the former ages, Isaiah 24:23; Hebrews 12:1; representing the whole body of the saints." 
2. "Clothed in white raiment - This and their golden crowns show, that they had already finished their course and taken their place among the citizens of heaven."
3. "They are never termed souls, and hence it is probable that they had glorified bodies already. Compare Matthew 27:52."
