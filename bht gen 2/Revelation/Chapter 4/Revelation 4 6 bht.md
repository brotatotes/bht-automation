# Revelation 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Revelation unveils a stunning sight before God's throne: a sea as clear as crystal, reflecting the purity and calmness of God's rule. This sea represents the course of Providence, leading those who trust in God to their final rest in His presence. Standing upon this sea, the redeemed remember God's righteous acts and the paths by which they were delivered. The four living beings surrounding the throne, similar to the cherubim in Ezekiel and Isaiah, embody unwavering courage, patience, prudence, compassion, activity, and vigor. With their eyes full of wisdom and knowledge, they symbolize God's vigilant and all-seeing Providence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Like rock crystal... symbolizing the purity, calmness, and majesty of God's rule."
2. "There is in this sea depth and transparency, but not the fluidity and instability of the natural sea."
3. "His judgments, which overwhelm the ungodly, they stand firmly upon, as on a solid sea of glass; able like Christ to walk on the sea, as though it were solid."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The comparison, in the representation of the expanse spread around the throne, turns on these points: it resembled, in its general appearance, glass; and this idea is strengthened by the addition of another image of the same character - that it was like an expanse of crystal, perfectly clear and pellucid."
2. "The vision of the 'living beings'...is an emblematic representation of the divine government - of the throne of Deity resting upon, or sustained by, those things of which these living beings are emblems - intelligence, firmness, energy, etc."
3. "The emblem here would denote an everwatchful and observing Providence...nothing escapes observation; nothing can be concealed...it is the perfection of the government of God that all things are seen just as they are."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The adjective, and the kindred noun ualov glass occur only in Revelation. The etymology is uncertain; some maintaining an Egyptian origin, and others referring it to the Greek uw to rain, with the original signification of rain - drop."
2. "The Egyptians possessed the art of coloring it, and of introducing gold between two layers of glass."
3. "The four living beings are mainly identical with the cherubim of Ezekiel 1:5-10; Ezekiel 10:5-20; Isaiah 6:2, Isaiah 6:3; though with some differences of detail."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the ‘glassy sea’ of this verse we have an emblem of that course of Providence by which God conducts those who place themselves in His hands to then-final rest in His immediate presence."
2. "They who stand upon it cannot forget those ‘righteous acts’ of God which they have witnessed, or the troubled paths by which they have escaped the great enemies of their salvation. Judgment upon their foes, as well as mercy to themselves, marks the whole of that way by which they have been led."
3. "What has been said finds support in the language of Isaiah 6:2, where the prophet, after speaking of the Lord’s sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, adds, ‘above it stood the seraphim.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Like crystal (ομοια κρυσταλλω). Associative-instrumental case after ομοια. Old word, from κρυος (ice and sometimes used for ice), in N.T. only here and Revelation 22:1, not semi-opaque, but clear like rock-crystal."
2. "This seems to mean that on each of the four sides of the throne was one of the four living creatures either stationary or moving rapidly round (Ezekiel 1:12)."
3. "Full of eyes (γεμοντα οφθαλμων). Present active participle of γεμω, to be full of, with the genitive, signifying here unlimited intelligence (Beckwith), the ceaseless vigilance of nature (Swete)."

### John Gill:
1. "But the world, and men of it, used not to be compared to a still and quiet sea, as this is, but to one disturbed and troubled by winds and tempests, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."
2. "Christ's blood is the fountain opened to wash in for sin, and may be compared to a sea for its abundant efficacy in cleansing from all sin; and it is this which makes way to the throne, and to him that sits on it."
3. "And though they may not be all found in everyone, at least not in all alike, yet thou are in one or another of them, and in them as together considered."

### John Wesley:
1. "And before the throne is a sea as of glass, like crystal — Wide and deep, pure and clear, transparent and still." 
2. "Both the 'seven lamps of fire' and this sea are before the throne; and both may mean 'the seven spirits of God,' the Holy Ghost; whose powers and operations are frequently represented both under the emblem of fire and of water."
3. "The first living creature was like a lion — To signify undaunted courage. The second, like a calf — Or ox, to signify unwearied patience. The third, with the face of a man — To signify prudence and compassion. The fourth, like an eagle — To signify activity and vigour. Full of eyes — To betoken wisdom and knowledge."
