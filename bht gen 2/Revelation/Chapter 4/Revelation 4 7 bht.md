# Revelation 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The lion, the steer, the man, and the eagle are symbols within these passages that hold various meanings. They represent strength, endurance, laboriousness, wisdom, and understanding. These symbols are reflected in the depictions of the four Evangelists and can also be associated with the cherubim in Ezekiel and the figures overseeing the holy of holies. Some even propose these symbols to represent the Trinity and the incarnation of the second Person. Together, they enhance our understanding of the diverse qualities and attributes found within the ministry and worship.
