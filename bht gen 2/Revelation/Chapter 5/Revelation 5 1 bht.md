This book, containing divine purposes, was held openly, with no withholding from God's part. The book and its seals symbolize the authority given to Christ. The book appears to represent the Scriptures, including their literal and spiritual meanings. The vials under the seventh trumpet represent the breaking of the power of the beast.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The lying on the open hand imports, that on God’s part there was no withholding of His future purposes as contained in this book."
2. "The completeness of the contents as containing the divine counsels: there was no room for addition to that which was therein written."
3. "What is in that book, shall not be known, until, in full completion, it is contemplated in its completeness by the spirits of the glorified hereafter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His right hand was open and on it lay the book. On God's part there was no withholding of His future purposes as contained in the book." 
2. "The roll, or book, appears from the context to be 'the title-deed of man's inheritance' redeemed by Christ, and contains the successive steps by which He shall recover it from its usurper and obtain actual possession of the kingdom already 'purchased' for Himself and His elect saints."
3. "The opening of the seals will mean the successive steps by which God in Christ clears the way for the final opening and reading of the book at the visible setting up of the kingdom of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The book or roll seems to have been so held in his hand that John could see its shape, and see distinctly how it was written and sealed."
2. "The fact that there were seven seals - an unusual number in fastening a volume - would naturally attract the attention of John, though it might not occur to him at once that there was anything significant in the number."
3. "May it not have been intended by this arrangement to suggest the idea that the whole future is unknown to us, and that the disclosure of any one portion, though necessary if the whole would be known, does not disclose all, but leaves seal after seal still unbroken, and that they are all to be broken one after another if we would know all?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A Book [βιβλιον] . See on Matthew 19:7; Mark 10:4; Luke 4:17. Compare Ezekiel 2:9; Jeremiah 36:2; Zechariah 5:1, Zechariah 5:2. Within and on the back side [εσωθεν και οπισθεν] . Compare Ezekiel 2:10. Indicating the completeness of the divine counsels contained in the book."
2. "Sealed [κατεσφραγισμενον] . Only here in the New Testament. The preposition kata denotes sealed down. So Rev., close sealed. The roll is wound round a staff and fastened down to it with the seven seals. The unrolling of the parchment is nowhere indicated in the vision."
3. "Commentators have puzzled themselves to explain the arrangement of the seals, so as to admit of the unrolling of a portion with the opening of each seal. D?ieck remarks that, With an incomparably more beautiful and powerful representation, the contents of the roll are successively symbolized by the vision which follows upon the opening of each seal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The book beheld by the Seer is on, not ‘in’ the right hand of him that sat on the throne, and it shall be opened for the inspection of all His saints."
2. "The roll is close-sealed, a strong expression, to mark the mysterious and inscrutable nature of its contents."
3. "The general nature of the contents of the roll may be gathered from the reference to that of Ezekiel, 'lamentations, and mourning, and woe.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A book (βιβλιον)... Written (γεγραμμενον). Perfect passive predicate participle of γραφω. Within and on the back (εσωθεν κα οπισθεν). 'Within and behind.' Description of a roll like that in Luke 4:17, not a codex as some scholars think."
2. "Sealed (κατεσφραγισμενον). Perfect passive predicate participle of κατασφραγιζω, old compound (perfective use of κατα), to seal up (down), here only in N.T. With seven seals (σφραγισιν επτα). Instrumental case of σφραγις, old word used in various senses, proof or authentication (1 Corinthians 9:2; Romans 4:11), signet-ring (Revelation 7:2), impression made by the seal (Revelation 9:4; 2 Timothy 2:19), the seal on books closing the book (Revelation 5:1; Revelation 5:2; Revelation 5:5; Revelation 5:9; Revelation 6:1; Revelation 6:3; Revelation 6:5; Revelation 6:7; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 6:12; Revelation 8:1)."
3. "'A will in Roman law bore the seven seals of the seven witnesses' (Charles). But this sealed book of doom calls for no witnesses beyond God's own will. Alford sees in the number seven merely the completeness of God's purposes."

### John Gill:
1. "This book seems to have consisted of seven rolls, to which was annexed seven seals; and there being not room enough within, contrary to the common way of writing, some things were written upon the backside of the outermost roll." 
2. "By this book some understand the Scriptures of the Old Testament, which were written in rolls; and which came out of the right hand of God, and were given forth by him; and being written within, and on the backside, may denote the fulness of them, they containing a variety of matter, useful and profitable, for different purposes; or else the literal and mystical, or spiritual meaning of some parts of them." 
3. "Rather therefore the book of God's decrees is here meant, which respects all creatures, and all occurrences and events in the whole world, from the beginning to the end of time."

### John Wesley:
1. "He held it openly, in order to give it to him that was worthy."
2. "The book and its seals represent all power in heaven and earth given to Christ. A copy of this book is contained in the following chapters."
3. "By 'the vials,' under the seventh trumpet, the power of the beast, and whatsoever is connected with it, is broken."
