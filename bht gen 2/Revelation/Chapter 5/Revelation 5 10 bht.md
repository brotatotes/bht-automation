# Revelation 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, the redeemed, acknowledge that it is by God's grace that we have been made kings and priests. This does not merely signify spiritual reign over sin and corruption, but also the future reign with Christ during the millennial state. We humbly recognize our role in the coming thousand years' reign with Christ in the new earth, where righteousness prevails. This is the fulfillment of God's promise, and we eagerly anticipate the time when we shall reign alongside Christ.
