# Revelation 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power, riches, wisdom, might, honor, glory, and blessing. The Lamb is deserving of all praise and adoration because of his sacrifice and the power he possesses. The song of the elders proclaims that the Lamb is worthy to receive all of these things, recognizing his authority and sovereignty over all creation. Each aspect of the Lamb's worthiness is significant and corresponds to the seven seals and the complete dominion that the Lamb has over both the visible and invisible realms.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "to receive power—Greek,
	'the power.' The remaining six (the whole being
	seven, the number for perfection and completeness)
	are all, as well as 'power,' ranged under the one Greek
	article, to mark that they form one complete aggregate
	belonging to God and His co-equal, the Lamb."
2. "riches—both spiritual
	and earthly."
3. "blessing—ascribed
	praise: the will on the creature's part, though unaccompanied
	by the power, to return blessing for blessing conferred."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that he was slain, or was made a sacrifice for sin, was the ground or reason for what is here ascribed to him."
2. "In view of all that he was, and of all that he has done, he is here spoken of as 'worthy' of all these things."
3. "To bless God, or to ascribe blessing to him, is that state where the heart is full of love and gratitude, and where it desires that he may be everywhere honored, loved, and obeyed as he should be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Power, etc. Rev., 'the power.' Compare the ascription in chapter Revelation 4:11, on which see note, and notice that each separate particular there has the article, while here it is attached only to the first, the power, the one article including all the particulars, as if they formed but one word."
2. "Riches [πλουτον] . Not limited to spiritual riches, but denoting the fulness of every gift of God. James 1:17; Acts 17:25. Only here in a doxology."
3. "Blessing [ευλογιαν] . See on the kindred word eujloghtov blessed, 1 Peter 1:3."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered to take the power, and riches and wisdom and might and honour and glory and blessing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The point of the song is the same as that in verses Revelation 5:9; Revelation 5:10, but the language differs."
2. "Note the repeated article το (the lamb the slain) referring to verses Revelation 5:6; Revelation 5:9."
3. "Note also the one article την before δυναμιν for all the seven grounds of praise (δυναμιν, power, πλουτον, wealth, σοφιαν, wisdom, ισχυν, strength, τιμην, honor, δοξαν, glory, ευλογιαν, blessing), though πλουτον is masculine, in contrast with separate article for each item (all three feminine) in Revelation 4:11, here grouping them all together, 'a heptad of praise' (Swete)."

### John Gill:
1. "worthy is the Lamb that was slain...celebrate the virtue and efficacy of his sufferings and death" 
2. "power belongs to him, as he is the mighty God...having all power in heaven and in earth"
3. "wisdom also is his...he is the author of all wisdom, natural and spiritual"

### John Wesley:
1. "Worthy is the Lamb" - The elders said, Revelation 5:9, "Worthy art thou." They were more nearly allied to him than the angels.
2. "To receive the power" - This sevenfold applause answers the seven seals, of which the four former describe all visible, the latter all invisible, things, made subject to the Lamb. And every one of these seven words bears a resemblance to the seal which it answers.
