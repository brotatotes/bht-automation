# Revelation 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All worlds, from the depths of the sea to the highest peaks, offer a harmonious song of praise to the Redeemer. The entire creation, with its rivers, hills, birds, animals, and even the smallest creatures, resounds with thanksgiving to their Creator. No one is left out in this all-encompassing chorus of worship. It is a declaration of the completion of God's purposes and the full execution of His original design in Jesus. Even enemies and adversaries are compelled to acknowledge the glory of Christ, joining in the honor and exaltation offered to Him alongside God the Father.
