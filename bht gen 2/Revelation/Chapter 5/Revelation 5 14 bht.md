# Revelation 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The four living creatures affirm their agreement with the angels and all creation, confirming their belief that God is indeed worthy of glory and honor. The twenty-four elders join in worship, bowing down before the One who lives forever, expressing their reverence and adoration. As the leaders of the praise, the living creatures and elders not only initiate the song but also conclude it, as they have a unique understanding and involvement in the sacrifice of the Lamb and the unveiling of the sealed book.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The words 'him that liveth for ever and ever' are omitted in all the manuscripts: inserted by commentators from Revelation 4:9. But there, where the thanksgiving is expressed, the words are appropriate; but here less so, as their worship is that of silent prostration."
