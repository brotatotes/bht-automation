# Revelation 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No creature, not even the wise and learned, had the ability to open the book and reveal its contents. The challenge was presented to all, whether in heaven, on earth, or under the earth, yet none had the power to do so. The book remained closed, and its secrets were left undiscovered.
