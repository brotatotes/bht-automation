# Revelation 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The anguish of the apostle's weeping reflects a deep longing to understand the future, to lift the veil that obscures it. This yearning is relatable to individuals who also desire to penetrate the mysteries of what lies ahead. The apostle's tears should remind us of the grief that arises when efforts to unravel the future are in vain, leaving us in darkness. Our desires for knowledge may seem futile, yet we can look to the example of John as an eager student, dedicated to comprehending the mysteries of the Apocalypse.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book nor to look upon it."
2. "It had been promised to him, that he should be shewn future events: and now it seemed as if this promise were about to be frustrated by the lack of one worthy to open the book."
3. "There was no weakness of faith... St. John is in this book the simple recipient of the Apocalypse: for that he is summoned to the heavenly scene, for that he is waiting in humility: but that now seems to be precluded, and his tears burst forth in the earnestness of disappointed desire after the fulfilment of the promise."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "John having been promised a revelation of 'things which must be hereafter,' weeps now at his earnest desire being apparently frustrated."
2. "He is a pattern to us to imitate, as an eager and teachable learner of the Apocalypse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The tears of the apostle here may be regarded as an illustration of two things which are occurring constantly in the minds of people: the strong desire to penetrate the future; to lift the mysterious veil which shrouds what is to come; to find some way to pierce the dark wall which seems to stand up before us, and which shuts from our view what is to be hereafter."
2. "The weeping of the apostle may be regarded as an instance of the deep grief which people often experience when all efforts to penetrate the future fail, and they feel that after all they are left completely in the dark."
3. "Nowhere does man find himself more fettered and limited in his powers than here; nowhere does he feel that there is such an intense disproportion between his desires and his attainments."
