# Revelation 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, a comforting elder spoke to John, revealing the glories of the triumphant Christ. He describes Him as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, symbolizing His kingly authority and power. As the root of David, He is not only a descendant, but also the source of David's family. Christ, the victorious prince, has overcome all obstacles and prevailed, giving Him the honor to unlock the hidden divine counsels.

2. "The lion, as victorious: from the tribe of Judah, as the Messiah of promise, sprung from among the brethren of the Seer, and so carrying more comfort to him."
3. "The evident design here is to set forth Christ as sprung from the tribe of Judah and lineage of David, and His victory as His exaltation through suffering."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The elders in heaven round God's throne know better than John, still in the flesh, the far-reaching power of Christ." 
2. "Not merely 'a sucker come up from David's ancient root,' but also including the idea of His being Himself the root and origin of David."
3. "He is at once 'the branch' of David, and 'the root' of David, David's Son and David's Lord, the Lamb slain and therefore the Lion of Juda: about to reign over Israel, and thence over the whole earth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Having this knowledge, they were prepared to comfort him with the hope that what was so mysterious would be made known."
2. "The lion is the king of beasts, the monarch of the forest, and thus becomes an emblem of one of kingly authority and of power."
3. "This use of the term would connect him in the apprehension of John with the prophecy, and would suggest to him the idea of his being a ruler, or having dominion."
