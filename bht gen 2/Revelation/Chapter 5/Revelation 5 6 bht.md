## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the use of ἀρνίον, the diminutive, as applied to our Lord, is peculiar to the Apocalypse. It is difficult to say what precise idea is meant to be conveyed by this form. Possibly, as De W., it may be to put forward more prominently the idea of meekness and innocence."
2. "the ὡς ἐσφαγμένον serves to solve the apparent paradox lying in the juxtaposition of ἑστηκός and ἐσφαγμένον"
3. "the seven eyes of the Lamb represent the same Spirit in his sevenfold perfection, profluent, so to speak, from the incarnate Redeemer: busied in His world-wide energy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "in the midst of the company ( :-) which was 'round about the throne."
2. "the Lamb, is to put Him in the more marked contrast to Greek, 'therion,' the Beast."
3. "the seven eyes of the Lamb represent the same sevenfold Spirit profluent from the incarnate Redeemer in His world-wide energy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was so placed as to seem to be in the midst of the group made up of the throne, the living beings, and the elders."
2. "The great work which the Redeemer performed - that of making an atonement for sin - was thus represented to John in such a way that he at once recognized him, and saw the reason why the office of breaking the seals was entrusted to him."
3. "The number seven here seems to be designed, as in other places, to denote completeness. The meaning is, that he had so large a number as to denote complete dominion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A Lamb...Nowhere else in the New Testament." 
2. "Christ had just been spoken of as a lion. He now appears as a lamb."
3. "Though slaughtered the lamb stands. Christ, though slain, is risen and living."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Seer had been told of a lion, and he beholds a lamb."
2. "The 'standing' of the Lamb is deeply important. First of all we may observe that it is as slaughtered (not 'slain,' but 'slaughtered') for sacrifice, the word being sacrificial...But though thus 'slaughtered' the Lamb 'stands,' stands as a living, not lies as a dead, animal."
3. "In short, we have here the great lesson alike of the Apocalypse and of the Fourth Gospel, that we are redeemed not merely by a Saviour who died, but by one who also rose to everlasting and glorious life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A Lamb (αρνιον). Elsewhere in the N.T. ο αμνος is used of Christ... but in the Apocalypse το αρνιον occurs for the Crucified Christ 29 times in twelve chapters." 
2. "As though it had been slain (ως εσφαγμενον). Perfect passive predicate participle of σφαζω... The Christ as the Lamb is both sacrifice and Priest (Hebrews 9:12; Hebrews 10:11)."
3. "Seven horns (κερας) is a common symbol in the O.T. for strength and kingly power... Fulness of power (the All-powerful one) is symbolized by seven."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ had been really slain by the wicked hands of the Jews, and not in appearance only; the as, here, is not a note of mere similitude and likeness, but of reality and truth."
2. "He, appeared before the throne for them, as their advocate, and stood ready to give them all the assistance, and to do them all the good he could."
3. "The number 'seven' expresses the fulness and perfection of his power and authority, having, as Mediator, all power in heaves and in earth given him; and what is above all power, might, dominion, and every name in this world, and that to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I saw — First, Christ in or on the midst of the throne; secondly, the four living creatures making the inner circle round him; and, thirdly, the four and twenty elders making a larger circle round him and them."
2. "As if he had been slain — Doubtless with the prints of the wounds which he once received. And because he was slain, he is worthy to open the book, to the joy of his own people, and the terror of his enemies."
3. "Having seven horns — As a king, the emblem of perfect strength. And seven eyes — The emblem of perfect knowledge and wisdom."
