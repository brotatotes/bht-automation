# Revelation 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lamb approaches the throne of God and takes the book from the right hand of the One who sits upon it, signifying His authority and willingness to fulfill all that is written in it. This act is both glorious and significant, as it fulfills the prophecy in Psalm 2:8 and demonstrates the Lamb's power over all angels, principalities, and powers. He has been entrusted with a commission and given the authority to open the book and manifest its contents to others, bringing about the fulfillment of the events written within it at the appointed time.
