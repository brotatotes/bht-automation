# Revelation 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The acts of adoration depicted in the passage reflect the honor given to the Lamb, who shares the throne with the Father. The four living creatures and elders symbolize the worship offered by the church and the providential governance of the world. In this worship, the elders engage in high-priestly functions, presenting the prayers of suffering saints as incense to God. These prayers, held in golden bowls, symbolize the heartfelt and unwavering pleas that come from a pure and faithful heart. Such genuine prayers have a profound impact as they ascend to God, reaching His attentive and loving presence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "fell down before the Lamb‚Äîwho shares worship and the throne with the Father."
2. "prayers of saints‚Äîas the angel offers their prayers with incense."
3. "Though they be employed by God in some way unknown to us to present our prayers, yet we are told to pray only to Him. Their own employment is praise: ours is prayer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The acts of adoration here described as rendered by the four living creatures and the elders are, according to the explanation given in Revelation 4:4-7, emblematic of the honor done to the Redeemer by the church, and by the course of providential events in the government of the world."
2. "The whole prostrated themselves with profound reverence; the elders had harps and censers, and broke out into a song of praise for redemption."
3. "The idea here is, therefore, that the representatives of the church in heaven - the elders - spoken of as 'priests' Revelation 5:10, are described as officiating in the temple above in behalf of the church still below, and as offering incense while the church is engaged in prayer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The aorist is resumed. Every one of them harps [ŒµŒ∫Œ±œÉœÑŒøœÇ Œ∫ŒπŒ∏Œ±œÅŒ±œÇ] . Rev., less clumsily, having each one a harp. Each one, that is, of the elders."
2. "The word vial, used commonly of a small bottle, gives a wrong picture here. The fialh was a broad, flat vessel, used for boiling liquids, sometimes as a cinerary urn, and for drinking, or pouring libations."
3. "The prayers offered by priests and people at this part of the service are recorded by tradition as follows: 'True it is that Thou art Jehovah, our God and the God of our fathers; our King and the King of our fathers; our Savior and the Rock of our salvation; our Help and our Deliverer.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The language of the four living creatures is given at Revelation 5:14. In the remainder of Revelation 5:8, therefore, we have to do only with the Elders."

3. "The bowls are full (comp. John 2:7; John 19:29; John 21:11). (3) Further still, the twenty-four Elders sing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He had taken (ŒµŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒΩ). Here John drops back to the narrative tense (the second aorist active indicative of ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ±ŒΩœâ), not the past perfect as the English rendering might indicate, merely 'when he took.'" 
2. "Fell down (ŒµœÄŒµœÉŒ±ŒΩ). Second aorist active indicative of œÄŒπœÄœÑœâ with first aorist (-Œ±ŒΩ) ending, just 'fell.'"
3. "Golden bowls (œÜŒπŒ±ŒªŒ±œÇ œáœÅœÖœÉŒ±œÇ). Broad shallow saucers, old word, in N.T. only in Revelation 5:8; Revelation 15:7; Revelation 16:1-4; Revelation 16:8; Revelation 16:10; Revelation 16:12; Revelation 16:17; Revelation 17:1; Revelation 21:9."
