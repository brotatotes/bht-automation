# Revelation 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They joyfully sing a new song, one that has never been sung before, in response to the redemption achieved by the blood of the Lamb and his worthiness to open the sealed book. This song expresses their gratitude to Christ who was slain, redeeming not only the Jews but also the Gentiles and even the living creatures. It emphasizes the fruit of redemption, particularly for those who had finished their earthly course from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation, signifying the inclusive nature of salvation.
