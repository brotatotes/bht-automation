# Revelation 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first living creature, symbolized by a lion, represents the bold and courageous testimonies of faithful believers for Christ. As the voice of this creature resonates, it resonates with the lion-like boldness in which the faithful have testified for Christ throughout history and will do so again in the end times. It is a call to testify, to proclaim the Gospel, and to invite others to accept Christ's salvation while there is still time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The first living creature was like a lion (Revelation 4:7): his voice is in consonance. Implying the lion-like boldness with which, in the successive great revivals, the faithful have testified for Christ, and especially a little before His coming shall testify."
2. "Contrast the form of expression, Revelation 4:7- :. It is much more likely to be the cry of the redeemed to the Redeemer, 'Come' and deliver the groaning creature from the bondage of corruption."
3. "If the four living creatures represent the four Gospels, the 'Come' will be their invitation to everyone (for it is not written that they addressed John) to accept Christ's salvation while there is time, as the opening of the seals marks a progressive step towards the end (compare Revelation 22:17- :). Judgments are foretold as accompanying the preaching of the Gospel as a witness to all nations (Revelation 14:6-11; Matthew 24:6-14)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No one had been found in the universe who could open the seals but the Lamb of God." 
2. "The representation in this place is, therefore, that of a volume with a small portion unrolled and written on both sides of the parchment." 
3. "He had wept much that no one was found who was worthy to open that book, but he was now called on to approach and see for himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of the seals. Add seven. And see. Omit.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whether, therefore, the living creatures now meet us in one same order as that in which they are mentioned there, it is hardly possible to say."
2. "It is enough to say that the visions are introduced with peculiar propriety as an answer to the cry of the living creatures."
3. "The living creature cries ‘Come,’ not ‘Come and see.’ In the latter case the cry would be addressed to the Seer. It is really addressed to Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No effort will be made here to interpret these seals as referring to persons or historical events in the past, present, or future, but simply to relate the symbolism to the other symbols in the book."
2. "In the Old Testament the horse is often the emblem of war."
3. "The command is not addressed to the Lamb nor to John (the correct text omits κα ιδε 'and see') as in Revelation 17:1; Revelation 21:9, but to one of the four horsemen each time."

### John Gill:
1. "These seals express events to be fulfilled and therefore cannot respect the steps towards, and the signs of Jerusalem's destruction, and that itself, which had been accomplished some years before the vision of the seals; and which vision would have been needless."
2. "Now the opening of these seals is the revealing of the events signified by them, and expressed in the hieroglyphics here made use of, and the fulfilment of them."
3. "It is enough in general to understand the ministers of the Gospel, who, as sons of thunder, loudly and publicly preached the Gospel, and, as lions, boldly and bravely defended, and took notice of the power and providence of God in succeeding their ministry."

### John Wesley:
1. I heard one-That is, the first. Of the living creatures - Who looks forward toward the east.
