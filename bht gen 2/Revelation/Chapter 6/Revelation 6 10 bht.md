## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As in the parable the woman (symbol of the Church) cries day and night to the unjust judge for justice against her adversary who is always oppressing her... so the elect cry day and night to God, who will assuredly, in His own time, avenge His and their cause."
2. "The glory even of those in Paradise will only be complete when Christ's and the Church's foes are cast out, and the earth will become Christ's kingdom at His coming to raise the sleeping saints."
3. "Implying that He has them and their foes and all His creatures as absolutely at His disposal, as a master has his slaves; hence, in Revelation 6:11, 'fellow servants,' or fellow slaves follows."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "How long [εως ποτε]. Lit., until when."
2. "Addressed to God rather than to Christ, and breathing, as Professor Milligan remarks, 'the feeling of Old Testament rather than of New Testament relation.'"
3. "Avenge [εκδικεις]. Compare Luke 18:3; Romans 12:19."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The cry is addressed to Him who is spoken of as ‘Master,’ and by whom we are most probably to understand not Christ but God."
2. "Their confidence that God will deliver is confirmed by the thought of the attributes which distinguish Him. He is 'the holy:' therefore He will the more surely punish wickedness. He is the 'true,' that is, either the Being who alone has true and substantial existence, or the Master who completely corresponds with the idea of what a Master ought to be."
3. "Their cry is, How long will it be before the Judge arises to claim the victory as His own, and to punish His adversaries as they deserve? Those who are thus to be judged are described as ‘they that dwell upon the earth;' and by the ‘earth’ here is to be understood the ungodly earth: those that dwell on it are the ungodly." (137 words)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "How long (εως ποτε). 'Until when.'" 
2. "'O Master (ο δεσποτης). Nominative articular form, but used as vocative (δεσποτα) as in Revelation 4:11 (John 20:28). On δεσποτης (correlative of δουλος) see Luke 2:29. Here (alone in the Apocalypse) it is applied to God as in Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24, but to Christ in Judges 1:4; 2 Peter 2:1." 
3. "The holy and true (ο αγιος κα αληθινος). See Revelation 3:7 for these attributes of God."

### John Gill:
1. "And they cried with a loud voice,.... With great ardour and fervency, being very pressing and importunate; and which shows that they were awake, and not asleep, and that the soul does not sleep with the body in the grave, or is after the death of that in a state of insensibility and inactivity, as some imagine:saying, how long, O Lord, holy and true..."
2. "...the holiness and justice of God might appear, and also his truth and faithfulness in his promises to them, and threatenings to his enemies..."
3. "...that God in all things might be glorified, and his church and people on earth might be supported and delivered..."

### John Wesley:
1. "The cry did not begin now, but under the first Roman persecution."
2. "Both the holiness and truth of God require him to execute judgment and vengeance."
3. "The martyrs are concerned for the praise of their Master, of his holiness and truth."
