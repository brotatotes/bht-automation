# Revelation 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
White robes, symbolizing purity and victory in Christ, were given to each person as a token of honor and acceptance. These robes represent the innocence and joy of the saints who have overcome, not just the martyrs. The souls underneath the altar find eternal rest from their toil and sorrows, experiencing peace. In heaven, the saints eagerly anticipate the completion of God's plan, trusting in the assurance of divine justice against their enemies. Their hope is anchored in the unfolding of time.
