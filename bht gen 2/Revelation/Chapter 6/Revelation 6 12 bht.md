# Revelation 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sixth seal in Revelation depicts the judgment of God on the wicked departed, as indicated by the shaking of the church and state by the man of sin. The darkening of the sun, resembling an eclipse, signifies the downfall of idolatry and the removal of the principal gods worshiped by the pagans. The moon turning as blood represents the obscuring and downfall of the moon deities along with the pagan priesthood. These apocalyptic images were revealed to the wicked departed, symbolizing the impending end of the world for them, even though these events were not perceived on earth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the sword, famine, and pestilence, answer to Matthew 24:6; Matthew 24:7; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 6:10, as to martyrdoms, answer to Matthew 24:9; Matthew 24:10"
2. "the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven; . . . then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming"
3. "earthquake—Greek, 'shaking' of the heavens, the sea, and the dry land; the shaking of these mutable things being the necessary preliminary to the setting up of those things which cannot be shaken"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The parallelism between the two is, to a certain extent, acknowledged by all inquirers, and is indeed, in many respects, so obvious, that it can hardly escape the notice of even the ordinary reader."
2. "Earthquake [σεισμος] . Lit., shaking. Used also of a tempest."
3. "Black as sackcloth of hair [μελας ως σακκος] . Compare Matthew 24:29; Isaiah 50:3; Isaiah 13:10; Jeremiah 4:23; Ezekiel 32:7, Ezekiel 32:8; Joel 2:31; Joel 3:15; Amos 8:9, Amos 8:10; Micah 3:6."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus spoke of earthquakes in his great eschatological discourse." 
2. "The reference is not a local earthquake like those so common in Asia Minor."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the earthquake' they suppose is meant the shaking of both church and state by the man of sin; who shook the doctrines, ordinances, and discipline of the church, and threw all into confusion, and introduced a new face of things."
2. "And the sun came black as sackcloth of hair; which is made of black hairs; see Isaiah 50:3; as when eclipsed. The sun was the chief deity worshipped by the Heathens, under various names, and this becoming black, may design the removing of their principal gods from their honour and glory, or the downfall of idolatry."
3. "The moon became as blood; as when obscured; this may design the next Heathen deity, or class of deities, for the moon was also worshipped by the Heathens under different names; and may likewise include the Pagan priesthood, which was next, and was annexed to the imperial dignity."
