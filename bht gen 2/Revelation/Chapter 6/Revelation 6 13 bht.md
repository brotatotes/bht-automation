# Revelation 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The imagery of unripe figs represents the Church's unreadiness and the impending destruction of the Antichristian world. The fig tree symbolizes the end of a long winter, pointing to the coming judgment and restoration. The falling stars depict a great shaking, demonstrating the power of God's kingdom. Through these signs, the inferior deities lose their honor, while the idols are exposed and despised, as the true power of Constantine's faith prevails.
