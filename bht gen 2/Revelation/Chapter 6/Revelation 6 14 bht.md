# Revelation 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power of God is exalted when comparing the Roman empire, with its pervasive paganism, to a small, easily removed sheet. The complete eradication of idolatry, including the elimination of the names of pagan gods, demonstrates the thoroughness of this purification. Not only was paganism uprooted from the mainland, but also from the islands, leaving no trace. Just as a mountain holds significance on land, an island is significant in the sea. This disruption signifies God's grand plan to prepare the earth for new beginnings and showcases the magnitude of His divine intervention.
