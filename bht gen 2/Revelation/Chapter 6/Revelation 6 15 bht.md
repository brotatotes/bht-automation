# Revelation 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the wrath of the Lamb was poured out, even those who were once greatly feared – the kings and the great men – sought to hide from the immense terror. These powerful individuals who were accustomed to mocking fear were now trembling in the face of the wrath. In their desperation to escape, they hid themselves in caves and rocks, trying to elude the judgment that had come upon them.
