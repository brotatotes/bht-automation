# Revelation 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The arrival of the great day of God's wrath signifies the ultimate judgment against those who oppose Him, as prophesied in the Old Testament writings. In this day, the combined wrath of God and the Lamb is unleashed upon the ungodly, causing great fear and trembling. The rhetorical question, Who shall be able to stand? implies the overwhelming and devastating nature of this divine judgment, leaving humanity in a state of despair, shame, and powerlessness before the mighty presence of God and the Lamb.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "After the Lord has exhausted all His ordinary judgments, the great day of the Lord itself shall come."
2. "The sixth seal brings us to the verge of the Lord's coming. The ungodly 'tribes of the earth' tremble at the signs of His immediate approach."
3. "But before He actually inflicts the blow in person, 'the elect' must be 'gathered' out."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The great day [Œ∑ Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ± Œ∑ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒ∑] . Lit., the day, the great (day)."
2. "Is come [Œ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ] . Lit., came."
3. "Shall be able to stand [Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±œÑŒ±Œπ œÉœÑŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒ±Œπ] . Rev., rightly, is able. Compare Nahum 1:6; Malachi 3:2."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The great day (Œ∑ Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ± Œ∑ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒ∑). The phrase occurs in the O.T. prophets and is here combined with 'of their wrath' as in Zephaniah 1:15; Zephaniah 1:18; Zephaniah 2:3; Romans 2:5."
2. "'Their' (Œ±œÖœÑœâŒΩ) means the wrath of God and of the Lamb put here on an equality as in Revelation 1:17; Revelation 22:3; Revelation 22:13; 1 Thessalonians 3:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:16."
3. "And who is able to stand? (Œ∫Œ± œÑŒπœÇ Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±œÑŒ± œÉœÑŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒ±Œπ?). Very much like the words in Nahum 1:6; Malachi 3:2. It is a rhetorical question, apparently by the frightened crowds of verse Revelation 6:15."

### John Gill:
1. "For the great day of his wrath is come... against the Heathen gods and Heathen persecutors, in answer to the cry of the martyrs..." 
2. "...who shall be able to stand? Against either of them, or in their presence, and so as to bear their wrath and displeasure..."
3. "...all which expresses guilt, shame, fear, and despair."
