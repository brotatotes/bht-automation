# Revelation 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rider on the white horse represents the triumphant progress of the Gospel in the world, overcoming opposition as it advanced. The white color symbolizes the purity of Gospel truths, the peace and joy it brings, and the victories achieved through it. With a bow shooting arrows afar off, the rider signifies victory, triumph, and dominion over many people. Going forth conquering and to conquer, the rider's mission is to achieve one victory after another. Ultimately, the rider fulfills prophecies about the fourth empire, devouring, treading down, and breaking in pieces the whole earth.
