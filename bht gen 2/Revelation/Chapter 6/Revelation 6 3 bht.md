# Revelation 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature, who looked toward the west, saying, Come. The opening of the second seal is accompanied by the voice of the second living creature, which symbolizes the providential government of God. As each seal is opened, there is a direction to turn towards the specific quarter of the world that is involved in the events depicted. The invitation to Come in this context serves to draw attention to the significance of what is about to be revealed.
