# Revelation 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The red horse, flaming and blood-red like fire, represents the agony and chaos brought upon by violence. It embodies the suffering endured by the church or the divisions caused by the Gospel. Through history, countless red horses have ridden, resulting in bloodshed and turmoil. From the time of Trajan to Hadrian, the Jews committed heinous acts, feasting on human flesh, and drenched themselves in blood. This horseman, wielding a mighty sword, symbolizes the never-ending cycle of war and the constant strife found in the world, particularly in the western regions.
