# Revelation 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The black horse symbolizes not only the lust of conquest and bloodshed, but also the associated consequences of famine and hunger. The pair of balances carried by the rider represents scarcity, where provisions are measured and doled out by weight. This scarcity resembles the afflictions of the church, including persecution, schisms, errors, and heresies. However, it may also encompass a literal famine, emphasizing the need to ration food by weight. These scales signify the control that Christ has over the entire creation, where all aspects of nature and states are subject to Him.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Come and see" - The two oldest manuscripts, A, C, and Vulgate omit "and see." B retains the words.
2. "black" - implying sadness and want.
3. "a pair of balances" - the symbol of scarcity of provisions, the bread being doled out by weight.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Black. The color of mourning and famine." 
2. "The judgment of this seal is scarcity, of which the balance is a symbol, representing the time when food is doled out by weight."
3. "The cross - beam of the loom, to which the warp was fixed; the thwarts joining the opposite sides of a ship; the beam of the balance, and hence the balance itself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A black horse... Lust of conquest brings bloodshed, but also famine and hunger." 
2. "The rider of this black horse, like the spectral figure of hunger, carries in his hand a pair of scales. This is also one of the fruits of war."

### John Gill:
1. "This living creature was that which was like a man, who was on the south side of the throne... but the ministers of the Gospel, whose voice was neither the voice of the lion nor of the ox, but of a man, which was still lower, but yet they retained their humanity, reasoning prudence, and wisdom." 
2. "An emblem either of the afflicted state of the church, still answering to the Smyrnaean one, being black with persecutions, schisms, errors, and heresies, which were many... or rather of a famine, not in a spiritual sense, of hearing of the word, but in a literal sense."
3. "He that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand... rather it signifies famine, and such a scarcity as that bread is delivered out by weight to men."

### John Wesley:
1. "A fit emblem of mourning and distress; particularly of black famine, as the ancient poets term it."
2. "When there is great plenty, men scarce think it worth their while to weigh and measure everything... But when there is scarcity, they are obliged to deliver them out by measure and weight."
3. "These scales signify scarcity... all the fruits of the earth, and consequently the whole heavens, with their courses and influences; that all the seasons of the year, with whatsoever they produce, in nature or states, are subject to Christ."
