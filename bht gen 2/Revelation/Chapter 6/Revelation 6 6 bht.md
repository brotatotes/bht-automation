# Revelation 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The voice heard amidst the four living creatures expresses God's concern for his redeemed in the face of famine. The scarcity described in the passage refers to a situation where a person's daily wages would only be sufficient to afford bread without any additions, leaving nothing for clothes, family, or other necessities. This scarcity primarily affects the fundamental staple of life, bread, while the oil and wine, symbolizing important Gospel doctrines, remain unharmed. The proclamation intends to prevent a complete dearth of provisions, ensuring that some resources are left to alleviate the situation.

### John Gill:

2. "Signifying that this scarcity should fall not upon the superfluities, such as oil and wine, which may be spared, and men can live without; but upon the necessities of life, particularly bread."
3. "And others understand them in an allegorical sense, of the principal doctrines of the Gospel, comparable to oil and wine, and which Christ takes care of, that they shall not be hurt and destroyed by heretics and false teachers, even when they prevail the most, and bring on a famine of the word, and when the church is blackened and darkened with them."
