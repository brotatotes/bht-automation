# Revelation 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The voice of the fourth living creature refers to the Gospel ministers of the time. This living creature is not a specific person like James or Cyprian, but represents the overall ministry. The direction toward the north could symbolize their mission to reach all people, as the north was associated with the Gentiles. It signifies that the proclamation of the Gospel was not limited to a particular region, but reaching out to all corners of the earth with the message of salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fourth living creature, who was 'like a flying eagle,' introduces this seal; implying high-soaring intelligence, and judgment descending from on high fatally on the ungodly, as the king of birds on his prey."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As in the other cases, there does not appear to have been any particular reason why the fourth of the living creatures should have made this proclamation rather than either of the others."
2. "It was poetic and appropriate to represent each one in his turn as making proclamation."
3. "Come and see."

### John Gill:
1. "This living creature was not James, the brother of our Lord, who had been dead long ago, as Grotius imagines; nor Cyprian, as Brightman thinks, though he lived under this seal; but the ministers of the Gospel in general in the times referred to are intended."
2. "It may denote some decline in the Gospel ministry, that they had not the courage and strength of the lion, as the first Gospel preachers; nor the patience and laboriousness of the ox, the next set of ministers; nor the solidity and prudence of the man, the ministers that followed them; and yet they retained some degree of light and knowledge, sagacity and penetration, and contempt of the world, signified by the eagle."
3. "These [ministers] invite John in a visionary way to come and see the following hieroglyphic."

### John Wesley:
1. I heard the voice of the fourth living creature — Toward the north.
