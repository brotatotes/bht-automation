# Revelation 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fourth seal represents the state of the church, pale with the hypocrisy and superstition of its members, but also symbolizes the sickly and dying state of the Pagan Roman empire. Death is the name of the fourth rider, who is accompanied by Hades. This fourth seal represents the various kinds of death and the short lives of the emperors. It also reaches into the realm of things invisible, encompassing the judgments upon the Roman empire. From the time of Trajan onwards, a considerable portion of men died by sword, famine, pestilence, and wild beasts within the Roman empire.
