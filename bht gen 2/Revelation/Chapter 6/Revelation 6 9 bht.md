# Revelation 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fifth seal unveils the martyrs who, having sacrificed their lives for their faith, are symbolically represented as souls under the altar, crying out for justice. Their blood, poured out on earth, signifies their ultimate offering and oneness with Christ. These martyrs, both from the Old and New Testament eras, eagerly await the fulfillment of their bliss in Christ's presence. Their testimony serves as an inspiration for a long succession of faithful followers who bravely acknowledge their loyalty to Christ, even in the face of persecution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The representation here, in which they are seen under the altar, is simply symbolical, carrying out the likening of them to victims slain on an altar. Even as the blood of these victims was poured under the altar and the life was in the blood, so their souls are represented as under the symbolical altar in heaven, crying for vengeance, as blood is often said to do." 
2. "The cry of the martyrs' blood has been ever going up before God since Stephen fell: ever and anon, at some great time of persecution, it has waxed louder: and so on through the ages it shall accumulate and gather strength, till the great issue... is accomplished."
3. "The white robe, in this book, is the vestment of acknowledged and glorified righteousness in which the saints walk and reign with Christ... individually they are blessed in glory with Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The scene changes from earth to heaven; so that interpretations which make these three last consecutive to the first four seals, are very doubtful." 
2. "The blood of the martyrs cries from the earth under Christ's cross, whereon they may be considered virtually to have been sacrificed; their souls cry from under the altar of incense, which is Christ in heaven, by whom alone the incense of praise is accepted before God." 
3. "They are under Christ, in His immediate presence, shut up unto Him in joyful eager expectancy until He shall come to raise the sleeping dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Souls [ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Î±Ï‚] . Or lives. See on 3 John 1:2. He saw only blood, but blood and life were equivalent terms to the Hebrew."
2. "Slain [ÎµÏƒÏ†Î±Î³Î¼ÎµÎ½Ï‰Î½] . See on chapter Revelation 5:6. The law commanded that the blood of sacrificed animals should be poured out at the bottom of the altar of burnt - offering (Leviticus 4:7)."
3. "They held [ÎµÎ¹Ï‡Î¿Î½] . Not held fast, but bore the testimony which was committed to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Seer beholds first â€˜the altar.â€™ We have already seen that the whole imagery of the heavenly abode is taken from the structure of the Tabernacle, afterwards copied in the Temple. The only question, therefore, is whether we have here the altar of incense which stood in the holy place, or the great brazen altar of burnt-offering which stood in the outer court." 
2. "It corresponds with this that what St. John sees under the altar is in all probability blood. He speak indeed of â€˜souls,â€™ or rather â€˜lives;â€™ but to the Hebrew blood and life were equivalent terms; â€˜the life of the flesh,â€™ he said, â€˜is in the blood.â€™"
3. "These â€˜souls underneath the altar,â€™ therefore, are the saints of the Old Testament waiting for the completion of their happiness by having added to them their â€˜fellow-servantsâ€™ of New Testament times."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The altar of sacrifice...not of incense...this altar in heaven is symbolic, of course, the antitype for the tabernacle altar."
2. "The souls, the lives...were given for Christ."
3. "A long line of martyrs has followed...the confession of loyalty to Christ as opposed to emperor-worship."

### John Gill:
1. "This seal refers to the times of Dioclesian, and the persecution under him; and instead of the voice of one of the living creatures, John hears the voice of martyrs."
2. "These were the souls of such as 'were slain'; their bodies were dead, but their souls were alive; which shows the immortality of souls, and that they die not with their bodies, and that they live after them in a separate state."
3. "Christ may be meant by the altar here, as he is in Hebrews 13:10, who is both altar, sacrifice, and priest, and is the altar that sanctifies the gift, and from off which every sacrifice of prayer and praise comes up with acceptance before God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The fifth seal refers to the happy dead, particularly the martyrs."
2. "It not only describes the actions of both these armies upon earth, but their respective removals from earth, into a more happy or more miserable state, succeeding each other at several times, distinguished by various degrees."
3. "Under the altar - That is, at the foot of it. Two altars are mentioned in the Revelation, 'the golden altar' of incense, Revelation 9:13; and the altar of burnt-offerings, mentioned here, and Revelation 8:5; 14:18; 16:7. At this the souls of the martyrs now prostrate themselves."
