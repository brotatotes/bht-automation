# Revelation 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the initial six seals were opened, the seventh seal would serve as the climax of judgment. In preparation for this significant event, the visions in Revelation 7 are presented to encourage and strengthen the faith of believers. The sealed number of God's true church, hidden and protected, would be preserved until the seventh seal is executed. The four angels mentioned in the passage are connected to the four first trumpets, acting as agents of judgment. The reference to the wind not blowing upon the earth, sea, and trees signifies that these judgments will affect various regions of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The second advent will be the time of the restoration of the kingdom to Israel, when the times of the Gentiles shall have been fulfilled."
2. "The period of the Lord's absence has been a blank in the history of the Jews as a nation."
3. "The judgments to descend on [earth, sea, and tree] are in answer to the martyrs' prayer under the fifth seal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that events would occur which would be properly represented by four angels standing in the four quarters of the world, and having power over the winds."
2. "The angels here are represented as 'holding' the winds - κρατοῦντας kratountas. That is, they held them back when about to sweep over the earth, and to produce far-spread desolation."
3. "The essential ideas, therefore, in this portion of the symbol, cannot be mistaken. They are two: (1) That at the period of time here referred to...there would be a state of things which would be well represented by rising tempests and storms, which if unrestrained would spread desolation afar; and, (2) That this impending ruin was held back as if by angels having control of those winds; that is, those tempests were not suffered to go forth to spread desolation over the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. These things [ταυτα] . Read touto this. Holding [κρατουντας] . Holding fast or firmly. See on Mark 7:3; Acts 3:11.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Seer beholds four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. The number four is that of the world; and hence ‘the four corners,’ North, South, East, West."
2. "The winds are those upon which the Almighty rides, and the symbols of His judgments."
3. "The figure used in this verse is at once appropriate and natural. We may compare Hamlet’s account of his father’s care of his mother ‘So loving to my mother. That he might not let even the winds of heaven Visit her too roughly.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Instead of the seventh seal (Revelation 8:1) being opened, two other episodes or preliminary visions occupy chapter 7."

### John Gill:
1. "This vision is shown him, to fortify his mind, and all other saints, that are observers of these things, who by the opening of the following seal would see what judgments and plagues would come upon the empire..."
2. "God would have throughout all this, and in every age of time, a sealed number, a true church, hidden and secured, even until the seventh angel has sounded his trumpet..."

### John Wesley:
1. "And after these things — What follows is a preparation for the seventh seal, which is the weightiest of all."
2. "They have their employ with the four first trumpets, as have other evil angels with the three last."
