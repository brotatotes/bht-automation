# Revelation 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In their resounding cry, the multitude expresses the intensity of their thankfulness and joy, as they ascribe the glory of their salvation to God, our Savior. The salvation they praise God for encompasses not only temporal deliverances but also the profound spiritual and eternal salvation. This salvation was purposed by God the Father, who sits upon the throne, and was accomplished through His divine decrees and the covenant of grace. It is the constant, everlasting praise of the saints to attribute all glory and honor to God and the Lamb for this great salvation.
