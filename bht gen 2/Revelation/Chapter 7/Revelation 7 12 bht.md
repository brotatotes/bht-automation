# Revelation 7:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angels join in a resounding confirmation of the praise offered by the great multitude. They not only affirm it, but also elevate it as they ascribe blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and strength to our God. This echoes the sevenfold hymn of praise offered to the Lamb before he opened the seven seals, emphasizing the completeness and totality of the praise given. The angels desire that this praise be given to God for all eternity, believing that it is right and just for men to acknowledge and attribute all excellence to Him.
