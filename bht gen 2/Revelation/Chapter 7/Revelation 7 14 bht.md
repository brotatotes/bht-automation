# Revelation 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The speaker addresses the elder in reverence and seeks his knowledge about the identities and origins of the individuals being discussed. The elder possesses this knowledge and is asked to share it. These individuals have emerged from a period of intense suffering, which encompasses various instances of tribulation throughout history. The term washing refers to the act of cleansing from sin through the faith in the blood of Christ. This blood not only purifies but also adorns us with holiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Comparatively ignorant ourselves of divine things, it is well for us to look upward for divinely communicated knowledge."
2. "Thus this seventh chapter is a recapitulation of the vision of the six seals, Daniel 12:1- :, to fill up the outline there given in that part of it which affects the faithful of that day."
3. "Meanwhile, in contrast with their previous sufferings, they are exempt from the hunger, thirst, and scorching heats of their life on earth, and are fed and refreshed by the Lamb of God Himself; an earnest of their future perfect blessedness in both body and soul united."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'tribulation' - θλίψις thlipsis - is a word of general character, meaning 'affliction,' though perhaps there is here an allusion to persecution. The sense, however, would be better expressed by the phrase great trials."
2. "The object seems to have been to set before the mind of the apostle a view of those who had suffered much, and who by their sufferings had been sanctified and prepared for heaven, in order to encourage those who might be yet called to suffer."
3. "It is not by their own sufferings and trials, their persecutions and sorrows, that they are made holy, but by the blood of the Lamb that had been shed for sinners."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sir [κυριε] . Add mou my, and render, as Rev., my Lord. An address of reverence as to a heavenly being." 
2. "Which came [οι ερχομενοι] . The present participle. Hence, as Rev., which come. Out of great tribulation [εκ της θλιψεως της μεγαλης] . Lit., out of the tribulation, the great (tribulation)." 
3. "Have washed [επλυναν] . The aorist tense. Rev., correctly, they washed. Only here and Luke 5:2, on which see note. For the New Testament words for washing, see on Acts 16:33."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The martyrs are still arriving from the scene of the great tribulation."
3. "Robes are the expression of character and compares the word habit used of dress."

### John Gill:
1. "John confesses his ignorance, and ascribes knowledge to the elder, and desires information of him; for the sense is, that the elder knew who they were, and from whence they came, but he did not, and therefore desires that he would inform him."
2. "The 'great tribulation', out of which they came, is not to be restrained to any particular time of trouble, but includes all that has been, is, or shall be."
3. "The act of washing from sin, by the blood of Christ, is sometimes ascribed to Christ himself, as in Revelation 1:5; but here to the saints, and designs the concern which faith has in the blood of Christ, which deals with it for justification, peace, and pardon, for the removing of sin from the conscience, and for cleansing from all impurity, both of flesh and Spirit."

### John Wesley:

3. "And have washed their robes — From all guilt.And made them white — In all holiness.By the blood of the Lamb — Which not only cleanses, but adorns us also."
