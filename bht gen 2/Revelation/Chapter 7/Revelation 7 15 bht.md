# Revelation 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who have been purified by the blood of Christ and have endured great affliction, for they will enter into the heavenly city and stand before the throne of God. In this heavenly sanctuary, they will experience an intimate communion with God, even nearer than the angels. God will be their dwelling place, providing both a protective covering and a glorious presence. This is the ultimate destiny of the redeemed, who have been brought through their tribulations by the grace and power of God.

2. "On earth, toil is suspended by the return of night, and the service of God is intermitted by the necessity of rest; in heaven, as there will be no weariness, there will be no need of intermission, and the service of God, varied doubtless to meet the state of the mind, will be continued forever."
3. "Perhaps the allusion is to the tabernacle in the wilderness. That was regarded as the special dwelling-place of God, and that always occupied a central place among the tribes of Israel.
