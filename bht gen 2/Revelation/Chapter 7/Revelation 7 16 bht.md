# Revelation 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the future, the saints shall hunger and thirst no more, for their wants will be fully supplied. They will not be subjected to any suffering like one experiences in a scorching desert. The saints will not be struck by the sun, as God Himself will be their sun and provide warmth, light, and protection from any painful heat or inclement weather. There will be no longer any desires for earthly or carnal things, but only the enjoyment of the presence and provision of God.
