# Revelation 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lamb, in the middle point in front of the throne, will be the great agent in promoting the happiness of the redeemed in heaven. He will shepherd them, leading them to living fountains of water, representing the grace, love, and favor of God in Christ. In that glorious realm, there will be no pain, disappointment, or bereavement. God Himself will wipe away every tear, replacing them with full and everlasting joy. Hunger, thirst, suffering, and grief will be eternally abolished in the presence of the Lamb.
