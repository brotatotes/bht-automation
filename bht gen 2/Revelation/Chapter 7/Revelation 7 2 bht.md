## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

	"the rising of the sun." The quarter from which God's glory
	oftenest manifests itself.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It may be that as light begins in the east, this would be properly symbolic of something that could be compared with the light of the morning; or that some influence in 'sealing' the servants of God would in fact go out from the east." 
2. "As to what was to be designated by the seal, the main idea is clear, that it was to place some such mark upon his friends that they would be known to be his, and that they would be safe in the impending calamities."
3. "This would be something appointed by God himself. It would not be of human origin, but would be as if an angel sent from heaven should impress it on the forehead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. East [ανατολης ηλιου] . Rev., more literally, the sunrising. See on Matthew 2:2; Luke 1:78. Compare Ezekiel 43:2. The four angels. Compare Matthew 24:31.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ascend (αναβαινοντα). Present active participle of αναβαινω, 'ascending,' 'going up,' picturing the process."
