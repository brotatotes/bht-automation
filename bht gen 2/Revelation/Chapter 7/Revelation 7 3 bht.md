# Revelation 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's love is such that He refrains from judgment until His people are safe from harm. A faithful remnant will be preserved from the coming judgments. Their spiritual resurrection will bring life to all nations. These angels were commanded to delay destruction until God's servants were secure. The task required more than one person. The mark on their foreheads would be easily recognizable in times of destruction. The sealing does not signify election but the protection and concealment of the saints amidst turmoil. Christ will care for His people, providing shelter until judgment has passed.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hurt not (μη αδικησητε). Prohibition with μη and the ingressive aorist active subjunctive of αδικεω, not to begin to hurt."

3. "Upon their foreheads (επ των μετωπων). From Ezekiel 9:4. Old word... in N.T. only in the Apocalypse... For 'the servants of God' (τους δουλους του θεου) who are to be thus marked linked with angels in the service of God..."

### John Gill:
1. "This retarding of them was but in appearance, that there might be an opportunity to show to John what care would be taken all along of the church of Christ, and true servants of the living God."
2. "The sealing of them does not design the sealing of them with the seal of election, this was done in eternity; nor with the seal of the Spirit, which is common to all the saints in all ages; but it denotes the hiding and concealing, and so securing the saints amidst all the calamities of the empire, and throughout the whole time of the Romish apostasy, from first to last."
3. "Christ will have a people in the worst of times; he knows who are his, and he will take care of them; he has his chambers of protection to hide them in, till the indignation is over past."

### John Wesley:
1. "Hurt not the earth, till we — Other angels were joined in commission with him."
2. "Have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads — Secured the servants of God of the twelve tribes from the impending calamities; whereby they shall be as clearly distinguished from the rest, as if they were visibly marked on their foreheads."
