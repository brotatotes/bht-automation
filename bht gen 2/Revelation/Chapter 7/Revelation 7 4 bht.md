# Revelation 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord knows and seals His own, ensuring the accomplishment and preservation of His chosen ones. The listing of tribes in Revelation may not follow a specific order, but it signifies the inclusion of a portion from every tribe and represents the true Israel, consisting of both Jews and Gentiles. The sealing of the 144,000 suggests exemption from judgment, resembling examples from Exodus and Ezekiel. This number symbolizes a multitude, known to God and Christ, that will join the people of Israel from all nations. The book focuses on Israel, while also pointing to the inclusion of believers from diverse backgrounds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The import for us is that the Lord knoweth and sealeth His own: that the fulness of their number shall be accomplished and not one shall fail..."
2. "The points to be noticed in this enumeration are, 1) that with the exception of Judah being placed first, the order of the tribes does not seem to follow any assignable principle. It may indeed be not without reason, that Reuben, the eldest, next follows Judah, and Benjamin the youngest is placed last, with Joseph his own brother: but beyond this all is uncertainty..."
3. "It has been the general view, that it was to exempt those sealed from the judgments which were to come on the unbelieving. And it can hardly be denied, that this view receives strong support from Scripture analogy, e.g. that of Exodus 12:0 and Ezekiel 9:0, especially the latter, where the exempted ones are marked, as here, on their foreheads."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Twelve is the number of the tribes, and appropriate to the Church: three by four: three, the divine number, multiplied by four, the number for world-wide extension."
2. "Twelve by twelve implies fixity and completeness, which is taken a thousandfold in 144,000. A thousand implies the world perfectly pervaded by the divine; for it is ten, the world number, raised to the power of three, the number of God."
3. "Not 144,000 of each tribe, but the aggregate of the twelve thousand from every tribe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair interpretation seems to require that it should be understood as symbolical, or as designed not to be literally taken."
2. "The representation seems to be rather that of a comparatively small number than a large one."
3. "The fact that a certain portion would be sealed from every tribe would not be an unfit representation of the fact that a portion of all the various churches or denominations would be sealed and saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The interpretations, as usual, vary greatly, dividing generally into two great classes : one holding that only Jews are meant, the other including the whole number of the elect both Jew and Gentile."
2. "According to the Apocalyptic usage, Jewish terms are 'christianized and heightened in their meaning, and the word 'Israel' is to be understood of all Christians, the blessed company of all faithful people, the true Israel of God.'"
3. "The mark of Satan which is in the forehead, is set upon all his servants without distinction of race."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The number connotes perfection (Alford), 12x12x1000 = a hundred and forty-four thousands."
2. "There are two opposite views here, one taking the sealed as referring only to Jews... the other including Gentiles as well as Jewish Christians, that is the true Israel as in Revelation 2:9; Revelation 3:9 and like Paul in Galatians and Romans."
3. "But in either view there remains the difficulty about names of the tribes. The list is not geographical, since Levi is included, but Dan is omitted and Manasseh put in his place, though he as the son of Joseph is included in Joseph."

### John Gill:
1. "And therefore could be sure of the exact number, which did not depend upon his sight, and telling them, in which some mistake might have been made, but he heard the number expressed."
2. "And may denote their being the true and genuine offspring of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, holding their doctrine, and being built on their foundation."
3. "And only intends a large number of persons known to God and Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "To these will afterwards be joined a multitude out of all nations."
2. "This is not the number of all the Israelites who are saved from Abraham or Moses to the end of all things."
3. "It seems as if this book had, in many places, a special view to the people of Israel."
