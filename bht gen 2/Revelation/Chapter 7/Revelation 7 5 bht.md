# Revelation 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of Judah first in this passage holds great significance as it represents the tribe that Christ, the Messiah, descended from. Judah was chosen to preserve the pure worship of God and remained a distinct and faithful tribe until the coming of Shiloh. The name 'Judah' itself means 'praise God,' reminding us that it is our duty as the sealed ones, true believers, and members of the church to offer continuous praise to Him for the countless blessings and favors He bestows upon us, both in this life and for all eternity.
