# Revelation 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tribe of Asher, pronounced 'Aser', signifies being blessed with all spiritual blessings and grace, as the sealed ones are. Similarly, the name Nephthalim, meaning 'wrestlings', refers to the wrestlings of saints, both in prayer with God and in their struggles against sin, Satan, and the world. Additionally, the name Manasses, meaning 'forgetting', encourages followers of Christ to forget their past sins, worldly pleasures, former associations, and all labors and sufferings for the sake of Christ. Instead, they should focus on striving for the faith of the Gospel.
