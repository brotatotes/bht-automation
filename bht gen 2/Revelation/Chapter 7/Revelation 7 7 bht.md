# Revelation 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
His tribe, whose name signifies hearing, represents those who hear, understand, believe, and obediently follow the Gospel. They are called to practice what they hear and to yield the obedience of faith. Like Levi, who was no longer set apart by the Levitical ceremonies, they are now on a level playing field with their fellow believers.
