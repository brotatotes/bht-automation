# Revelation 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The human race originated as one nation but later divided into tribes and peoples. However, a glimpse of unity in heaven reveals the triumph of the church beyond earthly struggles. This vision offers encouragement to those facing persecution and shows that a multitude from all nations will be part of the redeemed. Clothed in white robes, symbolizing victory and purity, they will hold palm branches, signifying joy and thanksgiving. This diverse multitude represents both Gentile and Jewish Christians, and their number cannot be quantified. The future state will bring forth varying degrees of reward, illustrating the immeasurable greatness of the heavenly glory that awaits.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The human race is 'one nation' by origin, but afterwards separated itself into tribes, peoples, and tongues; hence, the one singular stands first, followed by the three plurals."
2. "The 'first-fruits unto the Lamb,' the 144,000 of Israel, are followed by a copious harvest of all nations, an election out of the Gentiles, as the 144,000 are an election out of Israel."
3. "The palm branch is the symbol of joy and triumph. It was used at the feast of tabernacles, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when they kept feast to God in thanksgiving for the ingathered fruits."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design seems to be to carry the mind forward quite beyond the storms and tempests of earth - the scenes of woe and sorrow - the clays of error, darkness, declension, and persecution - to that period when the church should be triumphant in heaven."
2. "The object of the vision is to cheer those who are desponding in times of religious declension and in seasons of persecution, and when the number of true Christians seems to be small, with the assurance that an immense host shall be redeemed from our world, and be gathered triumphant before the throne."
3. "The meaning of the whole is, that persons from all parts of the earth, as contemplated in these points of view, would be among the redeemed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Arrayed in His own land shall be with twofold garments."
2. "This revelation manifests to us." 
3. "Not a heathen but a Jewish image drawn probably from the Feast of Tabernacles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The vision now introduced is distinguished from the former by the fact that it belongs to heaven, while the sealing took place on earth." 
2. "They are clothed with white robes, emblematic of priestly purity. They have palms in their hands, not palms of victory at heathen games, but palms of festive joy, especially of the least of Tabernacles."
3. "This great multitude is out of every nation, the word 'nation' being then enlarged and supplemented. The terms used are four, an indication of the universality of the host. But not Gentile Christians alone are included; Jewish Christians must also be referred to."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A polyglott cosmopolitan crowd" (Swete).
2. "Both these and the white robes are signs of victory and joy."
3. "Which no man could number."

### John Gill:
1. "But it rather respects the millennium state, or thousand years' reign of Christ with his saints on earth, with which all that is here said agrees."
2. "And these robes may also design their shining robes of glory and immortality; for they will now be clothed upon with their house from heaven, and will have put off mortality and corruption, and have put on immortality and incorruption, and appear with Christ in glory."
3. "And hence here palms are mentioned along with white garments; and some have been tempted to render the words thus, 'clothed with white robes', and 'palms on their sides'; that is, on the sides of their robes."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is an inconceivable variety in the degrees of reward in the other world."
2. "Let not any slothful one say, 'If I get to heaven at all, I will be content:' such an one may let heaven go altogether."
3. "The difference between the very highest and the lowest state in the world is nothing to the smallest difference between the degrees of glory."
