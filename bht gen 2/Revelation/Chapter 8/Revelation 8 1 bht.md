# Revelation 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The opening of this seal initiates a moment of profound stillness, in stark contrast to the jubilation and worship that filled the heavens before. It signifies the expectation and anticipation of the angels and blessed spirits as they await the unfolding of God's judgments. The silence hints at the imminent development of God's eternal purposes, which will be revealed for all eternity. This short period of silence represents the moment when hindrances to our perfect knowledge will be removed, ultimately leading to the glorification of God and the praise of His name.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The openings of these seals correspond to the various arrangements of God's Providence by which the way is prepared for the final opening of the closed book of His purposes to His glorified Church."
2. "This book the Lamb opens, containing as it does matters which οὐδεὶς οἶδεν, οὐδὲ ἄγγελος ἐν οὐρανῷ, οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός."
3. "Then will be the time when the last hindrance to our perfect knowledge will be removed, and the book of God's eternal purposes will lie open the theme of eternity's praise."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The half hour's silence contrasts with the previous jubilant songs of the great multitude, taken up by the angels."
2. "The half-hour stillness implies, too, the earnest adoring expectation with which the blessed spirits and the angels await the succeeding unfolding of God's judgments."
3. "A short space is implied; for even an hour is so used."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "On the opening of this seal, instead of voices, thunderings, tempests... there was an awful stillness, as if all heaven was reverently waiting for the development."
2. "In a state, however, of anxious suspense, the moments would seem to move slowly... and now the last in the series to be opened, disclosing what the affairs of the world would be at the consummation of all things."
3. "The most simple and obvious interpretation is likely to be the true one; and that is... as expressive of the fearful anticipation felt on opening the last seal that was to close the series, and to wind up the affairs of the church and the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For a similar construction, see Mark 11:19 (correct reading). Alford observes that it occurs in the opening of this seal only, giving it an indefiniteness which does not belong to any of the rest." 
2. "More literally, come to pass. Rev., there followed."
3. "A usual form of expression with John. See John 1:39; John 6:19; John 11:18."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The silence is generally supposed to relate to the cessation either of the songs of praise spoken of in chap. 7, or of the trials of the Church, which is now to enjoy a blessed period of rest."
2. "We suggest that the ‘silence’ alluded to refers only to the cessation of the ‘lightnings and voices and thunders’ of chap. Revelation 4:5."
3. "The silence of half an hour may well be understood to mean that the hour of judgment is interrupted or broken."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here modal αν is used with οτε (used about the opening of the preceding six seals), but οταν is not here rendered more indefinite, as is sometimes true (Mark 3:11; Revelation 4:9), but here and possibly (can be repetition) in Mark 11:19 it is a particular instance, not a general rule (Robertson, Grammar, p. 973)."
2. "There came silence." Dramatic effect by this profound stillness with no elder or angel speaking, no chorus of praise nor cry of adoration, no thunder from the throne (Swete), but a temporary cessation in the revelations. See Revelation 10:4.
3. "Late and rare word (ημ, half, ωρα, hour), here only in N.T. Accusative of extent of time."

### John Gill:
1. "This space of time some think refers to the time which elapsed, while the angel, who had incense given him to offer it with the prayers of saints, did so, and took fire off the altar with his censer, and cast it on the earth."
2. "Others understand it of the amazement of the saints at the judgments of God, which were coming upon the Christian empire, and of their quiet and silent preparations for these troubles and combats."
3. "Rather this is to be understood of that peace and rest which the church enjoyed upon Constantine's having defeated all his enemies, when he brought the church into a state of profound tranquility and ease."

### John Wesley:
1. "Such a silence is mentioned but in this one place. It was uncommon, and highly observable: for praise is sounding in heaven day and night."
2. "This silence before God shows that those who were round about him were expecting, with the deepest reverence, the great things which the Divine Majesty would farther open and order."
3. "Silence is only a preparation: the grand point is, the sounding the trumpets to the praise of God."
