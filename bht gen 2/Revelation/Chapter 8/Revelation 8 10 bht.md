# Revelation 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And thus, the symbolism of a falling star in this passage represents a figure of great prominence in the church who eventually deviated from the true doctrine. This star, like a lamp or torch, initially shone brightly but fell into great errors. The name associated with it, Wormwood, indicates the bitterness that tainted the teachings, causing harm to many. The waters, symbolizing the Scriptures, became embittered, resulting in confusion. This event parallels the destructive nature of war and warns against the dangers of false doctrine. It serves as a reminder to be discerning and guard against heresy.

### Henry Alford:
1. "And the third angel blew his trumpet, and there fell from heaven a great star burning as a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of the waters."

3. "And the fourth angel blew his trumpet: and the third part of the sun was struck and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars, that the third part of them might be darkened, and the day might not shine during the third part of it, and the night in like manner."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A star falling from heaven would be a natural symbol of one who had left a higher station, or of one whose character and course would be like a meteor shooting through the sky." 
2. "In the application of this part of the symbol, therefore, we naturally look for some prince or warrior of brilliant talents, who appears suddenly and sweeps rapidly over the world; who excites consternation and alarm; whose path is marked by desolation, and who is regarded as sent from heaven to execute the divine purposes." 
3. "At the same time, as in the case of the other trumpets, there is a propriety in supposing that there would be something in the event referred to by the symbol which would make it more appropriate to use this symbol in this case than in the others."

2. "His name, according to his doctrine, was wormwood and gall, which embittered the sweet doctrines of the free grace of God, and affected the fountains and rivers, the sacred Scriptures, from whence these doctrines flow; so that instead of being pleasant and wholesome to men, through his false glosses and perverse interpretations of them, they became bitter and poisonous."
