# Revelation 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The star that is called Wormwood represents the bitter afflictions and sorrows that it brought upon the people. The third part of the waters becoming wormwood signifies the widespread afflictions and calamities that were experienced by the inhabitants of the Roman empire. These bitter waters caused many to suffer and die, reflecting the barbarities and cruelties inflicted by those who followed the bitter and divisive doctrine of Arius and his followers. The widespread influence and the bitter spirit of these individuals impacted not only a considerable part of Africa, but also brought death and suffering to many.

2. "Heretical wormwood changes the sweet Siloas of Scripture into deadly Marahs."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Wormwood [αψινθος] . Used metaphorically in the Old Testament of the idolatry of Israel (Deuteronomy 29:18); of calamity and sorrow (Jeremiah 9:15; Jeremiah 23:15; Lamentations 3:15, Lamentations 3:19); of false judgment (Amos 5:7).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Wormwood (ο Αψινθος). Absinthe. Usually feminine (η), but masculine here probably because αστηρ is masculine."

3. "Were made bitter (επικρανθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of πικραινω. Old verb (from πικρος, bitter), as in Revelation 10:9. In a metaphorical sense to embitter in Colossians 3:19."
