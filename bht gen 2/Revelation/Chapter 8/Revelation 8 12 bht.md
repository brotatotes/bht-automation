# Revelation 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sixth seal brings darkness to the heavenly luminaries, symbolizing a calamitous event that impacts both the physical and spiritual realms. This darkness represents the obscuring of Christ's doctrine and the corruption of the church. The subsequent trumpet warns of the spreading ignorance and decline of knowledge caused by the barbarous nations. The destruction of the Roman Empire is ultimately foretold, marked by the loss of provinces and the fall of Rome itself. These events unfold over a significant period, lasting nearly four hundred years.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This partial obscuration, therefore, comes between the prayers of the martyrs under the fifth seal, and the last overwhelming judgments on the ungodly under the sixth seal, at the eve of Christ's coming."
2. "The night likewise withdrew a third part of the light which the bright Eastern moon and stars ordinarily afford."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The darkening of the heavenly luminaries is everywhere an emblem of any great calamity - as if the light of the sun, moon, and stars should be put out."
2. "The meaning is, that calamity would come as if darkness should spread over the sun, the moon, and the stars, leaving the world in gloom."
3. "Perhaps it is also intended by the symbol that there would be light again... That is, is it not implied that there would still be prosperity in some future period?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sun, moon, and stars are thought of only in their relation to earth and its life and comfort, so that when they are affected it also suffers."
2. "Any attempt to connect particular objects upon earth with the heavenly bodies mentioned in the judgment is vain."
3. "The whole series of the trumpets is more intense in judgment than that of the seals, but not to such a degree that the judgment of the fourth trumpet may not be lighter than that of the sixth seal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was smitten (επληγη). Second aorist passive indicative of πλησσω, old verb (like πληγη plague), here only in N.T." 
2. "That should be darkened (ινα σκοτισθη). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of σκοτιζω, from σκοτος (darkness) as in Matthew 24:29, but σκοτοω in Revelation 9:2." 
3. "And the day should not shine (κα η ημερα μη φανη). Negative purpose clause with ινα μη and the first aorist active subjunctive of φαινω, to shed light upon, as in Revelation 18:23, not the second aorist passive subjunctive φανη with different accent. The eclipse here is only partial and is kin to the ninth Egyptian plague (Exodus 10:21)."

### John Gill:
1. "When the doctrine concerning the person and offices of Christ, who is the sun and light of the world, was obscured by heresies; and the discipline of the church, which, like the moon, has all its light, beauty, and order from Christ, was sadly defaced by the introduction of Jewish and Paganish rites and ceremonies."
2. "This trumpet has respect to that darkness and ignorance which the above barbarous nations, the Goths, Huns, Vandals, and Heruli, spread, and left throughout the empire; for from this time there was a visible decline, as of evangelical light and knowledge, so of all kind of useful knowledge, and nothing but ignorance, stupidity, and barbarity, took place everywhere."
3. "The destruction of the western Roman empire, which is expressed by much the same figures as the ruin of the Roman Pagan empire...and which the various irruptions of these savage people issued in."


### John Wesley:
1. "After the emperor Theodosius died, and the empire was divided into the eastern and the western, the barbarous nations poured in as a flood."
2. "During all these commotions, one province was lost after another, till, in the year476, Odoacer seized upon Rome, deposed the emperor, and put an end to the empire itself."
3. "The three last trumpets have the time of their continuance fixed, and between each of them there is a remarkable pause: whereas between the four former there is no pause, nor is the time of their continuance mentioned; but all together these four seem to take up a little less than four hundred years."
