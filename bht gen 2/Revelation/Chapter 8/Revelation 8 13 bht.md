The seventh trumpet introduces a series of great and fearful calamities, symbolized by an eagle, a bird associated with vengeance and judgment.

The three woes will extend over the earth, encompassing a wide span of regions and nations, bringing about the final judgments. The preludes of these woes have already begun, as the stage is set for the unfolding of God's divine plan.
