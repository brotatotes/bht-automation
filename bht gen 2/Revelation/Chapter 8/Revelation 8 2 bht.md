# Revelation 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seven angels mentioned in the passage have a significant role as messengers of divine wrath, executing judgment on the earth. The blowing of the seven trumpets signifies the completion of the woes that will come upon the world. Each part of the revelation, whether the seals, trumpets, or phials, unfolds consecutively, with the beginning of one part preceding the beginning of the next. Through the trumpets, the angels proclaim the marvelous works of God, shaking opposing powers until the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of God and his Anointed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The evolution of the courses of visions out of one another does not legitimately lead to the conclusion that the events represented by them are consecutive in order of time."
2. "There is something to me far more revolting from theological propriety in such a supposition, than in an angel being seen in the heavenly ministrations offering incense to mix with the prayers of the saints."
3. "The whole imagery introduces the fact that those prayers are about to be answered in the following judgments."
 

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One." 
2. "These come in during the time while the martyrs rest until their fellow servants also, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled; for it is the inhabiters of the earth on whom the judgments fall, on whom also the martyrs prayed that they should fall."
3. "By the seven trumpets the world kingdoms are overturned to make way for Christ's universal kingdom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The only difficulty in applying it arises from the use of the article - 'the seven angels' - τοὺς tous as if they were angels already referred to... But this interpretation is not absolutely necessary."
2. "John might use this language either because the angels had been spoken of before; or because it would be sufficiently understood, from the common use of language, who would be referred to."
3. "It would be entirely in accordance with the usage of the article for one to say that he saw an army, and the commander-in-chief, and the four staff-officers, and the five bands of music, and the six companies of sappers and miners, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Stood [εστηκασιν] . Rev., correctly, stand. Trumpets [σαλπιγγες] . See on chapter Revelation 1:10.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The seven angels spoken of stand before God ready to execute His will."
2. "These trumpets are neither those of festal proclamation, nor are they, with some recent commentators, to be regarded as a mere ‘manifestation of will.’ They are trumpets of war and battle."
3. "This alone is sufficient to show us that in them we have an advance upon the seals. The seals only announce judgment. The trumpets indicate action, which at the same time they arouse and quicken."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The article (the seven angels) seems to point to seven well-known angels."
2. "We see trumpets assigned to angels in Matthew 24:31; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 15:52; Revelation 4:1; Revelation 4:4."
3. "These seven trumpets are soon to break the half hour of silence."

### John Gill:
1. "The angelic spirits, and these either evil ones, since they are the executioners of wrath and vengeance, and bring judgments on the earth; or rather good angels, who are sometimes ministers of divine wrath."
2. "Seven of them are mentioned, as being a proper number for the blowing of the seven trumpets, which would complete all the woes that were to come upon the world."
3. "The trumpet being an alarm, preparing for, proclaiming, and introducing these things."

### John Wesley:
1. "All things mentioned in the epistles are not fully accomplished before the seals are opened; neither are all things mentioned under the seals fulfilled before the trumpets begin; nor yet is the seventh trumpet wholly past before the phials are poured out. Only the beginning of each part goes before the beginning of the following."
2. "The seven angels which stood before God - A character of the highest eminence."
3. "And the angels here made known by these trumpets the wonderful works of God, whereby all opposing powers are successively shaken, till the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of God and his Anointed."
