# Revelation 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prayers of the saints and the trumpets of the angels are intertwined, as illustrated by the interposing presence of the incense. This incense represents not only the prayers of the saints, but also the earnest longings of the angels, desiring the fulfillment of God's holy plan. It is important to note that the angels are not acting as mediators, but rather as companions in servitude alongside the saints.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He, in Revelation, is always designated by one of His proper titles; though, doubtless, He is the only true High Priest, the Angel of the Covenant, standing before the golden altar of incense, and there, as Mediator, offering up His people's prayers, rendered acceptable before God through the incense of His merit."
2. "The angel does not provide the incense; it is given to him by Christ, whose meritorious obedience and death are the incense, rendering the saints' prayers well pleasing to God. It is not the saints who give the angel the incense; nor are their prayers identified with the incense; nor do they offer their prayers to him. Christ alone is the Mediator through whom, and to whom, prayer is to be offered."
3. "The saints' praying on earth, and the angel's incensing in heaven, are simultaneous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design seems to be, to represent the prayers of the saints as ascending in the anticipation of the approaching series of wonders in the world - and there would be a beautiful propriety in representing them as offered by an angel, feeling deep interest in the church, and ministering in behalf of the saints."
2. "There seems reason to suppose that the incense that was offered in the ancient worship was designed to be emblematic of the prayers of saints, for it was the custom for worshippers to be engaged in prayer at the time the incense was offered by the priest."
3. "The idea seems to be, that, at this time, all the saints would unite in calling on God, and in deprecating his wrath."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The officiating priest in the tabernacle or temple took the fire for his censer from the brazen altar, and then offered the incense upon the golden altar."
2. "So that the prayers and the incense might ascend together."
3. "Golden altar. The altar of incense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ’s place, too, as our High Priest, is by the altar."
2. "Much incense is given him that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints, so that the prayers and the incense might ascend together, a memorial before God of the trials and sufferings of His people."
3. "It is clear that both in this verse, and throughout the passage, we are dealing not with any select company of believers, or with martyrs in the ordinary sense of that term, but with the whole Church of Christ conceived of as being in a martyr state."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Another angel. Not one of the seven of verse Revelation 8:2 and before they began to sound the trumpets." 
2. "A golden censer. Old word for frankincense, but here alone in N.T. and for censer, as is plain by the use of χρυσουν (golden) with it." 
3. "Unto the prayers. Dative case. In Revelation 5:18 the θυμιαματα are the prayers."

### John Gill:
1. "The intercession of Christ is meant by 'the incense', which, like that, is sweet and fragrant, very grateful and acceptable to God and also pure and holy."
2. "This may denote the fulness of Christ's intercession, which is for all his elect, called and uncalled, greater or lesser believers, and for all things for them, as their cases be; for conversion, discoveries of pardon, preservation, perseverance, and glorification; and to support this, he has a fulness of merit, which makes his intercession efficacious."
3. "The prayers of the saints, rightly performed, are themselves compared to incense, being very grateful and acceptable to God...and these are spiritual sacrifices, which Christ the high priest presents for the saints, perfumes with the incense of his mediation, and makes acceptable to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The interposing of which shows, that the prayers of the saints and the trumpets of the angels go together." 
2. "Incense generally signifies prayer: here it signifies the longing desires of the angels, that the holy counsel of God might be fulfilled."
3. "The angels are fellowservants with the saints, not mediators for them."
