# Revelation 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar, symbolizing the imminent divine judgments that would be unleashed in response to the prayers of the saints. The hot coals cast upon the earth represent the destruction and calamities that would come upon the world. These thunderings, lightnings, voices, and earthquake are signs of God's impending and fearful judgments that cannot be averted, even in the face of fervent prayers. They serve as a reminder that the righteous desire justice, not personal vengeance, and long for the salvation of all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
