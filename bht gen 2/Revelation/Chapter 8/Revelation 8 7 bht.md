# Revelation 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The storm of hail and fire mentioned in this passage has been associated with the Arian heresy, which caused widespread damage to the churches. Some view this as a symbolic representation of the violent and destructive nature of the heresy. It is believed that this storm affected the entire Roman empire, encompassing the world at that time. Others, however, connect this imagery to the invasion of the Goths, which brought devastation to the empire. These events serve as reminders of the significant historical impact of these judgments, shaping the course of history for the church and the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stones of hail and the balls of fire fell in a shower of blood, just as hail and fireballs commonly fall in a shower of rain."
2. "In blood is life: in the shedding, or in the appearing, of blood, is implied the destruction of life, with which, as a consequence, all these judgments must be accompanied."
3. "Two thirds escape in each case, while one is smitten."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The common feature of the first four trumpets is, the judgments under them affect natural objects, the accessories of life, the earth, trees, grass, the sea, rivers, fountains, the light of the sun, moon, and stars."
2. "Judicial retribution in kind characterizes the inflictions of the first four, those elements which had been abused punishing their abusers."
3. "Here, vice versa, two-thirds escape, one-third is smitten. The fire was the predominant element."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Fame,' says the poet, 'encircling with terror or gloomy wings, proclaimed the march of the barbarian army, and filled Italy with consternation.'"
2. "I do not suppose, indeed, that it is necessary, in order to find a proper fulfillment of the symbol, to be able to show that exactly one-third part of the empire was made desolate in this way; but it is a sufficient fulfillment if desolation spread over a considerable portion of the Roman world - as if a third part had been destroyed."
3. "That the desolations produced by Alaric were such as would be properly represented by this symbol may be fully seen by consulting the whole account of that invasion in Gibbon, ii. 213-266."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The hailstones and fire-balls fell in a shower of blood."
2. "Compare the account of the plague of fire and hail in Egypt... where the Septuagint reads and there was hail and the fire flaming in the hail."
3. "And the third part of the earth was burnt up. This is added by the best texts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The judgments of the Almighty upon Egypt, vindicating His own glory and effecting the deliverance of His people, became types of the manner in which the same great ends shall be effected in every age of the Churchâ€™s history."
2. "It seems unwise to attempt to connect particular judgments, such as wars or pestilences or the incursions of barbarians or the demolition of cities, with the special things mentioned as objects of terror either in this or the following visions."
3. "The figure, as belonging to the third part of the earth, would indeed prove quite incongruous if we did, for the trees would necessarily perish when that portion of its surface was destroyed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first four trumpets are very much like the plagues in Egypt, this one like a semitropical thunderstorm."
2. "The storm flung itself on the earth."
3. "Repeated here three times for dramatic effect."

### John Gill:
1. "Some have thought the Arian heresy is here intended, which may well enough agree with the time; and which may be compared to 'hail', for the mischief it did to the vines, the churches; and because of the violence with which it came..."
2. "this storm fell upon 'the earth'; the whole Roman empire; for even all the world was once said to be Arian..."
3. "but rather this trumpet regards not the church, but the empire; and this storm of hail, fire, and blood, designs the irruption of the Goths into it..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Even under Trajan, in the year 114, the Jews made an insurrection with a most dreadful fury; and in the parts about Cyrene, in Egypt, and in Cyprus, destroyed four hundred and sixty thousand persons."
2. "The alarm spread itself also into Mesopotamia, where Lucius Quintius slew a great number of them."
3. "Fifty well-fortified cities, and nine hundred and eighty-five well-inhabited towns of the Jews, were wholly destroyed in this war."
