# Revelation 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blazing mass resembling a mountain signifies a strong and mighty kingdom, not meant to be taken as a literal mountain. It represents a nation burning with the desire for conquest. The mention of the sea suggests a connection to regions beyond, possibly associated with commerce. This portrayal could refer to the formidable Roman Empire, known for its strength and built on seven mountains. Alternately, it may symbolize a heresy opposing the divine nature of the Holy Spirit. Whichever interpretation is applied, it is crucial to contextualize this vivid imagery within the broader narrative of the Bible.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the language (hardly in the sense) there seems to be a reminiscence of Jeremiah 28:25, δώσω σε ὡς ὄρος ἐμπεπυρισμένον."
2. "The non-consequence of the result of the fiery mass falling into the sea is again represented to us that in the infliction of this plague from above, the instrument of it is merely described as it appeared, not as it really was."
3. "We may remark, at the end of this second trumpet, that the judgments inflicted by these first two are distinctly those which in ch. Rev 7:3 were held back until the servants of God were sealed: μὴ ἀδικήσητε τὴν γῆν μήτε τὴν θάλασσαν μήτε τὰ δένδρα, ἄχρι σφραγίσωμεν κ. τ. λ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "as it were—not literally a mountain: a mountain-like burning mass."
2. "The overthrow of Jericho, the type of the Antichristian Babylon, after which Israel, under Joshua (the same name as Jesus), victoriously took possession of Canaan, the type of Christ's and His people's kingdom, is perhaps alluded to in the SEVEN trumpets, which end in the overthrow of all Christ's foes, and the setting up of His kingdom." 
3. "A mountain-like fiery mass would not naturally change water into blood; nor would the third part of ships be thereby destroyed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A mountain is a natural symbol of strength, and hence becomes a symbol of a strong and powerful kingdom" 
2. "The symbol employed here would denote some fiery, impetuous, destructive power. If used to denote a nation, it would be a nation that was, as it were, burning with the desire of conquest" 
3. "It is undoubtedly required in the application of this, that we should find its fulfillment in some country lying beyond the sea, or in some seacoast or maritime country, or in reference to commerce."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. As it were [ως] . Not a mountain, but a fiery mass so large as to resemble one. Blood. Reminding of the first plague in Egypt (Exodus 7:20, Exodus 7:21).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As if," not a great mountain, but a blazing mass as large as a mountain.
2. Somewhat like Enoch 18:13, but perhaps with the picture of a great volcanic eruption like that of Vesuvius in A.D. 79.
3. Like the Nile in the first plague (Exodus 7:20). Cf. also Revelation 16:3.

### John Gill:
1. "Called a 'mountain' from his height of pride, a great one from his might and power, and a 'burning' one from his great wrath and malice against Christ, his Gospel, and his people."
2. "But rather some heresy, and, as some have thought, the Macedonian heresy, which was levelled against the deity of the Holy Spirit, as was the Arian heresy against the deity of the Son."
3. "Rome is very fitly represented by a great mountain, as kingdoms and cities sometimes are; seeing it was built on seven mountains; and its being taken and burnt by Alaricus is aptly expressed by a burning mountain

### John Wesley:
1. "By the sea, particularly as it is here opposed to the earth, we may understand the west, or Europe; and chiefly the middle parts of it, the vast Roman empire."
2. "A mountain here seems to signify a great force and multitude of people."
3. "The fire may mean the fire of war, and the rage of those savage nations."
