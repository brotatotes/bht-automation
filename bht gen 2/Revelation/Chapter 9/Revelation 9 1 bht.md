# Revelation 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter a fallen star, which is understood to be Satan, symbolizing his expulsion from heaven and his subsequent state. The star is given the key to the bottomless pit, also known as the abyss, which serves as the dwelling place for Satan and his demons. The concept of the abyss is depicted as a deep and locked well-shaft, representing the depths of darkness and wickedness. This imagery prompts us to contemplate the stark contrast between the purity of heaven and the fallen nature of Satan.
