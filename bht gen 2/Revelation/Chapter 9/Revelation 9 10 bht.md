# Revelation 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The locusts that appeared to John were remarkable because while the locusts themselves do not have a sting, they had tails like scorpions, not resembling the tail of a scorpion but truly like scorpions themselves. These tails, resembling the tails of venomous creatures, symbolize the power and authority to hurt and injure. The locusts, whose power was to hurt men for a period of five prophetic months, represent a prolonged period of calamity lasting for seventy-nine common years, causing distress and doing wrong to those who were not sealed by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "tails like unto scorpions—like unto the tails of scorpions."
2. "and there were stings—There is no oldest manuscript for this reading. A, B, Aleph, Syriac, and Coptic read, 'and (they have) stings: and in their tails (is) their power (literally, 'authority': authorized power) to hurt.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This made the locusts which appeared to John the more remarkable, for though the fancy may imagine a resemblance between the tail of a locust and a scorpion, yet the locusts have properly no sting."
2. "The only thing which they have resembling a sting is a hard bony subsubstance like a needle, with which the female punctures the bark and wood of trees in order to deposit her eggs."
3. "The word used here - ἀδικῆσαι adikēsai, rendered 'to hurt' - is different from the word in Revelation 9:5 - βασανισθῶσιν basanisthōsin, rendered 'should be tormented.' This word properly means 'to do wrong, to do unjustly, to injure, to hurt'; and the two words would seem to convey the idea that they would produce distress by doing wrong to others, or by deeding unjustly with them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Tails (ουρας). Old word, in N.T. only in Revelation 9:10; Revelation 9:19; Revelation 12:4."
2. "Like unto scorpions (ομοιας σκορπιοις). Aleph A wrongly have ομοιοις (agreeing with σκορπιοις instead of with ουρας). It is a condensed idiom for 'like unto the tails of the scorpions' as we have it in Revelation 13:11 (cf. Matthew 5:20; 1 John 2:2)."
3. "Stings (κεντρα). Old word from κεντρεω (to prick, to sting), in N.T. only here, Acts 26:14 (about Paul); 1 Corinthians 15:55 (about death)."

### John Gill:
1. "Locusts are said to have the tail of a serpent, and of the vipers of the earth." 
2. "The tail... with which both Mahomet, who set himself up for a prophet, and the Romish clergy, who set up their decrees and unwritten traditions above the word of God, have poisoned and destroyed multitudes of souls."
3. "Their power [was] to hurt men five months."

### John Wesley:
1. "And they have tails like scorpions — That is, each tail is like a scorpion, not like the tail of a scorpion."
2. "To hurt the unsealed men five months  -  Five prophetic months; that is, seventy-nine common years."
3. "So long did these calamities last."
