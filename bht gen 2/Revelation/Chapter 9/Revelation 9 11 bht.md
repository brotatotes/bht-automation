In this passage, it is mentioned that the ones being discussed have a king who governs them. This king is known as Abaddon or Apollyon, which both signify a destroyer.

The interpretations put forth suggest that this king represents figures like Mahomet, who led the Saracens and Turks in acts of destruction, or even the pope of Rome, leading many towards perdition. The passage ultimately portrays a forceful ruler whose presence brings about devastation.
