# Revelation 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One woe has already passed, but there are still two more to come after these events. The first woe referred to the downfall of the Persian power, which cleared the path for the two imminent woes. At the time the first woe ended, Mahomet was twenty years old and the Christians were deeply divided among themselves. Therefore, as soon as the first woe ended, the second and third quickly followed, with all three being closely intertwined in their occurrence.
