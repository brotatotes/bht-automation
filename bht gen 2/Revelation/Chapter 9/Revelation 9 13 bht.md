2. "God's revelation, though in its aspects fourfold, still has but one and the same voice."
3. "I prefer understanding this cry from the four corners of the altar to refer to the saints' prayerful cry from the four quarters of the world, incensed by the angel, and ascending to God from the golden altar of incense, and bringing down in consequence fiery judgments."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The temple in its arrangements was designed, undoubtedly, to be in important respects a symbol of heaven, and this idea constantly occurs in the Scriptures."
2. "This altar, made of shittim or acacia wood, was ornamented at the four corners, and overlaid throughout with laminae of gold. Hence, it was called 'the golden altar,' in contradistinction from the altar for sacrifice, which was made of stone."
3. "When it is said that this was 'before God,' the meaning is, that it was directly before or in front of the symbol of the divine presence in the most holy place."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A voice (φωνην μιαν). For μιαν as indefinite article see Revelation 8:13."
2. "Accusative case here after ηκουσα, though genitive in Revelation 8:13, a distinction between sound and sense sometimes exists (Acts 9:7; Acts 22:9), but not here as the words are clearly heard in both instances."
3. "Note triple use of the genitive article here as of the accusative article with this identical phrase in Revelation 8:3 ('the altar the golden the one before the throne')."

2. "Its form was foursquare, as is the city of the new Jerusalem, and shows that Christ's intercession avails for all his people in the four parts of the world."
3. "This altar is said to be 'before God', in a visionary way, as the altar of incense was before the vail, and the mercy seat, and by the ark of the testimony, Exodus 30:1; suggesting that Christ continually appears in the presence of God for all the saints."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the sixth angel sounded — Under this angel goes forth the second woe."
2. "I heard a voice from the four corners of the golden altar — This golden altar is the heavenly pattern of the Levitical altar of incense."
