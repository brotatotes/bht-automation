# Revelation 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The four angels mentioned here were previously bound, indicating that they were evil angels. The reason and duration of their bondage remains unknown. However, now they are commanded to be released in order to carry out their destructive work, spreading chaos in every direction. This serves as a reminder that evil forces can be restrained by divine power until the appointed time for their release.
