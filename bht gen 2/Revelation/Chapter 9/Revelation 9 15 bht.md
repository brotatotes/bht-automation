# Revelation 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The appointed hour has arrived, and the angels are released with great power and fury to fulfill their commission. They were held in readiness by God, patiently waiting for this moment. This appointed hour falls on a specific day, month, and year, determined by God. Their purpose is to bring about extensive destruction, killing a vast number of people. The angels' rampage is compared to the historical events of the Saracens and the Ottomans, who conquered and destroyed regions for decades, leaving devastation in their wake. This period of time symbolizes the gradual rise and expansion of their dominion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Greek article (teen), put once only before all the periods, implies that the hour in the day, and the day in the month, and the month in the year, and the year itself, had been definitely fixed by God."
2. "The article would have been omitted had a sum-total of periods been specified, namely, three hundred ninety-one years and one month (the period from A.D. 1281, when the Turks first conquered the Christians, to 1672, their last conquest of them, since which last date their empire has declined)."
3. "The third part - namely, of earthy men, as distinguished from God's sealed people."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The loosening of the angels was, in fact, also a letting loose of all these hosts, that they might accomplish the work which they were commissioned to do."
2. "The word used here properly refers to what is made ready, suited up, arranged for anything: as persons prepared for a journey, horses for battle, a road for travelers, food for the hungry, a house to live in, etc."
