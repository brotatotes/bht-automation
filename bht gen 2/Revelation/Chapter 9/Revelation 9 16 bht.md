# Revelation 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A mighty army of skilled horsemen, led by powerful generals, is depicted. These horsemen are described as dextrous, skilled at leaping on and off. The number of this army is staggering, reaching two hundred thousand thousand or two myriads of myriads. Its immense scale is almost infinite and incredible. This portrayal draws parallels to historical battles where vast armies with hundreds of thousands of men were assembled. Through these words, we catch a glimpse of the strength and magnitude of the spiritual realm, where infernal hosts work in accordance with God's will.
