# Revelation 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The imagery in the passage vividly depicts the warriors and their horses, adorned with breastplates that appeared as if they were aflame and had the color of hyacinth and brimstone. These descriptions serve to convey the strength and fearlessness of the riders, reminiscent of David's mighty heroes in battle. It is worth noting that the language used by the writer to describe what they saw in the vision is metaphorical and not meant to be taken literally. The intention is to portray a sense of awe-inspiring power rather than literal fire and brimstone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fiery color of the breastplates answering to the fire which issued out of their mouths."
2. "Their dark, dull-colored breastplates correspond to the smoke out of their mouths."
3. "Sulphur-colored: answering to the brimstone or sulphur out of their mouths."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'fire' here simply denotes red. It was burnished and bright, and seemed to be a blaze of fire."
2. "It will be necessary to look for the fulfillment of this in cavalry that was so caparisoned."
3. "All this seemed to issue from their mouths - that is, it was breathed forth in front of the host, as if the horses emitted it from their mouths."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of jacinth [υακινθινους] . Uakinqov hyacinth is the name of a flower and also of a precious stone. The noun occurs only Revelation 21:20, and the adjective only here."
2. "As a stone, it is identified by some with the sapphire. As to color, the hyacinth of the Greeks seems to have comprehended the iris, gladiolus, and larkspur."
3. "The magnificent description in Joh 39:19 - 25 applies to the war - horse. He is distinguished not so much for his speed and utility as for his strength (see Psalms 33:17; Psalms 147:10), and the word abbir strong is used as an equivalent for a horse (Jeremiah 8:16; Jeremiah 47:3)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Breastplates as of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone...these three adjectives which are only metaphors." 
2. "Πυρινος is an old adjective (from πυρ, fire), here only in N.T. Hυακινθος is also an old word (from υακινθος, hyacinth, then of a sapphire stone Revelation 21:20), of a red color bordering on black, here only in the N.T. Θειωδης is a late word (from θειον, brimstone), sulphurous, here only in N.T." 
3. "These horses likewise have 'fire and smoke and brimstone' (θειον, brimstone, is old word, in N.T. only in Rev. and Luke 17:29) proceeding (εκπορευετα, singular because it comes first and the subjects afterwards) out of their mouths. Both rider and horse are terrible."

### John Gill:
1. "having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth and brimstone; which may be understood either literally of their external breastplates, which being of polished iron, according to the custom of these people, looked at a distance like sparkling fire, and seemed to be of the colour of hyacinth, or of a sky colour, and appeared as flaming sulphur"
2. "this designs not so much the strength, boldness, and intrepidity of their horses, which are warlike creatures, and very undaunted in battle, as of the men that sat upon them, who were like David's heroes and warriors"
3. "nor could it well appear to John to be otherwise, who could never have seen a gun, and one fired off in his life; nor could he well represent to others what he saw in vision, than in this manner."
