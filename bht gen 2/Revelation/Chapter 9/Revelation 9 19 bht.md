# Revelation 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many interpreters understand the horsemen mentioned as the myriads of Turkish cavalry, known for their invincible courage and use of gunpowder and artillery. The horsemen's scarlet, blue, and yellow attire symbolize their military might. The fire and brimstone coming out of their mouths represent the introduction of gunpowder and artillery. The tails of the horses, resembling serpents with heads, may signify the false doctrines spread by the false prophet, causing harm to both bodies and souls. This passage depicts the devastating impact of physical and spiritual forces, accentuating the destructive nature of war and false teachings.
