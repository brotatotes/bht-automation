# Revelation 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The smoke, likened to a great furnace, represents a dense and dark vapor arising from the under-world, obstructing the view of the sun and enveloping the air in darkness, a characteristic of Satan's kingdom. It could also symbolize the false doctrine and worship perpetrated by the Romish antichrist, obscuring the light of Christ's righteousness. This smoke, associated with the Persian locusts and their idolatrous zeal, signifies the affliction and darkness that befell the Jews in Persia.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The common image of the place of punishment, in the Scriptures, is that of a 'lake that burns with fire and brimstone.'"
2. "The purpose of this is, probably, to indicate the origin of the plague that was about to come upon the world. It would be of such a character that it would appear as if it had been emitted from hell; as if the inmates of that dark world had broke loose upon the earth."
3. "The meaning here is, that an effect would be produced as if a dense and dark vapor should ascend from the under-world."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Gill:
1. "He made use of his universal power over all bishops and churches, enacted laws, issued out decrees, made articles of faith, and imposed them on men's consciences, and obliged all to submit to his hellish principles and practices."
2. "False doctrine, and superstitious worship, which sprung from the decrees of popes and councils, and the Alcoran of Mahomet."

### John Wesley:

2. "As the smoke of a great furnace — where the clouds of it rise thicker and thicker, spread far and wide, and press one upon another, so that the darkness increases continually."
