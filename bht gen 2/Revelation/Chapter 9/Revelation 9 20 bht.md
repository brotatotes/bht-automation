# Revelation 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite the plagues and destruction, the western antichristian party did not change their ways, remaining unrepentant in their idolatrous worship. The idols they created and worshiped were a form of idolatry or works, representing their devotion to demons. These idols were not able to see, hear, or walk, yet the people continued to worship them, ignoring the call to turn away from their evil practices.
