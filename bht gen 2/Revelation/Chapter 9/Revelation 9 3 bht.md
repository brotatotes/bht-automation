# Revelation 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage describes a terrifying scene where smoke rises and out of it emerge destructive locusts. These locusts symbolize a hostile and numerous people who bring great harm. They can be compared to the Persians who inflicted immense suffering on the Jews during the sixth century. These locusts are described as the scorpions of the earth, the most harmful kind, while the scorpions of the air have wings. This imagery emphasizes the devastating power and relentless nature of the enemy.
