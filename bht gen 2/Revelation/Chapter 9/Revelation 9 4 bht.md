# Revelation 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The locusts were supernaturally restrained from causing harm to grass, green things, and trees, as commanded by the power of God. It was not the entire class of men that the locusts were prohibited from hurting, but specifically those who had been sealed. While the primary targets of the locust plague were the unbelieving Israelites, there were also many Christians who suffered alongside them. The locust plague serves as a reminder of God's protection over His faithful followers.
