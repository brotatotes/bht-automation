# Revelation 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The locust plague fulfilled prophecy by tormenting rather than killing the people. The duration of the torment, symbolized by five months, represented a limited and broken time. The pain inflicted by the locusts was compared to the sting of a scorpion, causing great distress and affliction. The locusts served as a form of punishment, imprisoning and tormenting the people, rather than outright killing them. This fulfilled the prophecy of the locust plague being a time of torment rather than death.
