# Revelation 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the passage, we see the depiction of a condition where people are in such immense distress that they fervently long for death as a means of escape. Their suffering is so intense that they anxiously await the moment when they can be relieved from their pain. Yet, despite their desperate yearning, death remains elusive, highlighting the fact that the torment they experience cannot be alleviated by physical death alone. This serves as a reminder of the severity of their affliction and the futility of seeking solace solely in death.
