# Revelation 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These verses depict a formidable and deceptive force, resembling horses and locusts. The likenesses between horses and locusts emphasize their strength and agility in battle, possibly symbolizing the Saracens who rapidly conquered through force. The faces of these beings, resembling humans, suggest a friendly and concerned facade used to deceive others. This portrayal reflects a people possessing a mix of civilization and savagery, like the Persians of that time, who were known for their horsemanship. The description highlights the deceptive nature of this force, embodying both power and cunning.
