# Revelation 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These locusts were unlike any other army, having long hair like women instead of the customary appearance of warriors. In fact, there was even a proverb comparing the antennae of locusts to the hair of girls. These locusts also had teeth like lions, a fierce and ravenous characteristic that brought terror and desolation, similar to the lions of the desert. Their appearance and behavior were truly extraordinary and remarkable, causing devastation wherever they went, much like the Saracens and the Roman clergy who pillaged and destroyed in their wake.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "An Arabic proverb compares the antlers of locusts to the hair of girls."
2. "Ewald understands the allusion to be to the hair on the legs or bodies of the locusts: compare 'rough caterpillars.'"
3. "As the teeth of lions (Joel 1:6, as to locusts)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This struck John as a peculiarity, that, though warriors, they should have the appearance of effeminacy indicated by allowing their hair to grow long."
2. "Though manifestly designed to represent an army, yet it was not the usual appearance of men who went forth to battle."
3. "But it is evident that John means to say that there was much that was unusual and remarkable in the teeth of these locusts. They would be ravenous and fierce, and would spread terror and desolation like the lions of the desert."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Hair of women. The antennae of the locust. There is said to be an Arabic proverb in which the antennae of locusts are compared to girls' hair. Teeth of lions. Compare Joel 1:6.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They had long hair (1 Corinthians 11:15), with no reference to matters of sex at all, for ανθρωπων just before is used, not ανδρων (men as distinct from women)."
2. "Perhaps the antennae of the locust were unusually long."
3. "The locust is voracious."

### John Gill:
1. "They were called Hagarenes, from Hagar, Abraham's handmaid, by whom he had Ishmael, the father of these people; afterwards they took the name of Saracens, from Sarah, the wife of Abraham, whose posterity they would be thought to be."
2. "This may also point at the effeminacy of the western locusts, the monks and friars, who dress more like women than men; and many of them claim the virgin Mary for their patroness; and may in general design the votaries of the church of Rome, who are under the vow of a monastic life."
3. "Which may denote the ravages and devastations of the Saracens in the empire, robbing, pillaging, and destroying all they met with; and is applicable enough to the devouring jaws of the Romish clergy, their plundering the estates of men, their cruelties and barbarities exercised by their Inquisition, &c."

### John Wesley:
1. And they had hair as the hair of women — All the Persians of old gloried in long hair.And their teeth were as the teeth of lions — Breaking and tearing all things in pieces.
