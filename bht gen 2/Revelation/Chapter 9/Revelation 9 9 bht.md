# Revelation 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The locusts in this passage were not just ordinary insects, but mighty warriors equipped with breastplates of iron-like armor. Their presence was overwhelming, as their wings made a deafening noise likened to the sound of chariots rushing into battle. This imagery captures the swift and terrifying incursions of these locusts, as they brought dread and alarm to the nations they invaded.
