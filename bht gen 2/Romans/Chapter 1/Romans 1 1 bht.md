# Romans 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A servant of Jesus Christ, Paul identifies himself as belonging entirely to the Lord and being fully dedicated to His will. This title emphasizes humility and dependence, representing the highest honor. As a called apostle, Paul's designation is not of his own choosing, but a result of being personally selected by Jesus Christ. He is set apart for the purpose of proclaiming the gospel, chosen and consecrated by God for this specific task. The gospel itself is of divine origin, originating from God and centering on the person of Jesus Christ. It is a message of grace and salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression answers to the Hebr. ◊¢÷∂◊ë÷∂◊ì ◊ô÷∞◊î◊ï÷π◊î, the especial O. T. title of Israel, and of individuals, as Moses, Joshua, David, Daniel, Job, and others, who as prophets, kings, &c., were raised up for the express work of God."
2. "In naming himself a servant of Jesus Christ, he bespeaks their attention as a Christian speaking to Christians: he now further specifies the place which he held by the special calling of God: called, and that to the very highest office, of an apostle; and even more among the Apostles, not one by original selection, but one specially called."
3. "The genitive is not, as in œÑ·Ω∏ Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒ±œÇ, Matthew 4:23, one of apposition, but of possession or origin; God‚Äôs Gospel...Thus in the very beginning of the Epistle, these two short words announce that the Gospel is of God, in other words, that salvation is of grace only."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a servant of Jesus Christ‚ÄîThe word here rendered 'servant' means 'bond-servant,' or one subject to the will and wholly at the disposal of another...expressing such absolute subjection and devotion to the Lord Jesus as they would never have yielded to a mere creature." 
2. "called to be an apostle‚Äîwhen first he 'saw the Lord'; the indispensable qualification for apostleship."
3. "separated unto the preaching of the gospel‚Äîneither so late as when 'the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul' nor so early as when 'separated from his mother's womb'. He was called at one and the same time to the faith and the apostleship of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ancient custom was to begin an epistle with the name of the writer, as Cicero to Varro, etc. We record the name at the end."
2. "The apostle uses it here evidently to denote his acknowledging Jesus Christ as his master; as indicating his dignity, as especially appointed by him to his great work; and as showing that in this Epistle he intended to assume no authority of his own, but simply to declare the will of his master, and theirs."
3. "It was of consequence for him therefore, to affirm that he had not taken this high office to himself, but that he had been called to it by the authority of Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The practice of adopting Gentile names may be traced through all the periods of Hebrew history."
2. "The Roman name is stereotyped at the moment when he converts the Roman governor."
3. "The word involves the ideas of belonging to a master, and of service as a slave. The former is emphasized in Paul's use of the term, since Christian service, in his view, has no element of servility, but is the expression of love and of free choice."

### John Calvin:
1. "They who think that the Apostle attained this name as a trophy for having brought Sergius, the proconsul, to the faith of Christ, are confuted by the testimony of Luke, who shows that he was so called before that time."
2. "A servant of Jesus Christ, etc. ‚Äî He signalizes himself with these distinctions for the purpose of securing more authority to his doctrine; and this he seeks to secure by two things ‚Äî first, by asserting his call to the Apostleship; and secondly, by showing that his call was not unconnected with the Church of Rome."
3. "But the choosing for the gospel, etc., which he afterwards mentions, expresses the end as well as the use of the Apostleship; for he intended briefly to show for what purpose he was called to that function."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'servant' here means 'bondman,' expressing the fact that Paul personally belonged to Jesus Christ, rather than the idea of service in His behalf...This term of humility and dependence is the most honorable of all titles."
2. "Called to be an Apostle...Paul was not one of the Twelve, but represented the independent apostolate of the Gentiles...As preachers and missionaries the Apostles must have successors, but as inspired and authoritative witnesses for Christ, called directly by him for the whole world, they have none."
3. "Set apart...Paul was selected from the world, singled out, consecrated to, and destined for the gospel service."
4. "Unto the gospel of God...The gospel is 'of God,' having Him as its author; it is about Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Epistle is put first in the MSS. because it is the most important of Paul's Epistles."
2. "Paul is a spiritual Pharisee (etymologically), separated not to the oral tradition, but to God's gospel, a chosen vessel."
3. "Many of Paul's characteristic words like ŒµœÖŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒπŒøŒΩ have been already discussed in the previous Epistles that will call for little comment from now on."

### John Gill:
1. "A servant of Jesus Christ"; not a servant of sin, nor of Satan, nor of man, nor of Moses and his law, nor of the traditions of the elders, but of Jesus Christ.
2. "called to be an apostle: an apostle was one that was immediately sent by Christ, and had his authority and doctrine directly from him, and had a power of working miracles from him, in confirmation of the truth of his mission, authority, and doctrine."
3. "separated unto the Gospel of God. This may regard either God's eternal purpose concerning him, his preordination of him from eternity to be a preacher of the Gospel, to which he was separated from his mother's womb, Galatians 1:15; or the separation of him to that work made by the order of the Spirit of God, Acts 13:2."

### John Wesley:
1. "Called to be an apostle - And made an apostle by that calling. While God calls, he makes what he calls."
2. "And various other proper and important thoughts are suggested in this short introduction; particularly the prophecies concerning the gospel, the descent of Jesus from David, the great doctrines of his Godhead and resurrection, the sending the gospel to the Gentiles, the privileges of Christians, and the obedience and holiness to which they were obliged in virtue of their profession."
3. "Separated - By God, not only from the bulk of other men, from other Jews, from other disciples, but even from other Christian teachers, to be a peculiar instrument of God in spreading the gospel."
