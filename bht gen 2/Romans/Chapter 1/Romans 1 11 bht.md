# Romans 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul expresses his earnest desire to personally meet the recipients of his letter in order to share with them not just any supernatural gift, but rather some spiritual gift. This gift, bestowed by God, would serve to strengthen and confirm their faith. The purpose of this impartation was not just to instruct them in doctrine, but also to edify their Christian character. Paul understood the importance of mutual assistance and the sharing of spiritual gifts among believers, as it affirms the testimony of Christ and helps establish their faith on a firm foundation.
