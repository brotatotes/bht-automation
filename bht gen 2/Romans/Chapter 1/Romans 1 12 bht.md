# Romans 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's desire is to encourage and strengthen the believers, not to dominate over their faith. He wants to instruct and benefit them, and hopes that their mutual faith and fellowship will bring comfort to one another. This demonstrates the nature of Christianity, which seeks the company of fellow believers. Paul recognized the value that each individual brings to the body of Christ, regardless of their position or status. The apostolic style is in stark contrast to the prideful hierarchy of certain institutions.
