# Romans 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle affectionately addresses the Roman believers as his brethren, highlighting their spiritual connection and his deep care for them. His desire to visit them was not a fleeting thought, but a long-standing resolution. Although hindered thus far, whether due to circumstances, opposition, or the leading of the Spirit, his purpose was to bear fruit through his ministry among them, just as he had already experienced with many other churches he had established and nurtured. This fruit was not about personal gain, but the conversion of sinners, the growth of believers, and the manifestation of grace in their lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "his φιλοτιμία to preach the gospel where it had not been preached before, rather than on the foundation of others."
2. "Not, ‘wages,’ or ‘result of my apostolic labour,’ but fruit borne by you who have been planted to bring forth fruit to God."
3. "This fruit I should then gather and present to God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, but was let—hindered."
2. "hitherto—chiefly by his desire to go first to places where Christ was not known"
3. "that I might have some fruit—of my ministry among you also, even as among other Gentiles"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact, however, that he had done it, showed his strong desire to see them, and to witness the displays of the grace of God in the capital of the Roman world."
2. "A forger of these books would not have thought of such a contrivance as to feign such a purpose to go to Rome at that time, and to have mentioned it in that manner."
3. "It was not curiosity to see the splendid capital of the world that prompted this desire; it was not the love of travel, and of roaming from clime to clime; it was the specific purpose of doing good to the souls of human beings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I would not have you ignorant. An emphatic expression calling special attention to what follows."
2. "Have some fruit. A metaphorical statement of what is stated literally in ver. 11. Not equivalent to bear fruit, but to gather as a harvest."
3. "Fruit is a favorite metaphor with Paul. He uses it in both a good and a bad sense."

### John Calvin:
1. "We hence learn that the Lord frequently upsets the purposes of his saints, in order to humble them, and by such humiliation to teach them to regard his Providence, that they may rely on it."
2. "Thus the hinderances of the godly and of the unbelieving differ: the latter perceive only that they are hindered, when they are restrained by the strong hand of the Lord, so as not to be able to move; but the former are satisfied with an hinderance that arises from some approved reason; nor do they allow themselves to attempt any thing beyond their duty, or contrary to edification."
3. "For the godly have nothing more as their own than the work of promoting the glory of the Lord, with which is connected all their happiness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The progress of thought is natural. Paul had expressed his prayerful longing to see them, he now tells them that this longing had not been inactive; it had frequently led to a definite purpose to visit them."
2. "The figure is quite common. The ‘fruit’ is the harvest to be gathered and presented to God. Hence it is not Paul’s reward, or the result of his labor merely, but the good works produced among the Roman Christians, as fruit unto God."
3. "The literal sense would emphasize the internal character of the fruit-bearing; but ‘among,’ which is a frequent sense of the preposition, is, on the whole, to be preferred."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Oftentimes I purposed...to propose to myself."
2. "And was hindered."
3. "That I might have some fruit."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle calls them brethren, because many of them were Jews, his brethren and kinsmen according to the flesh, and all of them were his brethren in a spiritual relation; and this he does to express his affection to them."
2. "It was not a sudden start of mind, or a desire that lately arose up in him, but a settled resolution and determination, and which he had often made."
3. "By fruit he means, not any reward of his labour, either temporal or eternal; but the conversion of sinners, the edification of saints, and the fruitfulness of believers in grace and works."

### John Wesley:
1. "Brethren — A frequent, holy, simple, sweet, and yet grand, appellation."
2. "Though I have been hindered hitherto - Either by business, see Romans 15:22; or persecution, 1 Thessalonians 2:2; or the Spirit, Acts 16:7."
3. "That I might have some fruit — Of my ministerial labours. Even as I have already had from the many churches I have planted and watered among the other gentiles."
