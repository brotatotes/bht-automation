# Romans 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul recognizes that as an apostle, he has a responsibility to share the gospel with all people, regardless of their nationality or culture. This obligation extends to both the educated and the less educated, as well as to both Greeks and non-Greeks. He does not consider himself superior or arrogant in this matter, but rather acknowledges that his role is divinely appointed, and he must faithfully fulfill this debt by proclaiming the good news to everyone.
