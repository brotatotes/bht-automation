1. "He concludes what he had before said of his desire — that as he knew it to be his duty to spread the gospel among them, in order to gather fruit for the Lord, he was anxious to fulfill God’s calling, as far as he was allowed to do so by the Lord." 
2. "τὸ κατ ἐμὲ πρόθυμον, literally, 'As to me there is readiness;' or, according to [Stuart ], 'There is a readiness so far as it respects me.' But, 'I am ready,' or 'I am prepared,' conveys the meaning sufficiently, without the other words, 'As much as in me is.'"

The very same power is required to make men missionaries as to make them martyrs."
