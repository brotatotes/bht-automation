# Romans 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the righteousness of God is revealed, representing both His justice and mercy. It is a divine righteousness that can only be obtained through faith. This righteousness is not something that could be attained through human effort or by following the law, but is made known through the gospel. It is through faith that one can find true life and experience a righteousness that comes from God alone.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The Greek Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ . and the Heb. ◊¶÷∞◊ì÷∏◊ß÷∏◊î are taken sometimes for ‚Äòvirtue‚Äô and ‚Äòpiety‚Äô which men possess or strive after, sometimes imputatively, for ‚Äòfreedom from blame‚Äô or ‚Äòjustification,‚Äô"
2. "To say, with Jowett, that all attempts to define Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÇ . Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶ are 'the after-thoughts of theology, which have no real place in the interpretation of Scripture,' is in fact to shut our eyes to the great doctrinal facts of Christianity, and float off at once into uncertainty about the very foundations of the Apostle‚Äôs argument and our own faith."
3. "·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫Œ±ŒªœçœÄœÑŒµœÑŒ±Œπ ] generally used of making known a thing hitherto concealed: but here of that gradually more complete realization of the state of justification before God by faith in Christ, which is the continuing and increasing gift of God to the believer in the Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The just shall live by faith‚ÄîThis golden maxim of the Old Testament is thrice quoted in the New Testament ... showing that the gospel way of 'LIFE BY FAITH,' so far from disturbing, only continued and developed the ancient method."
3. "While Christ is to be regarded as the ordained Channel of all grace from God to men, let none imagine that His proper divinity is in any respect compromised by this arrangement."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is not perhaps a more important passage in the Bible than this verse; or one more difficult to be understood."
2. "The phrase 'righteousness of God' is equivalent to God's 'plan of justifying people; his scheme of declaring them just in the sight of the Law; or of acquitting them from punishment, and admitting them to favor.'"
3. "The gospel states the fact that God has such a plan of justification; and shows the way or manner in which it might be done. The fact seems to have been understood by Abraham, and the patriarchs Hebrews 11:0, but the full mode or manner in which it was to be accomplished, was not revealed until it was done in the gospel of Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Righteousness is by faith."
2. "The Greek divinity is only the Greek man exaggerated in his virtues and vices alike."
3. "Righteousness is character, and the norm of character is likeness to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if we seek salvation, that is, life with God, righteousness must be first sought, by which being reconciled to him, we may, through him being propitious to us, obtain that life which consists only in his favor."
2. "Thus he reasons from the cause to the effect. Notice further, how extraordinary and valuable a treasure does God bestow on us through the gospel, even the communication of his own righteousness."
3. "Faith alone is that which secures the perpetuity of life; and whence is this, except that it leads us to God, and makes our life depend on him?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The gospel is the power of God unto salvation... it brings to sinful men righteousness which comes from God, given freely by Him, so that they are accounted righteous (and made righteous because He so accounts them); and this, not by any impossible way." 
2. "Faith... includes knowledge and belief, assent and surrender, appropriation and application; and hence cannot be limited to a purely intellectual credence."
3. "The man who is declared righteous lives by faith (or, the man who is righteous by faith lives)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A righteousness of God...one that each must have and can obtain in no other way save 'from faith unto faith.'" 
2. "It is a revelation from God, this God kind of righteousness, that man unaided could never have conceived or still less attained."
3. "Paul claims that in the gospel, taught by Jesus and by himself, there is revealed a God kind of righteousness with two ideas in it (the righteousness that God has and that he bestows)."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the righteousness of God', is not meant the essential righteousness of God, the rectitude of his nature, his righteousness in fulfilling his promises, and his punitive justice, which though revealed in the Gospel, yet not peculiar to it."
2. "This righteousness is not known by the light of nature, nor by the law of Moses; it was hid under the shadows of the ceremonial law, and is brought to light only by the Gospel."
3. "The just shall live by faith: 'a just', or righteous man is, not everyone who thinks himself, or is thought by others to be so; nor are any so by their obedience to the law of works; but he is one that is made righteous by the righteousness of Christ imputed to him."
