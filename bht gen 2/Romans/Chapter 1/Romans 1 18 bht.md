# Romans 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For there is no other way of obtaining life and salvation except through the revelation of God's wrath against sin, which is not only manifested in divine providence but also in the sacred oracles and through the messengers of God. This wrath is directed against all forms of ungodliness and unrighteousness, specifically addressing the gentiles and their wise but misguided ways.
