# Romans 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The truth of God's existence and glory is evident through His creation. All people have the ability to know and perceive this truth, as it is revealed by God Himself. Even though some may suppress this knowledge due to their own sinful nature, God's wrath is revealed against those who reject the truth. The knowledge of God is not limited to a select few, but is made known through the internal light that God has given to every person.
