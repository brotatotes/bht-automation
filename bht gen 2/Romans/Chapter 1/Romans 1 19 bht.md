# Romans 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's revelation of Himself through creation and the inner conscience of humanity provides knowledge of His existence and basic attributes. While some aspects of God, such as the Trinity and the redemptive work of Christ, require special revelation, other truths can be known through nature and general human understanding. This knowledge of God is made manifest to all people, serving as a witness of His existence and calling humanity to acknowledge and honor Him.
