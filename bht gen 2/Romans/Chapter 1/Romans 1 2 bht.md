# Romans 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel is not a new invention but a fulfillment of God's promises in the Old Testament. The prophets proclaimed the Gospel beforehand, and their writings serve as the foundation for the Christian faith. This Gospel was not a novel doctrine but one that God had ordained before the world began. Its truthfulness is confirmed by the fact that God had promised it long ago. Though it is a new message in terms of its fulfillment in Christ, it is rooted in the ancient promises of God. The Gospel, therefore, carries the weight of divine authority and credibility.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This good tidings is no new invention, no after-thought, but was long ago announced in what God’s prophets wrote concerning His Son: and announced by way of promise, so that God stood pledged to its realization."
2. "The expression used is defined enough by the adjective, to be well understood without the article; so πνεῦμα ἁγιως below, πν. ἅγιον passim."
3. "This expression (εὐαγγ. ὃ προεπηγγ.) is used in the strictest sense. Moses gave the Law: the prophets proclaimed the Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
2. "They are here reminded that in embracing Christ they had not cast off, but only the more profoundly yielded themselves to, Moses and the prophets."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle here declares that he was not about to advance anything new. His doctrines were in accordance with the acknowledged oracles of God."
2. "He wished to show them, and the remainder of his countrymen, that the Christian religion was built on the foundation of their prophets, and their acknowledged writings."
3. "If these things were promised - predicted in the Old Testament, then Christianity is true. Every passage which he adduces is therefore proof that it is from God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb ejpaggellomai; means more than to proclaim. It occurs frequently, and always in the sense of profess or promise."
2. "Prophets. Not limited to the prophets proper, but including all who, in the Old Testament, have prophesied the Gospel - Moses, David, etc. Compare Hebrews 1:1."
3. "In the holy scriptures [εν γραφαις αγιαις] . Or, more strictly, in holy writings. The scriptures would require the article. See on John 5:47; John 2:22. Here again the absence of the article denotes the qualitative character of the phrase - books which are holy as conveying God 's revelations."

### John Calvin:
1. "As the suspicion of being new subtracts much from the authority of a doctrine, he confirms the faith of the gospel by antiquity."
2. "Christ came not on the earth unexpectedly, nor did he introduce a doctrine of a new kind and not heard of before... he, and his gospel too, had been promised and expected from the beginning of the world."
3. "He in the third place adds, that their testimonies were duly recorded, that is, in the Holy Scriptures."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It must be God’s gospel, for He had already promised it, and this thought would have force with the Gentile Christians as well as the Jews." 
2. "The ‘prophets’ are not here distinguished from the other Old Testament writers." 
3. "The gospel, Paul implies, though new, is yet old."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He promised afore" (προεπηγγειλατο). First aorist middle of προεπαγγελλω for which verb see on 2 Corinthians 9:5.
2. "By" (δια). Through, by means of, intermediate agency like Matthew 1:22 which see.
3. "In the holy scriptures" (εν γραφαις αγιαις). No article, yet definite. Perhaps the earliest use of the phrase (Sanday and Headlam). Paul definitely finds God's gospel in the Holy Scriptures.

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel is here further commended from the antiquity it: it was no novel doctrine, an upstart notion, but what God had conceived in his own breast from eternity."
2. "This mystery was hid in him from the beginning of the world, and was ordained before the world was; in time God was pleased to make it known to the sons of men."
3. "He 'promised' it, he spoke of it, and declared it by his prophets, Isaiah and others, 'afore' the Apostle Paul was called forth to be a preacher of it."

### John Wesley:
1. Which he promised before — Of old time, frequently, solemnly. And the promise and accomplishment confirm each other. Deuteronomy 18:18; Isaiah 9:6,7; 53:1; 61:1; Jeremiah 23:5.
