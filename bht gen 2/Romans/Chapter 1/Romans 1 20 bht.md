# Romans 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The invisible attributes of God, such as His eternal power and divinity, are made known through the works of creation. By observing the intricacies and wonders of the visible world, we can catch a glimpse of the invisible qualities of the Creator. It is through the visible creation that God's existence and divine nature are revealed, leaving humanity without excuse for their ignorance or indifference. This revelation of truth is sufficient to bring conviction and accountability, even to those who do not possess the advantage of divine revelation.

### Henry Alford:
1. "His invisible attributes (hence the plur. applying to Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπœÇ and Œ∏ŒµŒπœåœÑŒ∑œÇ which follow), ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ Œ∫œÑŒØœÉŒµœâœÇ Œ∫œåœÉŒº ., from the time of the creation, when the manifestation was made by God."
2. "His eternal Power. To this the evidence of Creation is plainest of all: Eternal, and Almighty, have always been recognized epithets of the Creator."
3. "and Divinity (not Godhead, which would be Œ∏ŒµœåœÑŒ∑œÇ). The fact that the Creator is divine; is of a different nature from ourselves, and accompanied by distinct attributes, and those of the highest order, which we call divine."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The outward creation is not the parent but the interpreter of our faith in God."
2. "The inner and the outer revelation of God are the complement of each other, making up one universal and immovable conviction that God is."
3. "All their degeneracy being a voluntary departure from truth thus brightly revealed to the unsophisticated spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The affirmation extends only to that; and the argument implies that that was enough to leave them without any excuse for their sins."
2. "The proof of this was clear, even to the pagan, with their imperfect views of creation and of astronomy."
3. "It is implied here that in order that people should be responsible, they should have the means of knowledge; and that he does not judge them when their ignorance is involuntary, and the means of knowing the truth have not been communicated."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The attributes which constitute God's nature, afterward defined as 'His eternal power and divinity.'"
2. "Invisible things are clearly visible."
3. "The revelation of God's power and divinity is given, so that, if, after being enlightened, they fall into sin, they may be without defense."

### John Calvin:
1. "God is in himself invisible; but as his majesty shines forth in his works and in his creatures everywhere, men ought in these to acknowledge him, for they clearly set forth their Maker."
2. "He who is the framer of all things must necessarily be without beginning and from himself."
3. "The manifestation of God, by which he makes his glory known in his creation, is, with regard to the light itself, sufficiently clear; but that on account of our blindness, it is not found to be sufficient."
