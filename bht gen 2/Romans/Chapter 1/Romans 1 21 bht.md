# Romans 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They did not acknowledge God's glory and excellence, nor did they express gratitude for his blessings. Instead, they conformed to the idolatrous practices of the less enlightened. In their pursuits of knowledge, they failed to attribute their understanding to God and neglected to appreciate his abundant mercies. Indeed, their reasoning became futile and their hearts darkened, as seen in the writings of Lucretius, where vain philosophies masked a lack of true wisdom and understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Without excuse, because they did not give Him glory as God, i.e. as the great Creator of all, distinct from and infinitely superior to all His works."
2. "They deposed God from His place as Creator, in their religion, and in their lives, they were ungrateful by the abuse of His gifts."
3. "They became vain in their speculations, their thoughts becoming idle and foolish."
4. "Their heart, being foolish, became dark and lost the little light it had, wandering blindly in the mazes of folly."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Because that, when they knew God—that is, while still retaining some real knowledge of Him, and ere they sank down into the state next to be described."
2. "They glorified him not as God, neither were thankful—neither yielded the adoration due to Himself, nor rendered the gratitude which His beneficence demanded."
3. "Their foolish heart—that is, their whole inner man—was darkened—How instructively is the downward progress of the human soul here traced!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To glorify him 'as God' is to regard with proper reverence all his perfections and laws; to venerate his name, his power, his holiness, and presence, etc. As they were not inclined to do this, so they were given over to their own vain and wicked desires."
 
2. "The apostle here clearly regards this unwillingness to render gratitude to God for his mercies as one of the causes of their subsequent corruption and idolatry."
 
3. "They acted foolishly; they employed themselves in useless and frivolous questions, the effect of which was to lead the mind further and further from the truth respecting God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I think it may be proved from facts that any given people, down to the lowest savages, has at any period of its life known far more than it has done: known quite enough to have enabled it to have got on comfortably, thriven and developed, if it had only done what no man does, all that it knew it ought to do and could do" (Charles Kingsley, " The Roman and the Teuton ").
2. "Their ideas and conceptions of God had no intrinsic value corresponding with the truth. 'The understanding was reduced to work in vacuo. It rendered itself in a way futile' (Godet)."
3. "They did not combine the facts which were patent to their observation."

### John Calvin:
1. "He plainly testifies here, that God has presented to the minds of all the means of knowing him, having so manifested himself by his works, that they must necessarily see what of themselves they seek not to know — that there is some God; for the world does not by chance exist, nor could it have proceeded from itself."
2. "No idea can be formed of God without including his eternity, power, wisdom, goodness, truth, righteousness, and mercy."
3. "Having forsaken the truth of God, they turned to the vanity of their own reason, all the acuteness of which is fading and passes away like vapor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact which renders them inexcusable is now stated."
2. "What worship they rendered was not in accordance with the knowledge they had."
3. "Not worshipping and thanking God, although they knew Him, they became vain in their reasonings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Knowing God. Second aorist active participle of γινωσκω, to know by personal experience. Definite statement that originally men had some knowledge of God."
2. "No people, however degraded, have yet been found without some yearning after a god, a seeking to find the true God."
3. "Their senseless heart. Καρδια is the most comprehensive term for all our faculties... Ασυνετος... unintelligent, not able to put together the manifest evidence about God."

### John Gill:
1. "They neither thought nor spoke honourably of him; nor did they ascribe those perfections to him, which belonged to him; they did not adhere to him as the one and only God, nor honour him as the Creator of all things out of nothing, and as the sole Governor of the universe."
2. "Neither for the knowledge of things they had, which they ascribed to themselves; nor for their mercies, which they imputed to second causes."
3. "The vanity of their minds was the spring and source of their evil conduct; which may design the wickedness of their hearts, and the imaginations thereof, which were evil, and that continually; the pride of their natures the carnality and weakness of their reasonings, and the whole system of their vain philosophy."

### John Wesley:
1. "The wiser heathens did know that there was one supreme God; yet from low and base considerations they conformed to the idolatry of the vulgar."
2. "They did not glorify him as God, neither were thankful - They neither thanked him for his benefits, nor glorified him for his divine perfection."
3. "What a terrible instance have we of this in the writings of Lucretius! What vain reasonings, and how dark a heart, amidst so pompous professions of wisdom!"
