# Romans 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Indeed, it is not uncommon for individuals to engage in empty reasonings and present themselves as wise, only to reveal their folly in the process. This is reminiscent of the ancient philosophers who arrogantly declared themselves to be lovers of wisdom, but ultimately proved to be fools. Paul's message is laced with a sharp truth that unveils the sheer absurdity of their efforts to depict a lost and misguided image of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They professed themselves wise, professing themselves to be wise." 
2. "The assumption of wisdom by the Greeks in general... of which assumption their philosophers were indeed eminent, but not the only examples."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Professing themselves wise, they became fools."
2. "It is the invariable property of error in morals and religion, that men take credit to themselves for it and extol it as wisdom."
3. "So the heathen."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Professing themselves to be wise - This was the common boast of the philosophers of antiquity. The very word by which they chose to be called, 'philosophers,' means literally 'lovers of wisdom.' That it was their boast that they were wise, is well known."
2. "They became fools - They became really foolish in their opinions and conduct. There is something particularly pungent and cutting in this remark, and as true as it is pungent."
3. "Sinners of all kinds are frequently spoken of as fools in the Scriptures. In the sense in which it is thus used, the word is applied to them as void of understanding or moral sense; as idolaters, and as wicked."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is commonly inferred from this passage, that Paul alludes here to those philosophers, who assumed to themselves in a peculiar manner the reputation of wisdom."
2. "The arrogance then which is condemned here is this — that men sought to be of themselves wise, and to draw God down to a level with their own low condition, when they ought humbly to have given him his own glory."
3. "The wiser they thought themselves, the more foolish they became."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Professing themselves to be wise. While, not because they professed themselves to be wise. This has reference, not to heathen philosophers, but to the conceit of wisdom which lay back of heathenism itself."
2. "They became fool. Their folly was manifested in their idolatry. ‘For heathenism is not the primeval religion, from which man might gradually have risen to the knowledge of the true God, but is, on the contrary, the result of a falling away from the known original revelation of the true God in His works. Instead of the practical recognition and preservation of the truth thus given comes the self-wisdom rendering them foolish, and idolatry in its train’ (Meyer)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Empty reasonings as often today." 
2. "An oxymoron or sharp saying, true and one that cuts to the bone." 
3. "Paul shows indignant contempt for these grotesque efforts to present pictures of a deity that had been lost."

### John Gill:
1. "The learned men among the Gentiles first called themselves σοφοι, 'Sophi', wise men: and afterwards, to cover their wretched pride and vanity, φιλοσοφοι, 'Philosophers', lovers of wisdom."
2. "but notwithstanding all their arrogance, their large pretensions to wisdom, and boast of it, they became fools."
3. "they showed themselves to be such in those very things they prided themselves with the knowledge of."
