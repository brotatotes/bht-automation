# Romans 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When people exchange the glory of the uncorruptible God for degrading and humiliating images, they are feigning a god according to their own limited comprehension. God, who is unchanging and immortal, cannot be compared to any corruptible creature. It is a deep degradation to worship idols in the likeness of corruptible humans, birds, four-footed beasts, and even creeping things. By resorting to such worship, people forsake the true God and are left to their own devices, throwing away their very humanity and incurring the punishment of God giving them up to their sinful desires.
