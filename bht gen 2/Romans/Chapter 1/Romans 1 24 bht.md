# Romans 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heart of man is a breeding ground for wickedness, giving birth to numerous lusts that lead to various forms of impurity. One punishment for sin arises from its very nature, while another is the consequence of divine justice. God, in his righteousness, allowed them to disgrace themselves by engaging in these scandalous and degrading actions, dishonoring not just their own bodies, but human nature as a whole. It is clear that the abandonment of God's restraining grace played a significant role in this outcome, demonstrating the connection between ungodliness, uncleanness, and the knowledge of God and purity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As sin begets sin, and darkness of mind deeper darkness, grace gives place to judgment, and the divine wrath hardens men, and hurries them on to more fearful degrees of depravity."
2. "The lusts of the heart were the field of action, the department of their being, in which this dishonour took place."
3. "ἀκαθαρσίαν: more than mere profligacy in the satisfaction of natural lust; bestiality; impurity in the physical, not only in the social and religious sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As they deserted God, God in turn deserted them; not giving them divine (that is, supernatural) laws, and suffering them to corrupt those which were human..."
2. "He let them do what they pleased, even what was in the last degree vile, that those who had not honored God, might dishonor themselves" [GROTIUS].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Here is traced the practical tendency of paganism; not as an innocent and harmless system, but as resulting in the most gross and shameless acts of depravity."
2. "God gave them up - He abandoned them, or he ceased to restrain them, and suffered them to act out their sentiments, and to manifest them in their life."
3. "He left them to act out, or manifest, their depraved affections and inclinations."

### John Calvin:
1. "What then, in short, he proves to us is this, - that the ingratitude of men to God is incapable of being excused; for it is manifest, by unequivocal evidences, that the wrath of God rages against them: they would have never rolled themselves in lusts so filthy, after the manner of beasts, had not the majesty of God been provoked and incensed against them."
2. "God, however, is not on this account cruel, nor are we innocent, inasmuch as Paul plainly shows, that we are not delivered up into his power, except when we deserve such a punishment."
3. "By connecting the desires or lusts of man's heart with uncleanness, he indirectly intimates what sort of progeny our heart generates, when left to itself. The expression, among themselves, is not without its force; for it significantly expresses how deep and indelible are the marks of infamy imprinted on our bodies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God abandons man to the consequence of his own doings, and thus punishes him."
2. "The heathen scarcely recognized lewdness as sinful."

1. "God gave them up... merely left them to their own self-determination and self-destruction, part of the price of man's moral freedom."
2. "The withdrawal of God's restraint sent men deeper down."
3. "Heathenism left its stamp on the bodies of men and women."


### John Gill:
1. "The heart of man is the source of all wickedness; the lusts that dwell there are many, and these tend to uncleanness of one sort or another."
2. "By it here is meant particularly bodily uncleanness, since it is said they were given up to dishonour their own bodies between themselves."
3. "He left them to dishonour themselves by doing these things which were reproachful and scandalous to human nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "One punishment of sin is from the very nature of it, as Romans 1:27; another, as here, is from vindictive justice."
2. "Ungodliness and uncleanness are frequently joined, 1 Thessalonians 4:5 as are the knowledge of God and purity."
3. "By withdrawing his restraining grace, God gave them up."
