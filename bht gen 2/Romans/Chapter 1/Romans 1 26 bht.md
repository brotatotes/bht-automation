## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πάθη ἀτιμ ., see above, Romans 1:24 , stronger than ἄτιμα πάθη , as setting forth the status, ἀτιμία, to which the πάθη belonged."
2. "Contrast 1 Thessalonians 4:4, τὸ ἑαυτοῦ σκεῦος κτᾶσθαι ἐν τιμῇ."
3. "This abuse is spoken of first, as being the most revolting to nature."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The practices here referred to, though too abundantly attested by classic authors, cannot be further illustrated, without trenching on things which 'ought not to be named among us as become the saints.'"
2. "But observe how vice is here seen consuming and exhausting itself."
3. "No wonder that, thus sick and dying as was this poor humanity of ours under the highest earthly culture, its many-voiced cry for the balm in Gilead, and the Physician there, 'Come over and help us,' pierced the hearts of the missionaries of the Cross, and made them 'not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sins which he proceeds to specify are the most indelicate, vile, and degrading which can be charged on man. But this is not the fault of the apostle. If they existed, it was necessary for him to charge them on the pagan world." 
2. "The shame is not in specifying them, but in their existence; not in the apostle, but in those who practiced them, and imposed on him the necessity of accusing them of these enormous offences."
3. "Evidence of the shameful and disgraceful fact here charged on the women is abundant in the Greek and Roman writers."

### John Calvin:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unto vile passions (εις παθη ατιμιας). Unto passions of dishonour."
2. "Παθος, old word from πασχω, to experience, originally meant any feeling whether good or bad, but in N.T. always in bad sense as here, 1 Thessalonians 4:5; Colossians 3:5 (only N.T. examples)."
3. "That which is against nature (την παρα φυσιν). The degradation of sex is what Paul here notes as one of the results of heathenism (the loss of God in the life of man). They passed by the Creator."

### John Gill:
1. "Because of their idolatrous practices, God left them to very dishonourable actions, sodomitical ones, both among the men and women."
2. "Either by prostituting themselves to, and complying with the 'sodomitical' embraces of men, in a way that is against nature, or by making use of such ways and methods with themselves, or other women, to gratify their lusts, which were never designed by nature for such an use."
3. "There were such women among the Jews, whom they call 'חמסוללות זו בזונשים,' and whom the priests were forbidden to marry."

### John Wesley:
1. Therefore God gave them up to vile affections — To which the heathen Romans were then abandoned to the last degree; and none more than the emperors themselves.
