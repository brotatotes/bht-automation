# Romans 1:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The consequences of their departure from God into idolatry are seen in the shame and retribution of their unnatural and degrading vice. Their actions were so base and unnatural that they brought upon themselves premature decay, disease, and even death. They deserved to be blinded, having closed their eyes to the light of God's glory. The prevalence and intensity of their immorality is evident in the passionate and self-destructive behaviors they engaged in. These acts of disobedience were a fitting recompense for their departure from God and refusal to honor Him.

### John Calvin:

1. "Turned (ŒµŒæŒµŒ∫Œ±œÖŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ). First aorist passive indicative, causative aorist, of ŒµŒ∫Œ∫Œ±Œπœâ, old verb, to burn out, to set on fire, to inflame with anger or lust."
