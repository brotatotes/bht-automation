# Romans 1:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They rejected God and were given over to an undiscerning mind, leading them to engage in actions that were not expedient. These actions, detailed in Romans 1:29-31, represented the depths of depravity. By giving them up to this mind, God demonstrated the justness of His response to their rejection of Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Because they reprobated the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, is indeed a very inadequate, but as far as the form of the two words is concerned, an accurate representation of it."
2. "God gave them up to a mind which had lost the faculty of discerning, but to a mind judicially abandoned to that depravity which, being well able to exercise the δοκιμασία required, not only does not do so, but in the headlong current of its abandonment to evil, sympathizes with and encourages its practice in others."
3. "The text charges them with not having exercised that judgment which would, if exercised, have led to the retention of God in their knowledge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "gave them over—or 'up' (see on  :-)." 
2. "to do those things which are not convenient—in the old sense of that word, that is, 'not becoming,' 'indecorous,' 'shameful.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They did not choose to acknowledge God...and chose to forsake him, and follow their own passions and lusts."
2. "To retain God...To think of him, or to serve and adore him. This was the first step in their sin."
3. "He gave them up to a mind destitute of judgment...the state of their minds was such that God could not approve it."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is an evident comparison to be observed in these words, by which is strikingly set forth the just relation between sin and punishment."
2. "He then intimates, that they, making a depraved choice, preferred their own vanities to the true God; and thus the error, by which they were deceived, was voluntary."
3. "As he calls them in the first instance not meet, understand him as saying, that they were inconsistent with every decision of reason, and alien to the duties of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having chosen out the most glaring form of vice, the Apostle enumerates others which formed part of the punishment."
2. "They refused, etc., did not deem it worth while; the original makes ‘God’ the object; did not deem God worthy to have in knowledge."
3. "'Reprobate' means rejected of God as unworthy. The heathen were not deprived of the faculty of distinguishing between right and wrong, but they practised evil and encouraged it in others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And even as they refused (κα καθως ουκ εδοκιμασαν). 'And even as they rejected' after trial just as δοκιμαζω is used of testing coins. They tested God at first and turned aside from him."
2. "Unto a reprobate mind (εις αδοκιμον νουν). Play on ουκ εδοκιμασαν. They rejected God and God rejected their mental attitude and gave them over."
3. "Like an old abandoned building, the home of bats and snakes, left 'to do those things which are not fitting' (ποιειν τα μη καθηκοντα), like the night clubs of modern cities, the dives and dens of the underworld, without God and in the darkness of unrestrained animal impulses. This was a technical term with Stoics (II Macc. 6:4)."

### John Gill:
1. "This accounts for the justness of the divine procedure in leaving them to commit such scandalous iniquities."
2. "God gave them over to a reprobate mind; a vain empty mind, worthless, good for nothing devoid of all true knowledge and judgment."
3. "To do those things which are not convenient; which are neither agreeably to the light of nature, nor convenient to, or becoming the honour of human nature."

### John Wesley:
1. God gave them up to an undiscerning mind — Treated of, Romans 1:32.To do things not expedient — Even the vilest abominations, treated of verses Romans 1:29-31.
