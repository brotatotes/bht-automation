# Romans 1:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Under the guise of morality, even the wise and moral instructors are guilty of the greatest vices like pride, covetousness, and debauchery. Fallen humanity is filled with all manner of sin and wickedness, lacking righteousness and violating the law in relation to their neighbors. This includes every form of uncleanness and a malicious disposition that delights in harming others without personal gain. The apostle's purpose is to emphasize the dramatic state of fallen humanity, illustrating that no one is exempt from these vices. The pervasive nature of these sins serves as a reminder of the absolute need for redemption.
