# Romans 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Concerning the Son. Christ, the great subject of the gospel, is the promised fulfillment of God's plan. He is the descendant of David, fulfilling the promise that was made to him. In His human nature, Jesus represents the union of divinity and humanity, which was necessary for our salvation. The mention of His human nature first emphasizes the importance of His incarnation, even though His divine nature would become more evident after His resurrection.
