# Romans 1:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see a vivid portrayal of the characteristics of those who turn away from God. They are haters of God, deniers of His providence, and rebels against His justice and holiness. These individuals engage in wickedness, secretly defame others, and speak against them behind their backs. Their actions not only hurt and defame others but also disrupt the bonds of society. With their haughtiness, they boast about their own abilities and wisdom, attributing their success solely to themselves. In their rebellion against God, they reveal a deep-seated enmity towards His justice and holiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Haters of Godâ€”The word usually signifies "God-hated," which some here prefer, in the sense of 'abhorred of the Lord'; expressing the detestableness of their character in His sight."
2. "But the active sense of the word, adopted in our version and by the majority of expositors, though rarer, agrees perhaps better with the context."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To an awakened sinner there is often nothing more plain and painful than that he is a hater of God."
2. "Surely, if this be the native character of man, then it is 'far gone from original righteousness.'"
3. "The system of paganism did not disclose the wickedness of the heart, and that rids was a main reason why they were elevated in self-esteem."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those, then, are designated, who hate God, whose justice they seem to resist by doing wrong."
2. "Haughty are they who swell with the empty wind of overweeningness."
3. "Unsociable are those who, by their iniquities, unloose the bands of society, or those in whom there is no sincerity or constancy of faith, who may be called truce-breakers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Leaving the word in its strict signification, hated of God, we recognize in it a summary judgment of moral indignation respecting all the preceding particulars; so that, looking back on these, it forms a resting-point in the disgraceful catalogue."
2. "If any crime was known more than another, as 'hated by the gods,' it was that of informers, abandoned persons who circumvented and ruined others by a system of malignant espionage and false information."
3. "'Apostasy from the piety and affection due to parents is a fountain of corruption. See Malachi 4:6; Luke 1:17.' (Lange)"

3. "Boasters of their parts, abilities, wisdom, and works; all which they attributed to themselves, and to the sharpness of their wit, their sagacity, and industry."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whisperers â€” Such as secretly defame others."
