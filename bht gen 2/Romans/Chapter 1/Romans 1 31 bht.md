# Romans 1:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those described as without understanding lack knowledge and comprehension of God and moral principles. Throughout history, humans have shown a tendency to break covenants and disregard contracts both on an individual and societal level. Furthermore, the absence of natural affection is evident in practices like exposing newborn children to die and even killing elderly parents. These actions reflect a heart devoid of empathy and demonstrate the cruel realities of the ancient world.
