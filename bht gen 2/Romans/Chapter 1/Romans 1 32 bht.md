# Romans 1:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The profound judgment of God is unequivocally pronounced against all forms of wickedness, extending beyond heinous crimes to encompass every violation of divine law. This divine wrath reverberates within the human conscience, decisively revealing the dire consequences that await those who persist in sinful paths. The distressing portrayal of a pagan world consumed by vice underscores the necessity of an alternative plan of religion. In the face of such moral decay, the urgency of missionary endeavors becomes evident, as Christianity is believed to possess the transformative power to rectify these pervasive evils.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle advances to the highest grade of moral abandonment, the knowledge of God‚Äôs sentence against such crimes, united with the contented practice of them, and encouragement of them in others." 
2. "The sentence of God, unmistakeably pronounced in the conscience."
3. "That such courses lead to ruin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "‚ÄòThe wrath of God‚Äô against sin has all the dread reality of a ‚Äòrevelation from heaven‚Äô sounding in the consciences of men...so this ‚Äòwrath of God‚Äô is not confined to high-handed crimes, or the grosser manifestations of human depravity, but is ‚Äòrevealed‚Äô against all violations of divine law of whatever nature."
2. "We must not magnify the supernatural revelation which God has been pleased to make of Himself, through Abraham's family to the human race, at the expense of that older, and, in itself, lustrous revelation which He has made to the whole family of man through the medium of their own nature and the creation around them."
3. "To take pleasure in what is sinful and vicious for its own sake, and knowing it to be such, is the last and lowest stage of human recklessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The judgment of God - The word ‚Äújudgment‚Äù here denotes the declared sentiment of God that such things deserved death."
2. "If this revolting and melancholy picture of the pagan world was a true representation, then it was clear that there was need of some other plan of religion."
3. "The account in this chapter shows the propriety of missionary exertions. If this be the state of the world, and if Christianity, as all Christians believe, contains the remedy for all these evils, then it is wisdom and benevolence to send it to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it is the summit of all evils, when the sinner is so void of shame, that he is pleased with his own vices, and will not bear them to be reproved, and also cherishes them in others by his consent and approbation."
2. "For he who is ashamed is as yet healable; but when such an impudence is contracted through a sinful habit, that vices, and not virtues, please us, and are approved, there is no more any hope of reformation."
3. "I see that the Apostle meant here to condemn something more grievous and more wicked than the very doing of vices: what that is I know not, except we refer to that which is the summit of all wickedness, ‚Äî that is, when wretched men, having cast away all shame, undertake the patronage of vices in opposition to the righteousness of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse adds to the description of vices a deeper degree of immorality; showing how entirely the heathen are ‚Äòwithout excuse‚Äô (Romans 1:20; chap. Romans 2:1)."
2. "Knowing. A stronger word than that in Romans 1:21. Their conscience gave such knowledge."
3. "The climax of the punishment of sin by sin suggests one feature of the eternal death threatened in the Bible. This dark picture of heathen corruption is not overdrawn, though honorable exceptions existed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The heathen knows that God condemns such evil practices."
2. "It is a tragedy of American city government that so many of the officials are proven to be hand in glove with the underworld of law-breakers."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews have a saying that no man is suspected of a thing but he has done it; and if he has not done the whole of it, he has done part of it, and if he has not done part of it, he has thought in his heart to do it, and if he has not thought in his heart to do it, he has seen others do it, and has rejoiced."
2. "Now from this whole account we see the insufficiency of the light of nature to guide persons in the way of salvation; what need there was of a divine revelation."
3. "How impossible it is that such men should ever be justified before God, by any works of seeming righteousness done by them."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is the highest degree of wickedness."
2. "He that has pleasure in those that do evil, loves wickedness for wickedness' sake."
3. "And hereby he encourages them in sin, and heaps the guilt of others upon his own head."
