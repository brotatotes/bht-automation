# Romans 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the power of His resurrection, Jesus was strongly and convincingly declared to be the Son of God, with a nature that is both divine and holy. This resurrection, which is the source of our faith, served as a powerful confirmation of His deity and the truth of His teachings. The apostles, in turn, preached this truth, being compelled by the undeniable evidence of Christ's resurrection from the dead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle...does not deal with the essential subsistent Godhead of Christ, but with that manifestation of it which the great fact of the Resurrection had made to men."
2. "Thus the objective words ποιεῖν...and ἐδικαιώθη...are used of the same proof or manifestation of Christ’s Sonship by His Resurrection."
3. "The Spirit is designated by the gen. of quality, ἁγιωσύνης, to show that it is not a human, but a divine Spirit which is attributed here to Christ, a Spirit to which holiness belongs as its essence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He 'was MADE [says the apostle] of the seed of David, according to the flesh'; but He was not made, He was only 'declared [or proved] to BE the Son of God.'"
2. "By His birth in the flesh, that Sonship, which was essential and uncreated, merely effloresced into palpable manifestation."
3. "Declared to be the Son of God" in possession of that "power" which belonged to Him as the only-begotten of the Father, no longer shrouded as in the days of His flesh, but "by His resurrection from the dead" gloriously displayed and henceforth to be forever exerted in this nature of ours."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The act of raising him from the dead designated him, or constituted him the Son of God."
2. "The phrase 'Son of God' stands in contrast with the title 'Son of man,' and the natural and obvious import of the title 'Son of God' is that he was divine; or that he sustained relations to God designated by the name Son of God, corresponding to the relations which he sustained to man designated by the name Son of Man."
3. "The expression, 'according to the Spirit of holiness,' does not indeed of itself imply divinity. It denotes that holy and more exalted nature which he possessed as distinguished from the human. What that is, is to be learned from other declarations. 'This expression implies simply that it was such as to make proper the appellation, the Son of God.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It means to designate one for something, to nominate, to instate."
2. "The idea is that of Christ's instatement or establishment in the rank and dignity of His divine sonship with a view to the conviction of men."
3. "He was declared or instated mightily; in a striking, triumphant manner, through His resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ was declared the Son of God by openly exercising a real celestial power, that is, the power of the Spirit, when he rose from the dead."
2. "This glory, however, is not made known to us, until the same Spirit imprints a conviction of it on our hearts."
3. "He gained victory over death, not by aid sought from another, but by the celestial operation of his own Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sense ‘constituted,’ in so far as that implies that the Sonship began at the resurrection, is an impossible one."
2. "In neither case is there any suggestion that Christ became the Son of God in consequence of the resurrection, although the human nature of Christ was then exalted, and made partaker of the glory which eternally belonged to the Son."
3. "'Having given this description of the person and dignity of the Son of God, very man and very God, he now identifies this divine person with Jesus Christ, the Lord and Master of Christians, the historical object of their faith, and (see words following) the Appointer of himself to the apostolic office’ (Alford)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Resurrection of Christ is the miracle of miracles. 'The resurrection only declared him to be what he truly was' (Denney)." 
2. "Not the Holy Spirit, but a description of Christ ethically as κατα σαρκα describes him physically (Denney). Hαγιωσυνη is rare...as the attribute of God." 
3. "These words gather up the total personality of Jesus (his deity and his humanity)."

### John Gill:
1. "He, the Son of God, who existed as such, from everlasting, was manifested in the flesh, or human nature."
2. "His divine sonship, and proper deity, are declared and made evident with, or 'by' his power."
3. "The power of Christ in raising the dead...declared him to be, or clearly made it appear that he was the Son of God, a divine person, truly and properly God."

### John Wesley:
1. "But powerfully declared to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit of Holiness."
2. "By the resurrection from the dead."
3. "For this is both the fountain and the object of our faith; and the preaching of the apostles was the consequence of Christ's resurrection."
