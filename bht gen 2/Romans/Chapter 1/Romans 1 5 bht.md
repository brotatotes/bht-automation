# Romans 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Grace and apostleship are mentioned together, referring to the favor and honor of being chosen as an apostle by divine grace. This appointment was not based on Paul's merit, but on God's sovereign choice. The purpose of Paul's apostleship was to bring about obedience in faith among all nations, so that they may embrace and submit to the message of Christ. It is important to recognize that everything Paul did as an apostle was for the sake and glory of Jesus Christ.
