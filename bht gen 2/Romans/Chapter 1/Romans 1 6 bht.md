# Romans 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The calling mentioned here is not simply an external invitation or an office, but it refers to a special internal call by the grace of God. This calling is powerful and unchangeable, leading individuals out of darkness and bondage, and into the light, liberty, and fellowship with Christ. Those who are called are the elect of God, secured in Christ and redeemed by Him. St. Paul asserts that the Romans, among other Gentiles, have also received this call, showing that they have no superiority over anyone else.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole to χριστοῦ should be taken together: among whom ye also are called of Jesus Christ; otherwise, with a comma at ὑμεῖς, the assertion, ‘among whom are ye,’ is flat and unmeaning."
2. "De Wette and Calvin would take Ἰησοῦ χρ. as a gen. of possession, because the call of believers is generally referred to the FATHER: but sometimes the SON is said to call likewise, see John 5:25; 1 Timothy 1:12: and with ἀγαπητοὶ θεοῦ following so close upon it, the expression can I think hardly be taken otherwise than as called by Jesus Christ."
3. "ἐκλεκτοὶ αὐτοῦ, Matthew 24:31, cited by De W. is hardly parallel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Among whom are ye also—that is, along with others; for the apostle ascribes nothing special to the Church of Rome." 
2. "The called—(See on Romans 1:7)."
3. "Of Christ Jesus—that is, either called 'by Him' or the called 'belonging to Him'; 'Christ's called ones.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Among whom - That is, among the Gentiles who had become obedient to the Christian faith in accordance with the design of the gospel, Romans 1:8."
2. "The called of Jesus Christ - Those whom Jesus Christ has called to be his followers."
3. "The word 'called' (see Romans 1:1) denotes not merely an external invitation to privilege, but it also denotes the 'internal' or 'effectual' call which secures conformity to the will of him who calls, and is thus synonymous with the name Christians, or believers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Ye also. As Romans among other Gentiles : not, called as I am called.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To prepare for the address he says that his mission for the glory of Christ’s name is to them also; they are included among those for whom he received his apostleship."
2. "They were not called by Jesus Christ but called to tie His, since the call of believers is always referred to God."
3. "'Called' may here mean effectually called, but 'called' and 'chosen,' or, 'elect,' are frequently distinguished in the New Testament."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Called to be Jesus Christ's"
2. "Predicate genitive after κλητο (verbal adjective from καλεω, to call), though it is possible to consider it the ablative case, 'called of (or from) Jesus Christ.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The calling here spoken of is not to an office, or a mere external one by the ministry of the word, but an internal special call by the grace of God; and which is irresistible, efficacious, and unchangeable, and is an high, holy, and heavenly one."
2. "By it persons are called out of darkness into light, out of bondage into liberty, out of the world, from the company of the men of it, and the sinful pleasures thereof, to fellowship with Christ and his saints, and off a dependence on themselves, and their own righteousness, to the grace and righteousness of Christ, and to eternal glory."
3. "The persons so called are the elect of God, who are secured in Christ, and redeemed by him, and who has a concern with the Father and Spirit in the calling of them."

### John Wesley:
1. Among whom — The nations brought to the obedience of faith.Are ye also — But St. Paul gives them no preeminence above others.
