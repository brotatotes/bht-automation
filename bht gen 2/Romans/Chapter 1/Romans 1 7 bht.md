Beloved of God, you have been set apart for His service and called to holiness through His free love and by His Word and Spirit. May you receive the abundant grace and all-encompassing peace that come from God, encompassing every blessing, both temporal and eternal. This greeting not only carries the warmth of Christian fellowship but also the apostolic blessing. Remember that it is the same peace and grace that originate from both God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, for whom our trust and prayers are directed, as they are inseparable in their divine nature.

He only, in whom the Word of the Father who is Himself God became flesh, may be named beside Him for men are commanded to honor Him even as they honor the Father (John 5:23)' [OLSHAUSEN]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The radical idea of the word is what is separated from a common to a sacred use, and answers to the Hebrew word, ◊ß◊ì◊ï◊©◊Å qadowsh. It is applied to any thing that is set apart to the service of God [...] This is the special characteristic of the saints."

### John Wesley:
