## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There could be no other witness to his practice in his secret prayers, but God: and as the assertion of a habit of incessantly praying for the Roman Christians, whom he had never seen, might seem to savour of an exaggerated expression of affection, he solemnly appeals to this only possible testimony." - Bengel.
2. "The serving God in his spirit was a guarantee that his profession was sincere, and that the oath just taken was no mere form, but a solemn and earnest appeal of his spirit." - Umbreit.
3. "His peculiar method of λατρεία was concerned with the gospel of the Son of God." - Chrys. Hom. iii.

### John Calvin:
1. "He proves his love by its effects; for had he not greatly loved them, he would not have so anxiously commended them to the Lord, and especially he would not have so ardently desired to promote their welfare by his own labors."
2. "He did not transgress the prohibition of Christ. It hence appears that it was not Christ’s design to abolish oaths altogether, but on the contrary to call attention to the due observance of the law; and the law, allowing an oath, only condemns perjury and needless swearing."
3. "He still further sets forth the ardor of his love by his very constancy in praying for them...whenever I address God in prayer, I join a mention of you...He at the same time intimates how frequently, or rather, how unceasingly he was engaged in such prayers, since he says that he prayed continually."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such appeals to God are not uncommon in Paul’s writings. God only could know what his habit in secret prayer was."
2. "He renders true service, not in the temple, but in his 'spirit.' 'Spirit' is the highest part of man’s nature, and in passages like this the reference is to the human spirit, not in contrast with soul or body, but as the sphere of the working of the Holy Spirit."

3. "Always (παντοτε)...He seems to have had prayer lists. He never omitted the Romans."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason of the apostle's using it was, because he was personally unknown to the Romans, and they to him, and so might doubt of his affectionate regard unto them; and therefore for the confirmation thereof he uses it."
2. "He describes him as the God 'whom [he] served', to distinguish him from all false gods, and to show that he that takes an oath, should be one that fears and serves the Lord; what he served him in was not the law, but the Gospel of his Son."
3. "The manner in which he served him was, as he says, with my Spirit; either with the Spirit of God, which was given to him; or in a spiritual manner, in opposition to the carnal worship of the Jews; internally, in opposition to bodily exercise only, and voluntarily, with his whole heart, soul, and spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. God, whom I serve — As an apostle.In my spirit — Not only with my body, but with my inmost soul.In the gospel — By preaching it.
