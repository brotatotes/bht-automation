## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Brethren, the inclination of my heart imports the rest of approving satisfaction."
2. "The Apostle’s εὐδοκία would be their salvation itself, his δέησις πρὸς τὸν θ . ὑπὲρ αὐτ . was εἰς σωτ."
3. "The Apostle’s meaning seems to be, to destroy any impression which his readers may have received unfavourable to his love of his own people, from the stern argument of the former chapter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Brethren, my heart's desire...expresses 'entire complacency,' that in which the heart would experience full satisfaction."
2. "and prayer...to God for Israel...'for them' is the true reading; the subject being continued from the close of the preceding chapter."
3. "is, that they may be saved...Having before poured forth the anguish of his soul at the general unbelief of his nation and its dreadful consequences, he here expresses in the most emphatic terms his desire and prayer for their salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Brethren - This expression seems intended particularly for the Jews, his ancient friends, fellow-worshippers, and kinsmen, but who had embraced the Christian faith. It is an expression of tenderness and affection, denoting his deep interest in their welfare."
2. "Prayer to God - He not only cherished this feeling but he expressed in a desire to God. He had no desire that his kinsmen should be destroyed; no pleasure in the appalling doctrine which he had been defending. He still wished their welfare; and could still pray for them that they might return to God."
3. "For Israel - For the Jewish nation. That they might be saved - This clearly refers to salvation from the sin of unbelief; and the consequences of sin in hell."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Brethren. An expression of affectionate interest and indicating emotion."
2. "My heart's desire. More literally, the good will of my heart. "
3. "Prayer. Implying communion. For Israel. That they may be saved."

### John Calvin:
1. "We here see with what solicitude the holy man obviated offenses; for in order to soften whatever sharpness there may have been in his manner of explaining the rejection of the Jews, he still testifies, as before, his goodwill towards them, and proves it by the effect..."
2. "It may be at the same time that he was also induced by another reason to testify his love towards the nation from which he had sprung; for his doctrine would have never been received by the Jews had they thought that he was avowedly inimical to them..."
3. "The word for 'goodwill,' εὐδοκία, means a kind disposition towards another, it means here a benevolent or a sincere desire..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Brethren. This term of affection, though not addressed to Jewish readers, was probably suggested by Paul’s feeling toward them; his severity was consistent with love."
2. "The desire, lit., ‘good pleasure,’ not, ‘good will;’ the latter sense does not suit the context. ‘Desire’ is not exact, yet probably suggests the true sense: the salvation of Israel was the ideal of his heart."
3. "And my petition to God. ‘Prayer’ is not so exact as ‘petition;’ ‘to God’ is to be joined with ‘petition’...The correct reading shows the intimate connection of thought with the close of chap. 9."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Desire (ευδοκια) means will, pleasure, satisfaction."
2. "Supplication (δεησις) is a late word from δεομα, to want, to beg, to pray."
3. "Paul did not feel that the case was hopeless for them in spite of their conduct."

### John Gill:
1. "he continually bore them upon his mind at the throne of grace"
2. "that they might be spiritually converted, turned from their evil ways, and brought to believe in Christ"
3. "he knew there was a seed, a remnant according to the election of grace, at that present time among them, that should be saved"

### John Wesley:
1. My prayer to God is, that they may be saved — He would not have prayed for this, had they been absolutely reprobated.
