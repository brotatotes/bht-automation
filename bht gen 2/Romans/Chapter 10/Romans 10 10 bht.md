# Romans 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believing with the heart goes beyond mere intellectual assent, involving a genuine commitment of all the faculties of the soul - understanding, will, and affections. This kind of faith is what leads to obtaining justification and the righteousness of Christ. Similarly, confession is not just a matter of words, but also of actions that demonstrate a sincere and genuine faith. It is through this heartfelt confession that we can ultimately obtain salvation.

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage may help us to understand what justification by faith is; for it shows that righteousness then comes to us, when we embrace God’s goodness offered to us in the gospel."
2. "But as the word heart is often taken for a serious and sincere feeling, I would say that faith is a firm and effectual confidence, and not a bare notion only."
