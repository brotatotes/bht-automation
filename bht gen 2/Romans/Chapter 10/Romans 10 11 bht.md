# Romans 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For everyone who believes in Him will not be put to shame. This passage from Isaiah 28:16, which has already been mentioned in Romans 9:33, is being quoted to emphasize the connection between faith and righteousness, and confession and salvation. It is a profound and unchanging truth that whoever believes in Christ, regardless of their background or identity, will unquestionably be saved. In this context, the object of belief is explicitly mentioned as Him, referring to the stone laid in Zion for a foundation, which is none other than Christ Himself.

2. "Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed—Here, as in Isaiah 28:16, the quotation is from the Septuagint, which renders those words of the original, 'shall not make haste,' 'shall not be put to shame,' which comes to the same thing."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having stated the reasons why God had justly repudiated the Jews, he returns to prove the calling of the Gentiles, which is the other part of the question which he is discussing."
2. "As then he had explained the way by which men obtain salvation, and one that is common and opened to the Gentiles no less than to the Jews, he now, having first hoisted an universal banner, extends it expressly to the Gentiles, and then invites the Gentiles by name to it."
3. "He repeats the testimony which he had before adduced from Isaiah, that what he said might have more authority, and that it might also be evident, how well the prophecies concerning Christ harmonize with the law."

2. "The word answering to ‘whosoever,’ more literally, ‘every one’ is not found in the original passage (comp. chap. Romans 9:33). But it is properly inserted here, because this idea of universality, which is implied in the original prophecy, has not only been established in the intervening discussion, but is the theme of the succeeding verses."
