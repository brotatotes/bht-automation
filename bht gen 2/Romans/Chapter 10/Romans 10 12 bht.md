# Romans 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord of all is rich in mercy and grace. No one is exempt from the offer of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. It is not based on race or nationality, but on the universal call to call upon Him as Lord. The richness of God's grace flows in the direction of all who seek Him, without discrimination. The cry of adoration, Jesus, Lord! can be uttered by every human heart, Jew or Gentile, as they acknowledge and call upon Him as their God.
