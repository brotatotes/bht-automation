# Romans 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True faith in God requires hearing about Him, and hearing about Him necessitates the preaching of the Gospel. The objections raised by some are addressed by the Apostle, demonstrating that God has arranged for the proclamation of the gospel to reach both Jews and Gentiles. Calling upon God's name is a declaration of belief, indicating that there is a prior knowledge of Him. Without preachers sent forth with the mission to proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ, there would be no opportunity for people to hear, believe, and call upon God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "True, the same Lord over all is rich unto all alike that call upon Him."
2. "But this calling implies believing, and believing hearing, and hearing preaching, and preaching a mission to preach."
3. "Why, then, take ye it so ill, O children of Abraham, that in obedience to our heavenly mission we preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The objection was, that they could not call on him in whom they had not believed; that they could not believe in him of whom they had not heard; and that this was arranged by God himself, so that a large part of the world was destitute of the gospel, and in fact did not believe."
2. "The objection is, that in order to our calling on one for help, we must be satisfied that there is such a being, and that he is able to aid us. This remark is just, and every man feels it."
3. "The objection thence derived is, that it is not right to condemn people for not believing what has never been proclaimed to them; and, of course, that the doctrine that eternal life is suspended on faith cannot be just and right."

### John Calvin:
1. "Both Jews and Gentiles, by calling on the name of God, do thereby declare that they believe on him; for a true calling on God’s name cannot be except a right knowledge of him were first had."
2. "Where then there is a calling on God, there is faith; and where faith is, the seed of the word has preceded; where there is preaching there is the calling of God."
3. "This is what no man can do who has not previously entertained in his mind such a persuasion of God’s paternal kindness towards him, that he dares to expect everything from him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle argues from the cited prophecy (Romans 10:13) the necessity of preachers sent forth in accordance with another prophecy (Romans 10:15), in order by thus enforcing the universality of the gospel to show more plainly the responsibility of the Jews."
2. "The reference is to Christ."
3. "The reference is to hearing Christ through His preachers, or to hearing the Christ who is preached; since ‘of whom’ here cannot be grammatically explained as = about whom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "How shall they call?" - Deliberative subjunctive (first aorist middle) of επικαλεομα. The antecedent of εις ον is not expressed. (Romans 10:14)
2. "How shall they believe?" - Deliberative subjunctive again (first aorist active of πιστευω). Each time Paul picks up the preceding verb and challenges that. Here again the antecedent εις τουτον before ον is not expressed. (Romans 10:14)
3. "How shall they hear?" - Deliberative subjunctive (first aorist active of ακουω). (Romans 10:14)

### John Gill:
1. "There can be no true calling upon God without faith, no faith without hearing, no hearing without preaching, and no preaching without divine mission."
2. "There is no faith in Christ without hearing of him; as it is in human, so in divine faith, there may be believing without seeing, but not without hearing."
3. "There is no hearing of Christ, and salvation by him, without the preaching of the Gospel; the usual and ordinary way of hearing from God, and of Christ, is by the ministry of the word."
