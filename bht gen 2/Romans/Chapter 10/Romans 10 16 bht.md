# Romans 10:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy of Isaiah captures the disbelief and rejection of the Gospel message. Despite the preaching, not all have obeyed or believed, as anticipated even in Isaiah's time. The success of the Gospel relies on the power of God working in the hearts of hearers. Ministers faithfully proclaim the truth, but individuals must respond in faith and obedience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "But not all hearkened to the glad tidings...for Esaias saith, Lord, who believed the hearing of us?"
3. "The persons here meant are as yet kept indefinite, but evidently the Apostle has in his mind the unbelieving Jews, about whom his main discourse is employed."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was therefore necessary, that, in passing, he should give them this intimation, ‚Äî that many are called, who are yet not chosen."
2. "He also quotes a passage from Isaiah 53:1; where the Prophet, before he proceeds to announce a remarkable prediction respecting the death and the kingdom of Christ, speaks with astonishment of the few number of believers, who appeared to him in the Spirit to be so few, that he was constrained to exclaim, ‚ÄúO Lord, who has believed our report?‚Äù that is, the word which we preach."
3. "It is hence evident, how foolishly some maintain, that all are indiscriminately the elect, because the doctrine of salvation is universal, and because God invites all indiscriminately to himself. But the generality of the promises does not alone and by itself make salvation common to all: on the contrary, the peculiar revelation, mentioned by the Prophet, confines it to the elect."
