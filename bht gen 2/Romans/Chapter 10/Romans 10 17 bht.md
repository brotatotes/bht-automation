# Romans 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith is derived from hearing, specifically the spoken word of God. It is through the preaching of the Gospel and the proclamation of the truth contained in the Scriptures that faith in Christ is produced in the hearts of people. The authority of the message, rooted in the word of God and the command of Christ, plays a vital role in bringing about faith and demonstrating the importance of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Faith then is from hearing, and the hearing is by means of the word of Christ." 
2. "The publication of the Gospel produces belief in it." 
3. "The word of Christ is used as an instrument and vehicle for the hearing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17. So then faith cometh by hearing,
	and hearing by the word of God—"This is another
	confirmation of the truth that faith supposes the hearing of the
	Word, and this a commission to preach it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not condemn people for not believing what they had not heard; but he complains of those who did not believe a message actually delivered to them."
2. "It could not be right, therefore, to condemn those who had not obeyed the gospel because they had not heard it; and hence, not right to make salvation dependent on a condition which was, by the arrangement of God, put beyond their power."
3. "And this shows us at once the importance of the message, and the fact that people are converted by the instrumentality of truth, and of truth only."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Belief comes through the message, and the message through the command of Christ."
2. "The authority of the message."
3. "Emphasizing the authority of the message."

### John Calvin:
1. "Wherever faith is, God has there already given an evidence of his election."
2. "This is a remarkable passage with regard to the efficacy of preaching; for he testifies, that by it faith is produced."
3. "It must be further noticed, that faith is grounded on nothing else but the truth of God; for Paul does not teach us that faith springs from any other kind of doctrine, but he expressly restricts it to the word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The heard preaching of the gospel brings about in men’s minds faith in Christ" (Meyer).
2. "The weight of authority favors the substitution of ‘Christ’ for ‘God.’ 'Word'... probably means command or order, taking up again the idea of the verb" (Romans 10:15).
3. "Thus the authority of the message is emphasized over against the unbelief of some, preparing the way for the application to the responsibility of the Jews."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  By the word of Christ  (δια ρηματος Χριστου). "By the word about Christ" (objective genitive). 

### John Gill:
1. "That is, by preaching; for the word hearing is used in the same sense as in the preceding verse; and designs the report of the Gospel, or the preaching of the word, which is the means God makes use of, to convey faith into the hearts of his people;"
2. "and hearing by the word of God; or "of Christ", as some copies read, and so do the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions; and intends either the holy Scriptures, which have God for their author, and Christ for the subject of them;"
3. "and the sense is, that men preach the Gospel in obedience to the commandment of the everlasting God, and according to the orders, mission, and commission, warrant and authority, of the Lord Jesus Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. Faith, indeed, ordinarily cometh by hearing; even by hearing the word of God.
