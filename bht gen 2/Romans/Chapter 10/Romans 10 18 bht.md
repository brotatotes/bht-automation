# Romans 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The message of the Gospel has been proclaimed throughout the world, leaving no room for ignorance. The Jews had ample opportunity to hear the Gospel through the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, rendering their unbelief inexcusable. Furthermore, even the Gentiles, who did not have the full revelation of God, heard of His existence through the wonders of creation. The Apostle Paul emphasizes that he is not referring to natural light or the Mosaic law, but specifically to the preaching of the Gospel, which has reached the known parts of the world and continues to spread.

1.

2. "He indeed manifested himself then more particularly to his chosen people, so that the Jews might be justly compared to domestic hearers, whom he familiarly taught as it were by his own mouth; yet as he spoke to the Gentiles at a distance by the voice of the heavens, he showed by this prelude that he designed to make himself known at length to them also."
