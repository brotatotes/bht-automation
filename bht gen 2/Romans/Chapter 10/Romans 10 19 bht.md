# Romans 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite Israel's knowledge of God's plan to extend the gospel to the Gentiles, they rejected it while a nation that was not in a covenant with God was accepted in their place. Just as Israel had followed false gods, the Lord chose to provoke them to jealousy and anger by bestowing His favor upon a foolish nation. Those who do not know God fall into this category.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Did Israel not know... the fact that such a general proclamation of the Gospel would be made as has been mentioned in the last verse, raising up the Gentiles into equality and rivalry with themselves?"
2. "First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy against (those who are) no nation, against a nation that hath no understanding will I anger you."
3. "The original reference of these words, as addressed to Israel by Moses, is exactly apposite to the Apostle’s argument. Moses prophetically assumes the departure of Israel from God, and his rejection of them, and denounces from God that as they had moved Him to jealousy with their 'no-gods' (idols) and provoked Him to anger by their vanities, so He would, by receiving into his favour a 'no-nation,' make them jealous, and provoke them to anger by adopting instead of them a foolish nation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did not Israel know?—know, from their own Scriptures, of God's intention to bring in the Gentiles?" 
2. "In this verse God warns His ancient people that because they had moved Him to jealousy with their 'no-gods,' and provoked Him to anger with their vanities, He in requital would move them to jealousy by receiving into His favor a 'no-people,' and provoke them to anger by adopting a nation void of understanding."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But Paul does not here state what it was that they knew. That is to be gathered from what he proceeds to say. From that it appears that he referred to the fact that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles, and that the Jews were to be cast off."
2. "Thus, he would illustrate the great principle of his government [...] that if the Jews should be rebellious, and prove themselves unworthy of his favor, that favor would be withdrawn, and conferred on other nations."
3. "We may remark here, (2)That when people abuse his mercies, become proud, or cold, or dead in his service, he often takes away their privileges, and bestows them on others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Did Israel not know? As in ver. 18, a negative answer is implied. 'It is surely not true that Israel did not know.' Did not know what? That the Gospel should go forth into all the earth."
2. "By a foolish nation [επι εθνει ασυνετω] . Lit., upon a foolish nation as the basis of the exasperation."
3. "The force of the compounded preposition para in this verb and in parazhlwsw provoke to jealousy, seems to be driving to the side of something which by contact or comparison excites jealousy or anger."

### John Calvin:
1. "What then is to be said of Israel, who had been illuminated by a far different light of truth? for how comes it that aliens and the profane should run to the light manifested to them afar off, and that the holy race of Abraham should reject it when familiarly seen by them?"
2. "He proves by the testimony of Moses, that there was nothing inconsistent in God in preferring the Gentiles to the Jews."
3. "The emulation, which Moses mentions, arose from this, — that God formed for himself a nation from that which was not a nation, and raised up from nothing a new people, who were to occupy the place from which the Jews had been driven away."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prophecies which follow, it is true, prove that the gospel was to pass over from the Jews to the Gentiles. But the more general view seems preferable."
2. "From this point to the close of the chapter we have the direct Scriptural proof, that the Jews ought not to have been in ignorance."
3. "The use made by the Apostle of this prophecy is very apt. 'Moses prophetically assumes the departure of Israel from God, and His rejection of them, and denounces from God that, as they had moved Him to jealousy with their 'no-gods' (idols) and provoked Him to anger by their vanities, so He would, by receiving into His favor a 'no-nation' make them jealous, and provoke them to anger by adopting instead of them a foolish nation' (Alford)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did Israel fail to know?"
2. "The Jews had worshipped 'no-gods' and now God shows favours to a 'no-nation' (people)."
3. "Will I anger you?"

### John Gill:
1. "They knew the being and perfections of God, the unity of God, and the trinity of persons in the divine essence; they knew the will of God, and the right way of worshipping him."
2. "The Gentiles are here designed by 'them that are no people': who before God, and in his sight, as all nations are, were as a drop of the bucket, as the small dust of the balance: nay, even as nothing, yea, less than nothing and vanity."
3. "It was a righteous thing in him to provoke them to jealousy of him, as if he had no affection for them, who had been so long, in some sense, a husband to them all; and as about to cast them off; and to anger them, by sending his Gospel among the Gentiles, and calling them by his grace, and making them partakers of his special favours."

### John Wesley:
1. "They might have known, even from Moses and Isaiah, that many of the gentiles would be received, and many of the Jews rejected."
2. "As they followed gods that were not gods, so he accepted in their stead a nation that was not a nation; that is, a nation that was not in covenant with God."
3. "Such are all which know not God."
