# Romans 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They have a zeal for God, but it is not based on true knowledge. Their zeal is directed towards external rituals and traditions, rather than a genuine understanding of God's truth. We must be cautious not to fall into the same trap of zeal without knowledge. Instead, we should seek a deep understanding of God's Word and apply it with genuine passion and devotion.

2. "They have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A zeal for God...an earnest desire for the honor of the sanctuary has wholly absorbed my attention."

### John Calvin:
1. "There was indeed a just cause why he should regard them with compassion rather than hatred, since he perceived that they had fallen only through ignorance, and not through malignancy of mind..."
2. "Let us hence learn where our good intentions may guide us, if we yield to them...if we seek God sincerely, let us follow the way by which alone we can come to him."
3. "And further, since we see that they perish, who with good intention wander in darkness, let us bear in mind, that we are worthy of thousand deaths, if after having been illuminated by God, we wander knowingly and willfully from the right way."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They have a seal for God, i.e., of which God is the object, not great zeal, or, godly zeal. Their zeal was religious, conscientious, but misdirected."

3. "They became zealous for the letter and the form instead of for God himself."

### John Gill:
1. "A zeal for God; for the being and unity of God, against the polytheism and idolatry of the Gentiles."
2. "Their zeal moved in a wrong way, in persecuting the church of God, in doing things contrary to the name of Christ, in putting to death his ministers and members."
3. "They did not know God in Christ, nor Jesus to be the true Messiah; they understood neither law nor Gospel truly, and fancied the Gospel was contrary to the law, and an enemy to it."

1. They have a zeal, but not according to knowledge — They had zeal without knowledge; we have knowledge without zeal.
