# Romans 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage highlights the continual rejection and obstinance of the Israelites towards God's gracious invitation. Despite His ongoing efforts to extend His hands to them, they persistently disobeyed and contradicted His words. Their refusal to accept the truth was driven by their own misguided beliefs and preconceived notions. However, the gospel's provisions are ample for all, including the disobedient and gainsaying ones. It emphasizes the importance of preaching the gospel to every person, as it is through this proclamation that people can find hope and salvation.

### Henry Alford:

2. "The words are not an address."
3. "The attitude of gracious invitation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The true cause of such rejection of saving truth, by the otherwise sincere, is the prepossession of the mind by some false notions of its own."
3. "The essential terms of salvation have in every age been the same: 'Whosoever will' is invited to 'take of the water of life freely.'"
4. "How piercingly and perpetually should that questionâ€”'HOW SHALL THEY HEAR WITHOUT A PREACHER?'â€”sound in the ears of all churches."
5. "God's dealings even with reprobate sinners are full of tenderness and compassion; all the day long extending the arms of His mercy even to the disobedient and gainsaying."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Disobedient - gainsaying [Î±Ï€ÎµÎ¹Î¸Î¿Ï…Î½Ï„Î± - Î±Î½Ï„Î¹Î»ÎµÎ³Î¿Î½Ï„Î±] . See on John 3:36; Jude 1:11. Disobedience is the manifestation of the refractoriness expressed in gainsaying. Some explain gainsaying as contradicting. Compare Luke 13:34, Luke 13:35. 

### John Calvin:
1. "However, he chiefly complains of the contempt shown to his truth; which is the more abominable, as the more remarkable is the manner by which God manifests his paternal solicitude in inviting men by his word to himself."
2. "And very emphatical is the expression, that he stretches out his hands; for by seeking our salvation through the ministers of his word, he stretches forth to us his hands no otherwise than as a father who stretches forth his arms, ready to receive his son kindly into his bosom."
3. "Their unfaithfulness is also set forth by two most suitable words. I have thought it right to render the participle á¼€Ï€ÎµÎ¹Î¸Î¿á½»Î½Ï„Î± , refractory, or rebellious, and yet the rendering of [Erasmus ] and of the Old Translator, which I have placed in the margin, is not to be wholly disapproved."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast is between 'Israel' and the Gentiles referred to in the prophecy."
2. "'Spread out,' as one who invites to his embrace, or, even supplicates; this God is represented as doing without intermission, 'the whole day.'"
3. "Probably 'disobedient' presents the positive, and 'gainsaying' the negative side of the rebellious conduct; or rebellion is distinguished into refusing Godâ€™s commands and contradicting His words, disobedience and unbelief, acting and reacting upon each other continually."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He quotes Isaiah 65:2." 
2. "Bold metaphor, only here in N.T." 
3. "The two things usually go together. Contrary and contradictory (Luke 13:34)."

### John Gill:
1. "The Lord's 'stretching out [his] hands all the day long' to them, designs the ministry of the prophets one after another to them, the preaching of John the Baptist, of Christ and his apostles among them."
2. "But they were a stiffnecked and rebellious people, uncircumcised in heart and ears; would have none of his counsel, and despised his reproof; contradicted and blasphemed the word."
3. "Rejected the Messiah and his Gospel; killed the Prince of life, and persecuted his apostles; so that it was just with God to write a 'Lo-ammi', Hosea 1:9, upon them, and cast them off."

### John Wesley:
1. An unbelieving and gainsaying people â€” Just opposite to those who believed with their hearts, and made confession with their mouths.
