# Romans 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many people are unaware of the righteousness of God, which is the means by which sinners can be justified. Instead, they strive to establish their own righteousness and gain acceptance with God through their own efforts. However, they fail to recognize that they have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God, the very path that He has set for justification. It is important for us to understand that our own righteousness cannot save us, but it is through submitting to God's righteousness that we can find true justification.
