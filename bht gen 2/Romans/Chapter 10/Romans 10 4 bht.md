# Romans 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the ultimate goal and purpose of the law. He fulfills the law, both in its ceremonial aspects and its moral principles. The law points to Christ as the means of justification and salvation, showing that righteousness comes through faith in Him alone. The law cannot give the forgiveness and eternal life that Christ offers to everyone who believes in Him, regardless of whether they are Jewish or Gentile. In Christ, the law finds its true fulfillment and the promise of righteousness is extended to all who trust in Him.
