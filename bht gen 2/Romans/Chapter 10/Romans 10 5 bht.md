# Romans 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The righteousness of the law, as described by Moses, requires complete obedience to all of God's commandments, both inwardly and outwardly. It is a righteousness that is based on works done by men, and it is impossible for anyone to fully achieve. In contrast, the life promised by the law is understood by the Jewish interpreters to be eternal life, a blessed and eternal existence. However, the righteousness that God imputes and through which a man can be justified before Him is not based on works, but is a righteousness that comes by faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (proof of the impossibility of legal righteousness, as declared even in the law itself) Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, that the man who hath done them shall live in it."
2. "As regards the life here promised, the Jewish interpreters themselves included in it more than mere earthly felicity in Canaan, and extended their view to a better life hereafter."
3. "In the New Testament, this idea (of life) is always exalted into that of life blessed and eternal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man that doeth—'hath done' those things—which it commands." 
2. "This is the one way of justification and life—by 'the righteousness which is of (or, by our own obedience to) the law.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This appeal is made to Moses, both in regard to the righteousness of the Law and that of faith, in accordance with the usual manner of Paul to sustain all his positions by the Old Testament, and to show that he was introducing no new doctrine."
2. "The righteousness which a perfect obedience to the Law of God would produce. That consisted in perfectly doing all that the Law required."
3. "The man who shall perform or obey what was declared in the previous statutes. Moses here had reference to all the commandments which God had given, moral and ceremonial."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "He now compares them; for by comparison the opposition between contrary things appears more clear."
2. "He removes this, and in the best manner, when by the teaching of the law itself he confirms the righteousness of faith."
3. "It behooved him to preach repentance and faith; but faith is not taught, except by propounding promises of divine mercy, and those gratuitous: and thus it behooved him to be a preacher of the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We here give a rendering of the text which seems to be better established. The critical questions, however, are not only numerous, but difficult to decide."
2. "The participle sums up the obedience as one act, which is the condition of 'living'; the starting-point is not faith, but the exact and full performance of that which the law requires."
3. "It has been maintained that 'live,' in Leviticus 18:5, and similar Old Testament passages, refers only to temporal prosperity, but even the Jewish interpreters included more, and certainly 'life' in the New Testament has an exalted meaning."
