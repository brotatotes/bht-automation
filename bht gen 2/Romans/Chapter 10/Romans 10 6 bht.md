# Romans 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The righteousness of faith, which is attained through believing rather than by our own efforts, speaks a different language. It urges us not to doubt or despair, for salvation does not require us to bring Christ down from heaven or raise Him from the dead. This righteousness of faith, the doctrine of justification through faith in Christ's righteousness, offers a contrasting perspective from the righteousness achieved through human actions. It reminds us that doubting and despair are unnecessary, for salvation lies in placing our trust and belief in Christ's righteousness rather than relying on our own merit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But theâ€”justifying righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wiseâ€”"speaketh thus"â€”its language or import is to this effect."
2. "Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down, c."
3. "Ye have not to sigh over the impossibility of attaining to justification as if one should say, oh! if I could but get someone to mount up to heaven and fetch me down Christ, there might be some hope, but since that cannot be, mine is a desperate case."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The scheme of justification by faith is here personified, as if it were living and describing its own effects and nature." 
2. "To see the excellency of this characteristic of the divine Law, it may be observed, that among the ancients, it was not uncommon for legislators and philosophers to travel to distant countries in pursuit of knowledge."
3. "Paul makes this use of the words because, (2) If this might be affirmed of the doctrines of Moses, much more might it of the Christian religion. Religion had no such difficult work to do as to ascend to heaven to bring down a Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The righteousness of faith describes itself."
2. "Paul recognizes a secondary meaning in Moses' words."
3. "The phrase 'say in the heart' is a Hebraism for think."

### John Calvin:
1. "If he had spoken of the law only, his reasoning would have been frivolous, since the law of God being set before their eyes, it was not easier to do it, than if it was afar off. He then means not the law only, but generally the whole of Godâ€™s truth, which includes in it the gospel."
2. "He does not, therefore, repeat verbally what Moses has said, but makes alterations, by which he accommodates more suitably to his own purpose the testimony of Moses. He spoke of inaccessible places; Paul refers to those, which are indeed hid from the sight of us all, and may yet be seen by our faith."
3. "He teaches us, that doubt on those two points is removed by the righteousness of faith; for the one would draw down Christ from heaven, and the other would bring him up again from death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But the righteousness of faith. As already indicated, â€˜butâ€™ introduces a contrast with the other â€˜righteousnessâ€™ of doing."
2. "Say not in thy heart. This phrase is = â€˜think not,â€™ but usually suggests an evil thought."
3. "That is, to bring Christ down. 'That is' introduces the explanation, but the whole clause may mean either (1.) 'Whoever asks this' question, says, in effect, who will bring Christ down? thus denying that He has come; or (2.) 'That is, in order to bring Christ down;' substituting this purpose for that expressed in Deuteronomy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He does not quote Moses as saying this or meaning this."
2. "To say in the heart is to think."
3. "Paul applies the words of Moses to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The righteousness of faith, as forbids all doubting and despair"
2. "The righteousness of faith...gives such an account...as forbids all doubting and despair"
3. "The righteousness of faith, or the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ's righteousness, forbids every thing of this kind"

### John Wesley:
1. "The righteousness which is by faith - The method of becoming righteous by believing."
2. "Speaketh a very different language, and may be considered as expressing itself thus: (to accommodate to our present subject the words which Moses spake, touching the plainness of his law)"
3. "Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, as if it were to bring Christ down: or, Who shall descend into the grave, as if it were to bring him again from the dead - Do not imagine that these things are to be done now, in order to procure thy pardon and salvation."
