# Romans 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase  :- refers to the impossibility of someone descending. This phrase is similar to Who shall descend, which is a proverbial expression of impossibility. The idea of descending is also connected to the concept of bringing up Christ, who has already risen from the dead. This passage depicts the descent of Christ into Hades, the realm of the dead. It is through the deity and resurrection of Christ that faith in salvation is accomplished. Today, these two points of attack by skeptics challenge the beliefs of believers.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 7. Or, Who shall descend,
	c.—another case of impossibility, suggested by  :-, and perhaps also Amos 9:2

Proverbs 24:7, &c.).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The words as used by Moses refer to what is remote, and therefore difficult to be obtained."
2. "In the same sense Paul uses the word 'deep,' ἄβυσσον abusson - 'the abyss.'"
3. "That is, to bring up Christ ... - Justification by faith had no such difficult and impossible work to perform as would be an attempt for man to raise the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul changes the phrase in order to adapt it to the descent of Christ into Hades."
2. "The two ideas may be reconciled in the fact that the Jew conceived the sea as the abyss of waters on which the earth rested."
3. "To bring up. There is no need. He is already risen."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The descent of Christ to the realm of the dead ‘is in any case the undoubted presupposition, which led Paul to substitute the words of our passage for those of the original’ (Meyer)." 
2. "The anxious follower after righteousness is not disappointed by an impracticable code, nor mocked by an unintelligible revelation; the word is near him, therefore accessible; plain and simple and therefore apprehensible deals with definite historical fact, and therefore certain’ (Alford)."
3. "All the doing demanded from man by the law...has been already perfectly accomplished by Christ...There only remains then to man, in order to be saved, to believe in that work by applying it to himself; and this is that which the righteousness of faith commands us..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Into the abyss." - See Luke 8:31 for this old Greek word, bottomless like sea, our abyss. In Revelation 9:1 it is the place of torment. Paul seems to refer to Hades or Sheol, the other world to which Christ went after death. 
2. "To bring Christ up." - Second aorist active infinitive of αναγω and dependent on καταβησετα (shall descend). Christ has already risen from the dead. 
3. "The deity and resurrection of Christ are precisely the two chief points of attack today on the part of sceptics."

### John Gill:
1.  :-.
