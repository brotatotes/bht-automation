# Romans 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thine heart means that the gospel message, which contains blessings and promises of grace, is easily accessible and understandable. It is the word of faith, preached by the apostles, that brings salvation. By embracing this word of faith and confessing it with our mouths, we can experience the righteousness that comes from faith in Christ. Through faith and confession, we can receive the grace of God and be saved.
