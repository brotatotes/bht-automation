# Romans 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The duty of openly confessing Jesus as Lord is a vital aspect of the gospel message, demonstrating our agreement and alignment with God's declarations. This confession requires a sincere and heartfelt belief that Christ is our Savior. It involves acknowledging Him as the incarnate Lord, adorning Him with His own divine power. A true confession goes beyond a mere assent to historical facts, requiring a deep trust in Christ's resurrection and a surrender to Him as our ultimate authority. Through this confession and belief, we can experience true salvation and be transformed by God's grace.
