## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Be it not so: for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin." 
2. "This seems better to agree with μὴ γένοιτο, as deprecating the consequence of such an assertion." 
3. "Thus the covenant of God with Israel, having been national, shall ultimately be fulfilled to them as a nation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle teaches that, in two respects, Israel was not 'cast away'; First, Not totally; Second, Not finally." 
2. "Israel is not wholly cast away. for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The objection, as will be seen by the answer which Paul makes, is formed on the supposition that God had rejected 'all his people,' or 'cast them off entirely.'" 
2. "At the same time, however, the doctrine which Paul had maintained was true, that God had taken away their exclusive and special privileges, and had rejected a large part of the nation."
3. "If I should say that all Jews must be excluded from the favor of God, then I also must be without hope of salvation, for I am a Jew."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

2. "That it should fail through any perfidiousness of men...howsoever great the unfaithfulness of men may be, which may tend to abolish it."
3. "Before he proceeds to the subject, he proves...how unreasonable it was to think that the nation was utterly forsaken by God...it was an evidence that God’s favor rested on Israel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The divine act of casting off from Himself is not viewed as the cause, but as the penal consequence, of disdaining God’s loving will."
2. "The rejection of the Jews as a nation was consistent with all that God had promised to their fathers."
3. "The restoration of Israel as a nation is so prominent, that 'if such a hypothesis were to be conceded, it would exclude from God’s kingdom the writer himself as an Israelite.'"

1. "God has not cast away the men of the captivity, though they are under the chastisements of God; but it is fit that they should every day obtain salvation by the hands of Messiah, the Son of David."
2. "God had chosen him unto eternal salvation, Christ had redeemed him by his blood, and he was effectually called by grace; and as to his eternal state, he had no doubt or scruple about it."
3. "God had made him a minister of the Gospel, had greatly qualified him for that work, had raised him to the high office of an apostle, and had made him very useful to the souls of many, both Jews and Gentiles; and yet he was one of the nation of the Jews, and therefore God had not cast them all away, as the objection insinuates."

### John Wesley:
1. Hath God rejected his whole people — All Israel? In no wise. Now there is "a remnant" who believe, Romans 11:5; and hereafter "all Israel will be saved," Romans 11:26.
