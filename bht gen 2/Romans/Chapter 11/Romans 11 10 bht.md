# Romans 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their eyes, once bright and perceptive, have now become dark; a punishment that signifies not only their physical inability to see, but also their spiritual blindness. The darkened eyes symbolize their humbled and servile state, where they are unable to recognize the beauty and glory of Christ. Their focus is solely on material pursuits, with a complete disregard for higher truths and heavenly matters. They are burdened with a sense of captivity, weighed down by their own earthly desires. However, even in this darkness, there is a glimmer of hope, as God has not completely abandoned His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Instead of bending the back, the Heb. text speaks of making the loins to tremble, מָתְנֵיהֶם הַמְעַד. This elsewhere is a sign of great terror..." 
2. "The darkening of the eyes betokens in the Psalm, a weakened, humbled, servile condition, just as in Deuteronomy 28:65-67."
3. "The Apostle might well apply such a description to the servile condition of the bondmen of the law, see Galatians 4:24."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle's object in making these quotations is to show that what he had been compelled to say of the then condition and prospects of his nation was more than borne out by their own Scriptures."
2. "God has not cast away His people finally."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Bow down [συγκαμψον] . Lit., bend together. Hebrew, shake the loins.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reference is not to old age, but to some more sudden blinding. This verse explains the ‘recompense’ of Romans 11:9. Spiritual blindness is one form of the punishment."
2. "The Hebrew means: ‘make their loins to waver,’ but the LXX., here followed closely, presents the same thought under another figure. Present loss of strength is meant, representing spiritual servitude, under the yoke of legalism, rather than that of Roman conquerors."
3. "Meyer thinks the retribution is for want of faith in Christ; Godet, with more reason, says: ‘the rejection of Jesus by the Jews was the effect, not the cause of the hardening. The cause Paul has said clearly enough (chap. Romans 9:31-33) was the obstinacy of their own righteousness.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let their eyes be darkened" - A terrible imprecation. 
2. "That they may not see" - Repeated from verse Romans 11:8. 
3. "Bow down" - To bend together as of captives whose backs were bent under burdens. Only here in N.T.

### John Gill:
1. "Which is to be understood not literally of their being struck with blindness, as the men of Sodom were by the angels, and as Elymas the sorcerer was by the Apostle Paul; but mystically, of the eyes of their understandings being darkened..."
2. "...their eyes were so blinded, that they could see no beauty nor comeliness in him; no excellency in his person, nothing wonderful in his works, nor amiable in his doctrine..."
3. "...for they mind nothing but earth and earthly things; the acquiring of which they are bent upon at any rate, and are infamous for their earthly mindedness, covetousness, extortion, usury, tricking, and overreaching..."
