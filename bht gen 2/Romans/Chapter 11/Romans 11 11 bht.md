# Romans 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The stumbling and falling of the Jews does not indicate their permanent and complete downfall; rather, it is a temporary slip. The Gentiles have received salvation as a result of this slip, which in turn is meant to provoke the Jews to jealousy and lead them to seek the Lord. This displays the purposeful plan of God, who desires the restoration and salvation of both Jews and Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle is arguing respecting God’s intent in the παράπτωμα of the Jewish nation. He here calls it by this mild name to set forth that it is not final."
2. "He regards the λοιποί as the representatives of the Jewish people, who have nationally stumbled, but not in order to their final fall."
3. "By this stumble of the Jews out of their national place in God’s favour, and the admission of the Gentiles into it, the very people thus excluded are to be stirred up to set themselves in the end effectually to regain, as a nation, that pre-eminence from which they are now degraded."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did they stumble that they should fall? God forbid"
2. "Salvation is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy"
3. "Emulation is a legitimate stimulus to what is good"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Is it the design of God that the Jews should totally and irrecoverably be cast off?"
2. "The rejection and fall of the Jews contributed to the introduction of the Gentiles."
3. "The calamities that came upon the Jewish nation scattered the inhabitants of Judea, and with the Jews also those who had become Christians, and thus the gospel was carried to other lands."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle denies that the salvation of the Jews was to be despaired of, or that they were so rejected by God, that there was to be no future restoration, or that the covenant of grace, which he had once made with them, was entirely abolished, since there had ever remained in that nation the seed of blessing."
2. "The fall of the Jews had turned out for salvation to the Gentiles; but to this end — that they might be kindled by a sort of jealousy, and be thus led to repentance."
3. "Since then it was the Lord’s purpose that Israel should be provoked to emulation, they were not so fallen as to be precipitated into eternal ruin; but that God's blessing, despised by them, might come to the Gentiles, in order that they might at length be also stirred up to seek the Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact of stumbling is not, however, denied, since that has been affirmed in chap. Romans 11:32-33, nor yet the existence of a divine purpose (‘that’ = in order that) in connection with that fact, but as the context shows, the Apostle denies that this purpose was the final fall (i.e., eternal destruction) of the nation." 
2. "This view alone accords with the close of the chapter."
3. "The salvation of the Gentiles was therefore the immediate purpose, but there was a further design, namely, bringing about the final salvation of the Jews by stirring them up to emulation, or, zeal (‘jealousy’ has a bad sense not implied in the original). This twofold purpose forms the theme of the whole section."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did they stumble that they might fall? Negative answer expected by μη as in verse Romans 11:1." 
2. "For to provoke them to jealousy (εις το παραζηλωσα). Purpose expressed by εις and the articular infinitive, first aorist active, of παραζηλοω, for which verb see 1 Corinthians 10:22."
3. "Fulness (πληρωμα). Perhaps 'completion,' though the word from πληροω, to fill, has a variety of senses, that with which anything is filled (1 Corinthians 10:26; 1 Corinthians 10:28), that which is filled (Ephesians 1:23)."

### John Gill:
1. "...the end which God had in view, in suffering the Jews to stumble and fall, was not their destruction, but rather the salvation of the Gentiles..."
2. "...through their fall, salvation is come unto the Gentiles."
3. "...to provoke the Jews to jealousy...when being convinced of their sin in rejecting the Messiah, and observing the many advantages the Gentiles have received by embracing him, and they have lost by their contempt of him, will be provoked to an holy emulation of them, and be stirred up through their means to seek the Lord their God..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have they stumbled so as to fall — Totally and finally? No"
2. "By their fall - Or slip: it is a very soft word in the original."
3. "Salvation is come to the Gentiles — See an instance of this, Acts 13:46."
4. "To provoke them — The Jews themselves, to jealousy."
