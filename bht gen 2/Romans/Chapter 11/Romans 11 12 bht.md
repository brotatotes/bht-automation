# Romans 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fulfillment of the prophecies about the restoration of Israel as a nation is a remarkable event that should dispel any doubts. This fulfillment is further supported by the fact that the Jewish people have been preserved as a distinct group throughout history. When this restoration is finally accomplished, it will provide a compelling evidence for the truth of both the Old and New Testament, potentially convincing many who doubt the validity of Christianity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "if their trespass is the world’s wealth (the occasion of that wealth, the wealth itself being the participation in the unsearchable riches of Christ), and their loss, the wealth of the Gentiles, how much more (shall) their replenishment (be all this)?"
2. "Thus the argument will stand: ‘If their unbelief (i.e. of one part of them) is the world’s wealth, and their small number (i.e. of believers, the other part of them), the wealth of the Gentiles, how much more their full (restored) number!’"
3. "Israel is the nation, the covenant people, the vehicle of God’s gracious purposes to mankind... If then the disgrace of Israel has had such a blessed accompaniment, how much more blessed a one shall Israel’s honour bring with it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But if their trespass be the riches of the Gentile world—as being the occasion of their accession to Christ."
2. "If an event so untoward as Israel's fall was the occasion of such unspeakable good to the Gentile world, of how much greater good may we expect an event so blessed as their full recovery to be productive?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The gospel is called riches, as it is the means of our highest enjoyment, and eternal welfare."
2. "The Jews have shown that they are eminently suited to spread the true religion."
3. "Their conversion would be, therefore, to give to the church a host of missionaries prepared for their work, familiar with all customs, languages, and climes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Diminishing [ηττημα]. The literal translation. Rev. renders loss. Referring apparently to the diminution in numbers of the Jewish people."
2. "Fullness [πληρωμα]. See on John 1:16. The word may mean that with which anything is filled..."
3. "Here in the first sense: the fullness of their number contrasted with the diminution. They will belong as an integral whole to the people of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "To prove this, he derives an argument from the less, — 'If their fall had raised the Gentiles, and their diminution had enriched them, how much more their fullness?' for the first was done contrary to nature, and the last will be done according to a natural order of things."
2. "For if they had received it, their faith would have brought forth much more fruit than their unbelief had occasioned; for the truth of God would have been thereby confirmed by being accomplished in them, and they also themselves would have led many by their teaching, whom they, on the contrary, by their perverseness, had turned aside."
3. "The reason for the restatement of the first clause seems to be this, — that the fall might not be deemed as total, but in part; it wasἣττημα, a less part, a diminution, a lessening of their number in God’s kingdom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that the nation, regarded as the people of God, had been thus reduced proved to be the riches of the Gentiles, i.e., thus the Gentile nations were enriched through the Gospel preached to them."
2. "If the diminution of Israel through unbelief had such a blessed result, how much more their full number when they as a nation become believers."
3. "Some find here their full restoration or blessedness, contrasted with their impoverishment (‘diminishing’). But this leaves out of view the numerical sense, giving to both the contrasted terms a less obvious meaning, and identifies the thought of this verse with that of Romans 11:15."

### John Gill:
1. "The fall of the Jews, which was a lessening of them, was the riches of the Gentiles."
2. "The few that did believe were the means of carrying and spreading the Gospel, which is, 'the unsearchable riches of Christ', in the Gentile world."
3. "This handful of men that went out of Judea were the means of converting vast numbers, large multitudes of souls among the Gentiles, which may be also designed by 'riches'."

### John Wesley:
1. "So many prophecies refer to this grand event, that it is surprising any Christian can doubt of it."
2. "These are greatly confirmed by the wonderful preservation of the Jews as a distinct people to this day."
3. "When it is accomplished, it will be so strong a demonstration, both of the Old and New Testament revelation, as will doubtless convince many thousand Deists, in countries nominally Christian."
