# Romans 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of the Jews has led to the reconciliation of the Gentiles, and if this rejection has resulted in such a great blessing, then their acceptance will surely bring even greater blessings. The restoration of the Jewish people will be a remarkable event, like a resurrection from the dead. This revival of a people once considered lost will bring new life and spread the true religion throughout the world, which was dead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If the rejection of them be the occasion of the reconciliation of the world, what will be their reception, but the occasion of life from the dead!"
2. "It may mean that 'life from the dead' literally should follow on the restoration of the Jewish people; i.e. that the Resurrection, the great consummation, is bound up with it."
3. "The Apostle would hardly have used ζωὴ ἐκ νεκρῶν thus predicatively, if he had meant by it a fixed and predetermined event; but that, standing as it does, it must be qualitative, implying some further blessed state of the reconciled world, over and above the mere reconciliation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They were cast away, though neither totally nor finally, and it is of this partial and temporary rejection that the apostle here speaks."
2. "The reception of the whole family of Israel… will be such a stupendous manifestation of the power of God upon the spirits of men, and of His glorious presence with the heralds of the Cross, as will not only kindle devout astonishment far and wide, but so change the dominant mode of thinking and feeling on all spiritual things as to seem like a resurrection from the dead."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "If their rejection as the special people of God - their exclusion from their national privileges, on account of their unbelief."
2. "The word 'reconciliation' καταλλαγή katallagē denotes commonly a pacification of contending parties; a removing the occasion of difference, so as again to be united."
3. "He uses, therefore, a most bold and striking figure. The resurrection of the dead was an image of the most vast and wonderful event that could take place."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The casting away [η αποβολη] . In contrast with receiving. Only here and Acts 27:22, where it means loss. Here exclusion from God's people."
2. "Reconciling of the world [καταλλαγη κοσμου]. See on ch. Romans 5:10, Romans 5:11. Defining the phrase riches of the world in ver. 12."
3. "Life from the dead. The exact meaning cannot be determined. Some refer it to the resurrection to follow the conversion of Israel, including the new life which the resurrection will inaugurate. Others, a new spiritual life. Others combine the two views."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since the rejection of the Jews has availed so much as to occasion the reconciling of the Gentiles, how much more effectual will be their resumption? Will it not be to raise them even from the dead?"
2. "For Paul ever insists on this, that the Gentiles have no cause for envy, as though the restoration of the Jews to favor were to render their condition worse. Since then God has wonderfully drawn forth life from death and light from darkness, how much more ought we to hope [...] that the resurrection of a people, as it were, wholly dead, will bring life to the Gentiles."
3. "The restoration of the Jews unto God’s favor will occasion the revival and spread of true religion through the whole Gentile world."

### Philip Schaff:
(1.) "The reception to salvation of the Jewish nation as a whole; comp. Romans 11:12, where the numerical phase of the comparison is brought out. That they would be thus received is the leading thought of the entire chapter."
(2.) "Evidently the Apostle has in mind something beyond ‘the reconciliation of the world,’ some greater blessing than the gradual conversion of the Gentiles through the gospel, and this he terms ‘life from the dead.’"
(3.) "To combine the two views seems improper, as Meyer affirms, yet his own explanation scarcely differs from a combination of the literal and figurative interpretations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The casting away of them...in N.T. only here and Acts 27:22." 
2. "It explains verse Romans 11:12." 
3. "The receiving...only here in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "The argument...is from the lesser to the greater, showing that as the Gentiles received present advantage through the rejection of the Jews, they would receive far greater at their future recovery."
2. "By the receiving of them is meant the conversion of the Jews in the latter day...and this their restoration will be as 'life from the dead'."
3. "It will be as unexpected by them, and as surprising to them, as a person's being raised from the dead would be; yea as joyful, and as welcome to them, as if a man received his nearest relation and friend from the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. Life from the dead — Overflowing life to the world, which was dead.
