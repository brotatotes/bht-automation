# Romans 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The analogy of offering firstfruits teaches us about consecration and holiness. Just as the consecration of the first portion sanctified the entire harvest, the conversion of a few Jews signifies the eventual conversion of the entire Jewish nation. The holiness of the patriarchs, represented by the root, extends to their descendants. Thus, the conversion of a remnant within the Jewish community gives hope for the redemption and sanctification of the entire nation.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The argument of the apostle is, that as the separation unto God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the rest of mankind, as the parent stem of their race, was as real an offering of first-fruits as that which hallowed the produce of the earth, so, in the divine estimation, it was as real a separation of the mass or 'lump' of that nation in all time to God."
2. "The figure of the 'root' and its 'branches' is of like import‚Äîthe consecration of the one of them extending to the other."
3. "The Israelites were required to offer to God the first-fruits of the earth‚Äîboth in their raw state, in a sheaf of newly reaped grain, and in their prepared state, made into cakes of dough‚Äîby which the whole produce of that season was regarded as hallowed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The first-fruits were regarded as among the best portions of the harvest; and it was their duty to devote to God that which would be the best expression of their thanksgiving."
2. "By this illustration Paul doubtless means to say that the Jewish nation, as a people, were set apart to the service of God, and were so regarded by him."
3. "If they [the root, referring to Abraham and the patriarchs] were holy, it is to be expected that the distant branches, or descendants, would also be so regarded."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The apparent confusion of metaphor, first - fruit, lump, is resolved by the fact that first - fruit does not apply exclusively to harvest, but is the general term for the first portion of every thing which was offered to God."
2. "The reference here is to Numbers 14:18-21; according to which the Israelites were to set apart a portion of the dough of each baking of bread for a cake for the priests. This was called ajparch, first - fruits."
3. "The same thought under another figure. The second figure is more comprehensive, since it admits an application to the conversion of the Gentiles."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us remember that in this comparison man is not compared with man, but nation with nation."
2. "He hence concludes, that from them an heredity holiness had passed to all their posterity."
3. "It is not then a strange thing that the Jews were sanctified in their father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This suggests a reason for expecting this ‚Äòreceiving‚Äô of the Jews, namely, the consecrated character impressed on this people, when they were separated from other nations."
2. "The ‚Äòfirstfruit,‚Äô it is generally agreed, refers to the patriarchs, with whom the covenant was made by which Israel became the theocratic people."
3. "God, in selecting the Hebrew patriarchs, and setting them apart for His service, had reference to their descendants, as well as to themselves; and designed that the Jews, as a people, should, to the latest generations, be specially devoted to Himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The metaphor is from Numbers 15:19. The LXX has Œ±œÄŒ±œÅœáŒ∑ŒΩ œÜœÖœÅŒ±ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ, first of the dough as a heave offering."
2. "The lump (œÑŒø œÜœÖœÅŒ±ŒºŒ±). From which the first fruit came."
3. "The root (Œ∑ œÅŒπŒ∂Œ±). Perhaps Abraham singly here. The metaphor is changed, but the idea is the same."

### John Gill:
1. "By them are intended the first converts among the Jews, under the Gospel dispensation; it being usual with the apostle to call those persons, that were first converted in any place, the firstfruits of it."
2. "The apostle's argument is, 'if the firstfruit be holy', the lump is also holy, and if the root be holy, so are the branches; that is, that those persons who were converted among the Jews, however few in number, and despicable in appearance they might be, yet were truly sanctified by the Spirit of God."
3. "The allusion in the former clause is to the holy offerings of firstfruits to the Lord, the two wave loaves, whereby the whole lump was sanctified, for after use throughout the year following; and that in the latter clause, to the holiness of trees devoted to sacred use or that were planted in a field appropriated thereunto."

### John Wesley:
1. "The consecration of them was esteemed the consecration of all and so the conversion of a few Jews is an earnest of the conversion of all the rest."
2. "And if the root be holy ‚Äî The patriarchs from whom they spring, surely God will at length make their descendants also holy."
