# Romans 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The branches broken off represent the unbelieving Israelites who were cast away due to their unbelief and sin. The Gentiles, represented by the wild olive, were grafted in among the remaining believing Israelites. In this process, the Gentiles should not boast over the Jews, for they receive their spiritual life and blessings through the Jews. This grafting of the Gentiles into the people of God is a remarkable work of God's grace, as it defies natural expectations. Both Jews and Gentiles are united in the same faith, sharing in the same privileges and foundation of the apostles and prophets.
