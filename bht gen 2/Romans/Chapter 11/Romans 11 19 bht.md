# Romans 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of the Jews and their replacement by the Gentiles was not an arbitrary decision, but a deliberate plan to extend God's grace to the Gentiles. The Gentiles should not boast in their place in the church, thinking they are more deserving, but should humbly acknowledge the favor of God. The breaking off of the branches of the Jews serves as a reminder that faith, not lineage, is the basis for being grafted into the kingdom of God.
