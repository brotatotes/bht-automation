# Romans 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God hasn't forsaken those whom he knew beforehand. His chosen people, those he had a special relationship with, were selected by him from the beginning. Despite outward appearances, God deeply loves and cares for them, even when he has to confront them about their disobedience. Just as in the example of Elijah, when it seemed like the entire nation had turned away, God always preserves a remnant of faithful followers.

2. "Wot ye not that the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession, pleadeth against Israel."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "God will not reject those who are foreknown or designated as his friends. It is a part of the plan, therefore, that those who are truly renewed shall persevere, and obtain eternal life."

1. "The phrase ‘which He foreknew’ need not be taken in its individual reference, as in chap. Romans 8:36, where a plural pronoun is joined with the verb."
2. "To limit it to those elected is not only contrary to the sweep of the argument, but to the historical position of the theocratic nation: a foreknowledge resulting in such theocratic privilege is as consistent with the tenor of Scripture as the more individual reference."
3. "'Pleading against' is equivalent to complaining of. 'Saying' is an unnecessary addition, supported by few authorities."
