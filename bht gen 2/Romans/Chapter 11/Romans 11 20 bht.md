# Romans 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because of their unbelief, they were cut off, but you stand by faith. This is not a cause for boasting, for your position is not due to your own merits, but to the grace of God. Therefore, let us not be proud or look down on others, but instead be humble, recognizing that our standing before God is a result of His gift of faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prompting cause of their excision, their unbelief, is distinct from the divine purpose of their excision, the admission of the Gentiles, and belongs to a different side of the subject."
2. "Through their unbelief (or perhaps, ‘through unbelief,’ abstract. There is often a difficulty in distinguishing the possessive from the abstract (i.e. generic) article."
3. "We should always say that we are justified through, not by, faith, but that we stand by, not through, faith."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Be it so, but remember that because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest—not as a Gentile, but solely by faith." 
2. "But as faith cannot live in those whose soul is lifted up. Be not high-minded, but fear."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou standest by faith - The continuance of these mercies to you depends on your fidelity."
2. "Do not be high-minded - Do not be elated in the conception of your privileges, so as to produce vain self-confidence and boasting."
3. "But fear - This fear stands opposed to the spirit of boasting and self-confidence, against which he was exhorting them. It does not mean terror or horror, but it denotes humility, watchfulness, and solicitude to abide in the faith."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Well [καλως] . Admitting the fact. Thou art right. Compare Mark 12:32. Some take it as ironical.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not necessarily ironical; but an admission of both the fact and the purpose of the breaking off of the branches."
2. "'Thou' is emphatic, while 'standest' refers to the position as a branch, rather than to standing as opposed to falling."
3. "Fear is opposed, not to faith, but to superciliousness and security."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Well (καλως). Perhaps ironical, though Paul may simply admit the statement (cf. Mark 12:32) and show the Gentile his real situation."
2. "By unbelief (τη απιστια)--by faith (πιστε). Instrumental case with both contrasted words (by unbelief, by belief)."

### John Gill:
1. "Because of their unbelief and contempt of the Messiah, they were rejected of God, and died in their sins."
2. "It was not by their merits, but by the grace of God that they were in the situation they were."
3. "The apostle would have them not be elated with their gifts, privileges, and enjoyments, and look over others, or down upon them with contempt and disdain."

### John Wesley:
1. "They were broken off for unbelief, and thou standest by faith." 
2. "Both conditionally, not absolutely: if absolutely, there might have been room to boast."
3. "By faith — The free gift of God, which therefore ought to humble thee."
