# Romans 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If God did not spare the natural branches, then we as ingrafted branches should not become arrogant. We should be cautious and not think highly of ourselves, but fear the possibility of being rejected by God. This warning applies to both Jews and Gentiles, reminding us that our election is based on God's purpose and should not lead to pride. We must take heed to avoid despising what God has appointed and instead humbly trust in Him.
