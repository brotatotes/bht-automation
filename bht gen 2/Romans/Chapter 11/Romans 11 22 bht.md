# Romans 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle reminds us to consider both the grace and kindness of God towards some, as well as his severity and strict justice towards others. This reminder serves to humble us and guard against pride and arrogance. God's judgment towards those who reject him is not to be taken lightly. If we do not continue to abide in his goodness, we too will face being cut off. It is important to value and appreciate the riches of God's goodness and remain faithful to him.
