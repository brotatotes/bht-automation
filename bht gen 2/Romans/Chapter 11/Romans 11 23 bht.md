# Romans 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the unbelieving Jews do not persist in their rejection of the Messiah, they have the potential to be grafted back into the fold. The apostle emphasizes the power of God in bringing about this restoration and awakening of faith in them. This demonstrates the immense difficulty involved in this process, as it requires the removal of their unbelief and the reingrafting of the entire nation. God's ability to accomplish this is crucial, as it reveals His mercy amidst the judgment on unbelief.
