# Romans 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The grafting of the wild olive branch into the fruitful olive tree is a remarkable example of divine grace, as it goes against the natural order of things. Normally, we graft a fruitful branch into a wild stock, but in this case, the wild branch is grafted into the fruitful stock. This highlights the power of God's grace, which separates the believers from the rest of the world and brings them into the ministration of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If thou wert cut out of the wild olive which is thine naturally, and wert engrafted contrary to (thy) nature into the good olive, how much more shall these, the natural branches."
2. "We either should expect the οἱ to be omitted (as is done in some mss.), or must, with Fritz., place a comma after οὗτοι, and, taking οἱ as the relative, construe, 'How much more these, who shall, agreeably to (their) nature, be grafted,' &c."
3. "We must at least assume a mixture of the two meanings, the antithesis of κατὰ and παρὰ φ. being rather verbal than logical, as is so common in the writings of the Apostle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the excision of the merely engrafted Gentiles through unbelief is a thing much more to be expected than was the excision of the natural Israel, before it happened."
2. "The restoration of Israel, when they shall be brought to believe in Jesus, is a thing far more in the line of what we should expect."
3. "The admission of the Gentiles to a standing which they never before enjoyed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That is, if you were introduced into a state of favor with God from a condition which was one of enmity and hostility to him."
2. "Contrary to your natural habits, thoughts, and practices. There was among the Gentiles no inclination or tendency toward God."
3. "If God had mercy on the Gentiles, who were outcasts from his favor, shall he not much rather on those who were so long his people, to whom had been given the promises, and the covenants, and the Law, whose ancestors had been so many of them his friends, and among whom the Messiah was born?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Contrary to nature. See remarks on ver. 17.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For introduces the entire verse as a proof of the probability that the Jews will ultimately be grafted in again, not of the statement that God is able to graft them in." 
2. "Contrary to nature suggesting, not the greater difficulty, but the antecedent improbability of the fact." 
3. "The fact of congruity of nature ('their own olive tree') is set against incongruity, as making the re-engrafting more probable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "He put the wild olive (Gentile) into the good olive tree (the spiritual Israel) and made the wild olive (contrary to nature) become the good olive."
3. "God can graft the natural Israel back upon the spiritual Israel, if they become willing."

### John Gill:
1. "...the ministration of the Gospel, by the power of divine grace separated from the rest of the world..."
2. "...this ingrafting was not of nature, it was contrary to it; but of pure grace, and sovereign good will and pleasure..."
3. "...that there is a greater likelihood, and more easily may it be, according to all appearance of things, that the Jews, the natural branches or descendants of Abraham, should be brought into a Gospel church state..."
