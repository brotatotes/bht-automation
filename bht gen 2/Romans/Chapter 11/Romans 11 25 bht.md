# Romans 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The revealed truth of God's plan for the salvation of both Jews and Gentiles is referred to as a mystery. This mystery, once hidden, has now been made known to all. Despite the partial hardening of Israel, there is hope for their future salvation. This hardening of Israel is not an unfortunate occurrence, but rather a result of the divine will. The fullness of the Gentiles refers to a significant number, signaling a great harvest among the nations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (I do not rest this on mere hope or probability, but have direct revelation of the Holy Spirit as to its certainty) I would not have you ignorant, brethren...of this mystery..." 
2. "...that ye be not wise in your own conceits...that hardening has happened in part..." 
3. "In order to understand τὸ πλήρ . τ . ἐθν ., we must bear in mind the character of the Apostle’s present argument...The πλήρωμα τῶν ἐθνῶν I would regard then as signifying 'the full number,' 'the totality,' of the nations, i.e. every nation under heaven..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word 'mystery'...does not mean (as with us) something incomprehensible, but 'something before kept secret, either wholly or for the most part, and now only fully disclosed.'" 
2. "lest ye should be wise in your own conceits—as if ye alone were in all time coming to be the family of God."
3. "until the Gentiles have had their full time of the visible Church all to themselves while the Jews are out, which the Jews had till the Gentiles were brought in."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'mystery' means properly what is 'concealed, hidden, or unknown.' And it especially refers, in the New Testament, to the truths or doctrines which God had reserved to himself, or had not before communicated."
2. "Rather than leave them to vain speculations and self-gratulation, he chose to cut short all inquiry, by stating the truth about; their present and future state."
3. "Probably the meaning is, that this blindness is to continue until great numbers of the Gentiles shall be converted; until the gospel shall be extensively spread; and then the conversion of the Jews will be a part of the rapid spread of the gospel, and will be among the most efficient and important aids in completing the work."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mystery [μυστηριον]...illustrates the use of the word in passages like Matthew 13:11, 'mysteries of the kingdom of heaven' - secret purposes or counsels which God intends to carry into effect in His kingdom." 
2. "Blindness [πωρωσις]...Rev., hardening."
3. "In part [απο μερους]...Construe here with hath happened: has partially befallen. Not partial hardening, but hardening extending over a part."

### John Calvin:
1. "And whenever a long delay tempts us to despair, let us remember this word mystery; by which Paul clearly reminds us, that the mode of their conversion will neither be common nor usual; and hence they act absurdly who attempt to measure it by their own judgment."
2. "That God had in a manner so blinded Israel, that while they refused the light of the gospel, it might be transferred to the Gentiles, and that these might occupy, as it were, the vacated possession."
3. "The fullness of the Gentiles is to be taken for a great number: for it was not to be, as before, when a few proselytes connected themselves with the Jews; but such was to be the change, that the Gentiles would form almost the entire body of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The decisive proof (‘for’) that the Jews shall be grafted in again... is found in the prophetic announcement now made by the Apostle."
2. "On the New Testament use of the word ‘mystery,’ see notes on Ephesians 1:9. It does not have the classical sense, but usually refers to a matter of fact, undiscovered by men themselves, which is made known to them by revelation from God."
3. "This is the second fact revealed, namely, that this hardening (‘in part’) will continue until another event occurs."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This mystery...the revealed will of God now made known to all...far superior to man's wisdom." 
2. "Paul refuses to believe that no more Jews will be saved."
3. "Until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in."

### John Gill:
1. "What he had to acquaint them with was a 'mystery', a thing secret and hidden."
2. "Blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in."
3. "This blindness 'happened' to them not by chance, but befell them by the decree, and according to the will of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Paul calls any truth known but to a few, a mystery."
2. "Hardness in part is happened to Israel, till — Israel therefore is neither totally nor finally rejected."
3. "The fullness of the gentiles be come in — Till there be a vast harvest amongst the heathens."
