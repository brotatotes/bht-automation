# Romans 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Gentiles come to believe, it will convince the Jews to turn back to God. This restoration of the Jewish people will be a great harvest, just as there will be a larger harvest among the Gentiles. While the Deliverer has already come, the full outcome of his coming is still to come: all Israel will be saved, fulfilling the prophecy found in Isaiah 59:20.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All Israel shall be saved." - Israel as a nation, not individuals, nor is there the slightest ground for the notion of the ἀποκατάστασις.
2. "The Redeemer was to come for the behoof of God's own chosen people."
3. "The citation is intended to express the sense of prophecy rather than the wording of any particular passage, and that the Apostle has, in ἐκ Σιών, summed up the prophecies which declare that the Redeemer should spring out of Israel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To understand this great statement, as some still do, merely of such a gradual inbringing of individual Jews, that there shall at length remain none in unbelief, is to do manifest violence both to it and to the whole context."
2. "He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. The apostle, having drawn his illustrations of man's sinfulness chiefly from Psalms 14:1-7; Isaiah 59:1-21, now seems to combine the language of the same two places regarding Israel's salvation from it."
3. "But as all the glorious manifestations of Israel's God were regarded as issuing out of Zion, as the seat of His manifested glory, the turn which the apostle gives to the words merely adds to them that familiar idea."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And so - That is, in this manner; or when the great abundance of the Gentiles shall be converted, then all Israel shall be saved."
2. "He does not mean to say that every Jew of every age would be saved; for he had proved that a large portion of them would be, in his time, rejected and lost. But the time would come when, as a people, they would be recovered; when the nation would turn to God; and when it could be said of them that, as a nation, they were restored to the divine favor."
3. "There can be no doubt that Isaiah refers here to the times of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The goel was the nearest kinsman of a childless widow, and was required to marry her."
2. "It is the word used by Job in the celebrated passage Job 19:25."
3. "See, also, Ruth 3:12, Ruth 3:13; Ruth 4:1-10. Ruth 4:5 Ruth 4:9."

### John Calvin:
1. "When the Gentiles shall come in, the Jews also shall return from their defection to the obedience of faith; and thus shall be completed the salvation of the whole Israel of God, which must be gathered from both; and yet in such a way that the Jews shall obtain the first place, being as it were the first-born in God’s family."
2. "The Israel of God is what he calls the Church, gathered alike from Jews and Gentiles; and he sets the people, thus collected from their dispersion, in opposition to the carnal children of Abraham, who had departed from his faith."
3. "For that Scripture calls all the people of God Israelites, is to be ascribed to the pre-eminence of that nation, whom God had preferred to all other nations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The view now generally adopted is: that the ancient people of God shall be restored, as a nation, to God's favor."
2. "As in Romans 11:25, it is not implied that every individual Jew will be converted; but probably the proportion will be greater than in the case of the Gentiles, since 'all' is more definite."
3. "The prophecies are introduced to confirm the last statement: 'and thus all Israel shall be saved.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All Israel... may be his idea in accord with Romans 9:6 (Galatians 6:16) as the climax of the argument."

### John Gill:

2. "but the people of the Jews, the generality of them, the body of that nation, called 'the fulness' of them..."
3. "... when they as a body, even the far greater part of them that shall be in being, shall return and seek the Lord their God, and David their King; shall acknowledge Jesus to be the true Messiah, and shall look to him, believe on him, and be saved by him from wrath to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "And so all Israel shall be saved - Being convinced by the coming of the gentiles."
2. "But there will be a still larger harvest among the gentiles, when all Israel is come in."
3. "The deliverer shall come - Yea, the deliverer is come; but not the full fruit of his coming. Isaiah 59:20."
