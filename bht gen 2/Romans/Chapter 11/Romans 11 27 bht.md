# Romans 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The covenant from God ensures that His promises are trustworthy and unbreakable, providing the assurance that He will fulfill them. The conversion of the Jews is not only a possibility or a probability, but a certainty. In order to accomplish this, God will forgive their sins and turn them away from ungodliness. This is the true essence of the covenant; a religious and ethical deliverance, assuring the faithfulness of God to His people.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is my covenant with them—literally, 'this is the covenant from me unto them.'"
2. "Those who believe that there are no predictions regarding the literal Israel in the Old Testament, that stretch beyond the end of the Jewish economy, are obliged to view these quotations by the apostle as mere adaptations of Old Testament language to express his own predictions [ALEXANDER on Isaiah, &c.]."
3. "But how forced this is, we shall presently see."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But the apostle connects with it a part of another promise taken from Jeremiah 31:33-34; or rather he abridges that promise, and expresses its substance, by adding 'when I shall take away their sins.'"
2. "It is clear that he intended to express the general sense of the promises, as they were well known to the Jews, and as it was a point concerning which he did not need to argue or reason with them..."
3. "God will doubtless convert the Jews, as he does the Gentiles, by human means, and in connection with the prayers of his people; so that the Gentiles shall yet repay the toil and care of the ancient Jews in preserving the Scriptures, and preparing the way for the Messiah; and both shall rejoice that they were made helps in spreading the knowledge of the Messiah."

### John Calvin:
1. "What he said of the conversion of a people who were so stubborn and obstinate, might have appeared incredible: he therefore removes this stumblingblock, by declaring that the covenant included a gratuitous remission of sins." (365)
