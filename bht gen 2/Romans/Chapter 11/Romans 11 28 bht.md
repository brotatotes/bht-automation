# Romans 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of the Jews towards the gospel has rendered them enemies, not only to God and His message, but also to themselves. Despite this enmity, it serves a purpose, as the proclamation of the gospel is extended to the Gentiles for the sake of salvation. However, it is important to note that within the Jewish people, there remains a beloved portion who are part of God's chosen people and recipients of His grace. This election is not due to any merit of their ancestors, but solely because of God's covenant with them.
