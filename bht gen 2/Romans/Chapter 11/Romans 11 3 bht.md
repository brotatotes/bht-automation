# Romans 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In 1 Kings 19:10, Elijah mourns the widespread wickedness and the destruction of altars and prophets, feeling that he alone remains faithful to God. The killing of prophets represented the people's overall wickedness, while the demolition of altars showed their disregard for worship. Elijah's isolation and desolation in the face of such pervasive ungodliness is relatable, but his claim to be the sole faithful one highlights his profound zeal for the Lord. This account reminds us of the importance of maintaining our faith when surrounded by darkness and opposition, even if we feel alone in our convictions.
