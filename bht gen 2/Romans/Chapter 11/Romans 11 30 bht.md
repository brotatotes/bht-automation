# Romans 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You Gentiles, in the past, were disobedient to God, living in a time of ignorance, idolatry, and superstition. Many of you did not believe in the existence of God or in the presence of just one God. However, through the disobedience of the unbelieving Jews, who previously rejected the message of Christ, you have received mercy and forgiveness by the grace of God. It is through their disbelief that you were given the opportunity to experience the saving power of God's love and redemptive plan.
