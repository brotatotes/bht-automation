# Romans 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the present time, the Jews are experiencing a state of unbelief and their hearts are veiled. They refuse to recognize God in Christ, rejecting the truth that Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. However, this veiling is not permanent, for the apostle argues that just as the Gentiles obtained mercy through the unbelief of the Jews, the Jews too will ultimately obtain mercy through the mercy shown to the Gentiles. Despite their present blindness, hardness of heart, enmity, and unbelief, the same way the Gentiles received mercy, so too will the Jews.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here is an entirely new idea."
2. "The apostle has hitherto dwelt upon the unbelief of the Jews as making way for the faith of the Gentiles—the exclusion of the one occasioning the reception of the other; a truth yielding to generous, believing Gentiles but mingled satisfaction."
3. "Now, opening a more cheering prospect, he speaks of the mercy shown to the Gentiles as a means of Israel's recovery; which seems to mean that it will be by the instrumentality of believing Gentiles that Israel as a nation is at length to 'look on Him whom they have pierced and mourn for Him,' and so to 'obtain mercy'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Through the mercy, that is, the compassion or deep feeling of the converted Gentiles; through the deep and tender pity which they would feel for the blinded and degraded Jews: the gospel should be again carried to them, and they should be recalled to the long lost favor of God."
2. "Each party should thus cause salvation to come to the other - the Jews to the Gentiles by their unbelief; but the Gentiles, in their turn, to the Jews by their belief."
3. "May the time soon come when they shall feel as they should, for the rejected and forsaken children of Abraham, and when their labors for their conversion shall be attended with success."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "So also; the cases are parallel."
2. "That, in order that, by the mercy shown to you (lit. ‘your mercy;’ in emphatic position in the original) they also may now obtain mercy."
3. "The leading thought of the section (Romans 11:11) is here repeated, in the final summing up."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By the mercy shown to you."
2. "God's purpose is for the Jews to receive a blessing yet."

### John Gill:
1. "Now is the time of the Jews' unbelief, blindness has happened to them, the vail is over their hearts."
2. "They do not believe God in Christ; nor that he is the Father of Christ; or that Christ is the Son of God, the true Messiah, and Saviour of the world."
3. "The apostle's argument in favour of the call and conversion of the Jews, upon the whole is this, that since the unbelief of the Gentiles was no bar to their obtaining mercy, and that through the infidelity of the Jews; then it cannot be thought, that the present blindness, hardness of heart, enmity, and unbelief, which now attend the Jews, can be any obstacle to their obtaining mercy in the same way the Gentiles have; but as the one has been, the other also will be."
