# Romans 11:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has allowed all people to experience disobedience, allowing each person to revolt against Him in their own time. This includes both the Gentiles in the early ages and the family of Abraham, whom God chose as a unique seed for Himself. The Apostle Paul recognizes this as a mysterious aspect of God's divine plan and marvels at it with awe-inspiring wonder.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God shut up all men in disobedience, that He may have mercy on all." 
2. "No mere permissive act of God must here be understood. The Apostle is speaking of the divine arrangement by which the guilt of sin and the mercy of God were to be made manifest." 
3. "The ultimate difference between the all men who are shut up under disobedience, and the all men upon whom mercy is shown is, that by all men this mercy is not accepted, and so men become self-excluded from the salvation of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For God hath concluded them all in unbelief"
2. "that he might have mercy upon all"
3. "Certainly it is not 'all mankind individually'; for the apostle is not here dealing with individuals, but with those great divisions of mankind, Jew and Gentile. And what he here says is that God's purpose was to shut each of these divisions of men to the experience first of an humbled, condemned state, without Christ, and then to the experience of His mercy in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word translated here 'concluded' ... is properly used in reference to those who are shut up in prison ... or to those in a city who are shut up by a besieging army."
2. "All are represented, therefore, as in prison, enclosed or confined by God, and to be liberated only in his own way and time."
3. "The emphasis in this verse is on the word 'mercy.' It signifies that God is under obligation to no one, and therefore that all are saved by grace, because all are equally ruined."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The person of Christ was only touching bodily substance concluded within the grave."
2. "Hath shut up."
3. "The totality, Jews and Gentiles, jointly and severally."

### John Calvin:
1. "For whatever they may now be, they have been like all the rest."
2. "He makes the Jews equal in guilt with the Gentiles, that both might understand that the avenue to salvation is no less open to others than to them."
3. "Paul intends here to teach two things — that there is nothing in any man why he should be preferred to others, apart from the mere favor of God; and that God in the dispensation of his grace is under no restraint that he should not grant it to whom he pleases."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'All' refers, however, to persons;... To explain it as meaning 'all nations' is to weaken it; to limit it to the 'elect' is contrary to the parallel... To refer it to the ultimate salvation of all individuals without exception... introduces a mechanical and fatalistic theory of Divine operations."
2. "The universality of sin is overborne by the universality of Divine grace... Here this universality is presented mainly with reference to the proffering of mercy, not its efficiency."
3. "Redemption is not a matter of force, but of freedom; of freedom on God’s part as well as man’s. And the Apostle by the doxology which follows teaches us to leave what we cannot understand in this matter to the wisdom of this Free Being."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath shut up (συνεκλεισεν). First aorist active indicative of συνκλειω, to shut together like a net (Luke 5:6)."
2. "This is a resultant (effective) aorist because of the disbelief and disobedience of both Gentile (Romans 1:17-32) and Jew (Romans 2:1-3)."
3. "No merit in anyone, but all of grace."

### John Gill:
1. "Rather it seems to be taken from a prison, and Jews and Gentiles are represented as prisoners, and unbelief the prison, in which they are shut up by God."
2. "To be 'concluded in unbelief', is the same as to be 'concluded under sin', Galatians 3:22; that is, to be thoroughly convinced of it."
3. "In order to bring them to a sense of their need of it, and that he may the more illustriously display the riches of it, he leaves them for a while in a state of unbelief, and then by his Spirit thoroughly convinces them of it, and gives them faith to look to, and believe in, the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. "For God hath shut up all together in disobedience — Suffering each in their turn to revolt from him."

3. "This was truly a mystery in the divine conduct, which the apostle adores with such holy astonishment."
