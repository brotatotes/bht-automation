# Romans 11:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The depth of God's riches, wisdom, and knowledge is truly unfathomable. His judgments are beyond our understanding, and His ways are unable to be fully traced out. The doctrines of grace offer us a glimpse into the vast wisdom and knowledge of God, but they only scratch the surface of His infinite being. It is a humbling reminder that while we strive to know and understand God, there will always be depths of His character that surpass our comprehension.
