# Romans 11:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These verses highlight the incomprehensibility of God's wisdom and knowledge. No one can fully understand the mind of the Lord or offer counsel to Him. Earthly rulers may seek advice from their counselors, but God stands apart in His infinite wisdom. This truth serves to silence any opposition to His plans and remind us that we cannot question or challenge His decisions. We are called to trust in His wisdom and submit to His leading, recognizing that His ways are higher than our own.
