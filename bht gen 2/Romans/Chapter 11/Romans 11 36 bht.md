### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The discussion in these three chapters fits perfectly into this question, It is aimed at the Jews ' national and religious conceit. It is designed to show them that, notwithstanding their claim to be God 's elect people, the great mass of their nation has been justly rejected by God; and further, that God 's elective purpose includes the Gentiles."
3. "Paul must face this problem. It lies in the straight line of his argument. Hints of it have already appeared in Romans 3:1 sqq; Romans 4:1. The discussion necessarily involves the truth of the divine sovereignty and election."
