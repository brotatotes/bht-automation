# Romans 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the present time, there is a remnant according to the election of grace. Just as in Elijah's time, there was a faithful remnant among the apostate Israel, so now there is a remnant chosen by God's free, unmerited favor. This election of grace is not based on human desert or foreseen congruity, but on God's sovereign choice. It is important to recognize that even in times of rejection, as recorded in our own Scriptures, there has always been a remnant preserved by God's grace.
