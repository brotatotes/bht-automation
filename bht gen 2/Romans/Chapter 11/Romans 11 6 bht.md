# Romans 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For if it is by grace, it is not by works, whether they are ceremonial or moral. If works are the basis for our salvation, then grace loses its essence. The concept of being justified by grace and being justified by works are completely incompatible. One excludes the other. Therefore, let us acknowledge that God's election is purely by His grace, and not by any merit or effort on our part.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let us remember, when we say an election of grace, how much those words imply: viz. nothing short of the entire exclusion of all human work from the question."
2. "The cautions of the Apostle are decisive against all attempts at compromise between the two great antagonist hypotheses, of salvation by God’s free grace, and salvation by man’s meritorious works."
3. "The Apostle’s object in this verse [Romans 11:6] is to guard carefully the doctrine of election by free grace from any attempt at an admixture of man’s work."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The general position here laid down is of vital importance: That there are but two possible sources of salvation—men's works, and God's grace and that these are so essentially distinct and opposite, that salvation cannot be of any combination or mixture of both, but must be wholly either of the one or of the other."
  
2. "The authority of ancient manuscripts against this latter clause, as superfluous and not originally in the text, though strong, we think, is not sufficient to justify its exclusion."
  
3. "Such seeming redundancies are not unusual with our apostle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the fact that any are reserved be by grace, or favor, then it cannot be as a reward of merit."
2. "The idea of being saved by merit contradicts the very idea of grace."
3. "Salvation cannot be partly by grace and partly by works. It is not because people can advance any claims to the favor of God; but from his mere unmerited grace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grace is no more, it gives up its specific character."
2. "No longer comes into manifestation as what it really is."
3. "If of works, it becomes."

### John Calvin:
1. "For whether you introduce works future or past, this declaration of Paul opposes you; for he says, that grace leaves nothing to works."
2. "For if any place is given to works, so much, he maintains, is taken away from grace."
3. "For as Paul has reasoned before concerning the justification of Abraham, that where reward is paid, there grace is not freely bestowed; so now he draws his argument from the same fountain, — that if works come to the account, when God adopts a certain number of men unto salvation, reward is a matter of debt, and that therefore it is not a free gift."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘No longer’ is logical, not temporal; ‘works’ are entirely excluded in this matter of the remnant existing according to the election of grace."
2. "‘Becometh’ is not only more literal than ‘is,’ but suggests as the more exact sense that in such a case grace would fail to show itself as what it is; ‘positively expressed: it becomes what according to its essence it is not; it gives up its specific character’ (Meyer)."
3. "The emphasis placed at this point on the doctrine of free grace is doubtless to prepare for what follows: the reference to the many rejected (Romans 11:7-10), as well as the statement of the final solution (Romans 11:11-32), are based on the sovereignty of God in His dealings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Since, in that case, grace no longer becomes grace."
2. "No longer becomes grace, loses its character as grace."

### John Gill:
1. "If election is 'by grace', as it certainly is; for no other reason can be given why God has chose one, and not another, but his own sovereign pleasure, or that free favour and unmerited love, with which he loves one and not another."
2. "Grace is not grace unless it is altogether freed."
3. "If election springs from, and depends upon the works of men, let no man ascribe it to the grace of God; for there is nothing of grace in it, if this be the case."

### John Wesley:
1. "And if by grace, then it is no more of works — Whether ceremonial or moral.Else grace is no longer grace — The very nature of grace is lost."
2. "And if it be of works, then it is no more grace: else work is no longer work — But the very nature of it is destroyed."
3. "There is something so absolutely inconsistent between the being justified by grace, and the being justified by works, that, if you suppose either, you of necessity exclude the other."
