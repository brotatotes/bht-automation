# Romans 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has not rejected all of the Jewish people; there is still a remnant whom He has chosen. The majority of Israel, however, has failed to obtain the favor and righteousness they so desperately seek. It is the elect, the chosen few, who have found acceptance with God. As for the rest, they have been hardened and blinded by their own stubbornness. Despite their rejection, God's purpose and plan remain unfathomable to us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We have seen that God hath not cast off his own chosen nation, but that even now there is a remnant."
2. "This he asks to bring out an answer which may set in view the  οἱ λοιποί (the rest of them)."
3. "That which Israel is in search of, this it (as a nation) found not, but the election found it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for—better, 'What Israel is in search of (that is, Justification, or acceptance with God—see on  :-); this he found not; but the election (the elect remnant of Israel) found it, and the rest were hardened,' or judicially given over to the 'hardness of their own hearts.'"
2. "the election found it" 
3. "the rest were hardened"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Israel hath not obtained...they have, as a people, failed of obtaining his favor at all, and will be rejected."
2. "The elect, the reserved, the chosen part of the people, have obtained the favor of God."
3. "The rest were blinded...they were blind and obstinate."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The simple verb tugcanw means originally to hit the mark; hence to fall in with, light upon, attain."
2. "Abstract for concrete. Those elected; like hJ peritomh the circumcision for those uncircumcised (Ephesians 2:11. Compare thn katatomhn the concision, Philippians 3:3)."
3. "Rev., correctly, hardened, though the word is used of blindness when applied to the eyes, as Job 17:7, Sept. See on hardness, Mark 3:5. Compare sklhrunei hardeneth, Romans 9:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "Israel in vain labored to seek salvation, because his attempt was absurd."
2. "For if Israel has obtained nothing by merit, what have others obtained whose case or condition was not better? Whence has come so much difference between equals? Who does not here see that it is election alone which makes the difference?"
3. "The origin of the impiety which provokes God’s displeasure, is the perversity of nature when forsaken by God. Yet the cause of eternal reprobation is so hidden from us, that nothing remains for us but to wonder at the incomprehensible purpose of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That which Israel (as a mass) is seeking for, now as formerly; chaps. Romans 9:31; Romans 10:3 show that ‘righteousness’ is the object sought." 
2. "The connection with Romans 11:5-6 shows that this took place, because the mass of the nation sought the end 'as of works' (chap. Romans 9:32), a method opposed to 'grace.'"
3. "And the rest were hardened. 'Blinded' is incorrect. The word denotes in its primary meaning: 'to deprive an organ of its natural sensibility; in the moral: to take from the heart the faculty of being touched by what is good or divine, from the intelligence the faculty of discerning between the true and the false, the good and the evil. The context will explain how it is possible that a similar effect can be attributed to divine agency' (Godet)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Since God did not push Israel away, what is true?" 
2. "Obtained: Second aorist active indicative of επιτυγχανω, to hit upon." 
3. "Were hardened: First aorist passive indicative of πωροω, to cover with thick skin."

### John Gill:
1. "God has not cast away all the people of the Jews, nor any whom he foreknew, any age or period of time; neither in the time Elijah, nor in the apostle's, he always having a reserve of some for himself."
2. "Indeed Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; that is, carnal Israel, the body and bulk of that people; who sought for life and righteousness by their obedience to the law."
3. "The apostle divides Israel into two parts, 'the election and the rest': by 'the election' he means, elect men, the remnant among them, whom God had reserved for himself; just as 'circumcision' designs circumcised persons, and 'uncircumcision' uncircumcised persons, and 'calling' called ones, and 'righteousness' righteous men and women."

### John Wesley:
1. "Israel in general hath not obtained justification; but those of them only who believe."
2. "And the rest were blinded - By their own wilful prejudice."
