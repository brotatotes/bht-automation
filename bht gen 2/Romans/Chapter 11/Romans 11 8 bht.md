# Romans 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has allowed a spirit of slumber or stupidity to come upon the people, causing them to be like those in a deep sleep, unaware of the danger they are in. Their minds are blinded and a veil remains over their hearts, leaving them unable to understand or receive the truth of the gospel. This spiritual insensibility has persisted until the present time, as the prophecy of Isaiah foretold.
