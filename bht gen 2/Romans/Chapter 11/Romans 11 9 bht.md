# Romans 11:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejecters of Christ would experience the consequences of their actions, as their blessings would turn into a curse. Their presumptuous security would become a snare, a hunting, and a stumbling block, serving as a just retribution. The imprecations in the Psalm predict the recompense that would befall the Jewish people for their mistreatment of the Messiah. The table mentioned could refer to the altar, sacrifices, and ceremonial laws. The preaching of the Gospel became a stumbling block and even caused death for the Jews. These consequences served as a recompense for their preceding wickedness.
