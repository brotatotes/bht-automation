# Romans 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Therefore, based on the mercies of God, which contrast His wrath, we are called as brethren to offer ourselves as living sacrifices to God, devoting our entire beings to His service. Just as in ancient sacrifices, the body represented the whole, so we are to present our bodies, or ourselves, as a sacrifice. This requires being dead to sin and alive to God, living out the life of faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sanctification of Christian life is to extend to that part of man's nature which is most completely under the bondage of sin."
2. "Our great sacrifice, the Lord Jesus, having been slain for us, and by the shedding of His Blood perfect remission having been obtained, we are now enabled to be offered to God no longer by the shedding of blood, but as living sacrifices."
3. "The λογικήν sacrifice is opposed to the σαρκικήν, meaning 'having reason' or 'rational,' as opposed to sacrifices of animals which have no reason."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sanctification extends to the whole man."
2. "The death of the one 'Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world,' has swept all dead victims from off the altar of God, to make room for the redeemed themselves as 'living sacrifices' to Him."
3. "Believers, 'yielding themselves to God as those that are alive from the dead, and their members as instruments of righteousness unto God,' are, in His estimation, not ritually but really 'holy,' and so acceptable—'well-pleasing' unto God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle, having finished the argument of this Epistle, proceeds now to close it with a practical or hortatory application, showing its bearing on the duties of life, and the practical influence of religion."
2. "The particular mercy to which the apostle here refers, is that shown to those whom he was addressing. He had proved that all were by nature under sin; that they had no claim on God; and that he had showed great compassion in giving his Son to die for them in this state, and in pardoning their sins. This was a ground or reason why they should devote themselves to God."
3. "We are to offer our entire selves, all that we have and are, to God. No other offering can be such as he will approve."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By the mercies [δια των οικτιρμων] . By, not as an adjuration, but as presenting the motive for obedience."
2. "A living sacrifice [θυσιαν ζωσαν] . Living, in contrast with the slain Levitical offerings."
3. "Which is your reasonable service [την λογικην λατρειαν] . Explaining the whole previous clause. Reasonable, not in the popular sense of the term, as a thing befitting or proper, but rational, as distinguished from merely external or material."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, that he might bind us to God, not by servile fear, but by the voluntary and cheerful love of righteousness, allures us by the sweetness of that favor, by which our salvation is effected; and at the same time he reproaches us with ingratitude, except we, after having found a Father so kind and bountiful, do strive in our turn to dedicate ourselves wholly to him."
2. "Iron indeed must be the heart which is not kindled by the doctrine which has been laid down into love towards God, whose kindness towards itself it finds to have been so abounding."
3. "Offer yourselves a, sacrifice to God, if ye have it in your heart to serve God: for this is the right way of serving God; from which, if any depart, they are but false worshippers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Beseech’ is not a word of legal command, but an appeal addressed to Christians whose hearts, it is assumed, will respond to the motives on which the appeal is based."
2. "‘He who is rightly moved by the mercy of God, enters into the entire will of God.’"
3. "This offering is ‘holy,’ morally pure over against the ceremonial purity of the Levitical offerings, as well as in opposition to the previous devotion to sin; it is ‘well-pleasing to God,’ as ‘a savor of a sweet smell’".

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By means of the mercies of God" as shown in his argument and in our lives.
2. "A living sacrifice...one of praise."
3. "Your rational (spiritual) service (worship)."

### John Gill:
1. "The illative particle 'therefore,' shows that the following exhortations are so many conclusions, consequences, and inferences, deduced from what had been said in the latter part of the preceding chapter."
2. "The introduction to these exhortations is in a very kind and affectionate manner; the saints are addressed as 'brethren', and very appropriately; since this expresses the relation they stood in to the apostle, for whom he had a hearty love and concern."
3. "The presenting of [their bodies] designs a devoting of them, with all readiness and willingness, to the service of God for His honour and glory, without putting any confidence in, or placing any dependence upon them."


### John Wesley:
1. "By the tender mercies of God — The whole sentiment is derived from Rom. i.-v. The expression itself is particularly opposed to 'the wrath of God,' Romans 1:18."
2. "Your bodies — That is, yourselves; a part is put for the whole; the rather, as in the ancient sacrifices of beasts, the body was the whole."
3. "A sacrifice — Dead to sin and living - By that life which is mentioned, Romans 1:17; 6:4, etc."
