# Romans 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In brotherly love, be affectionate towards one another, showing honor and outdoing each other in acts of kindness. This duty of brotherly love is not according to the world's standards, but it is a distinctive characteristic that should mark the disciples of Christ. It is a love that stems from the love of Christ within us, compelling us to live for others and not ourselves. By esteeming others better than ourselves and leading the way in showing them honor, we can truly demonstrate the love and humility of Christ.
