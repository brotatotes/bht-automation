# Romans 12:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whatever tasks or responsibilities we undertake, we should approach them with zeal and diligence, serving the Lord wholeheartedly in all that we do. Our devotion should not waver, as we strive to perform every task as unto God rather than for the praise or recognition of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The present subject is, the character of our zeal for God. In it we are not to be ὀκνηροί, but fervent in spirit, and that, as servants of God." 
2. "The command, τῷ καιρῷ δουλεύειν, would surely come in very inopportunely in the midst of exhortations to the zealous service of God." 
3. "The Christian may and should certainly employ (Eph 5:16) τὸν καιρόν (time and opportunity), but not serve it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "not slothful in business—The word rendered 'business' means 'zeal,' 'diligence,' 'purpose'; denoting the energy of action."
2. "serving the Lord—that is, the Lord Jesus."
3. "Another reading—'serving the time,' or 'the occasion'—which differs in form but very slightly from the received reading, has been adopted by good critics [LUTHER, OLSHAUSEN, FRITZSCHE, MEYER]. But as manuscript authority is decidedly against it, so is internal evidence; and comparatively few favor it. Nor is the sense which it yields a very Christian one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The tendency of the Christian religion is to promote industry... The Lord Jesus was constantly employed in filling up the great duties of his life, and the effect of his religion has been to promote industry wherever it has spread both among nations and individuals."
2. "An idle man and a Christian are names which do not harmonize. Every Christian has enough to do to occupy all his time; and he whose life is spent in ease and in doing nothing, should doubt altogether his religion."
3. "The meaning of the whole verse is, that Christians should be industrious, should be ardently engaged in some lawful employment, and that they should pursue it with reference to the will of God, in obedience to his commands, and to his glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In regard to zeal, be not lazy." - Luther
2. "Render, as Rev., in diligence." - Commentary
3. "Fervent." - Commentary

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought in many things to forget ourselves; for except we be in earnest, and diligently strive to shake off all sloth, we shall never be rightly prepared for the service of Christ."
2. "Diligence in doing good requires that zeal which the Spirit of God kindles in our hearts."
3. "It hence becomes us to show more alacrity in the performance of our duty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In diligence, not slothful."
2. "The figure is that of seething, boiling like a hot spring; hence the human spirit is meant, but the regenerated human spirit, since Christians are addressed."
3. "In whatever we find to do we are not only to be active, but to have a spiritual enthusiasm, which is prompted by the knowledge that all our doing, however humble, is in the service of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Slothful  (οκνηρο). Old adjective from οκνεω, to hesitate, to be slow. Slow and "poky" as in Matthew 25:26. 

### John Gill:
1. "Men should diligently pursue their lawful callings for the support of themselves and families, and the interest of Christ."
2. "Fervency of spirit is opposed to that lukewarmness of soul, that coldness of affection, and leaving of the first love, so much complained of, and resented by Christ in his people."
3. "Without the Spirit of God, there is no true worshipping and serving of him, and which ought to be done with fervency as well as with constancy."

### John Wesley:
1. Whatsoever ye do, do it with your might. In every business diligently and fervently serving the Lord - Doing all to God, not to man.
