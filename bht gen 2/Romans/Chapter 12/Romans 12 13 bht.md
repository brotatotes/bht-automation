# Romans 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By sharing in the needs of fellow believers, we demonstrate love and generosity. The duty to care for one another extends specifically to those in the community of faith. It is not simply about welcoming those who come to us, but actively seeking opportunities to show hospitality. This act of giving and receiving allows for the meaningful connection and support among the saints. Moreover, while it is important to remember and respect those who have passed away, the focus here is on the practical responsibilities of caring for fellow believers who are in need.
