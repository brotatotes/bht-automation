# Romans 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The importance of controlling our thoughts and emotions is evident in the command 'Curse not.' It is not enough to refrain from cursing with our words; we must also guard our hearts and minds against harboring resentment or ill-will towards others. This serves as a reminder that our Lord is concerned with our inner disposition, not just our outward actions.

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The saying of Christ, Matthew 5:44, was perhaps known to the Apostle and here came to his recollection."
2. "The word rendered 'persecute' is the same as that in the last clause of Romans 12:13; an intentional play on words."
3. "Hardest of all is the duty when the persecutor is a professed Christian brother."
