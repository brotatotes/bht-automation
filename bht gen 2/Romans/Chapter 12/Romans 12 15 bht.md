# Romans 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rejoice: the direct opposite to weeping is laughter; however, for a Christian, a cheerful, joyous spirit of brotherly sympathy with those who are happy is more fitting. This aligns with the command to rejoice with those who rejoice, which encourages a genuine rejoicing in the good and laudable things happening in the lives of others. It is a call to cultivate a selfless and empathetic heart, following in the footsteps of Christ, who deeply understands and cares for the weaknesses and emotions of His people.
