# Romans 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be of the same mind, thinking of one another with a common feeling of mutual love and kindness. Resist the temptation to desire worldly status or wisdom, instead, embrace humility and openness to the wisdom of others. Treat others with the same love and respect that you desire for yourself, bearing their burdens and seeking their good.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Having the same spirit towards one another, i.e. actuated by a common and well-understood feeling of mutual allowance and kindness."
2. "This spirit towards one another is not to be a spirit of haughtiness, but one of community and sympathy, condescending to men of low estate."
3. "Being uplifted one against another would be a sign of this fault being present and operative."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Being of the same mind one toward another" - The feeling of the common bond which binds all Christians to each other, whatever diversity of station, cultivation, temperament, or gifts may obtain among them, is the thing here enjoined.
2. "Mind not high things" - Cherish not ambitious or aspiring purposes and desires. As this springs from selfish severance of our own interests and objects from those of our brethren, so it is quite incompatible with the spirit inculcated in the preceding clause.
3. "Be not wise in your own conceits" - This is just the application of the caution against high-mindedness to the estimate we form of our own mental character.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be of the same mind... Think of, that is, regard, or seek after the same thing for each other; that is, what you regard or seek for yourself, seek also for your brethren."
2. "Mind not high things... Christians were commonly of the poorer ranks, and they were to seek their companions and joys there, and not to aspire to the society of the great and the rich."
3. "Be not wise... do not trust in the conceit of your own superior skill and understanding, and refuse to hearken to the counsel of others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The lowly things ought to have for the Christian a force of attraction, in virtue of which he yields himself to fellowship with them, and allows himself to be guided by them in the determination of his conduct."
2. "The reference is to the most indigent and ignorant and least influential in the Church. It is to them the believer ought to feel most drawn."
3. "The idea, then, fully expressed is, 'set not your mind on lofty things, but be borne away [Î±Ï€Î¿] from these by the current of your Christian sympathy along with [ÏƒÏ…Î½] things which are humble.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Not thinking, he says, 'of high things:' by which he means, that it is not the part of a Christian ambitiously to aspire to those things by which he may excel others, nor to assume a lofty appearance, but on the contrary to exercise humility and meekness."
2. "Here then is condemned all ambition and that elation of mind which insinuates itself under the name of magnanimity; for the chief virtue of the faithful is moderation, or rather lowliness of mind, which ever prefers to give honor to others, rather than to take it away from them."
3. "The most appropriate remedy for curing arrogance is, that man should not be over-wise in his own esteem."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This precept refers to concord in feeling, though not to the exclusion of corresponding thought and endeavor."
2. "This may be taken as a general warning against ambition, or 'high things' may refer to the distinctions which arise among Christians, whether social or official, and which are so naturally sought after."
3. "Nothing destroys Christian fellowship more effectually than this conceit of wisdom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Be of the same mind... 'thinking the same thing.'"
2. "Set not your mind on high things... 'Not thinking the high things.'"
3. "Condescend to things that are lowly... 'Be carried away with the lowly things.'"

### John Gill:
1. "think of one another, as equally interested in the love of God, redeemed by the blood of Christ"
2. "do not think too highly of yourselves, and despise others"
3. "bear their infirmities, and become all things to them for their good, and God's glory"

### John Wesley:
1. Mind not high things â€” Desire not riches, honour, or the company of the great.
