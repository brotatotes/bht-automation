# Romans 12:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we are called to a higher standard of conduct, even in our interactions with those who do not share our beliefs. We are to recompense evil with good and avoid seeking revenge. Instead, we should be proactive in our actions, thinking beforehand and making a deliberate effort to do what is honorable and commendable in the sight of all people. By doing so, we can silence the ignorance of wicked individuals, set a positive example, and ultimately bring glory to God.
