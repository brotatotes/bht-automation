# Romans 12:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As much as it depends on you, seek after peace, pursue it, and cultivate it. This requires living peaceably with others in the places where you dwell. Take every step to promote and maintain peace, while placing the blame on the other side if conflicts arise. As saints, it is our responsibility to strive for peace, even if others do not choose to do so with us.
