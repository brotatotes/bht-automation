## BHT:
Beloved, let us heed the apostle's affectionate call to attention, for his words are meant for our good and the glory of God. We are reminded not to seek revenge for our own personal injuries but to entrust our cause to the righteous judgment of the Lord. Instead of taking matters into our own hands, let us make room for the wrath of God, for He is the one who will repay and execute judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The more difficult this duty, the more affectionately does the Apostle address his readers, with this word." (ἀγαπητοί)
2. "'Give wrath room:' 'proceed not to execute it hastily, but leave it for its legitimate time, when He whose it is to avenge, will execute it: make not the wrath your own, but leave it for God.'"
3. "The citation varies from the LXX, which has ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκδικήσεως ἀνταποδώσω; and is nearer the Heb., לִי נָקָם וְשִׁלֵּם, 'mine is revenge and requital.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But as the context shows that the injunction is to leave vengeance to God, 'wrath' here seems to mean, not the offense, which we are tempted to avenge, but the avenging wrath of God which we are enjoined to await or give room for."
2. "Give room or space for wrath to spend itself."
3. "The avenging wrath of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But the apostle here is addressing private individual Christians. And the command is, to avoid a spirit and purpose of revenge." 
2. "The command here 'not to avenge ourselves' means, that we are not to take it out of the hands of God, or the hands of the law, and to inflict it ourselves."
3. "To 'give place,' then, is to leave it for God to come in and execute wrath or vengeance on the enemy. Do not execute wrath; leave it to God; commit all to him; leave yourself and your enemy in his hands, assured that he will vindicate you and punish him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let God’s wrath take its course, do not attempt to execute it yourself."
2. "The morality of this precept is based on the holiness of God; hence so far as love and wrath are the two poles of holiness, it does not exclude the blessing of our adversaries and intercession for them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
