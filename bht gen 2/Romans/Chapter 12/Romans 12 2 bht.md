# Romans 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not conform to the ways of this world, whether it refers to the Mosaic dispensation or the unregenerate men who live sinful lives. Instead, be transformed by renewing your mind, not only in the initial conversion and renovation but continually. By doing so, you will be able to discern and experience the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God, which may differ from the ways of the world.
