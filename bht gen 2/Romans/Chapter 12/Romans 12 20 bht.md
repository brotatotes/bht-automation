# Romans 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If your enemy is in need, provide for them in every way possible. Your kindness may cause them to feel shame and remorse, leading to a change of heart and repentance. This act of doing good to someone who has wronged you may even serve as a form of divine punishment, as it stings their conscience and exposes their guilt. Showing kindness to an enemy goes against our natural inclination for revenge, but it has the power to soften their heart and potentially bring about transformation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The οὖν would mean ‘quod cum ita sit;’ carrying on the sentence with the assumption of the last thing stated."
2. "What is meant by ἄνθρακας πυρὸς σωρεύσεις? The expression ἄνθρ. πυρ. occurs more than once in Psalms 18:0, of the divine punitive judgments."
3. "I understand the words, ‘For in this doing, you will be taking the most effectual vengeance;' as effectual as if you heaped coals of fire on his head."

1. "This is taken from Proverbs 25:21 Proverbs 25:22, which without doubt supplied the basis of those lofty precepts on that subject which form the culminating point of the Sermon on the Mount."
2. "As the heaping of 'coals of fire' is in the Old Testament the figurative expression of divine vengeance, the true sense of these words seems to be, 'That will be the most effectual vengeance—a vengeance under which he will be fain to bend.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If thine enemy is needy in any way, do him good, and supply his needs."
2. "The 'effect' of doing good to an enemy would be to produce pain. But the pain will result from shame, remorse of conscience, a conviction of the evil of his conduct, and an apprehension of divine displeasure that may lead to repentance."
3. "The way to bring a man to repentance is to do him good. On this principle God is acting continually. He does good to all, even to the rebellious; and he designs that his goodness should lead people to repentance."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The memory of the wrong awakened in your enemy by your kindness, shall sting him with penitence."
2. "Kindness is as effectual as coals of fire."
3. "Among the Arabs and Hebrews the figure of 'coals of fire' is common as a symbol of divine punishment."

### John Calvin:
1. "Understand as included under the words meat and drink, all acts of kindness."
2. "But some by coals understand the destruction which returns on the head of our enemy, when we show kindness to one unworthy, and deal with him otherwise than he deserves; for in this manner his guilt is doubled."
3. "I take a simpler view, that his mind shall be turned to one side or another; for doubtless our enemy shall either be softened by our benefits, or if he be so savage that nothing can tame him, he shall yet be burnt and tormented by the testimony of his own conscience, on finding himself overwhelmed with our kindness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But, i.e., ‘on the contrary,’ ‘nay rather’ (Alford). The authorities present several variations; but the oldest manuscripts and more recent editors accept ‘but.’"
2. "Thou wilt prepare for him the glowing shame of penitence; so Augustine, Meyer, Godet, and many others. This is not open to any serious objection, if real penitence be understood. Simply to make him ashamed is not an exalted motive."
3. "Thou wilt by this kindness most readily subdue him, thus taking the most effectual vengeance; so Alford, Hodge, and others. This really includes (2), and is favored by the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Feed him (ψωμιζε αυτον). Quotation from LXX text of Proverbs 25:21. Present active imperative of verb from ψωμος, a morsel, and so to feed crumbs to babies, then to feed in general." 
2. "Thou shalt heap (σωρευσεις). Future active of old verb σωρευω from σωρος, a heap. In N.T. only here and 2 Timothy 3:6." 
3. "Coals of fire (ανθρακας πυρος). That is, burning or live coals. Anthrax (our 'anthracite') is an old word, only here in N.T. It is a metaphor for keen anguish."

### John Gill:
1. "so far should the saints be from meditating revenge upon their enemies, that they should do good unto them, as Christ directs" 
2. "by so doing, his conscience would be stung with a sense of former injuries done to his benefactor, and he be filled with shame on account of them, and be brought to repentance for them, and to love the person he before hated" 
3. "This advice of showing kindness to enemies, and against private revenge, is very contrary to the dictates of human nature, as corrupted by sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "Feed him — With your own hand: if it be needful, even put bread into his mouth."
2. "Heap coals of fire upon his head — That part which is most sensible."
3. "So artists melt the sullen ore of lead, By heaping coals of fire upon its head; In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow, And pure from dross the silver runs below."
