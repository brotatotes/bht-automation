# Romans 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of opposition and injustice, do not allow yourself to be consumed by a desire for revenge, for that would only play into the hands of the enemy. Instead, overcome evil by doing good. It is through acts of kindness, forgiveness, and patience that we can conquer our enemies and demonstrate the transformative power of God's love. Even if we do not immediately see the results of our actions, let us persevere in responding to evil with goodness, knowing that through God's grace, we are more than conquerors.
