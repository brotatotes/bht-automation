3. "Faith is here viewed as the inlet to all the other graces, and so, as the receptive faculty of the renewed soul‚Äîthat is, 'as God hath given to each his particular capacity to take in the gifts and graces which He designs for the general good.'"

2. "Not to think ... - Not to over-estimate himself, or to think more of himself than he ought to. What is the true standard by which we ought to estimate ourselves he immediately adds. This is a caution against pride; and an exhortation not to judge of ourselves by our talents, wealth, or function, but to form another standard of judging of ourselves, by our Christian character."

3. "The character of this measure or standard is determined by faith... faith regarded as spiritual insight, which, according to its degree, qualifies a man to be a prophet, a teacher, a minister, etc."

### John Calvin:

2. "He draws us away from the investigation of those things which can bring nothing but harassment to the mind, and no edification."
3. "It is a part of our reasonable sacrifice to surrender ourselves, in a meek and teachable spirit, to be ruled and guided by God."

2. "Not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; that is, either not to arrogate to himself what does not belong to him, and detract from others, who may have equal, if not superior, abilities to him; or not to glory in what he has, as if he had not received it, and as if it was altogether owing to his own sagacity, penetration, diligence, and industry."
