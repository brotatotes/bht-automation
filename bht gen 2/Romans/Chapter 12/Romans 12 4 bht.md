# Romans 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church of Christ is compared to a human body, illustrating the unity and diversity within the community of believers. Just as different members of the body have distinct functions and roles, each member of the body of Christ has their own unique purpose and contribution to make. This diversity reminds us of the varying measures of faith and calls us to act in humility, recognizing and respecting the diverse gifts and callings that God has bestowed upon each individual within the body.
