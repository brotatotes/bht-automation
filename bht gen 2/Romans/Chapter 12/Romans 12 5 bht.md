# Romans 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, as Christians, are not simply individuals, but rather a collective body, united in Christ. This union is not only mysterious, but also tender and significant. We are mutually dependent, serving and supporting each other, as members of the same society. Our fellowship in Christ forms a unique and intimate bond, similar to the connections between friends, family, and spouses. Our goal is to walk together in holy unity, sympathizing with and serving one another, as we follow the example of Christ.
