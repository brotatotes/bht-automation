# Romans 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The body of believers is diverse, with each member having different gifts and abilities. These gifts are all given by God's grace, not by human effort. Those with the gift of prophecy should diligently exercise it, interpreting Scripture according to the overarching truths that are consistent throughout. Let us all use our gifts and faithfully proclaim the Word, keeping in line with the teachings of our faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The two first accusatives are grammatically dependent on ἔχοντες: by degrees the Apostle loses sight of the construction, and continues with the concrete ὁ διδάσκων, which still he binds on to the foregoing by εἴτε, but at ὁ μεταδιδούς, omits this also, and, at Romans 12:9, introduces the abstract ἡ ἀγάπη."
2. "There is some dispute about the construction of these clauses. The ordinary rendering regards them as elliptical, and supplies before κατὰ and ἐν, χρησάσθω αὐτῇ or ὥστε εἶναι αὐτήν or the like."
3. "The comparison of μέτρον πιστεως above, and the whole context, determine it to be the latter; the measure of our faith: 'quisque se intra sortis suæ metas contineat, et revelationis suæ modum teneat, ne unus sibi omnia scire videatur.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All the gifts of believers alike are viewed as communications of mere grace."
2. "Anyone speaking with divine authority—whether with reference to the past, the present, or the future—was termed a prophet."
3. "As all the gifts of believers are according to their respective capacity for them, they are not to be puffed up on account of them, but to use them purely for their proper ends."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All the endowments which Christians have are regarded by the apostle as gifts."
2. "It was never designed that all Christians should be equal. God designed that people should have different endowments."
3. "True honor consists not in splendid endowments, or great wealth and function. It consists in rightly discharging the duties which God requires of us in our appropriate sphere."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the New Testament, as in the Old, the prominent idea is not prediction, but the inspired delivery of warning, exhortation, instruction, judging, and making manifest the secrets of the heart."
2. "The New - Testament prophets are distinguished from teachers, by speaking under direct divine inspiration."
3. "The phrase here is related to the measure of faith. It signifies, according to the proportion defined by faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "Every one desires to have so much himself, so as not to need any help from others; but the bond of mutual communication is this, that no one has sufficient for himself, but is constrained to borrow from others."
2. "By this most beautiful order, and as it were symmetry, is the safety of the Church indeed preserved; that is, when every one imparts to all in common what he has received from the Lord, in such a way as not to impede others."
3. "He who inverts this order fights with God, by whose ordinance it is appointed; for the difference of gifts proceeds not from the will of man, but because it has pleased the Lord to distribute his grace in this manner."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘charisms’ are different, but all having one origin,  according to the grace that was given to us." 
2. "In the New Testament the reference is to the gift of immediate inspiration, for the occasion, ‘leading the recipient to deliver, as the mouth of God, the particular communication which he had received’ (Hodge)."
3. "This view is favored by the context, ‘which aims at showing that the measure of faith, itself the gift of God, is the receptive faculty for all spiritual gifts, which are therefore not to be boasted of, nor pushed beyond their provinces, but humbly exercised within their own limits’ (Alford)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "According to the proportion of our faith."
2. "The measure of faith."
3. "The context calls for the subjective meaning of 'faith' rather than the objective and outward standard."

### John Gill:
1. "The various members of [the body] have not the same office, and do not perform the same actions, thus they have not the same, but different faculties."
2. "For all these gifts are not the effects of nature, the fruits of human power, diligence, and industry, but flow from the grace of God, who dispenses them when, where, and to whom he pleases in a free and sovereign manner."
3. "Such who have this gift of prophecy, or of opening and explaining the Scriptures, ought to make use of it, and constantly attend to it: 'let us prophesy'; diligently prepare for it by prayer, reading and meditation, and continually exercise it as opportunity offers."

### John Wesley:
1. "Gifts are various: grace is one."
2. "Let us prophesy according to the analogy of faith."
3. "Every doubtful scripture interpreted according to the grand truths which run through the whole."
