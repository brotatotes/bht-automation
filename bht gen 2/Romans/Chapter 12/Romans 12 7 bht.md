# Romans 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us dutifully carry out the appointed service within the church, whether it be the ministry of preaching, teaching, or administering. This responsibility is of great significance and requires our unwavering dedication. Teachers are distinct from prophets, focusing on conveying the understanding of the gospel in a practical and diligent manner. As ministers, it is crucial for us to stay within our designated roles, recognizing the importance of our office and the impact we have on the church.

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Teaching is aimed at the understanding."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let us wait on our ministry, lit., ‘in the ministry,’ just spoken of. We might supply, ‘let us be,’ since the exhortation means let us render service in our appointed sphere, therein ‘be instant’ (comp. 1 Timothy 4:15)."
2. "It has happened ever since those who had a gift, and a corresponding office, for the external affairs of the church, have not been content to limit their efforts to their proper sphere."

1. "The word διακονια sometimes signifies the whole ecclesiastical ministry, even the office of apostleship, as well as the ordinary ministration of the Gospel."
2. "The gift of prophesying or preaching is subdivided into 'teaching' and 'exhorting'; the one belongs to 'teachers' or doctors, the other to 'pastors'; as the distinction is in Ephesians 4:11, not that different officers and offices are intended, but different branches of the same office."
3. "Teaching does not design an office in the school, but in the church; it is not teaching divinity as men teach logic, rhetoric, and other arts and sciences, in the schools; but an instructing of churches and the members thereof in the doctrines of the Gospel, in order to establish and build them up in their most holy faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ministering - As deacons."
2. "He that teacheth - Catechumens; for whom particular instructers were appointed."
3. "He that exhorteth - Whose peculiar business it was to urge Christians to duty and to comfort them in trials."
