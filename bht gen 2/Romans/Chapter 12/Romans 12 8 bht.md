## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He that bestoweth." 
2. "I would therefore render it: He that sheweth mercy, is the very best rendering: and I cannot conceive that any officer of the Church is intended, but every private Christian who exercises compassion."
3. "And yet in such an act it is even of more consequence towards the effect, consoling the compassionated, than the act itself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "all preaching, whether by apostles, prophets, or teachers, was followed up by exhortation" 
2. "the exercise of private benevolence probably, rather than in the discharge of diaconal duty" 
3. "feeling it to be 'more blessed to give than to receive,' and to help than be helped"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that exhorteth - One who presents the warnings and the promises of God to excite men to the discharge of their duty."
2. "He that giveth - The person whose function it was to distribute; and probably designates him who distributed the alms of the church, or the deacon of the congregation."
3. "He that ruleth - One who is set over others, or who presides or rules, or one who attends with diligence and care to a thing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that giveth [ο μεταδιδους] . Earthly possessions. The preposition meta indicates sharing with." 
2. "Simplicity [απλοτητι] . See on single, Matthew 6:22, and compare James 1:5, where it is said that God gives aJplwv simply."
3. "With cheerfulness [εν ιλαροτητι] . Only here in the New Testament. It reappears in the Latin hilaritas; English, hilarity, exhilarate."

### John Calvin:
1. "He teaches us here the legitimate use of God's gifts."
2. "To the first he recommends simplicity, so that without fraud or respect of persons they were faithfully to administer what was entrusted to them."
3. "He required the services of the other party to be rendered with cheerfulness, lest by their peevishness they marred the favor conferred by them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exhorter might also be a prophet, but the habit seems to have been to base the exhortation on a passage of Scripture, as in the synagogue."
2. "He who thus gives should do it 'with simplicity,' i.e., 'without any selfishness, without boasting, without secondary designs, etc., but in plain sincerity of disposition.'"
3. "Diligence should characterize the performance of duty of all those who have the gift of leadership."

### John Gill:
1. "one considerable branch of the ministry, and which is more principally the pastor's work, as well as to teach, is to exhort all sorts of persons, young and old, rich and poor, high and low, bond and free, under his care, with all longsuffering and doctrine." 
2. "though all the ministers of the Gospel are to speak comfortably to the saints, by preaching the doctrines of free justification by Christ's righteousness, and remission of sins by his blood, by bringing the good news of salvation by him, and by opening the exceeding great and precious promises of the Gospel; yet some have a greater talent this way than others"
3. "with all faithfulness and integrity, without fraud or embezzling the church's stock, with impartiality, and without respect of persons, and liberally and bountifully"

### John Wesley:
1. He that presideth — That hath the care of a flock.He that showeth mercy — In any instance.With cheerfulness — Rejoicing that he hath such an opportunity.
