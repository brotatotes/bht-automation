# Romans 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christians are called to exhibit respect and obedience towards those in positions of civil government. By doing so, they can serve as a positive example to believers across the empire, countering any accusations of opposition to magistracy. The apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of submitting to the higher powers, recognizing that all authority ultimately derives from God. Civil magistrates are specifically referred to as the higher powers, and their authority is appointed by God Himself. This understanding highlights the significance of conscientiously obeying them, as they act as representatives of God in their role as governing authorities.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For there is no authority (in heaven or earth no power at all) except from God: and those that are (the existing powers which we see about us), have been ordained by God."
2. "His precepts regard an established power, be it what it may. It, in all matters lawful, we are bound to obey."
3. "If the civil power commands us to violate the law of God, we must obey God before man. If it commands us to disobey the common laws of humanity, or the sacred institutions of our country, our obedience is due to the higher and more general law, rather than to the lower and particular."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let every soul‚Äîevery man of you‚Äîbe subject unto the higher powers." 
2. "For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The circumstances which made this discussion proper and important were the following: The Christian religion was designed to extend throughout the world. Yet it contemplated the rearing of a kingdom amid other kingdoms, an empire amid other empires. Christians professed supreme allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ; he was their Lawgiver, their Sovereign, their Judge." 
2. "The question was, whether they should obey a pagan magistrate at 'all.' This question the apostle answers in the affirmative, because 'God' had made government necessary, and because it was arranged and ordered by his providence." 
3. "The object of the apostle was to prevent Christians from entering into those disputes, and from taking an active part in a political controversy. Besides, the throne had been 'usurped' by the reigning emperors, and there was a prevalent disposition to rebel against a tyrannical government."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Higher powers [ŒµŒæŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ±ŒπœÇ œÖœÄŒµœÅŒµœáŒøœÖœÉŒ±ŒπœÇ] . Lit., authorities which have themselves over." 
2. "The powers that be [Œ±Œπ Œ¥Œµ ŒøœÖœÉŒ±Œπ] . Lit., the existing. Powers is not in the text, and is supplied from the preceding clause."
3. "Are ordained [œÑŒµœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒµŒΩŒ±Œπ ŒµŒπœÉŒπŒΩ] . Perfect tense : Have been ordained, and the ordinance remains in force."

### John Calvin:
1. "There are indeed always some tumultuous spirits who believe that the kingdom of Christ cannot be sufficiently elevated, unless all earthly powers be abolished."
2. "By these reasons, as it is probable, Paul was induced to establish, with greater care than usual, the authority of magistrates."
3. "For since it pleases God thus to govern the world, he who attempts to invert the order of God, and thus to resist God himself, despises his power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Submit himself. This rendering suggests that the obedience is of a voluntary and rational character, not a servile and blind subjection."
2. "For there is no authority (of any kind, the proposition being universal) but of God. The preposition, according to the received reading is more exactly 'from;' according to the better established text, 'by.' The former indicates that there is no authority apart from Him as the source; the latter that authority is established by Him."
3. "The simple, pellucid meaning of the Apostle, is that civil government is necessary, and of divine appointment. We infer that anarchy is as godless as it is inhuman; magistrates derive their authority from God, even when chosen by the people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Every soul. As in Romans 2:9; Acts 2:43. A Hebraism for every man."
2. "God is the author of order, not anarchy."
3. "Paul is not arguing for the divine right of kings or for any special form of government, but for government and order."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle judged it advisable especially to exhort the church of Rome, and the members who dwelt there, where was the seat of power and civil government, so to behave towards their superiors, that they might set a good example to the Christians in the several parts of the empire, and wipe off the aspersion that was cast upon them, as if they were enemies to magistracy and civil power."
2. "By 'the higher powers,' he means not angels, sometimes called principalities and powers; nor ecclesiastical officers, or those who are in church power and authority; but civil magistrates are intended..."
3. "The powers that be are ordained of God. The order of magistracy is of God; it is of his ordination and appointment, and of his ordering, disposing, and fixing in its proper bounds and limits."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let every soul be subject to the supreme powers... That is more readily acknowledged to be from God than these."
2. "The powers that be are appointed by God... implying, that they are God's deputies or vicegerents and consequently, their authority being, in effect, his, demands our conscientious obedience."
