# Romans 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is the key to obeying the law, for true love prevents us from causing harm to our neighbor. When we truly love our neighbor, we will not entertain thoughts of injuring or defrauding them but instead seek to do them good. By fulfilling the commandment to love others, we are fulfilling the entire law. Love not only restrains us from doing evil but also motivates us to do good.
