# Romans 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandments of the law are fulfilled when we work no ill towards our neighbor, as love works no harm and seeks to do good. Love is the ultimate fulfillment of the law, as it prevents us from doing any harm and prompts us towards justice, truth, and benevolence. If love was engraved on every heart and practiced, it would bring about transformative change in society. Love is the essence of the law and when we love our neighbor, we are fulfilling all that the law requires.
