# Romans 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The darkness of sin and evil is gradually fading away, as the time of the glorious day of redemption approaches. It is like the dawn of a new day, when we must cast off the works of darkness, like taking off our night-clothes. We are called to put on the armor of light, the weapons of righteousness that belong to the day, as we prepare for the eternal day of glory that is near at hand.

Of course, there are other applications; 'the day will break a hundred times, in ever greater potencies, between the first and the second coming of Christ' (Lange).
