# Romans 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us walk in the day - that is, let us live our lives in a way that reflects the light and truth of God's Word. We should conduct ourselves decently, avoiding any actions that we would be ashamed to do in the presence of others. This includes refraining from indulging in excessive drinking, revelry, and acts of impurity. Instead, let us strive to live honorable lives, abstaining from the temptations and immoralities that surround us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The act itself being a defilement when unsanctified by God's ordinance of marriage." 
2. "Various kinds of wantonness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let us therefore only do what is fit to be exposed to the light of such a day."
2. "varied forms of intemperance; denoting revels in general, usually ending in intoxication."
3. "varied forms of impurity; the one pointing to definite acts, the other more general."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let us walk - To 'walk' is an expression denoting 'to live;' let us 'live,' or 'conduct,' etc." 
2. "As in the day - As if all our actions were seen and known. People by day, or in open light, live decently; their foul and wicked deeds are done in the night." 
3. "In rioting - Revelling; denoting the licentious conduct, the noisy and obstreperous mirth, the scenes of disorder and sensuality, which attend luxurious living."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Honest is originally honorable, and so here."
2. "The word refers more particularly to the outward life, and thus accords with walk, and in the day the time of observation."
3. "All these three are plural: riotings, drunkennesses, wantonnesses."

### John Calvin:
1. "If these have in them so much filthiness, that even carnal men are ashamed to commit them before the eyes of men, it behooves us, who are in the light of God, at all times to abstain from them; yea, even when we are withdrawn from the presence of men."
2. "The case is the same with the two preceding instances; the vice which seems to follow is placed first. Revelling is first mentioned, though drunkenness goes before it; and 'chambering,' or concubinage, or indulgence in unlawful lusts is first stated, though lasciviousness or wantonness is the source from which it proceeds."
3. "It is an example of the Apostle’s mode of writing similar to what we find in Romans 11:29, as to 'the gifts and calling of God,' and in Romans 11:33, as to 'the wisdom and knowledge of God.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let us walk seemly, as in the day. [...] the reference being to decorum, such as befits the day when conduct is open to observation." 
2. "Not in rioting and drunkenness. [...] the former refers to nocturnal revels, and was probably suggested by the figures of 'night' and 'day;' the latter means drunken carousals."
3. "Not in chambering and wantonness. Various forms of secret vice are here indicated by the plural. These sins are closely connected with the preceding, often caused by them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul is fond of the metaphor 'walk' (περιπατεω), 33 times though not in the Pastoral Epistles."
2. "The English word 'honest' means honourable (Latin honor) and so decent."
3. "Quarrelling and jealousy go with the other vices."

### John Gill:
1. "Being under the day of the Gospel dispensation, and the day of grace having dawned, and the daystar of spiritual light and knowledge being risen in our hearts, and we being exposed to the view of all men in broad daylight, ought not to lie down and sleep, but to arise and be active, and walk decently with the armour of light on us, as becomes the Gospel of Christ."
2. "Not in rioting; the Syriac and Arabic versions read, 'in singing', or 'songs'; meaning lewd ones, sung at riotous feasts and banquets, made not for refreshment, but for pleasure and debauchery."
3. "Not in chambering; in unlawful copulations, fornication, adultery, and all the defilements of the bed: and wantonness; lasciviousness, unnatural lusts, as sodomy."

### John Wesley:
1. Banqueting — Luxurious, elegant feasts.
