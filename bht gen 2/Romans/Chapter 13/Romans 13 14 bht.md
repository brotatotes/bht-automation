# Romans 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, our focus should be on imitating Christ and reflecting His character in our lives. Putting on the Lord Jesus Christ means to take on His principles, imitate His example, and embody His spirit. It is not simply a superficial action, but a deep and intimate union with Him, allowing His graces to clothe us. By doing so, we can steer clear of the desires of our sinful nature and instead fulfill our highest purpose of becoming more like Christ. Putting on Christ is not just an external act, but a complete transformation of our hearts and minds.
