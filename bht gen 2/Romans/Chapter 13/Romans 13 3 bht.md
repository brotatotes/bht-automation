# Romans 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rulers are appointed to be a terror to evil works, ensuring that those who do wrong are met with consequences and deterring others from following the same path. However, those who do good and live in accordance with the laws have nothing to fear from the rulers. It is important to remember that different fears exist - one that prevents evil actions and one that follows after them.
