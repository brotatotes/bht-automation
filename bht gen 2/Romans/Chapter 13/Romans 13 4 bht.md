# Romans 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A magistrate is not appointed to reward, but to protect and defend the people, wielding the sword as a symbol of his authority. This authority is not for his own interest, but for the public good. Magistrates have the responsibility to repress evil and punish offenders, executing God's judgment. The right of the sword is bestowed upon them by God, and when they use it to execute punishment, they are obeying His commands. The magistrate is a minister of God, acting on His behalf for the well-being of the people.
