# Romans 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The necessity of our submission to civil authority is twofold. We must not only obey out of fear of punishment or the wrath of those in power, but also for conscience's sake. To act in accordance with our conscience means recognizing that God Himself has established civil government as a means for order and justice. Our obedience to this divine ordinance is a matter of moral duty and a reflection of our faith.
