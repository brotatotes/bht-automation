# Romans 13:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reason for paying taxes is because the rulers are ministers of God, appointed to serve for the public good. Paying taxes is not just a matter of practicality or avoiding consequences, but it is a matter of conscience and recognizing the authority that God has placed over us. The tribute we pay to them is not just for their personal benefit, but it is an act of homage to God and an act of obedience to His will. As God's ministers, they continue steadfastly in their duty, representing His majesty and serving His purpose.
