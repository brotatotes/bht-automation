2. "φόβος, to those set over us and having power: τιμή, to those, but likewise to all on whom the state has conferred distinction."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christianity is not designed to break in upon the proper order of society, but rather to establish and confirm that order."
2. "It does not rudely assail existing institutions: but it comes to put them on a proper footing."
3. "The authority of God is superior to that of civil rulers. They have no right to make enactments which interfere with 'his' authority."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To all. Probably all magistrates, though some explain all men. Tribute - custom [φορον - τελος] . Tribute on persons : custom on goods.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle seems here summarily to include the particulars in which the duties of subjects towards magistrates consist, — that they are to hold them in esteem and honor, that they are to obey their edicts, laws, and judgments, — that they are to pay tributes and customs."
2. "Now this passage confirms what I have already said, — that we ought to obey kings and governors, whoever they may be, not because we are constrained, but because it is a service acceptable to God; for he will have them not only to be feared, but also honored by a voluntary respect."
3. "The distinction commonly made between the two words is this, — φόρος, 'tribute,' is a tax on the person or on lands, andτέλος, 'custom,' is what is levied on merchandise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ideal of civil government here presented affords on the one hand abundant reason for obedience to rightful authority, and yet on the other makes room for Christian resistance to rulers who utterly and entirely depart from this ideal."
2. "The Christian’s duty is to obey, until the duty of resistance is clearly proven."
3. "Such obedience has led to civil freedom, and consists with the highest spiritual freedom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Dues (οφειλας). Debts, from οφειλω, to owe. Often so in the papyri, though not in Greek authors. In N.T. only here, Matthew 18:32; 1 Corinthians 7:3. Paying debts needs emphasis today, even for ministers."
2. "To whom tribute is due (τω τον φορον). We must supply a participle with the article τω like απαιτουντ ("to the one asking tribute"). So with the other words (to whom custom, τω το τελος απαιτουντ; to whom fear, τω τον φοβον απαιτουντ; to whom honour, τω την τιμην απαιτουντ)."

### John Gill:
1. "To all princes, magistrates, and officers, that are placed over us... should we render as a due debt, and not as a mere gift... whatever belongs to them, or is proper for them for the due discharge of their office..." 
2. "These two words include all sorts of levies, taxes, subsidies... and what arises from the exportation and importation of goods..."
3. "There is an honour due to all men, according to their respective rank and station, and the relation they stand in to each other..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tribute - Taxes on your persons or estates." 
2. "Fear - Obedience." 
3. "Honour - Reverence."
