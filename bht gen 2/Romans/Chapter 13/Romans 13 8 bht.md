# Romans 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The command to love one another is not simply a suggestion, but a debt that we owe to each other. This obligation is to be fulfilled constantly, recognizing that it can never be fully paid off. However, if we prioritize this debt of love and live in accordance with it, all other obligations towards our neighbors will naturally be fulfilled. By loving others as we ought, we fulfill the essence of the entire law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Pay all other debts: be indebted in the matter of love alone."
2. "This debt increases the more, the more it is paid: because the practice of love makes the principle of love deeper and more active."
3. "He who practices Love, the higher duty, has, even before he does this, fulfilled the law, the lower."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Owe no man anything, but to love one another"—"Acquit yourselves of all obligations except love, which is a debt that must remain ever due" [HODGE].
2. "For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law"—for the law itself is but love in manifold action, regarded as a matter of duty.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This rule, together with the other rules of Christianity, would propose a remedy for all the evils of bad debts in the following manner."
2. "Religion would produce sober, chastened views of the end of life, of the great design of living; and would take off the affections from the splendor, gaiety, and extravagances which lead often to the contraction of debts."
3. "Love is a debt which 'can' never be discharged. We should feel that we 'owe' this to all people, and though by acts of kindness we may be constantly discharging it, yet we should feel that it can 'never' be fully met while there is opportunity to do good."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Another [τον ετερον] . Lit., the other, or the different one, the word emphasizing more strongly the distinction between the two parties. Rev., his neighbor.

### John Calvin:
1. "He then who introduces anarchy, violates love; for what immediately follows anarchy, is the confusion of all things."
2. "He who loves his neighbor as himself, performs his duty towards the whole world."
3. "The debt of love is to be always paid, and is always due: for love is ever to be exercised."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The more we love, the more we will feel the claims of love. This obligation can never be paid; hence here we must 'owe,' but we must here most faithfully attempt to discharge our obligations."
2. "Love is more than a performance of the single precepts of the law, it is the essence of the law itself."
3. "The context (Romans 13:9-10) plainly shows that the Mosaic law is meant, while the whole Epistle excludes any idea of justification as based on this fulfilment. The Apostle is writing to those who love because they are justified."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Except the loving one another." This articular infinitive is in the accusative case the object of οφειλετε and partitive apposition with μηδεν (nothing). This debt can never be paid off, but we should keep the interest paid up.
2. "Just as in the relations of man and God πιστις has been substituted for νομος, so between man and man αγαπη takes the place of definite legal relations" (Sanday and Headlam).
3. Love is the only solution of our social relations and national problems.

### John Gill:
1. "There are debts arising from the natural and civil relations subsisting among men, which should be discharged; as of the husband to the wife, the wife to the husband; parents to their children, children to their parents; masters to their servants, servants to their masters; one brother, friend, and neighbour, to another."
2. "But to love one another. This is the only debt never to be wholly discharged; for though it should be always paying, yet ought always to be looked upon as owing."
3. "For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law; that is, not who loves some one particular person, but every other person besides himself, even his neighbour, in the largest sense of the word, including all mankind, and that as himself; such an one has fulfilled the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "To love one another - An eternal debt, which can never be sufficiently discharged; but yet if this be rightly performed, it discharges all the rest."
2. "For he that loveth another - As he ought."
3. "Hath fulfilled the whole law - Toward his neighbour."
