# Romans 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandment to love our neighbor encompasses all other commandments that pertain to our interactions with others. It is the principle from which all other commandments flow, and it is the epitome of fulfilling the law. Love for our neighbor prevents us from engaging in harmful actions such as murder, theft, and adultery. It is a fundamental aspect of living a righteous life and is ultimately summarized as the law of love.
