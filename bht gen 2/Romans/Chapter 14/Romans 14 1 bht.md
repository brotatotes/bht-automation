# Romans 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As children of light, it is important not to become intolerant of the shortcomings and weaknesses of others. Those who are weak in faith should be received into Christian fellowship with love and courtesy, rather than engaging in disputes. Instead of trying to argue or criticize, it is more effective to lead by example and show kindness, tenderness, and faithful teaching. By accommodating the weak and patiently bearing with their weaknesses, peace can be achieved among believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Do not let your own realization of your state as children of light make you intolerant of short-coming and infirmity in others."
2. "'Weak in the faith' = holding THE FAITH imperfectly, i.e. not being able to receive the faith in its strength, so as to be above such prejudices."
3. "Do not let your association of him among you be with a view to settle these disputes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Him that is weak in faith...not for the purpose of arguing him out of them: which indeed usually does the reverse; whereas to receive him to full brotherly confidence and cordial interchange of Christian affection is the most effectual way of drawing them off."
 
2. "The strong, it will be observed, are those who knew these to be abolished under the Gospel; 'the weak' are those who had scruples on this point."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To produce peace, there must be kindness, tenderness, and faithful teaching; not denunciation, or harshness, on one side or the other."
2. "The 'leading' idea here - which all Christians should remember - is, that a harsh and angry denunciation of a man in relation to things not morally wrong, but where he may have honest scruples, will only tend to confirm him more and more in his doubts."
3. "In questions which now occur about modes of 'dress,' about 'measures' and means of promoting revivals, and about rites and ceremonies, this is by far the wisest course, if we wish to overcome the scruples of a brother, and to induce him to think as we do."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Weak in the faith. Probably referring to a class of Jewish Christians with Essenic tendencies."
2. "Receive ye [œÄœÅŒøœÉŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒµœÉŒ∏Œµ] . Into fellowship."
3. "Doubtful disputations [Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπœÉŒµŒπœÇ Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπœÉŒºœâŒΩ] . Lit., judgings of thoughts."

### John Calvin:
1. "They who have made the most progress in Christian doctrine should accommodate themselves to the more ignorant, and employ their own strength to sustain their weakness."
2. "The ampler the grace which they had received from the Lord, the more bound they were to help their neighbors."
3. "Not for the solutions of doubts [...] the weak should not be wearied with fruitless disputes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Him that is weak in the faith...faith in Christ is meant, not Christian doctrine, or moral conviction, or knowledge."
2. "Receive ye...count him one of your number, in fraternal fellowship."
3. "But not to doubtful disputations...it should not be in such a way as to produce this result, that his thoughts are criticized and judged."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not for decisions of opinions."
2. "The 'strong' brother is not called upon to settle all the scruples of the 'weak' brother."
3. "But each takes it on himself to do it."

### John Gill:
1. "The advice the apostle gives, in reference to such a person, is to receive him; not only into their affections... but also into church fellowship with them."
2. "But this was no bar of communion, nor ought a person to be rejected on account of his weakness, either in the grace, or in the doctrine of faith."
