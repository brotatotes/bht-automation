# Romans 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle now shifts his focus and directs his questioning towards the stronger brother, asking why he would despise his weaker brother. The emphasis lies on the fact that both the weak and the strong believers are part of the same family, belonging to God and Christ, and therefore should not judge or look down upon one another.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He returns to the duty of abstaining, the weak, from judging his stronger brother; the strong, from despising the weaker."
2. "The fact of Origen once citing it, decides nothing, in the presence of the expression βήματος τοῦ χριστοῦ in 2 Cor."
3. "It seems probable that χριστοῦ has been substituted for θεοῦ in the later MSS. from 2 Corinthians 5:10."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But thou (the weaker believer), why judgest thou thy brother? And thou again (the stronger), why despisest thou thy brother?"
2. "For we shall all—the strong and the weak together—stand before the judgment-seat of Christ."
3. "The present reading doubtless crept in from 1 Corinthians 4:5, where 'the judgment-seat of Christ' occurs. But here 'the judgment-seat of God' seems to have been used, with reference to the quotation and the inference in Romans 14:11 Romans 14:12."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since we are all subjects and servants alike, and must all stand at the same tribunal, what right have we to sit in judgment on others?"
2. "Thou who art a 'Jewish' convert, why dost thou attempt to arraign the 'Gentile' disciple, as if he had violated a law of God?"
3. "The Jewish convert is now a brother; and all the contempt which you Gentiles once cherished for the Jew should cease, from the fact that 'he' is now 'a Christian.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Why dost thou judge? Thou, why dost thou Judge?" (Commentary on Romans 14:10) 
2. "The servant of another is here called brother." (Commentary on Romans 14:10) 
3. "For judgment-seat, see on to set his foot on, Acts 7:5." (Commentary on Romans 14:10)

### John Calvin:
1. "He hence concludes, that it is an unreasonable boldness in any one to assume the power to judge his brother, since by taking such a liberty he robs Christ the Lord of the power which he alone has received from the Father."
2. "But first, by the term brother, he checks this lust for judging; for since the Lord has established among us the right of a fraternal alliance, an equality ought to be preserved; every one then who assumes the character of a judge acts unreasonably."
3. "Secondly, he calls us before the only true judge, from whom no one can take away his power, and whose tribunal none can escape."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But why dost thou judge thy brother? ‘Thou’ is emphatic, ‘thou’ belonging to Christ the Lord." 
2. "Or thou also, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? Addressed to the stronger brother, who ‘also,’ by setting at nought his brother, overlooks the fact that both belong to Christ."
3. "For, as a reason for both the preceding questions, we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God. The judging of one’s brother therefore, first encroaches upon Christ’s office as ruler, and, second, anticipates the judgment bar of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But thou, why dost thou judge?"
2. "Shall stand before"
3. "See the same figure of God in 2 Corinthians 5:10."

### John Gill:
1. "The emphasis lies upon the word 'brother', in both branches of the expostulation; and the force of the apostle's reasoning is that they should not judge or despise one another, because they were brethren, stood in the same relation to God and Christ, belonged to the same family, were partakers of the same grace, and had no pre-eminence one over another."
2. "They had but one master, and all they were brethren."
3. "For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ; at the last day, when he shall sit on his throne of glory, and all nations shall be gathered before him, and he shall pronounce and execute the decisive sentence on each of them."

### John Wesley:
1. Or why dost thou despise thy brother — Hitherto the apostle as addressed the weak brother: now he speaks to the stronger.
