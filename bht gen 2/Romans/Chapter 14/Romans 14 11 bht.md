# Romans 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As I live is the solemn oath of the Lord, emphasizing his infinite and independent life. Every tongue will confess to God, acknowledging him as their rightful Lord, a confession that will reach its full extent at the appointed time. As we await that day, let us pray for mercy not only for ourselves but also for those who have disagreed or condemned us, desiring unity and the compassion of the Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The citation is according to the present Alexandrine text, except that our ζῶ  ἐγώ = κατ ʼ ἐμαυτοῦ ὀμνύω."
2. "Shall praise, see reff. LXX - [117] [118] 1.3a following the Heb. has ὀμεῖται ( ὀμνῖται [119] ) πᾶσα γλῶσσα τὸν θεόν ( κύριον [120] )."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As I live, saith the Lord—Hebrew, JEHOVAH."
2. "Every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
3. "Consequently, shall bow to the award of God upon their character and actions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This mode of quotation is a strong incidental proof that the apostle regarded the Lord Jesus as divine."
2. "To bow the knee” is an act expressing homage, submission, or adoration. It means that every person shall acknowledge him as God and admit his right to universal dominion."
3. "The passage originally did not refer particularly to the day of judgment, but expressed the truth that all believers should acknowledge his dominion. It is as applicable, however, to the judgment, as to any other act of homage which his people will render."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By myself I swear... that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now demonstrates by the words of the Prophet, that all flesh ought to be humbled while expecting that judgment; and this is expressed by the bending of the knee."
2. "This is also a remarkable passage for the purpose of confirming our faith in the eternal divinity of Christ: for it is God who speaks here, and the God who has once for all declared, that he will not give his glory to another."
3. "To swear to God or by his name is to avow allegiance to him, to profess or to confess his name."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The citation is freely made, the variations are, As I live for ‘I have sworn by myself’ and shall give praise to God for ‘shall swear’ (LXX. ‘unto God’)."
2. "The word ‘give praise’ usually means ‘confess,’ but followed by a dative, as here, has the signification, ‘render homage,’ ‘give praise.’"
3. "The general thought thus expressed by the Apostle lay at the basis of the more special one of the Old Testament passage. The whole, in any case, is regarded as a prophecy of the final judgment, furnishing a proof of the last clause of Romans 14:10."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As I live." The LXX here (Isaiah 45:23) has κατ' εμαυτου ομνυω, "I swear by myself."
2. "Shall confess to God." Future middle of εξομολογεω, to confess openly (εξ) with the accusative as in Matthew 3:6.
3. "With the dative as here the idea is to give praise to, to give gratitude to (Matthew 11:25)."

### John Gill:
1. "I have sworn by myself"; which being generally expressed, the apostle, perfectly agreeable to the meaning of it, gives the particular form of oath he swore.
2. ...figuratively, of the subjection of all creatures to Christ, both voluntary and involuntary.
3. ...everyone that has a tongue, every man, be he who he will, a good or a bad man, shall own at the last day, that Christ is God and Lord of all.

### John Wesley:
1. "As I live — An oath proper to him, because he only possesseth life infinite and independent."
2. "Every tongue shall confess to God — Shall own him as their rightful Lord; which shall then only be accomplished in its full extent."
3. "The Lord grant we may find mercy in that day; and may it also be imparted to those who have differed from us! yea, to those who have censured and condemned us for things which we have done from a desire to please him, or refused to do from a fear of offending him."
