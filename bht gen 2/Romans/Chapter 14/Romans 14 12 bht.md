# Romans 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All of us, as Christians, will have to give an account of ourselves to God. This emphasizes the individual responsibility each of us has. When we give account to God, we will be fully discharged through the blood and righteousness of Christ. It is important to remember that when we leave this world, we will have to give an account of all our actions to our Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stress is on περὶ ἑαυτοῦ: and the next verse refers back to it, laying the emphasis on ἀλλήλους."
2. "Seeing that our account to God will be of each man’s own self, let us take heed lest by judging one another we incur the guilt of ἀπολλύειν one another."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Now, if it be remembered that all this is adduced quite incidentally, to show that CHRIST is the absolute Master of all Christians, to rule their judgments and feelings towards each other while 'living,' and to dispose of them 'dying,' the testimony which it bears to the absolute Divinity of Christ will appear remarkable."
2. "On any other view, the quotation to show that we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God would be a strange proof that Christians are all amenable to Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Every one of us - That is, every Christian; for the connection requires us to understand the argument only of Christians."
2. "In the fearful arraignment of that day every work and purpose shall be brought forth, and tried by the unerring standard of justice."
3. "Still we may be said to give account to God, The Lord Jesus being God as well as man, the account will be rendered directly to the Creator as well as the Redeemer of the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "This conclusion invites us to humility and lowliness of mind."
2. "He forbids us to judge, that is, to condemn; in the second place he bids us to judge, that is, to exercise judgment, so as not to give offense."
3. "He therefore bids them to exercise wariness themselves; for by their neglect they often precipitate, or drive their brethren against some stumblingblock or another."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis rests on ‘each one of us,’ not on ‘of himself,’ or, ‘to God.’" 
2. "There is no exception; let each remember this, and each will be guarded against judging his brother."
3. "‘That which precedes means: 'Do not judge thy brother, since God will judge him;’ this verse means: 'Judge thou thyself, since God will judge thee.'"


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Shall give account  (λογον δωσε). So Aleph A C rather than αποδωσε of Textus Receptus. Common use of λογος for account (bookkeeping, ledger) as in Luke 16:2. 

### John Gill:
1. "...from whence it necessarily follows, that every man... shall give an account of himself to God..."
2. "...the saints will have upon this reckoning, in what sort soever it may be, a full and open discharge, through the blood and righteousness of Christ."
3. "...when a man removes out of this world, then חושבנא למאריהיהיב, "he gives an account to his Lord", of all that he has done in the world.''
