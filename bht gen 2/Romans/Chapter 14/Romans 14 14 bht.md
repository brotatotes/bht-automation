# Romans 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that nothing is inherently unclean. This assurance is as strong as my confidence in God's love for me. However, what is considered unclean can vary based on personal beliefs. Under the gospel, there are no strict dietary restrictions, but one's conscience may still play a role in determining what is appropriate to consume.
