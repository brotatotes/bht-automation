# Romans 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If our actions cause our brother to be grieved, whether by leading him into sin, defiling his conscience, or causing him to stumble and fall away from faith, we are not walking in love. True love does not boast over or belittle the weak brother, but bears with his weaknesses and abstains from things that cause him grief. We must be careful not to destroy the peace and comfort of our brother, for whom Christ gave his life, by valuing our own desires over his well-being.
