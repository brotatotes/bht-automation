# Romans 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The essence of the kingdom of God lies not in external practices, but in the internal transformation of the heart. True religion is not about rules and rituals, but about righteousness - reflecting the image of God within us. This kingdom is characterized by peace that surpasses human understanding and joy that comes from the presence of the Holy Spirit. It is through the righteousness of Christ, obtained by faith, that we enter into this kingdom of peace and joy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the kingdom of God... is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." 
2. "The first - 'righteousness' - has respect to God... denoting 'rectitude' in its widest sense."
3. "The second - 'peace' - has respect to our neighbors, denoting 'concord' among brethren."
4. "The third - 'joy in the Holy Ghost' - has respect to ourselves... Christians as so thinking and feeling under the workings of the Holy Ghost, that their joy may be viewed rather as that of the blessed Agent who inspires it than their own."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The uniquenesses of the kingdom of God, or of the Church of Christ on earth, do not consist in observing the distinctions between meats and drinks..."
2. "The Christian must so live as to be appropriately denominated a righteous man, and not a man whose whole attention is absorbed by the mere ceremonies and outward forms of religion."
3. "The tendency and design of the kingdom of God is to produce concord and love, and to put an end to alienation and strife."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The heavenly sphere of life in which God's word and Spirit govern, and whose organ on earth is the Church." (Lange)
2. "Not peace with God, reconciliation, but mutual concord among Christians." 
3. "The whole chapter is concerned with the mutual relations of Christians, rather than with their relations to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now, on the other hand, teaches us, that we can without loss abstain from the use of our liberty, because the kingdom of God does not consist in such things."
2. "He has at the same time no doubt included in few words a summary of what it is; namely, that we, being well assured, have peace with God, and possess real joy of heart through the Holy Spirit dwelling in us."
3. "And though it was necessary, when mention was made of these things, that the Spirit should have been declared as the author; yet he meant in this place indirectly to oppose the Spirit to external things, that we might know, that the things which belong to the kingdom of God continue complete to us without the use of meats."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This kingdom is 'God's dominion over the heart, instituted and administered by Christ; it is the heavenly sphere of life, in which God's word and Spirit govern, and whose organ on the earth is the Church'" (Lange).
2. "Two views: (1.) 'Righteousness' from God (= justification), 'peace' with God (= reconciliation) 'joy in the Holy Spirit,' produced by fellowship with the Holy Spirit; these are named as the essential matters in the kingdom of God. This is favored by the tone of the entire Epistle" (Lange).
3. "Others understand 'righteousness' as moral rectitude toward men, 'peace' as concord in the Church, and 'joy in the Holy Spirit' as above, but with a wider reference to the common joy of Christians. This view is favored by the context, especially Romans 14:18-19, and by the practical nature of the entire passage" (Lange).

3. "The kingdom of glory, which is the kingdom of God, because of his preparing, giving, calling to, and putting into the possession of, is attained unto by righteousness; not the righteousness of men, but the righteousness of Christ imputed by God, and received by faith; and through peace made by the blood of Christ, and rejoicing in him, without having any confidence in the flesh, which is a branch of the Spirit's grace in regeneration."

### John Wesley:
