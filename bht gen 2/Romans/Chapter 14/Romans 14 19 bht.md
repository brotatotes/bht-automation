# Romans 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we seek to follow after the things that lead to peace and mutual edification, we are serving Christ and pleasing to God. This involves not only looking after our own peace and conscience, but also helping others build up their faith and contributing to the well-being of the church as a whole. Practical divinity, focused on living out our faith, brings both peace and edification, whereas controversial divinity may not contribute directly to building up one another in our faith.
