## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The strong in faith, so indicated by what follows, is opposed to ὁ δὲ ἀσθενῶν, by which τὸν ἀσθενοῦντα of Rom 14:1 is resumed."
2. "πιστεύει φαγεῖν, either believes that he may eat, or ventures to eat. The latter is favored by reference to Acts, 'we trust to be saved;' though that also may be expanded into 'we believe that we shall be saved,' as E.V."
3. "λάχ . ἐσθ., see remarks introductory to this chapter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "one believeth that he may eat all things—See Acts 10:16."
2. "another, who is weak, eateth herbs—restricting himself probably to a vegetable diet, for fear of eating what might have been offered to idols, and so would be unclean."
3. "(See 1 Corinthians 8:1-13)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For one believeth - This was the case with the Gentiles in general, who had none of the scruples of the Jew about the propriety of eating certain kinds of meat."
2. "The apostle admits that he was ‘weak,’ that is, not fully established in the views of Christian liberty."
3. "The scruples of the Jews on the subject might have arisen in part from the fact that sins of ‘ignorance’ among them subjected them to certain penalties."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The point is the strength or weakness of the man's faith as it affects his eating." 
2. "Hence Rev., correctly, hath faith to eat." 
3. "Herbs grown on land cultivated by digging: garden - herbs, vegetables."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let him who believes, etc. What [Erasmus] has followed among the various readings I know not; but he has mutilated this sentence, which, in Paul’s words, is complete; and instead of the relative article he has improperly introduced alius — one, 'One indeed believes,' etc."
2. "That I take the infinitive for an imperative, ought not to appear unnatural nor strained, for it is a mode of speaking very usual with Paul."
3. "If the common version be more approved, the meaning then will be, — that it is not right that he who freely eats all things, as he believes them to be lawful, should require those, who are yet tender and weak in faith, to walk by the same rule."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One man hath faith to eat all things. One has a confidence resulting from faith which permits him to eat every kind of food."
2. "But he that is weak, eateth herbs. The scruple was such that only vegetables were eaten. Even bread, prepared by others, may have been deemed unclean."
3. "But there may have been a variety of usage among the weak brethren. Such believers are apt to differ among themselves, as well as with their stronger brethren."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath faith (πιστευε). Like εχε πιστιν (Acts 14:9)."
2. "But he that is weak (ο δε ασθενων). One would expect ος δε (but that one) in contrast with ος μεν. Hο is demonstrative with δε sometimes, but here is probably just the article with ασθενων."
3. "Herbs (λαχανα). From λαχανω, to dig. Hence garden herbs or vegetables. Denney feels certain that Paul has in mind a party of vegetarians in Rome."

### John Gill:
1. "He is fully persuaded in his mind, that there is nothing in itself common, or unclean; that the difference between clean and unclean meats, commanded to be observed by the law of Moses, is taken away."
2. "Every creature of God being good, and none to be refused because of the ceremonial law which is abrogated, provided it be received with thanksgiving and used to the glory of God."
3. "One that is weak in the faith, and who thinks that the laws concerning the observance of meats and drinks are still in force; and therefore, rather than break any of them, and that he may be sure he does not, will eat nothing but herbs."

### John Wesley:
1. All things — All sorts of food, though forbidden by the law.
