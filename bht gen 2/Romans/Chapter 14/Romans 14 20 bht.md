# Romans 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not destroy the work of God, whether it is the righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit that makes up the kingdom of God, or the weak brother who is the creation of God. It is important to remember that all types of food can be eaten without distinction, as everything in itself is good. However, one must be cautious not to offend others through their eating, for it brings displeasure to Christ and brings woe upon the one who causes the offense.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the expression οἰκοδομή having just preceded is the clue to the right meaning: and that τὸ ἔργον = τὴν οἰκοδομήν in the Apostle’s mind."
2. "He calls Christians in 1 Corinthians 3:9, θεοῦ γεώργιον, θεοῦ οἰκοδομή. Thus it will mean, thy fellow-Christian, as a plant of God’s planting, a building of God’s raising."
3. "All things indeed are pure, but (it is) evil to the man who eats with offense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle sees in whatever tends to violate a brother's conscience the incipient destruction of God's work... on the same principle as 'he that hateth his brother is a murderer'." 
2. "All things indeed are pure... but it is evil to that man who eateth with offence."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By your obstinate, pertinacious attachment to your own opinions about the distinctions of meat and drinks, do not pursue such a course as to lead a brother into sin, and ruin his soul."
2. "Do not so conduct yourself, in regard to the distinction of meats into clean and unclean, as to cause your brother to sin, and to impair or ruin the work of religion which God is carrying on in his soul."
3. "Though pure in itself, yet it may become an occasion of sin, if another is grieved by it. It is evil to the man who pursues a course that will give offense to a brother; that will pain him, or tend to drive him off from the church, or lead him any way into sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Destroy [καταλυε]. A different word from that In ver. 15. It means to loosen down, and is used of the destruction of buildings."

3. "With offense [δια προσκομματος]. Against his own conscientious scruple. Lit., through or amidst offense."
