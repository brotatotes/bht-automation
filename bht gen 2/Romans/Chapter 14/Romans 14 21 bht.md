# Romans 14:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is commendable to refrain from eating meat and drinking wine, or doing anything that may cause a weak brother to stumble, be offended, or become spiritually weak. By abstaining from these actions, we prevent others from imitating us against their conscience, we preserve their peace, and we protect them from being caught in a state of uncertainty and weakness. In doing so, we display a spirit of charity and concession, promoting harmony and unity within the body of Christ.
