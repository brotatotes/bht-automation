# Romans 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In matters of faith, it is not necessary to impose our beliefs on others. We should cherish our convictions before God without causing disturbance in the church. This will bring peace and happiness, for when we have a clear conscience in our actions, we can be truly content. It is important to avoid self-judgment and to not let morbid introspection cloud our Christian practice. Instead, we should hold on to our faith, test and choose our actions wisely, and strive for a conscience untroubled by unnecessary scruples.

3. "It is a blessed thing to have no scruples about things in which we allow ourselves."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do not obtrude your faith or opinion on others. Be satisfied with cherishing the opinion, and acting on it in private, without bringing it forward to produce disturbance in the church."
2. "This state of mind, the apostle says, is one that is attended with peace and happiness; and this is a 'further' reason why they should indulge their opinion in private, without obtruding it on others."
3. "But the way to be happy is to have a 'clear conscience' in what we do; or in other words, if we have 'doubts' about a course of conduct, it is not safe to indulge in that course, but it should be at once abandoned."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The faith which thou hast have thou to thyself." 
2. "Who, in settled conviction of the rightness of his action, subjects himself to no self-judgment after it."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then says, that liberty really understood, as it is that of faith, has properly a regard to God; so that he who is endued with a conviction of this kind, ought to be satisfied with peace of conscience before God; nor is it needful for him to show before men that he possesses it."
2. "For it happens, that many commit the worst of crimes without any scruple of conscience; but this happens, because they rashly abandon themselves, with closed eyes, to any course to which the blind and violent intemperance of the flesh may lead them; for there is much difference between insensibility and a right judgment."
3. "He then who examines things is happy, provided he is not bitten by an accusing conscience, after having honestly considered and weighed matters; for this assurance alone can render our works pleasing to God."

2. "Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth or 'approves of'; that is, it is well for that man who observes no difference of meats, if either he does not act contrary to his own conscience, and so condemns himself in what he allows himself in; or exposes himself to the censure, judgment, and condemnation of others, in doing that which he approves of as lawful, and is so, but unlawful when done to the offence of others."
