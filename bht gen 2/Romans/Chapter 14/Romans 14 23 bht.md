# Romans 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whatever a person does without a full conviction of its righteousness is considered sinful. This includes actions that one does not believe to be lawful or in accordance with their faith. In all such cases, any action that lacks faith as its foundation is considered to be sinful. Ultimately, it is important for individuals to remember that anything that goes against their personal belief and understanding is considered a violation of their conscience and, consequently, sinful.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That ‘faith in the Son of God’ by which the Apostle describes his own life in the flesh as being lived, informing and penetrating the motives and the conscience, will not include, will not sanction, an act done against the testimony of the conscience." 
2. "All that is not from faith, the great element in which the Christian lives and moves and desires and hopes, is sin." 
3. "Here the Apostle has in view two Christians, both living by faith, and by faith doing acts pleasing to God: and he reminds them that whatever they do out of harmony with this great principle of their spiritual lives, belongs to the category of sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Some points in Christianity are unessential to Christian fellowship; so that though one may be in error upon them, he is not on that account to be excluded either from the communion of the Church or from the full confidence of those who have more light."
2. "Acceptance with God is the only proper criterion of right to Christian fellowship. Whom God receives, men cannot lawfully reject."
3. "Many things which are lawful are not expedient. In the use of any liberty, therefore, our question should be, not simply, Is this lawful? but even if so, Can it be used with safety to a brother's conscience?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that doubteth...does not do it with a clear conscience."
2. "It means properly to 'condemn'...the person who should thus violate the dictates of his conscience would incur guilt...But it does not affirm that he would inevitably sink to hell."
3. "Whatever is not done with a full conviction that it is right, is sinful...a man should not do a thing doubting its correctness; that he should have a strong conviction that what he does is right; and that if he has 'not' this conviction, it is sinful."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith. In Christ. 'So far as it brings with it the moral confidence as to what in general and under given circumstances is the right Christian mode of action.'"
2. "The question seems to be almost wholly due to the mention of Aquila and Priscilla in ch. 16 and to the fact that there is no account of their migration from Ephesus to Rome, and of an after - migration again to Ephesus (2 Timothy 4:19)."
3. "Against these theories is the stubborn fact that of the known extant MSS. of Paul (about three hundred) all the MSS. hitherto collated, including all the most important, give these chapters in the received connection and order, with the exception of the doxology."

### John Calvin:
1. "As then the main thing in a good work is the persuasion of a mind conscious of being right before God, and as it were a calm assurance, nothing is more opposed to the acceptance of our works than vacillation." (435)
 
2. "For if our way of living is to be confined to this moderation, that no one is to touch a morsel of meat with a doubting conscience, how much greater caution is to be exercised in the greatest things?" (435)
 
3. "The reason for this condemnation is, that every work, however splendid and excellent in appearance, is counted as sin, except it be founded on a right conscience; for God regards not the outward display, but the inward obedience of the heart, by this alone is an estimate made of our works." (435)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The act of eating itself condemns him, of course, according to the Divine ordering, so that the justice of this verdict appears not only before God, but before men, and himself also."
2. "That which one cannot do as his redemption and in the enjoyment of His salvation, he should not do at all, otherwise that act, of which faith is not the soul, becomes sin."
3. "The more important matter is, however, to remember that for Christians, at least, Christian ethics should have full validity, and that here the principle admits of no exception: whatsoever is not of faith is sin; genuine Christian morality is all of faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He that doubteth (ο διακρινομενος) ... See James 1:6 for this same picture of the double-minded man." 
2. "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin (παν ο ουκ εκ πιστεως αμαρτια εστιν). Faith (πιστις) here is subjective, one's strong conviction in the light of his relation to Christ and his enlightened conscience."
3. "To go against this combination is sin beyond a doubt."

### John Gill:
1. "He is self-condemned, his conscience condemns him for what he himself does."
2. "Whatever is not agreeable to the word and doctrine of faith, ought not to be done."
3. "Without faith nothing can be pleasing to God; and whatever is contrary to the persuasion of a man's own mind, is so far criminal, as it is a violation of his conscience."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whatever a man does without a full persuasion of its lawfulness, it is sin to him."
2. "He does not believe it lawful and, in all these cases, whatsoever is not of faith is sin."
3. "Whatever is not of faith is sin."
