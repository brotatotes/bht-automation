# Romans 14:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who had a greater understanding of the Gospel and exercised their freedom to eat any kind of food should not look down on those who abstained due to their adherence to the ceremonial law. Similarly, those who abstained should not pass judgment on those who freely ate. God has welcomed both groups into His family, regardless of their practices and opinions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I would rather take ὁ ἐσθ . as the eater, and ὁ μὴ ἐσθ . the abstainer."
2. "ἐξουθ., for his weakness of faith, κρινέτω, for his laxity of practice."
3. "For God has accepted (adopted into his family) him (i.e. the eater, who was judged, his place in God’s family doubted: not the abstainer, who was only despised, set at nought, and to whom the words cannot, by the construction, apply."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let not him that eateth despise—look down superciliously upon 'him that eateth not.'" 
2. "Let not him that eateth not judge—sit in judgment censoriously upon 'him that eateth.'" 
3. "For God hath received him—as one of His dear children, who in this matter acts not from laxity, but religious principle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The true direction to be given in such a case is, 'to the one party,' not to treat the scruples of the other with derision and contempt, but with tenderness and indulgence."
2. "He has a right to 'his' opinion; and while I do not 'despise' him, he has no right to 'judge' me. This is the foundation of true charity."
3. "These scruples, on the one side or the other, are not inconsistent with true piety; and as 'God' has acknowledged him as 'his,' notwithstanding his opinions on these subjects, so 'we' also ought to recognise him as a Christian brother."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Despise [εξουθενειτω] . The verb means literally to throw out as nothing. Rev., better, set at nought."
2. "Judge [κρινετω] . Judgment is assigned to the weak brother, contempt to the stronger."
3. "A distinguished minister once remarked : 'The weak brother is the biggest bully in the universe!'"

### John Calvin:
1. "They who were strong had this fault, — that they despised those as superstitious who were scrupulous about insignificant things, and also derided them."
2. "Hence he exhorts the former to refrain from contempt, and the latter from excessive moroseness."
3. "When you see a man illuminated with the knowledge of God, you have evidence enough that he is received by the Lord; if you either despise or condemn him, you reject him whom God has embraced."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The self-consciousness of strength misleads into looking down with contempt on the weak" (Meyer).
2. "The weak brother fails to comprehend the liberty of the stronger one; his misjudgment leads to false judgment, namely, in condemning the person whose conduct he fails to reconcile with the scruples of his weak faith" (commentary).
3. "But it is far more pertinent to the weak brethren, since they are apt to excommunicate, withdraw from fellowship on trivial grounds of external observance, thus rejecting him whom God received" (commentary).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Set at nought (εξουθενειτω). Present active imperative of εξουθενεω, to treat as nothing and so with contempt."
2. "Judge (κρινετω). Present active imperative of κρινω, criticize. One side (the meat-eaters) despises the vegetarians, while the vegetarians criticize the meat-eaters."
3. "Received him (αυτον προσελαβετο). Aorist middle (indirect) of προσλαμβανω, same verb used in verse Romans 14:1. God took both sides into his fellowship without requiring that they be vegetarians or meat-eaters."

### John Gill:
1. "Such who had a greater degree of Gospel light and knowledge, and made use of their Christian liberty in eating any sort of food, were not to despise as they were apt to do, such as abstained therefrom on account of the ceremonial law."
2. "But leave them to the last and righteous judgment, when every one must be accountable to God for the various actions of life."
3. "They were received by Christ, coming to him as perishing sinners, according to the will of God; whose will it likewise was, that they should be received into church fellowship, as being no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Despise him that eateth not — As over-scrupulous or superstitious."
2. "Judge him that eateth — As profane, or taking undue liberties."
3. "For God hath received him — Into the number of his children, notwithstanding this."
