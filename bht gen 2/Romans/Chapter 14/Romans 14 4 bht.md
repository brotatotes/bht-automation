# Romans 14:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who are you to judge another person's servant? It is not your place to have power over them or criticize them. Each servant is accountable to their own master, and it is by their master's judgment that they will stand or fall. God has the ability to make them stand, for He is able to keep them and ensure their perseverance. They are united to Him, built on Him, and the Spirit of God is at work in them, securing their faithfulness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Who art thou that judgest the servant of another... to his own Master he stands or falls... but he shall be made to stand... for the Lord is able to make him stand." 
2. "This argument is entirely directed to the weak, who uncharitably judges the strong... The weak imagines that the strong cannot be a true servant of God, nor retain his steadfastness amidst such temptation."
3. "To this the Apostle answers, (1) that such judgment belongs only to Christ, whose servant he is: (2) that the Lord's Almighty Power is able to keep him up, and will do so."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "To make good his standing, not at the day of judgment, but in the true fellowship of the Church here, in spite of thy censures."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine of this Epistle is uniformly, that the Jew had no such privilege, but that in regard to salvation he was on the same level with the Gentile."
2. "It is not ours to sit in judgment on the servant of another man. He has the control over him."
3. "The master had no power to keep him in a way of obedience, except by the hope of reward, or the fear of punishment. But it was not so in regard to the Christian. He shall not fall. God has power to make him stand; to hold him; to keep him from error, and from condemnation, and 'he shall be holden up.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "[Thou art] first in the Greek order and peculiarly emphatic."

### John Calvin:
1. "It belongs not to you to prescribe to him what to do and what not to do, nor is it necessary for him to live according to your law."
2. "We ought to leave the man, whatever he may be, to the judgment of God; but as to his deeds we may indeed form a decisive opinion, though not according to our own views, but according to the word of God."
3. "He not only bids us to abstain from condemning, but also exhorts us to mercy and kindness, so as ever to hope well of him, in whom we perceive anything of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Who art thou that judgest?" Evidently addressed to the weak brother, rather than to both classes.
2. "Another man’s servant, lit., ‘house-servant,’ one more closely connected with the family than the other slaves, and in those times often the recipient of great and special favors from a powerful master." 
3. "He standeth or falleth. The judgment of the weak would exclude the stronger brother from his place as a Christian, hence it is most natural to explain this phrase of the continuance or non-continuance in the daily fidelity of a true Christian life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Who art thou?." (συ τις ει?). Proleptic position of συ, "thou who art thou?"

### John Gill:
1. "One man has nothing to do with another man's servant; he has no power over him, nor any right to call him to an account for his actions; nor has he any business to censure or condemn him for them, or concern himself about them."
2. "To his own master he standeth or falleth [...] it is according to his judgment and not another's, that they 'stand', or are and will be justified and acquitted, and will hear, well done, good and faithful servant."
3. "God will make such to persevere to the end [...] they are united to him, and are built on him, the sure foundation; and the Spirit of God has begun that good work, which shall be performed."
