# Romans 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One man distinguishes one day above another, possibly referring to Jewish feasts and fasts. But let every man be fully convinced in his own mind and not condemn or judge one another.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He classes the observance or non-observance of particular days, with the eating or abstaining from particular meats. In both cases, he is concerned with things which he evidently treats as of absolute indifference in themselves."
2. "The obvious inference from his strain of arguing is, that he knew of no such obligation, but believed all times and days to be, to the Christian strong in faith, ALIKE. I do not see how the passage can be otherwise understood."
3. "I therefore infer, that sabbatical obligation to keep any day, whether seventh or first, was not recognized in apostolic times."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day" - The supplement "alike" should be omitted, as injuring the sense. 
2. "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind" - be guided in such matters by conscientious conviction.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression means that one would set a higher value on one day than on another, or would regard it as more sacred than others."
2. "The passage means that he regards 'every day' as consecrated to the Lord."
3. "Every man is to examine them for himself, and act accordingly. This direction pertains to the subject under discussion, and not to any other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Esteemeth every day alike (krinei pasan hJmeran). Alike is inserted. Lit., judgeth every day; subjects every day to moral scrutiny."
2. "Be fully persuaded [πληροφορεισθω] . Better, Rev., assured. See on most surely believed, Luke 1:1."
3. "In his own mind. 'As a boat may pursue its course uninjured either in a narrow canal or in a spacious lake' (Bengel)."

### John Calvin:
1. "That they were imbued with these notions, was an evidence of their weakness; they would have thought otherwise, had they possessed a certain and a clear knowledge of Christian liberty."
2. "Here then the Apostle applies the best rule, when he bids every one to be fully assured as to his own mind; by which he intimates that there ought to be in Christians such a care for obedience, that they do nothing, except what they think, or rather feel assured, is pleasing to God."
3. "For the meaning of the verb here see Romans 4:21. 'The Greek word is a metaphor borrowed from ships, which are carried with full sail, and signifieth a most certain persuasion of the truth.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One man esteemeth one day above another; distinguishes one day from another, the reference probably being to the Jewish feasts and fasts."
2. "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He does not say 'spirit,' but, 'mind;' the practical reason is to be exercised in the decision of matters of personal duty; the full conviction of an educated conscience should be sought for, not fancied spiritual intuitions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One man, another. Regular idiom of contrasted demonstratives (this one, that one)."
2. "One day above another. 'Day beyond day.' For this use of παρα (beside) in comparison..."
3. "Be fully assured. Present passive imperative of πληροφορεω, late compound verb for which see on Luke 1:1; Romans 4:21."

### John Gill:
1. "The weak brother, though he also observed a day for divine worship, which is the Lord's day, since there must be some time for it as well as place, yet he observed the day for the sake of worship, and not worship for the sake of the day."
2. "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind; this is the advice the apostle gives to both parties; his sense is, that he would have each of them fully enjoy their own principle and practice undisturbed... they ought to be thoroughly satisfied in their own minds, and being so, should content themselves with their different sentiments and practices, without despising or censuring one another."

### John Wesley:
1. "One day above another — As new moons, and other Jewish festivals."
2. "Let every man be fully persuaded — That a thing is lawful, before he does it."
