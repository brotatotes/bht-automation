# Romans 14:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who regard a specific day as holy and set apart for God do so out of a sense of obligation and honor. Conversely, those who do not pay special regard to a particular day do so based on a conscientious belief that such observance is not required. Similarly, those who abstain from certain foods, believing it to be God's will, give thanks to Him for their herb-based meal. Both actions, whether observing or abstaining, are motivated by a focus on God, expressing gratitude and obedience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words in brackets were probably omitted from the similar ending φρονεῖ of both clauses having misled some early copyists; but perhaps it may have been intentionally done, after the observation of the Lord’s Day came to be regarded as binding."
2. "φρονῶν, taking account of, 'regarding.'"
3. "εὐχαριστεῖ, adduced as a practice of both parties, shews the universality among the early Christians of thanking God at meals: see 1 Timothy 4:3-4. The εὐχαριστία of the μὴ ἐσθίων was over his 'dinner of herbs.'"
4. "κυρίῳ is CHRIST."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that regardeth the day,
	regardeth it to the Lord—the Lord CHRIST,
	as before."
2. "Each doing what he believes to be the Lord's will."
3. "Certainly it could not, if the sabbath were merely one of the Jewish festival days; but it will not do to take this for granted merely because it was observed under the Mosaic economy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that regardeth it as 'holy,' or as set apart to the service of God. He believes that he is 'required' by God to keep it."
2. "The Gentile Christian, who freely eats all kinds of meat... does it believing that such is God's will. In all other cases, it is to do it feeling that we receive our food from him; rendering thanks for his goodness, and desirous of being strengthened that we may do his commands."
3. "He abstains from eating because he believes that God requires him to do it, and with a desire to obey and honor him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. He that regardeth not - doth not regard it. Omit.

### John Calvin:
1. "He who regarded days committed no sin; for nothing but good can be accepted by God."
2. "He who refrained from unclean meats: if he ate in a doubtful state of mind, it would not have been to receive any benefit, from God’s hand, but to lay his own hand on forbidden things."
3. "Let a reason for what he does be clear to every one; as an account must be given before the celestial tribunal; for whether one eats meat or abstains, he ought in both instances to have regard to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord." 
2. "The presence of the Fourth Commandment in the Decalogue, the recognition (and explanation) of the obligation to keep the Sabbath by our Lord, as well as the relation of the law to the Christian life, suggest for the observance of the Lord’s day a higher sanction than is afforded by ‘considerations of humanity and religious expediency’ or by ecclesiastical enactment."
3. "All Christians were in the habit of thanking God at meals (and have been ever since). This was the proof that the man who ate without scruple ate as a Christian man, ‘unto the Lord;’ while on the other hand he who scrupulously abstained also regarded himself as abstaining from the same Christian motive, and hence gave thanks unto God over the meal of herbs to which he confined himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Regardeth (φρονε). 'Thinks of,' 'esteems,' 'observes,' 'puts his mind on' (from φρην, mind)."
2. "The Textus Receptus has also 'he that regardeth not,' but it is not genuine."
3. "Unto the Lord (κυριω). Dative case. So as to τω θεω (unto God)."
4. "Paul's principle of freedom in non-essentials is most important."
5. "The Jewish Christians still observed the Seventh day (the Sabbath). The Gentile Christians were observing the first day of the week in honour of Christ's Resurrection on that day."
6. "Paul pleads for liberty."

### John Gill:
1. "The weak brother that esteems one day above another, and regards the passover, pentecost, and feast of tabernacles, a new moon, or a seventh day sabbath, does it in obedience to the commands of the Lord, which he thinks are still binding, not knowing that they are disannulled by Christ."
2. "Whether he is right or wrong, it is to the Lord he does it, and to his own master he stands or falls."
3. "The man that is strong in faith, and is fully persuaded by the Lord Jesus that all distinction of meats, as of days, is ceased, eats any thing, and every sort of food, that comes in his way, without making any difference; and when he eats or drinks at any time, it is all to the glory of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Regardeth it to the Lord — That is, out of a principle of conscience toward God."
2. "To the Lord he doth not regard it — He also acts from a principle of conscience."
3. "He that eateth not — Flesh. Giveth God thanks — For his herbs."
