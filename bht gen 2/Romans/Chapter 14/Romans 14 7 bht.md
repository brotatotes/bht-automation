# Romans 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, our lives are not our own. We do not live for ourselves or our own desires, but for the Lord. Both in life and in death, we belong to Christ. This means that everything we do should be done with the purpose of bringing glory to Him. We should not be concerned with pleasing ourselves or satisfying the desires of others, but rather, we should seek to please God in all that we do. May our lives be a reflection of our dedication to Him, living in accordance with His will and His purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse illustrates the κυρίῳ of the former, and at the same time sets in a still plainer light than before, that both parties, the eater and the abstainer, are servants of another, even Christ."
2. "ἑαυτῷ and κυρίῳ are datives commodi."
3. "ζῇν and ἀποθνήσκειν represent the whole sum of our course on earth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 7, 8. For none of us—Christians
	liveth to himself—(See
	2 Corinthians 5:14; 2 Corinthians 5:15),
	to dispose of himself or shape his conduct after his own ideas and
	inclinations. 
	and no man—"and
	none" of us Christians "dieth to himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Where there was evidence of a sincere desire to do the will of God there should be charitable feeling, through there was difference of opinion and judgment in many smaller matters."
2. "To live 'to ourselves' is to make it the great object to become rich or honored, or to indulge in the ease, comfort, and pleasures of life. These are the aim of all people but Christians."
3. "No man... Dieth to himself - This expression is used to denote the 'universality' or the 'totality' with which Christians belong to God. Every thing is done and suffered with reference to his will."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To himself. But unto Christ."
2. "Hence the meaning 'a Christian should live for others,' so often drawn from these words, is not the teaching of the passage."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is no matter of wonder that particular acts of our life should be referred to the Lord’s will, since life itself ought to be wholly spent to his glory."
2. "For then only is the life of a Christian rightly formed, when it has for its object the will of God."
3. "But if thou oughtest to refer whatever thou doest to his good pleasure, it is then an act of impiety to undertake anything whatever, which thou thinkest will displease him; nay, which thou art not persuaded will please him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christian’s eating or not eating is unto the Lord, because the sum of his earthly existence, living and dying, is not ‘unto himself;’ and this is true in the case of all."
2. "The positive follows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  To himself  (εαυτω). Dative of advantage again. But to the Lord as he shows in verse Romans 14:8. Life and death focus in the Lord. 

### John Gill:
1. "none of us believers... do not live, neither to righteous, nor to sinful self... nor do they live to their own lusts, or make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof, and much less to the lusts and wills of others..."
2. "believers die as well as others, not eternally, or the second death, but corporeally, or a temporal death... it frees them from all their sorrows, toil, and labours, and introduces them into the presence of Christ, and the enjoyment of everlasting happiness..."
3. "no man has the power over life or death... this belongs to another Lord and master, whom life and death are both to subserve."

### John Wesley:
1. None of us — Christians, in the things we do.Liveth to himself — Is at his own disposal; doeth his own will.
