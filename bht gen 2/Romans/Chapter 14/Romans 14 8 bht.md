# Romans 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Living or dying, eating or abstaining, observing days or not observing them, everything we do is for the Lord. Both our natural and spiritual life are derived from Him and we belong to Him. We live to do His will, promote His glory, and honor Him as the supreme object of our lives. Even in death, we die unto the Lord, consecrating our departure as an act of devotion to Him. In all our existence, from beginning to end, we magnify and belong to the Lord, our Savior and Redeemer.
