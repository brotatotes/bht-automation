# Romans 15:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle includes himself among those who are strong, referring to those who have a clear understanding and are free from doubts. As believers, we should not seek to please ourselves, but rather consider the impact of our actions on others. We should bear with the weaknesses of others and not despise them, as their actions may come from a place of ignorance or misguided zeal. Let us deny ourselves the use of our liberties if it causes offense to others, for the purpose of promoting peace and unity among believers.
