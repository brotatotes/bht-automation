# Romans 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage in Deuteronomy 32:43 calls on the nations or Gentiles to rejoice with the Jewish people, as God intercedes on their behalf. In the Hebrew text, there is some difficulty in interpreting the meaning, but the Septuagint translation provides a clearer understanding by stating, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. This implies that both Jews and Gentiles are invited to celebrate and participate in the praises of God together. The quotation from the Old Testament serves to show that the Gentiles are included in God's plan and will partake in the same privileges as the Jewish people.
