# Romans 15:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise of a root of Jesse, a descendant of David, brings comfort and hope to the faithful. This Messianic figure is both divine and a Mediator, unrecognized and underestimated by the world. The exaltation of Christ as an ensign of the people has led to the voluntary submission of countless Gentiles, allowing them to find hope in Him. This promise also extends to those who were previously without hope, bringing a message of unity and salvation to all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "There shall be a 'the' root of Jesse - meaning, not 'He from whom Jesse sprang,' but 'He that is sprung from Jesse' (that is, Jesse's son David)."
2. "He that shall rise, &c. - So the Septuagint in substantial, though not verbal, agreement with the original."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There shall be a root - A descendant, or one that should proceed from him when he was dead. When a tree dies, and falls, there may remain a 'root' which shall retain life, and which shall send up a sprout of a similar kind."
2. "Though he should fall, like an aged tree, yet his name and family should not be extinct. There should be a descendant who should rise, and reign over the Gentiles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is a pleasant contrast: the root is in the lowest place, the banner rises highest, so as to be seen even by the remotest nations."
2. "Shall - hope. So Septuagint, which is a free rendering of the Hebrew seek or resort to."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek."

3. "In the Hebrew text in Isaiah, this is said of the root, and to be read thus, 'which shall stand for an ensign of the people'...since upon Christ's exaltation, and setting up his ensign or standard, the Gospel, in the Gentile world, multitudes became voluntary subjects to him, and still do..."
