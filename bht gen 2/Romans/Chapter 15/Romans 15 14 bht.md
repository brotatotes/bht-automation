# Romans 15:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ye are full of goodness and filled with all knowledge, able even to admonish one another. It is evident that the Roman Christians were highly esteemed by the Apostle Paul, as their faith and practice had gained recognition throughout the world. Their goodness was not of themselves, but a result of being renewed by the Spirit of God. Similarly, their knowledge was not mere intellectual understanding, but a deep understanding of the things of God acquired through their experience. This equipped them to instruct and confirm one another in the faith.
