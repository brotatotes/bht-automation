# Romans 15:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Brethren, I have written unto you with a certain boldness, but I want you to understand that my intention is not to assume the role of a teacher, but rather to remind you of what you already know and have been well instructed in. I write to you in part, focusing on specific areas where I feel the need to be direct and explicit. I do this because of the favor and authority that has been given to me as an apostle of Jesus Christ.
