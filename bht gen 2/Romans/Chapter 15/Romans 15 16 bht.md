# Romans 15:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, in his ministry to the Gentiles, envisions himself as a ministering priest, offering the gospel of God to them and presenting them as living sacrifices. He sees the conversion of the Gentiles as the ultimate goal of his service, acting as a faithful instrument in bringing them to faith in Jesus Christ. This portrayal does not equate the Christian minister as a sacrificing priest but rather emphasizes the spiritual sacrifice of the Gentiles themselves, sanctified by the Holy Spirit, as the fruit of Paul's ministerial labor.
