# Romans 15:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By speaking and through his actions, Christ manifested his power through me, performing mighty signs and wonders by the Spirit. The false teachers spoke of things they had not done, whereas I can confidently boast in what Christ accomplished through me, leading others to obedience through the proclamation of the Gospel and a life that exemplified and authenticated his message.
