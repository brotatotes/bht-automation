# Romans 15:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From Jerusalem, the gospel had been spread far and wide by Paul, not just through preaching and miracles, but also through the powerful work of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of those who heard. The regions he traveled were not merely a straight path, but a wide circuit encompassing Jerusalem and extending even to the west into Illyricum. His preaching was not partial or incomplete; he proclaimed the fullness of the gospel message, leaving nothing untold. The signs, wonders, and fulfillment of his preaching served as powerful evidence to convince the Gentiles to accept the truth of the gospel.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The signs and wonders are not spiritual, but external miraculous acts."
2. "I have fulfilled (ref.: 'executed my office of preaching,' so that the Gospel of Christ = the preaching of Christ.)"
3. "Illyricum bordered on Macedonia to the S. It is possible that Paul may literally have advanced to its frontiers during his preaching in Macedonia; but I think it more probable, that he uses it broadly as the ‘terminus ad quem,’ the next province to that in which he had preached."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Through mighty signs and wonders—that is, glorious miracles."
2. "This seems intended to explain the efficacy of the word preached, as well as the working of the miracles which attested it."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Fully preached [πεπληρωκεναι] . Lit., fulfilled Some explain, have given the Gospel its full development so that it has reached every quarter."

### John Calvin:
1. "From Jerusalem, I have propagated the gospel as far as Illyricum, and not by hastening to the end of my course by a straight way, but by going all around, and through the intervening countries." 
2. "He diffused, as it were by filling up, the preaching of the gospel; for others had before begun, but he spread it wider."
3. "The gospel is put for preaching the gospel. See Acts 12:25; Colossians 1:25. That the idea of teaching, or propagating, or preaching, belongs to it here, and in Colossians 1:25, is evident."

1. "Christ wrought through him, in word and work, in virtue of these powers; that proceeding from (miraculous) signs and wonders, and that which came from the Holy Spirit working through him on the minds of men."
