# Romans 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let each one of us seek to please his neighbor not just for self-gratification, but with the intention of benefiting and building up the other person. We are called to go beyond people-pleasing and consider the good of others, especially within the community of believers. Our aim should be to edify one another, helping each other grow in our faith and character. This requires accommodating ourselves to the needs and well-being of our brothers and sisters in Christ, always keeping in mind that our ultimate goal is their spiritual progress and development.
