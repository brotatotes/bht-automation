# Romans 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He had an ambition to preach where Christ was not yet named, making the first proclamation of the gospel in unheard-of places, despite the difficulties and dangers it posed. He did not want to build upon another man's foundation, as God's providence prevented this from happening, so that his enemies could not accuse him of being behind other apostles in the planting of churches. He did not shy away from the more challenging aspects of ministry.

2. "The Apostles then were the founders as it were of the Church; the pastors who succeeded them, had to strengthen and amplify the building raised up by them."

2. "He chose rather to go to such Heathen nations, as were wholly without any knowledge of him; who had only the dim light of nature to guide them; had had no promises nor prophecies of the Messiah, nor so much as any hints, at least very distant ones, concerning him; and where as yet the sound of the Gospel had not reached."
3. "He chose not to go where they had laid the foundation by preaching Christ and his Gospel, that he might not take another man's crown, or boast in another man's line, or of other men's labours."

2. "Lest I should only build upon another man's foundation - The providence of God seemed in a special manner, generally, to prevent this, though not entirely, lest the enemies of the apostle, who sought every occasion to set light by him, should have had room to say that he was behind other apostles, not being sufficient for planting of churches himself, but only for preaching where others had been already."
3. "Or that he declined the more difficult part of the ministry."
