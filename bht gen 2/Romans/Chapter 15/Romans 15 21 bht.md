# Romans 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy in Isaiah 52:15 assures that the Gentiles, previously unaware of the Messiah, will have the opportunity to spiritualize perceptive comprehension of the Savior. By faith, they will gain deep understanding of God's plan, the mysteries of His grace, and the significance of Christ's incarnation. This revelation extends beyond physical sight, allowing kings and nations to obtain spiritual insight into the truths revealed about the Messiah. Thus, through this prophetic vision, the Gentiles are granted the privilege of perceiving and grasping the profound revelations concerning the Savior and His redemptive mission through the eyes of faith.
