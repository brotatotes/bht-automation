# Romans 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul speaks of this fruit, he is referring to the contribution that the Gentile converts have generously given, which he promises to safely deliver to the recipients. It is like a sealed package, safeguarded and entrusted to him. Although Paul had plans to travel to Spain, it seems that these plans did not come to fruition. We can observe that sometimes our well-intentioned plans may be redirected by God's providence, but they are still valued by Him.
