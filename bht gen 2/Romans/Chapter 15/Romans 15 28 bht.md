# Romans 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul speaks of sealing the fruit to the Gentiles, he emphasizes his commitment to securely deliver the contributions made by believers, a result of his ministry and the love of the converts. Repeating his intention to go to Spain, Paul desires to expand his work. However, our plans are often subject to God's providence, and he may redirect our paths for his purposes, which are ultimately precious in his sight.
