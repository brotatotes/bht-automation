# Romans 15:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He did not seek his own pleasure, but rather dedicated himself to fulfilling God's purpose. He willingly endured suffering on behalf of others, bearing both their physical weaknesses and the verbal criticisms and insults they directed at him. In doing so, he fulfilled the prophecy in Psalm 69:9, where the Messiah is portrayed as taking on the reproaches of others.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The example of the Lord Jesus will furnish the most ready, certain, and happy illustration of the nature and extent of his duty."
2. "Christ...made it his great object to do the will of God, to finish the work which God had given him to do, and not to seek his own comfort and enjoyment."
3. "Christ was willing to suffer reproach and contempt in order to do good to others. He endured calumny and contempt all his life...We may see the kindness of the Lord Jesus in being willing thus to 'throw himself' between the sinner and God; to 'intercept,' as it were, our sins, and to bear the effects of them in his own person."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since it is not right that a servant should refuse what his lord has himself undertaken, it would be very strange in us to wish an exemption from the duty of bearing the infirmities of others, to which Christ, in whom we glory as our Lord and King, submitted himself."
2. "By these words it is intimated, that he burned with so much fervor for God’s glory that he was possessed by such a desire to promote his kingdom, that he forgot himself, and was, as it were, absorbed with this one thought, and that he so devoted himself to the Lord that he was grieved in his soul whenever he perceived his holy name exposed to the slandering of the ungodly."
3. "They ought to inconvenience themselves, and undergo toil, trouble, suffering, and reproaches, if necessary, in order to help and assist their fellow-Christians."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The example of Christ is for the believer the new law to be made real."
2. "The sufferings of Christ, according to the Psalm, were to fulfill the Father's purpose; that this purpose was for the salvation of men gives the passage here its most appropriate application."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pleased not himself."
2. "He quotes Psalms 69:9 (Messianic Psalm) and represents the Messiah as bearing the reproaches of others."

### John Gill:

2. "He became incarnate for us; he obeyed, suffered, and died for us; he came not to be ministered to, to be attended upon as an earthly prince, enjoying his own ease and pleasure, things grateful to nature, but to minister to others."
3. "He bore patiently, and reviled not again... the sins of his people, by which the name of God was blasphemed, his law trampled upon with contempt, and the perfections of his nature, as his justice and holiness, dishonoured."

### John Wesley:
1. But bore not only the infirmities, but reproaches, of his brethren; and so fulfilled that scripture. Psalm 69:9
