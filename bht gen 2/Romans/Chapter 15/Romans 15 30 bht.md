# Romans 15:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I beseech you, fellow believers, to join me in fervent prayers. Let us strive together in prayer, not only for ourselves but for all the brethren. By the love of the Spirit, which the blessed Holy Spirit infuses in the minds of God's children, let us make an intense effort in our prayers. Just as the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of the Spirit unite us, let us come together in prayer, for it is through the collective power of prayer that we can advance the kingdom of God and fulfill our purpose in Christ.
