# Romans 15:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Now the God of peace, the author of happiness and prosperity, the promoter of all peace and unity among His people, is with them. As the apostle prays for the presence of God to be with them, he also desires that they would have a deep understanding of the peace they have through the blood of Christ, which brings peace to their consciences. This peace goes beyond individual peace, but extends to the unity and harmony among the believers, allowing the peace of God to rule in their hearts as they live in love and unity with one another.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The peace here sought is to be taken in its widest sense: the peace of reconciliation to God, first, 'through the blood of the everlasting covenant'; then the peace which that reconciliation diffuses among all the partakers of it; more widely still, that peace which the children of God, in beautiful imitation of their Father in Heaven, are called and privileged to diffuse far and wide through this sin-distracted and divided world."
2. "How close the bond which the one spirit draws between ministers and people—how wide the separation produced by the other!"
3. "Though the debt we owe to those by whom we have been brought to Christ can never be discharged, we should feel it a privilege when we render them any lower benefit in return."


### Albert Barnes:
