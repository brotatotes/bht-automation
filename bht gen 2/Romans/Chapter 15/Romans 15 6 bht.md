# Romans 15:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to truly worship God with unity and harmony, it is crucial that believers, regardless of their background, come together with a shared mind and a united voice. This means believing and confessing our faith in unison, allowing our common belief in God to transcend any differences and divisions among us. By doing so, we can authentically glorify and honor God as one body.
