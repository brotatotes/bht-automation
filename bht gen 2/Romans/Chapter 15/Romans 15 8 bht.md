# Romans 15:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's ministry was not confined to a specific group but extended to all. By becoming a minister of the circumcision, he demonstrated his humility and fulfilled the promises made to the fathers. Through his ministry, he confirmed the truth of God and removed any distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles. Such was the significance of Christ's role in embracing humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He came to confirm the promises made to the fathers, but that the Gentiles glorified God on account of His mercy." 
2. "The Gentiles have no covenant promise to claim, they have nothing but the pure mercy of God in grafting them in to allege therefore the Jew has an advantage."
3. "The citations are from the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms. The first, originally spoken by David of his joy after his deliverances and triumphs, is prophetically said of Christ in His own Person."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nowâ€”"For" is the true reading: the apostle is merely assigning an additional motive to Christian forbearance." 
2. "I say that Jesus Christ wasâ€”"hath become" a minister of the circumcisionâ€”a remarkable expression, meaning 'the Father's Servant for the salvation of the circumcision (or, of Israel).'" 
3. "To cheer the Jewish believers, whom he might seem to have been disparaging, and to keep down Gentile pride, the apostle holds up Israel's salvation as the primary end of Christ's mission."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The force of the apostleâ€™s reasoning would often be more striking if he would retain the word 'Messiah,' and not regard the word 'Christ' as a mere surname."
2. "He remained among them in the exercise of his ministry, to show that God was 'true,' who had said that the Messiah should come to them."
3. "By thus admitting that the Messiah was the minister of the circumcision, the apostle conceded all that the Jew could ask, that he was to be peculiarly 'their' Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of the circumcision. Of those circumcised See on the election, ch. 11 7.

### John Calvin:
1. "He now shows that Christ has embraced us all, so that he leaves no difference between the Jews and the Gentiles."
2. "He had gathered them both from a miserable dispersion, and brought them, when gathered, into the Fatherâ€™s kingdom, that they might be one flock, in one sheepfold, under one shepherd."
3. "He expressly declares that the promises were made to the Fathers. Either then the benefits of Christ must be confined to temporal things, or the covenant made with Abraham must be extended beyond the things of this world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The connection of the former with Christ appears as the fulfillment of their theocratic claim, but that of the latter as the enjoyment of grace." 
2. "That Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision; i.e., those circumcised, as so frequently in Paulâ€™s writings. The emphasis rests on the word â€˜minister,â€™ which suggests the condescension of Christ, as an example of humility."
3. "For the sake of Godâ€™s truth that he might confirm the promises made unto the fathers. Thus Christâ€™s receiving the Jews was â€˜to the glory of God,â€™ showing His faithfulness, and this furnished a motive for fellowship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A minister of the circumcision."
2. "That he might confirm."
3. "The promises to the fathers."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision; he is rightly called a minister, for this was the end of his coming into the world, and the whole of his work in it was not to be ministered unto, but to minister to others."
2. "He is styled a minister of 'the circumcision', not literally considered, as if he administered circumcision to any, which he did not; he was indeed subject to it as a son of Abraham, as a Jew by birth, as under the law, and in order to fulfil all righteousness."
3. "Christ as a minister or preacher in the personal discharge of his prophetic office, was sent only to the Jews; among them he lived, and to them he only preached; nor did he allow his apostles to preach to any other till after his resurrection."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle here shows how Christ received us."
2. "Christ Jesus-Jesus is the name, Christ the surname."
3. "When the order is inverted, as here, the office of Christ is more solemnly considered."
