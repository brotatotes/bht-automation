# Romans 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Phebe, our sister in Christ, is entrusted with this letter as a commendation from one church to another. She is a servant, or deaconess, from the church in Cenchrea. In the early church, deaconesses were appointed to serve and minister to the needs of the community, particularly focusing on caring for and visiting the sick. While not engaged in public teaching, their role was vital in providing both temporal and spiritual support to those in need.
