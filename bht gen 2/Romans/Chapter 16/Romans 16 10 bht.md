# Romans 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Apelles was no ordinary believer but one who was approved in Christ. God himself recognized and commended him, reflecting his approval from eternity to him being adorned with God's grace and righteousness. Not only that, but Apelles was also esteemed by other believers, including the apostle, for his faithfulness and wholehearted devotion to Christ. His life served as a testament to the transformative power of being united with Christ and actively living out his calling.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Salute Apelles approved—"the approved" in Christ—or, as we should say, "that tried Christian"; a noble commendation."
2. "Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household—It would seem, from what is said of Narcissus in :-, that this Aristobulus himself had not been a Christian; but that the Christians of his household simply were meant; very possibly some of his slaves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Approved in Christ - An approved or tried Christian; approved and beloved by Christ.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Apelles. It occurs in Horace as the name of a Jew, under the form Apella."
2. "Them which are of Aristobulus' household. Possibly household slaves."
3. "They might have borne the name of Aristobulus even if they had passed into the service of another master."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Apelles. Not to be confounded with ‘Apollos.’ The name occurs in Horace (Sat. i. v. 100) as that of a Jew. He may have been a freedman, as some suppose, but the name was not uncommon. There are various conjectures as to the grouping of freedmen and slaves in these salutations."
2. "The approved in Christ; one whose Christian steadfastness had been tested."
3. "Of the household of Aristobulus; the Christians in that household (comp. Romans 16:11), probably slaves. There is no evidence that the person named was a believer; the phrase used has been thought by some to indicate that he was dead."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The approved (τον δοκιμον). The tried and true."
2. "Them which are of the household of Aristobulus (τους εκ των Αριστοβουλου). The younger Aristobulus was a grandson of Herod the Great. Lightfoot suggests that some of the servants in this household had become Christians, Aristobulus being dead."

### John Gill:
1. "He was one that was approved in Christ; approved of God in Christ, who approves of none but in Christ; not of any on account of their own commendations, or those of others."
2. "Moreover he was approved of by Christ, and that from eternity, as presented to him in the glass of his Father's purposes and decrees; and in time, as adorned with his own grace, and clothed with his justifying righteousness, and as faithfully serving him in his day and generation."
3. "This character shows, that he was not only approved of God and Christ, but of all good men, and particularly the apostle; and that on account of his being in Christ, united to him, and closely attached to his service and interest, and was an honor to it."
