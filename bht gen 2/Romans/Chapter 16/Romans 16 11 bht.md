# Romans 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individuals mentioned, like Herodion and Narcissus, were not esteemed for their social status or titles, but rather for their faith in Christ. It is remarkable how the grace of Christ extended even to those living in impure and wicked households. This reminds us that personal faith in Christ is what truly matters, not our social standing. Additionally, it is important to note that faith should not lead to negativity, but rather it should result in kindness and courtesy. We can learn from these examples that regardless of our background or circumstances, our faith in Christ can transform our lives.

2. "The more wonderful was the goodness of God, which penetrated into that impure house, abounding in all kinds of wickedness; not that Narcissus himself had been converted to Christ, but it was a great thing that a house, which was like hell, should be visited by the grace of Christ."
3. "And as they, who lived under a foul pander, the most voracious robber, and the most corrupt of men, worshipped Christ in purity, there is no reason that servants should wait for their masters, but every one ought to follow Christ for himself."
