# Romans 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tryphena and Tryphosa were two women who were commended for their impactful labor in the Lord. Their work was not in public ministry, but in serving the interests of their beloved Lord with their resources. They were known for their unwavering dedication and abundant contributions toward promoting the Gospel and advancing the kingdom of Christ. Their names, derived from the verb to live luxuriously, suggest their commitment to the Lord's work exceeded expectations. It is likely that they were sisters, and their efforts were highly regarded by the whole church.
