# Romans 16:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rufus, possibly the son of Simon of Cyrene, is mentioned in the Bible as one of the chosen believers in the Lord. It is believed that his mother was highly respected and revered by the apostle Paul as well. The mention of his mother and mine may simply indicate the tender care Rufus's mother had shown to him. These examples highlight the delicate relationships and love that can be found within the Christian community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Rufus may have been the son of Simon of Cyrene, mentioned Mark 15:21; but the name was very common."
2. "ἐκλεκτόν not to be softened, as De W., al., to merely ‘eximium,’ a sense unknown to our Apostle; elect, i.e. one of the elect of the Lord."
3. "καὶ ἐμοῦ the Apostle adds from affectionate regard towards the mother of Rufus: ‘my mother,’ in my reverence and affection for her. Jowett compares our Lord’s words to St. John, John 19:27."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the chosen" - meaning, not "who is one of the elect," as every believer is, but "the choice" or "precious one" in the Lord.
2. "We read in Mark 15:21 that Simon of Cyrene, who was compelled to bear our Lord's cross, was "the father of Alexander and Rufus." From this we naturally conclude that when Mark wrote his Gospel, Alexander and Rufus must have been well known as Christians among those by whom he expected his Gospel to be first read."
3. "In this case, supposing the elder of the two to have departed to be with Christ ere this letter was written, or to have been residing in some other place, and Rufus left alone with his mother, how instructive and beautiful is the testimony here borne to her!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An instance of the delicacy and tenderness of Paul; of his love for this disciple and his mother, as if he were of the same family."
2. "Religion binds the hearts of all who embrace it tenderly together. It makes them feel that they are one great family, united by tender ties, and joined by special attachments."
3. "See what the Lord Jesus declared in Matthew 12:47-50, and his tender address to John when he was on the cross; John 19:26-27."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Rufus. Meaning red. Possibly the son of Simon of Cyrene, Mark 14:21. Mark probably wrote in Rome. And mine. Delicately intimating her maternal care for him.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The chosen in the Lord; not merely ‘elect in Christ,’ but a chosen distinguished Christian man."
2. "His mother and mine. ‘His mother by nature, mine by maternal kindness’ (Webster and Wilkinson)."
3. "The peculiarly affectionate tone suggests some special kindness, in regard to which we can only conjecture."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rufus (Ρουφον). A very common slave name, possibly the Rufus of Mark 15:21. The word means 'red.'"
2. "The chosen (τον εκλεκτον). Not 'the elect,' but 'the select.'"
3. "And mine (κα εμου). Paul's appreciation of her maternal care once, not his real mother."

### John Gill:
1. "He is said to be one of the seventy disciples, and to be bishop of Thebes." 
2. "The apostle knew him, and that as one 'chosen in the Lord'; meaning either that he was a choice believer in Christ, an excellent Christian, one of the highest form."
3. "The apostle not only salutes this man, but his mother also, who doubtless was a believer in Christ, and highly respected by him: and his mother and mine."

### John Wesley:
1. "Salute Rufus — Perhaps the same that is mentioned, Mark 15:21."
2. "And his mother and mine — This expression may only denote the tender care which Rufus's mother had taken of him."
