# Romans 16:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul extends his personal greetings to a group of individuals, some of whom were closely associated with him and others who may have been lesser known. These individuals were connected through familial ties, proximity, or other circumstances. It is significant to note that Paul took the time to mention these individuals by name, providing encouragement and recognition, particularly to those who may have been socially marginalized or in need. This highlights the apostle's attentiveness to each person's worth and his desire for inclusive fellowship within the community of believers.
