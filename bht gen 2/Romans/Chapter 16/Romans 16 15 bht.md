# Romans 16:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Romans 16:15, the mention of Julia and Philologus, commonly used names for slaves, along with all the saints that are with them, suggests a numerous body of Christians, possibly another church in their house. Notably, the absence of St. Peter, if he was in Rome, is significant, as Paul would have addressed him by name. This raises the question of the Roman tradition's reliability in relation to the succession of their bishops. This discrepancy challenges the accuracy of their historical records.

### John Gill:
1. "This name Atteius assumed to himself, which Eratosthenes had done before him, because of his great learning." 
2. "Julia is a woman's name, and Roman, probably the wife of the former; one of Stephens's copies read, 'Junia.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Had St. Peter been then at Rome, St. Paul would doubtless have saluted him by name; since no one in this numerous catalogue was of an eminence comparable to his."
