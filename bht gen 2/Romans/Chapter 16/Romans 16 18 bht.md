# Romans 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These false prophets are not true followers of Christ, for they do not serve Him, but rather seek their own selfish desires and indulgence. They employ smooth and pleasing speech, filled with flattery and empty promises, in order to deceive those who are unsuspecting and innocent. They prioritize their own interests and the gratification of their appetites, using their eloquence to manipulate and draw others into their schemes. It is crucial for the simple and unwary to be aware of their tactics and not be swayed by their deceitful words.

2. "The authors of parties and divisions, in church and state, have this usually in view. It is for the indulgence of some earthly appetite; to obtain function or property; or to gratify the love of dominion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Belly. Compare Philippians 3:19. Good words [χρηστολογιας] . Only here in the New Testament. Lit., good speaking."
2. "The compounded adjective crhs tov is used rather in its secondary sense of mild, pleasant So Rev., smooth speech."
3. "Simple [ακακων] . Only here and Hebrews 7:26. Lit., not evil. Rev., innocent. Bengel says : 'An indifferent word. They are called so who are merely without positive wickedness, when they ought to abound also in prudence, and to guard against other men's wickedness.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He mentions an unvarying mark, by which false prophets are to be distinguished from the servants of Christ; for they have no care for the glory of Christ, but seek the benefit of their stomach."
2. "The preachers of the gospel have also their courtesy and their pleasing manner, but joined with honesty, so that they neither soothe men with vain praises, nor flatter their vices."
3. "Impostors allure men by flattery, and spare and indulge their vices, that they may keep them attached to themselves."

1. "By their smooth and fair speech, two compounds of λογος (speech), the first (from χρηστος and λογος) is very rare (here only in N.T.), the second is very common (ευ and λογος)."
2. "A blunt phrase like the same picture in Philippians 3:19 'whose god is the belly,' more truth than caricature in some cases."
3. "Of the innocent, old adjective (α privative and κακος), without evil or guile, in N.T. only here and Hebrews 7:26 (of Christ)."

### John Gill:
