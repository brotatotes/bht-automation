# Romans 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Timotheus, my fellow laborer and companion in the Gospel, is mentioned here by Paul after his own relatives. This is significant because Timothy had a great devotion to Paul, serving alongside him as a son with a father in their mission for Christ. Although Timothy had not been to Rome, he holds a special place in Paul's heart and is recognized in this postscript of greetings from his companions.
