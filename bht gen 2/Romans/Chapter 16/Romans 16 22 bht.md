# Romans 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tertius, the amanuensis who faithfully wrote down what the apostle Paul dictated, included his own salutation, possibly with Paul's instruction or consent. Another individual mentioned, Caius, is likely the same Corinthian mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:14. He is acknowledged as Paul's host and also associated with the entire church, suggesting that the church may have gathered in his house for meetings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is nothing strange... in this salutation being inserted in the first person."
2. "It would be natural enough that Tertius... should change the form into the first person."
3. "Thol. notices this irregularity as a corroboration of the genuineness of the chapter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I, Tertius, who wrote this—"the" epistle—as the apostle's amanuensis, or penman."
2. "So usually did the apostle dictate his epistles, that he calls the attention of the Galatians to the fact that to them he wrote with his own hand."
3. "But this Tertius would have the Romans to know that, far from being a mere scribe, his heart went out to them in Christian affection; and the apostle, by giving his salutation a place here, would show what sort of assistants he employed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tertius, who thus wrote it, joins with the apostle in affectionate salutations to the brethren at Rome."
2. "To the Epistle, Paul signed his own name, and added a salutation in his own hand-writing."
3. "In the Lord - As Christian brethren."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul's exquisite courtesy in leaving Tertius to salute in his own name."
2. "To dictate to him his own salutation would be to treat him as a machine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul seems to have dictated most of his letters."
2. "It was natural that the amanuensis, as a Christian brother, would send his salutation in the first person."
3. "In the Lord. It is more natural to connect this with ‘salute’."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  I Tertius  (εγω Τερτιος). The amanuensis to whom Paul dictated the letter. See 2 Thessalonians 3:17; 1 Corinthians 16:21; Colossians 4:18. 

### John Gill:
1. "Whosoever he was, it is certain he was an amanuensis of the apostle, who wrote this letter, either from the apostle's notes, or from his mouth."
2. "Some connect this phrase, 'in the Lord', with the other, 'wrote this epistle', and make the sense to be that he wrote this epistle for the Lord's sake, for his honour and glory."
3. "It is better connected with the word 'salute', and the sense is, that his salutation was not a mere form, nor only concerned their temporal good, but their spiritual welfare; that he wished them well in the Lord, that they might have much communion with him, and larger measures of grace from him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tertius, who wrote what the apostle dictated, inserted this, either by St. Paul's exhortation or ready permission."
2. "Caius - the Corinthian, 1 Corinthians 1:14."
3. "My host, and of the whole church - who probably met for some time in his house."
