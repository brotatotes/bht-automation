# Romans 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Gaius, the generous host who warmly welcomed and provided lodging for Paul, extends his greetings not only to the Corinthians but to all the believers. This Gaius, who demonstrated remarkable Christian hospitality, was not only the apostle's host but was esteemed by all the saints. Additionally, the chamberlain of the city of Corinth, Erastus, sends his greetings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Gaius is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:14, as having been baptized by Paul."
2. "The host of the whole church probably implies that the assemblies of the church were held in his house: or perhaps, that his hospitality to Christians was universal."
3. "The benediction repeated; see above on Romans 16:20. The omission (see var. read.) has perhaps been by the caprice of the copyists."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His Christian hospitality appears to have been something uncommon."
2. "Erastus the chamberlain—'treasurer' of the city—doubtless of Corinth."
3. "Nothing more is known of this Quartus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Gaius mine host - Who has received me into his house, and shown me hospitality."
2. "He was probably a wealthy citizen of Corinth, who freely opened his house to entertain Christians, and for the purpose of religious worship."
3. "The chamberlain - A chamberlain is properly an officer who has charge of a chamber, or of chambers. In this place it means one who presided over the pecuniary affairs of the 'city,' and should have been translated 'the treasurer; the city treasurer;'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Gaius." Possibly the same in all three references (Acts 19:29; Acts 20:4; 1 Corinthians 1:14).
2. "Chamberlain [οικονομος]." The word appears in the New Testament in two senses: 1. The slave who was employed to give the other slaves their rations. 2. The land-steward, as Luke 16:1.
3. "Probably here the administrator of the city lands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Gains mine host. Paul was lodging with this man, as he had previously done with Aquila and Justus." 
2. "The same person is probably meant in the first instance, probably in the last, and possibly in all three." 
3. "Erastus the treasurer (lit., ‘steward’) of the city; of Corinth. This may be the person mentioned in Acts 19:22; 2 Timothy 4:20; but in that case he had relinquished his office before the time."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Γαιος ο ξενος μου."
2. "This Gaius was plainly a man of some means as he was the host of all the church."
3. "Erastus (2 Timothy 4:20) was 'the treasurer of the city' (ο οικονομος της πολεως), one of the outstanding men of Corinth, the 'steward' (house-manager) or city manager."

### John Gill:
1. "Gaius...was not only the apostle's host that entertained him in a kind and liberal manner, but of all the saints:and of the whole church, saluteth you..."

### John Wesley:
1. The chamberlain of the city — Of Corinth.
