# Romans 16:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle, filled with immense love for this church, finds it difficult to bid them farewell, hence the repetition of his valediction. This repetition could be due to the first version being written by an assistant, while the second one is penned by Paul himself, as was his custom. The subsequent doxology ascribes glory to Christ, recognizing him as God and the all-wise deity.
