# Romans 16:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To the one who has the power to strengthen believers, may it be known that the closing of this epistle mirrors its beginning as it emphasizes the power of God, the gospel, Jesus Christ, the scriptures, and the obedience of faith for all nations. This power of God is at work to establish both Jews and Gentiles, bringing them together as one body. This divine power is revealed through the mystery of the calling of the Gentiles, which, though foretold in the prophets, was even hidden from many believers at the time.

1. "Who is able to stablish you." - This description of God is appropriate in this Epistle.
