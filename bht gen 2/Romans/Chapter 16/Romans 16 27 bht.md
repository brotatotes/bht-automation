# Romans 16:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To the only wise God, whose manifold wisdom is known in the church through the gospel, be glory through Christ Jesus for ever.

We are called to give glory to the wise God, who is able to accomplish His plans and purposes, and who deserves all praise and honor for eternity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The quantity of intervening matter, especially the datives μόνῳ σοφῷ θεῷ, prevent it from being referred (as Œc [128], Theophyl.) to στηρίξαι." 
2. "It must then be rendered to the only wise God through Jesus Christ, i.e. Him who is revealed to us by Christ as such."
3. "On the construction of ᾧ see above. It cannot without great harshness be referred to Christ, seeing that the words μόνῳ σοφῷ θεῷ resume the chief subject of the sentence, and to them the relative must apply."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To God, be the glory for ever. Amen." - This is an ascription of glory to the power that could do all this.
2. "In every age of the Church there have been real Christians whose excessive study of the serpent's wisdom has so sadly trenched upon their guileless simplicity." - The rarity of the combination of the wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove is equalled by its vast importance.
3. "Christians should cheer their own and each other's hearts, amidst the toils and trials of their protracted warfare, with the assurance that it will have a speedy and glorious end." - Christians should accustom themselves to regard all opposition to the progress and prosperity of Christ's cause as just "Satan" in conflict and never allow themselves to doubt that "the God of peace" will give them victory.

### Albert Barnes:

3. "The 'obligation' on all who are benefitted by it is to give him praise."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The difficult question still remains; does ‘to whom’ refer to ‘the only wise God,’ or to ‘Jesus Christ?’"
2. "The Apostle, who had dived so deeply into the riches of the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, might well close such an Epistle by declaring that God was revealed as absolutely wise through Jesus Christ, and ascribe to Him, as such, the glory forever."
3. "They only say ‘Amen’ who labor for and await the final triumph of Him whose plan of saving grace is so fully set forth in this great Epistle."
