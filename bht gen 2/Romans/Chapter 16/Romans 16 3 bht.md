# Romans 16:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Prisca, also known as Priscilla, and Aquila were prominent and faithful Christians, as mentioned by the apostle in 2 Timothy. Prisca's name being mentioned before her husband's is a matter of the order of the names rather than a deliberate indication of prominence. They were skilled tent makers and worked together in their trade. They had journeyed from Rome to Corinth, then Ephesus, and back to Rome before returning to Ephesus. It is worth noting that they were with the apostle when he wrote this epistle and were referred to as his helpers in Christ Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The true reading here is 'Prisca' (as in :-), a contracted form of Priscilla, as 'Silas' of 'Silvanus.'" 
2. "The wife is here named before the husband (as in Acts 18:18; Romans 16:26, according to the true reading; also in 2 Timothy 4:19), probably as being the more prominent and helpful to the Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Greet Priscilla and Aquila - Salute; implying the apostle’s kind remembrance of them, and his wishes for their welfare."
2. "They had the advantage of his private instruction."
3. "They are mentioned as having been with Paul when he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is argued by some that Aquila and Priscilla must have been at Ephesus at this time, since they were there when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 16:19, and again when he wrote 2 Timothy 4:19." 
2. "As Rome was their headquarters, and they had been driven thence by an imperial edict (Acts 18:2), it is natural enough that they should have returned thither as soon as it was convenient and safe to do so."
3. "Notice that the name of Priscilla precedes that of her husband. So Acts 18:2. Probably she was the more prominent of the two in christian activity."

### John Calvin:
1. "The testimonies which he brings here in favor of some individuals, were partly intended for this end, that by honoring those who were faithful and worthy, faithfulness itself might be honored..."
2. "It is a singular honor which he ascribes here to Prisca and Aquila, especially with regard to a woman. The modesty of the holy man does on this account more clearly shine forth; for he disdained not to have a woman as his associate in the work of the Lord; nor was he ashamed to confess this."
3. "Whether Aquila was a laymen or not, the Apostle connects his wife with him in the work of cooperation with him in his ministerial work; and we see by Acts 18:26, that they both taught Apollos."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The wife seems to have been the more prominent and active Christian; her name comes first in Acts 18:2, as well as here. Then as now, capacity and fidelity formed the standard."
2. "Their stay at Ephesus has been made the basis of the theory that this chapter (or Epistle) was originally addressed to that city; but persons of their trade would be apt to travel extensively."
