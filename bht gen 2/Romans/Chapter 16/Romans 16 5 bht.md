# Romans 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christians did not have designated church buildings, often relying on the hospitality of prominent believers who had larger homes. In Rome, there was likely only one house used for congregational gatherings. Epaenetus, who is affectionately mentioned by the apostle Paul, may have been one of the chief or first converts in the region of Achaia. He is regarded as a significant figure, either for his gifts and grace or for being the first to embrace Christianity in those parts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Epænetus is not elsewhere named."
2. "ἀπαρχή, the same metaphor being in the Apostle’s mind as in ch. Romans 15:16, the first believer."
3. "εἰς χρ., elliptical: the full construction would be τῆς προσφορᾶς εἰς χρ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From his occupation as tent-maker, he had probably better accommodations for the meetings of the church than most other Christians."
2. "Probably this devoted couple had written to the apostle such an account of the stated meetings at their house, as made him feel at home with them, and include them in this salutation, which doubtless would be read at their meetings with peculiar interest."
3. "Epænetus, as the first believer in that region called Proconsular Asia, was dear to the apostle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The church that is in their house - Aquila and Priscilla are mentioned Acts 18:26 as having received 'Apollos' into their family, to instruct him more perfectly...Christians had no houses erected for public worship, and were therefore compelled to meet in their private dwellings."
2. "Who is the first-fruits - One who first embraced Christianity under my preaching in Achaia. The 'first-fruits' were a small part of the harvest, which was first gathered and offered to the Lord...Paul calls Epenetus the first-fruits of the great spiritual harvest which had been gathered in Achaia."
3. "Achaia - See the note at Romans 15:26. This name and those which follow are chiefly 'Greek,' but we know little of the persons mentioned, except what is here recorded."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bishop Lightfoot says there is no clear example of a separate building set apart for Christian worship within the limits of the Roman Empire before the third century."
2. "The Christian congregations were, therefore, dependent upon the hospitality of prominent church members who furnished their own houses for this purpose."
3. "This led to the use of the catacombs, or of buildings erected over them for this purpose."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever then is called first in time to the faith, Paul allows him the prerogative of honor: yet he retains this eminence only when the end corresponds with the beginning."
2. "And doubtless it is no common honor when God chooses some for first-fruits: and there is in addition a greater and an ampler trial of faith, through a longer space of time, provided they who have first begun are not wearied in their course."
3. "Epaenetus, who is here called the first-fruit of Achaia, may have been off the family of Stephanas, who is said to have been the first-fruit in 1 Corinthians 16:15. But the majority of copies has Asia, Ασίας, here, instead of Achaia, Αχαίας. By Asia is often meant Asia Minor, and so here, no doubt, if it be the right reading."

### John Wesley:
1. "Where any Christian had a large house, there they all assembled together though as yet the Christians at Rome had neither bishops nor deacons. So far were they from any shadow of papal power."
2. "There does not appear to have been then in the whole city any more than one of these domestic churches."
3. "The first convert in the proconsular Asia."
