# Romans 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary, whose name is derived from the Hebrew Miriam, remains somewhat of a mystery as to her Jewish background and identity. However, what is clear is that she was known for her tireless efforts in supporting and providing for Paul and his companions in various places. Although some scholars have cast doubt on the authenticity of these epistles, it is undeniable that Mary's selfless service and generosity were highly regarded and deserving of recognition.
