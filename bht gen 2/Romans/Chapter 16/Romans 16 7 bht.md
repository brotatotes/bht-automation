Andronicus and Junia were not only fellow Jews, but they were also highly esteemed among the apostles.

Their faithfulness and reputation among the apostles serve as a testament to their commitment to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is uncertain also whether συγγενεῖς means fellow-countrymen, or relations."
2. "Two renderings are given: (1) 'of note among the Apostles,' so that they themselves are counted among the Apostles..."
3. "But, as Thol. remarks, had this latter been the meaning, we should have expected some expression like διὰ πασῶν τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And of course, if 'Junia' is to be taken for a woman, this latter must be the meaning."
2. "The apostle writes as if he envied them this priority in the faith."
3. "Very possibly they may have been among the first-fruits of Peter's labors, gained to Christ either on the day of Pentecost or on some of the succeeding days."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As many others who were Jews are mentioned here without this appellation, and as he especially designates these persons, and Herodian Romans 16:11, it seems probable that they were remote relatives of the apostle."
2. "My fellow-prisoners - Paul was often in prison; and it is probable that on some of those occasions they had been confined with him; compare 2 Corinthians 11:23, 'In prisons more frequent.'"
3. "Who were in Christ ... - Who were 'converted' before I was. The meaning is clear. The expression, 'in Christ,' means to be united to him, to be interested in his religion, to be Christians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Andronicus and Junia. The latter name may be either masculine or feminine. If the latter, the person was probably the wife of Andronicus." 
2. "Kinsmen [συγγενεις]. The primary meaning is related by blood; but it is used in the wider sense of fellow-countrymen."
3. "Of note [επισημοι]. A good rendering etymologically, the word meaning, literally, bearing a mark [σημα, νοτα]."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is more weight in the second eulogy, when he calls them his fellow-prisoners; for among the honors belonging to the warfare of Christ, bonds are not to be counted the least."
2. "He then, in a general way, calls those in this place Apostles, who planted Churches by carrying here and there the doctrine of salvation."
3. "But as they had embraced the gospel by faith before Paul, he hesitates not to set them on this account before himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is impossible to decide which form of the latter name is correct; if the feminine form (‘Junia’) be accepted, then the wife or sister of Andronicus is meant."
2. "My kinsman. This may mean ‘fellow-countrymen,’ here and in Romans 16:11; Romans 16:21; but all the persons thus termed may have been actual ‘kinsmen.’ It cannot be affirmed that they were not."
3. "Who are of note among the Apostles; honorably known by the Apostles. The phrase does not imply that they were Apostles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fellow prisoners (συναιχμαλωτυς). Late word and rare (in Lucian). One of Paul's frequent compounds with συν. Literally, fellow captives in war. Perhaps they had shared one of Paul's numerous imprisonments."
2. "Of note (επισημο). Stamped, marked (επ σημα). Old word, only here and Matthew 27:16 (bad sense) in N.T."
3. "Who have been in Christ before me (ο κα προ εμου γεγοναν εν Χριστω). Andronicus and Junias were converted before Paul was. The perfect tense notes that they are still in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "These were their Gentile names, the one Greek, the other Latin; but both were Jews.".
2. "This is a greater character of them, and a greater honour to them, than to be called his kinsmen after the flesh:who are of note among the apostles".
3. "It shows also, that they were persevering Christians, were pillars in the house of God, and never went out; and on account of their constancy and long standing, were worthy of respect.".

### John Wesley:
1. Who are of note among the apostles — They seem to have been some of the most early converts.Fellowprisoners — For the gospel's sake.
