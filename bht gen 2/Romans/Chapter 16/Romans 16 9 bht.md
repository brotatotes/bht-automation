# Romans 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Urbanus, or urbane as mentioned in the commentaries, is actually the name Urbanus, signifying someone who is city-bred. On the other hand, Stachys is a rare Greek name associated with the imperial household, and it means an ear of corn. The phrase our helper in the text refers not only to Paul but also to the Roman Christians. While it is unclear whether Urbanus was one of the seventy disciples or a bishop in Macedonia, he was undoubtedly highly regarded by the apostle as a fellow laborer in Christ.
