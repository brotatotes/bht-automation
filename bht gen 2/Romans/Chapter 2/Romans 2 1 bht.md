# Romans 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without excuse, you who pass judgment on others, for you condemn yourselves by doing the same things. Indeed, knowledge without action only increases guilt, and those who are quick to judge and condemn others should take heed, for they too are guilty of the same offenses. Instead of focusing on reproving and censuring others, it is better to examine one's own actions and refrain from being a hypocritical critic.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The address passes gradually to the Jews."
2. "This is evident by comparing τὰ γὰρ αὐτὰ πράσσεις ὁ κρίνων with Romans 2:21-23, where the same charge is implied in a direct address to the Jew."
3. "ἐν ᾧ … For wherein (not ‘in that’), as E. V. i.e. ‘in the matter in which.’"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since you Jews condemn the Gentiles for their sins, on the ground that they have the means of knowing their duty, therefore, you who are far more favored than they, are entirely without an excuse for the same things."
2. "As the Gentiles whom they judged were condemned, and were without excuse in their sins, so were the Jews who condemned them without excuse on the same principle; and in a still greater degree."
3. "It is clearly implied here, that they [the Jews] were guilty of offenses similar to those practiced by the Gentiles... If such was the character of the Jewish nation in general, there is no improbability in supposing that they practiced most of the crimes specified."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. O man. General, but still with a general and slightly reproachful reference to the Jew. Judgest [κρινων] . With the sense of condemning.

### John Calvin:
1. "Though thou consented not to the vices of others... yet as thou art not free from them, if thou really examinest thyself, thou canst not bring forward any defense."
2. "Thou art doubly deserving of condemnation; for thou art guilty of the same vices which thou blamest and reprovest in others."
3. "They then condemned themselves on this account, — because, in reproving a thief, or an adulterer, or a slanderer, they did not merely condemn the persons, but those very vices which adhered to themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Without excuse; as in chap. Romans 1:20."
2. "The judgment pronounced upon others applies to the man’s own conduct. There is a ‘reproachful emphasis’ upon ‘thou that judgest.’"
3. "The censorious spirit is of the same sinful character as vice; the most moral men have sinful natures, and are kept from open transgression only by the grace of God, or by a pride which is no less sinful than vice."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Without excuse."
2. "Thou condemnest thyself."
3. "The critic practises the same things that he condemns."

### John Gill:
1. "And therefore must be inexcusable, because they knew better, and would be thought to have been so; wherefore such could never be justified before God by their works, but might be justly condemned by him, nor shall they escape his righteous judgment."
2. "Others think the Jews are meant, who despised and condemned the Gentiles, and thought themselves to be righteous persons, and justified in the sight of God; and who, though they were secretly guilty of many abominable iniquities, yet were very severe upon the sins of others, and therefore inexcusable."
3. "Rather the words respect every man, of whatsoever nation, office, or place; and may be particularly applied to hypocrites, and seem designed to correct censoriousness, and hasty judging, and to throw confusion on such who value themselves on being the censurers and reprovers of others."

### John Wesley:
1. "Seeing knowledge without practice only increases guilt."
2. "Whosoever thou art that judgest, censurest, condemnest."
3. "Thou condemnest thyself; for thou doest the same things."
