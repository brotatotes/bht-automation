# Romans 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God will judge both Jews and Gentiles impartially, as there is no partiality in His judgment. He will judge every person according to their character, deeds, and the opportunities they have been given. This means that someone who has had more advantages or privileges will also have greater responsibility. In His judgment, God will not be swayed by personal biases or favoritism. His judgments are fair and just, based on the true nature and worth of each individual.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jew has had great advantages, he shall be justly judged for his use of them, not treated as a favorite of Heaven."
2. "A comparison between him and the Gentile to show how fairly he will be, for those greater advantages, regarded as πρῶτος in responsibility."
3. "We gradually pass to the direct comparison between him and the Gentile, and consideration of his state."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For God would deal with both on the principles of justice."
2. "He will judge righteous judgment; he will judge people as they ought to be judged; according to their character and deserts; and not contrary to their character, or by partiality."
3. "It may be added that this passage contains a most alarming truth for guilty people. It is that God will not be influenced by partiality, but will treat them just as they deserve."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Respect of persons [προσωπολημψια] Only once outside of Paul 's writings, James 2:1, on which see note.

### John Calvin:
1. "He now teaches us, that this difference is no reason why both should not be involved in the same guilt."
2. "But if any hence objects and says, 'That then there is no such thing as the gratuitous election of God;' it may be answered, That there is a twofold acceptation of men before God..."
3. "The full phrase isπρόσωπον λαμβάνω, as found in Luke 20:21, and Galatians 2:6. It is a phrase peculiar to the Hebrew language, and means literally, to lift up or regard faces, that is, persons, נשא פנים."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For there is no respect, etc. This is not a mere repetition of Romans 2:6; but shows the reason why 'the Jew first, and also of the Greek.' Since God has no respect of persons, He must judge the Jew first."
2. "The phrase 'respect of persons' is represented in the original by one word. The conception is from the Hebrew (to lift up, or accept, the face), and in the New Testament is always used in a bad sense, of unjust partiality."
3. "The verse, therefore, constitutes a proper transition to the next paragraph (Romans 2:12-16), which sets forth that God’s judgment is according to light."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Milligan considers this word [respect of persons] the earliest definitely known Christian words, not in LXX or non-Christian writings."
2. "See on Acts 10:34 for the formation in imitation of the Hebrew to take note of the face (προσωπον, λαμβανω), to judge by the face or appearance."

### John Gill:
1. "It will not come into consideration, at the day of judgment, of what nation men are; or from what parents they are descended; nor of what age and sex persons be; nor in what state and condition they have lived in this world."
2. "This passage respects matters of strict justice, and is a forensic expression relating to courts of judicature, where persons presiding are to have no regard to the faces of men, but do that which is strictly just between man and man."
3. "Though God, as a Judge, respects no man's person; yet in matters of grace he distinguishes one person from another, as it is plain he does by the bounties of his Providence."

### John Wesley:
1. "He will reward every one according to his works."
2. "But this is well consistent with his distributing advantages and opportunities of improvement, according to his own good pleasure."
