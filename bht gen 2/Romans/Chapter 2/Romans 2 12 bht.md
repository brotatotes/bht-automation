# Romans 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The condemnation of those who have sinned without the law is a result of the just judgment of God. Their lack of the Mosaic law does not excuse them from condemnation, as God will judge them according to the light they have. The presence or absence of the law does not determine their guilt, but rather their actions and conscience bear witness to their transgressions. This highlights God's impartiality, for He will judge all individuals based on their knowledge and deeds, regardless of whether they have the written law or not.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For as many as have sinned without (the) law (of Moses): shall also perish without (the) law (of Moses): i.e. it shall not appear against them in judgment." 
2. "·ºÄœÄŒøŒªŒø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ, the result of the judgment on them, rather than Œ∫œÅŒπŒ∏ŒÆœÉŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ, its process, because the absence of the law would thus seem as if it were the rule by which they are to be judged, whereas it is only an accident of that judgment, which depends on other considerations."
3. "ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ, throughout, signifies the law of Moses, even though anarthrous, in every place, except where the absence of the article corresponds to a logical indefiniteness... And I hope to shew that it is never thus anarthrously used as = ·ΩÅ ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ, except where usage will account for such omission of the article."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For as many as have sinned... as many are found in sin" 
2. "without law... exempt from the charge of rejecting or disregarding it" 
3. "as many as have sinned in the law... tried and condemned by the higher standard of that written Revelation"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The strain of the argument, as well as this express declaration, shows that they who had sinned - and in the first chapter he had proved that all the pagan were sinners - would be punished."
2. "They shall not be tried and condemned by the revelation which the Jews had. They shall be condemned only according to the knowledge and the Law which they actually possess."
3. "If it was admitted that the pagan would perish; and if God was to judge the Jews by an unerring rule, that is, according to their privileges and light; then it would follow that they would also be condemned, and their own minds would come at once to the conclusion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Nomov law is used both with and without the article for the Mosaic law."
2. "Law considered as a principle, exemplified no doubt chiefly and signally in the Mosaic law, but very much wider than this in its application."
3. "There is no doubt that the simple krinw is used in the New Testament in the sense of condemning."

### John Calvin:
1. "the knowledge of a written law was not necessary for the just condemnation of a sinner"
2. "Whosoever have sinned under the law, etc. As the Gentiles, being led by the errors of their own reason, go headlong into ruin, so the Jews possess a law by which they are condemned"
3. "A worse condition then awaits the Jewish sinners, since their condemnation is already pronounced in their own law"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since God is no respecter of persons it follows that He will judge according to light." 
2. "‚ÄòWithout law‚Äô is a single adverb in the original, and refers to the absence of the Mosaic law as a standard of morals."
3. "The verse teaches that the immoral heathen will not be punished, however, with the rigor of the written law, as in the case of disobedient Jews and unfaithful Christians, but according to their light."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The heathen who sin are lost, because they do not keep the law which they have, not because they do not have the Mosaic law or Christianity."
2. "In the sphere of the Mosaic law."
3. "The Jew has to stand or fall by the Mosaic law."

### John Gill:
1. "This is an instance of the strict justice of God, and proves him to be no respecter of persons."
2. "Their not having the written law of Moses will be no plea in their favour, or be a reason why they should not be condemned; their persons will not be regarded as with or without the law, but their sins committed by them, to which facts their consciences will bear witness."
3. "Their having this law will be no bar against their condemnation, but rather an aggravation of it; their hearing of it will be no plea in their favour; nor their doing of it neither, unless they could have done it to perfection; for perfect obedience it requires, as a justifying righteousness, otherwise it curses, condemns, and adjudges to death."

### John Wesley:
1. "He speaks as of the time past, for all time will be past at the day of judgment."
2. "Without having any written law."
3. "The word also shows the agreement of the manner of sinning, with the manner of suffering."
