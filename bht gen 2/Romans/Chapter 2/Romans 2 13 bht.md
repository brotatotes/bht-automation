# Romans 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hearing the law alone does not make someone righteous in God's sight, but it is the practice of the law that brings justification. The focus is not just on hearing, but on doing. This applies not only to the Jews who heard the law regularly, but also to the Gentiles who may not have had the written law. The message is clear: it is not the mere possession of the law, but the obedience to it that leads to justification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is to explain to the Jew the fact, that not his mere hearing of the law read in the synagogue will justify him before God, but the doing of the law."
2. "The correct English for οἱ ἀκροαταὶ νόμου is 'hearers of the law,' and for οἱ ποιηταὶ νόμου, 'doers of the law.'"
3. "His dictum, that such an expression as οἱ ἀκροαταὶ νόμου is inadmissible, will hardly in our day be considered as deciding the matter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the condemnation of as many of them as are found sinners at the last involves no difficulty but even as respects the heathen, who are strangers to the law in its positive and written form" 
2. "since they show how deeply it is engraven on their moral nature, which witnesses within them for righteousness and against iniquity" 
3. "their condemnation also for all the sin in which they live and die will carry its dreadful echo in their own breasts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Simply hearing the Law is not meeting all its requirements, and making people holy."
2. "The meaning is, that it is a maxim or principle of the Law of God, that if a creature will keep it, and obey it entirely, he shall not be condemned, but shall be approved and live forever."
3. "This passage is designed, doubtless, to meet a very common and pernicious sentiment of the Jewish teachers, that all who became hearers and listeners to the Law would be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hearers [ακροαται]...those whose business is hearing."
2. "Like the Jews, who heard it regularly in the synagogues."
3. "It brings out, better than the participle oiJ ajkouontev those that hear, the characteristic feature."

### John Calvin:
1. "That if righteousness be sought from the law, the law must be fulfilled; for the righteousness of the law consists in the perfection of works."
2. "They who pervert this passage for the purpose of building up justification by works, deserve most fully to be laughed at even by children."
3. "We can prove from this passage that no one is justified by works; for if they alone are justified by the law who fulfill the law, it follows that no one is justified; for no one can be found who can boast of having fulfilled the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jewish mistake was that the possession of the law of itself gave them an advantage in the judgment."
2. "The hearers of the law. The best authorities omit the article before ‘law’ in both clauses; but the phrases are equivalent to ‘law-hearers’ and ‘law-doers,’ evidently referring here to the Mosaic law."
3. "But the doers, etc. This form of the general principle of Romans 2:6 opposes the Jewish error, and it is not at all in opposition to the principle of justification by faith."

2. "Not these, but the doers of the law, shall be justified."
3. "The best of men, even believers in Christ, are not without sin in themselves; and when any of the saints are said to be perfect, it must be understood in a comparative sense, or as they are considered in Christ."
