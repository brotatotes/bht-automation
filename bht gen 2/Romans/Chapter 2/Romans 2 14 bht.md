# Romans 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the idea that even though the Gentiles do not have the written law, they still have a law within themselves. This law of nature serves as a substitute for the Mosaic law that the Jews adhere to. Their moral nature and conscience guide them in doing what is right, making them a law to themselves. The Gentiles' ability to do right without an outward rule demonstrates that they possess some knowledge of God and His principles. This understanding is crucial in convincing both the Gentiles and the Jews of their accountability to a higher moral authority.
