# Romans 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By their conduct, individuals demonstrate the works of the law. Their actions serve as an example, showing that the commandments are written on their hearts. Their conscience bears witness to the goodness or wrongness of their actions, affirming them as moral or condemnable. Through their thoughts and judgments, they engage in internal dialogue, both accusing and excusing themselves. This inward reflection reflects their innate knowledge of the law, as their conscience acts as a powerful witness to their actions.
