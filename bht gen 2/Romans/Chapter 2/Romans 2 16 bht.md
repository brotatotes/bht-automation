# Romans 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In that future day, the hidden thoughts and motives of humanity will be brought into the light, just as the law written in people's hearts becomes evident even in the present. The true quality of actions often lies in their secret circumstances, unknown to the actors themselves. This highlights the fact that the gospel is not just a message of grace and salvation, but also a law that reveals the standard by which people will be judged.
