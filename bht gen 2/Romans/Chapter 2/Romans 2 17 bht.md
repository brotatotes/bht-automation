# Romans 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By acknowledging their Jewish identity, they claimed all the privileges and honors associated with it. However, the apostle Paul cautions that being called a Jew or upholding the law does not suffice for righteousness before God. Instead, the Jews were placing undue confidence in their external knowledge, national status, and exclusive connection with God. They boasted about their relationship to God while neglecting the true heart transformation and humility that comes with genuine faith. Paul highlights the danger of relying on religious labels and external practices without a sincere and repentant heart.

### Henry Alford:

2. "No stress on ἐπ -, art named, 'denominated,' 'hast the name put on thee."
3. "The τῷ of the rec. has been inserted in the later MSS. before νόμῳ, because it here clearly applied to the 'law of Moses,' and the absence of the article gave offence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17-24. Behold—"But if"
	is, beyond doubt, the true reading here. (It differs but in a single
	letter from the received reading, and the sense is the same).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He admits all their claims to pre-eminence in privileges, and then with great faithfulness proceeds to show how, if abused, these might deepen their final destruction."
2. "The name 'Jew' came thus to denote all the peculiarities and special favors of their religion."
3. "This passage shows us that it is much more common to boast of privileges than to be thankful for them, and that it is no evidence of piety for a man to boast of his knowledge of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou art called, bringing out the value which attached to the name Jew, the theocratic title of honor."

### John Calvin:
1. "He allows them all those privileges, by which they were beyond measure transported and inflated: and then he shows how insufficient they were for the attainment of true glory, yea, how they turned to their reproach."
2. "By the name of Jews they avowed themselves to be the heirs of the covenant which the Lord had made with Abraham and his seed."
3. "Theygloried in God, not as the Lord commands by his Prophet, — to humble ourselves, and to seek our glory in him alone, but being without any knowledge of God’s goodness, they made him, of whom they were inwardly destitute, peculiarly their own, and assumed to be his people, for the purpose of vain ostentation before men. This, then, was not the glorying of the heart, but the boasting of the tongue."
