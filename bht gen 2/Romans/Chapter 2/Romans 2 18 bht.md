# Romans 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage highlights the privileged position of the Jews in knowing and understanding the will of God revealed in the law. However, simply possessing this knowledge is not enough. The true value lies in applying and living according to this knowledge. The Jews had the ability to discern and approve of what is excellent and superior, which they obtained through their instruction in the law. It is important to note that this knowledge and approval stems from being instructed out of the law, and not from the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "proveth (in the sense of sifting and coming to a conclusion on) things which differ, ἐναντία ἀλλήλοις, δικαιοσύνην κ. ἀδικίαν, κ. τ.λ." 
2. "being (habitually, not in youth only, force of pres.) instructed (not merely catechetically but didactically, in the synagogues, &c.) out of the law (τοῦ νόμου, though after a preposition because the law is distributed it is the book of the law, the law itself, out of which the κατήχησις takes place)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 18. approvest the things that are
	excellent—"triest the things that differ" (Margin).
	Both senses are good, and indeed the former is but the result of the
	latter action. (See on  :-).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And knowest his will - The will or commands of God. This knowledge they obtained from the Scriptures; and of course in this they were distinguished from other nations."
2. "The Jew would pride himself on the fact that he had been taught by the Law to make these distinctions, while all the pagan world had been left in ignorance of them. This was one of the advantages on which he valued himself and his religion."
3. "Being instructed ... - That is, in regard to the one God, his will, and the distinguishing rites of his worship."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou dost test with nice discrimination questions of casuistry."
2. "This formal instruction is the basis of the critical discrimination."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus the Jews were so learned in the law that they could pass judgment on the conduct of others, but were not careful to regulate their life according to that judgment."
2. "But as Paul reproves their hypocrisy, we may, on the other hand, conclude, that excellent things are then only rightly approved (provided our judgment proceeds from sincerity) when God is attended to."
3. "Thou provest, or, distinguishest things which differ," is the rendering of [Beza], [Pareus], [Doddridge], and [Stuart]: "Thou approvest things excellent or useful," is the rendering of [Erasmus], [Macknight], and others. The first is the most suitable to the context, as knowledge, and not approval, is evidently intended, as proved by the explanatory clause which follows, — "being instructed out of the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And knowest his will; lit, ‘the will,’ evidently God’s will, as revealed in the law."
2. "Approvest the things that are excellent; or, ‘dost distinguish the things that differ.’ Both translations are verbally exact, the latter being more in accordance with usage. But it gives so tame a sense here, in this glowing rebuke, that the other is to be preferred."
3. "Being instructed, etc. This was the means by which the will of God was known, and the excellent things approved. There is a reference to the public reading and exposition of the law in the synagogue."

### John Gill:
1. "And knowest his will.... to know which in express terms was a privilege, that other people had not; but then the bare knowledge of this will be of no avail..."
2. "...and approvest the things that are more excellent... having tried and discerned them, they approved of them in their judgment as the things more excellent..."
3. "...the knowledge and approbation they had of these things, arose from their being instructed out of the law, and not the Gospel; for the excellent things of the Gospel, they had no discerning, knowledge and approbation of..."
