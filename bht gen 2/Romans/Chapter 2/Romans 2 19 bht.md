# Romans 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, in their arrogance, held the belief that they were superior to the Gentiles, referring to them as blind, in darkness, ignorant, and babes. These titles reflected the Jewish perception of the Gentiles' lack of knowledge and understanding. It is unfortunate that such a mindset of superiority existed among the Jews, as it hindered their ability to truly fulfill their role as guides and lights for those who were in spiritual darkness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πέποιθας, sometimes with ἑαυτῷ or ἐφ ἑαυτῷ (see Luk 18:9), and sometimes with ὅτι (Luke, ib.; Galatians 5:10; Philippians 2:24; Heb 13:18), regardest thyself as, art confident in thyself as being."
2. "ὁδηγὸν τυφλ. We can hardly say with Olsh., that the Apostle undoubtedly refers to the saying of our Lord, Mat 15:14 but rather that both that saying and this were allusive to a title ‘leaders of the blind’ given to themselves by the Pharisees, with which Paul as a Pharisee would be familiar."
3. "Similarly, the following titles may have been well-known and formal expressions of Jewish pride with reference to those who were without the covenant."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

	is, beyond doubt, the true reading here. (It differs but in a single
	letter from the received reading, and the sense is the same).

3. "It is to be observed that Paul here takes the case, not of the common people, but of the learned — the teachers."
