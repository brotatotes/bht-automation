# Romans 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We can have confidence in the judgment of God, for it is known that He will punish wrongdoing. Unlike human judgments, God's judgment is based on the true nature of a person's conduct, including their thoughts and desires. This judgment applies to all individuals, without exception, as God sees and knows everything. Therefore, we must strive to live sincerely and uprightly before Him, as His judgment is the one that truly matters.
