# Romans 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They seemed to carry in their breasts all the secrets of the law, having the form of knowledge and truth, but failing to live in accordance with it. They had not a true knowledge of the law, only a draught and scheme, the rough-sketch and outline of it. They were merely outwardly conformed to the law, but lacked the inward knowledge and transformation.
