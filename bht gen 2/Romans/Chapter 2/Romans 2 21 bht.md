# Romans 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Teaching others without practicing what one teaches is an insufficient way of teaching, as it does not truly reflect a person's understanding and affirmation. The Jews had the faith but lacked the higher ornaments that constitute true glory. Though they abhorred idols and preached against stealing, they themselves committed sacrilege and robbery in the name of religious pretenses. Such hypocrisy is warned against, for it brings disgrace upon those who claim to teach but fail to live up to their own teachings.
