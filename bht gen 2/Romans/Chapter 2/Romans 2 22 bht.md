# Romans 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though the Jews had a strong aversion to idolatry, this did not absolve them from the sin of sacrilege. While they did not engage in idol worship anymore, they were guilty of defiling the worship of God by mixing it with their own traditions and refusing to offer the appropriate sacrifices. Moreover, they were known for plundering the temple and using the sacred items for their personal gain. Therefore, the Jews needed to be reminded that they could not condemn idols while committing acts of sacrilege themselves.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou that abhorrest idols - It was one of the doctrines of their religion to abhor idolatry. This they were everywhere taught in the Old Testament; and this they doubtless inculcated in their teaching. It was impossible that they could recommend idolatry."
2. "Sacrilege is the crime of violating or profaning sacred things; or of appropriating to common purposes what has been devoted to the service of religion... That spirit consisted in withholding from the true God what was his due, and bestowing the affections upon something else."

3. "The highest sacrilege, no doubt, is to deprive God of that sincere service and obedience which he justly requires."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Commit sacrilege' seems to stand in no necessary connection with abhorring idols, whereas the robbing of heathen temples, thus making personal gain of the ‘abominations,’ would be a grievous sin."
2. "The sense we advocate makes the Jew partaker in idolatry by making gain of heathen idol worship: there is a climax, theft, adultery, idolatry, three sins so often associated in the Scriptures and in practice."
