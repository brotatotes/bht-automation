# Romans 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through your boasting of the law, are you dishonoring God by breaking it? Sin takes various forms - falling, missing the mark, and passing over the line. By engaging in such iniquities, God, the lawgiver, is dishonored. No amount of righteous works can justify or please God in the face of such transgressions.
