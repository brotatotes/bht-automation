# Romans 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The actions and behavior of God's people have far-reaching consequences, not just on their own reputation, but also on the perception of the true God. When the Israelites, who were supposed to be a holy and chosen nation, engaged in unrighteous deeds, it brought dishonor to the name of God. The Gentiles, observing the actions of the Jews, concluded that the God of Israel was not holy, omniscient, or omnipotent. This highlights the importance of living a life that honors God and promotes the true nature of our Creator.
