# Romans 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Circumcision, the outward sign of being within the covenant, was highly regarded by the Jews but it does not justify a person before God. Merely possessing the Law does not entitle one to the favor of God, for external advantages, names, or ceremonies cannot save. True circumcision and true Judaism are matters of the heart, requiring faith and obedience. This principle also applies to Christian baptism - it avails nothing if the baptized person does not fulfill the duties implied in the covenant.

2. "Verily profiteth, if thou keep the law—if the inward reality correspond to the outward sign."
3. "But if, &c.—that is, 'Otherwise, thou art no better than the uncircumcised heathen.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews of course affixed a high importance to the rite." 
2. "The mere fact of being a Jew is not what God requires. It may be a favor to have his Law, but the mere possession of the Law cannot entitle to the favor of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Breaker of the law [παραβατης]. Rev., transgressor. See on James 2:11."
2. "Thy circumcision is made uncircumcision."
3. "But if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionable wrong, either in relation to the gods, or his parents, or the state, let the judge deem him to be incurable, remembering what an education and training he has had from youth upward, and yet has not abstained from the greatest of crimes" (Plato, "Laws," 854).

### John Calvin:

2. "The true character of circumcision was a spiritual promise, which required faith: the Jews neglected both, the promise as well as faith."
3. "Circumcision then requires perfection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Circumcision without the keeping of the law is of no avail; true circumcision and true Judaism are not outward matters but of the heart."
2. "The Jew would say: ‘my circumcision profits me, even if I am guilty as you charge.’"
3. "The unholy Jew virtually becomes a Gentile. The same principle applies to Christian baptism, the initiatory rite of the New Dispensation; it avails nothing; in fact, becomes a ground of condemnation, if the baptized person violates the duties implied in the covenant of which it is the sign and seal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If thou be a doer of the law (εαν νομον πρασσεις). Condition of third class and the present (continued action) subjunctive of πρασσω, a verb meaning to do as a habit."

### John Wesley:
1. "Circumcision indeed profiteth — He does not say, justifies. How far it profited is shown in the third and fourth chapters."
2. "Thy circumcision is become uncircumcision — is so already in effect. Thou wilt have no more benefit by it than if thou hadst never received it."
3. "The very same observation holds with regard to baptism."
