# Romans 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the sight of God, if an uncircumcised person walks in obedience to the law and keeps it as in the hands of Christ, they are counted as spiritually circumcised. The focus here is not on the external act, but on the condition of the heart and obedience to God's commands. Therefore, the obedience of an uncircumcised Gentile who keeps the law is more valuable than the circumcision of a Jew who fails to keep it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "'The moral requirements, not the ceremonial: for one of the very first of the latter was, to be circumcised."
2. "The case is an impossible one: nor does the Apostle put it as possible, only as showing manifestly that circumcision, the sign of the covenant of the Law, was subordinate to the keeping of the Law itself."
3. "'In such a case would not he be counted as a circumcised person?'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The case here put is, we think, such as that of Cornelius, who, though outside the external pale of God's covenant, yet having come to the knowledge of the truths contained in it, do manifest the grace of the covenant without the seal of it, and exemplify the character and walk of Abraham's children, though not called by the name of Abraham."
2. "Thus, this is but another way of announcing that God was about to show the insufficiency of the mere badge of the Abrahamic covenant, by calling from among the Gentiles a seed of Abraham that had never received the seal of circumcision."
3. "This interpretation is confirmed by all that follows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Acceptance with God does not depend on a man’s external privileges, but on the state of the heart and life."
2. "Shall his being uncircumcised be any barrier in the way of his acceptance with God?"
3. "God judges things as they are; and as the man, though uncircumcised, who keeps the Law, ought to be treated as if he had been circumcised, so he who believes in Christ agreeably to the divine promise, and trusts to his merits alone for salvation, ought to be treated as if he were himself righteous."

### John Calvin:
1. "The uncircumcised, provided he keeps the law, far excels the Jew with his barren and unprofitable circumcision."
2. "If any Gentile could be found who kept the law, his righteousness would be of more value without circumcision, than the circumcision of the Jew without righteousness."
3. "The Gentile, being a keeper of the law, shall judge thee who art a transgressor, though he is uncircumcised, and thou hast the literal circumcision."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If therefore. The unholy Jew virtually becomes a Gentile (Romans 2:25), does not the obedient Gentile virtually become a Jew?"
2. "The Jewish expression for ‘the uncircumcised;’ comp. Galatians 2:7."
3. "Shall not. The form indicates that an affirmative answer is expected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Keep on keeping" perfectly, Paul means.
2. As often in N.T.

### John Gill:
1. "If any such persons could be found among the Gentiles who keep the whole law of God; and can only be absolutely understood of such, who from a principle of grace act in obedience to the law; as in the hands of Christ, and who look to Christ as the fulfilling end of it, for righteousness; in whom they keep the righteousness of the law perfectly..."
2. "An uncircumcised Gentile, who keeps the law as in the hands of Christ, and under the influences of his Spirit and grace, and keeps it in Christ, is reckoned a circumcised person in a spiritual sense..."
3. "Must be preferable to a circumcised Jew that breaks it."

### John Wesley:
1. "If the uncircumcision — That is, a person uncircumcised."
2. "Keep the law — Walk agreeably to it."
3. "Shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision — In the sight of God?"
