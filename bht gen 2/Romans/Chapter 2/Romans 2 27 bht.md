# Romans 2:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If those who are naturally uncircumcised can fulfill the spiritual requirements of the law, they will have the authority to judge and condemn those who are physically circumcised but fail to live up to the moral obligations. Those who rely solely on the outward sign of circumcision, without truly embracing the inner worship of God and practicing justice and righteousness, are transgressors of the law and will be held accountable. The condemnation of the uncircumcised will highlight the hypocrisy of those who possess the external symbols of faith but lack true obedience in their hearts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He, who remains in his natural state of uncircumcision."
2. "Such is the supposition that an uncircumcised man could fully act up to the (moral) requirements of the law."
3. "The real Jew only, and the real circumcision only, are expressed in both verses."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For circumcision—that is, One's being within the covenant of which circumcision was the outward sign and seal."
2. "Verily profiteth, if thou keep the law—if the inward reality correspond to the outward sign."
3. "But if, &c.—that is, 'Otherwise, thou art no better than the uncircumcised heathen'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Which is the natural state of man; his condition before he is admitted to any of the unique rites of the Jewish religion."
2. "If they who are uncircumcised keep the Law."
3. "Shall not a pagan man who has none of your external privileges, if he keeps the law, condemn you who are Jews; who, although you have the letter and circumcision, are nevertheless transgressors of the law?"

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not mean that they violated the law, because they had the literal circumcision; but because they continued, though they had the outward rite, to neglect the spiritual worship of God, even piety, justice, judgment, and truth, which are the chief matters of the law." 
2. "The rendering of this clause is rather obscure, 'who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law.' The preposition, διὰ, has no doubt the meaning of ἐν or σύν, as in some other passages...Then the version should be, 'who, being with, or having, the letter and circumcision, dost transgress the law.'"
3. "It is better to take 'letter,' i.e., the law, and 'circumcision' separate, than to amalgamate them by a rhetorical figure, as is done by [Calvin] and others. [Hodge] justly says, that this is 'more suited to the context, as nothing is said here of spiritual circumcision.'"


### Philip Schaff:
1. "And the uncircumcision shall judge thee...the conduct of the Gentile will, by comparison, show the true moral attitude of the sinning Jew."
2. "The reference is not to the direct, but to the indirect, judgment of the last day."
3. "Hence the aggravated guilt of one who, in such circumstances, is a transgressor of this law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If it fulfill the law (τον νομον τελουσα). Present active participle...continually fulfilling to the end (as would be necessary)."
2. "Judge thee (κρινει--σε). Unusual position of σε (thee) so far from the verb κρινε."
3. "With the letter and circumcision (δια γραμματος κα περιτομης). Δια means here accompanied by, with the advantage of."

### John Gill:
1. "uncircumcision is by nature, and what men naturally have"
2. "if it, such persons, fulfil the law in Christ, they will judge thee, the circumcision: and condemn"
3. "by circumcision which is in the letter, sin being increased by the prohibitions of the moral law, and the rituals of the ceremonial law"

### John Wesley:
1. "The uncircumcision that is by nature - Those who are, literally speaking, uncircumcised."
2. "Fulfilling the law - As to the substance of it."
3. "Shall judge thee - Shall condemn thee in that day."
