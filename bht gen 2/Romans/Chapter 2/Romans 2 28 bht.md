# Romans 2:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being a true Jew is not determined by outward symbols like circumcision or descent from Abraham. Instead, it is about inner transformation and devotion to God. Mere external conformity does not mark one as a true Jew. The purpose of circumcision goes beyond a physical act; it signifies the need for a change of heart and a willingness to live a holy life. External privileges or religious markers alone cannot shield anyone from God's judgment. It is the inner transformation and experience of a changed heart that truly matters in the kingdom of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The name of 'Jew' and the rite of 'circumcision' were designed but as outward symbols of a separation from the irreligious and ungodly world unto holy devotedness in heart and life to the God of salvation."
2. "It is a sad mark of depravity when all that is designed and fitted to melt only hardens the heart."
3. "As no external privileges, or badge of discipleship, will shield the unholy from the wrath of God, so neither will the want of them shut out from the kingdom of heaven such as have experienced without them that change of heart which the seals of God's covenant were designed to mark."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He who is merely descended from Abraham, and is circumcised, and externally conforms to the Law only, does not possess the true character, and manifest the true spirit, contemplated by the separation of the Jewish people."
2. "Their separation required much more."
3. "Neither does it meet the full design of the rite of circumcision, that it is externally performed. It contemplated much more; see Romans 2:29."

### John Calvin:
1. "A real Jew is not to be ascertained, either by natural descent, or by profession, or by an external symbol."
2. "The circumcision which constitutes a Jew, does not consist in an outward sign only, but that both are inward."
3. "Circumcision then signified the mortification of the whole flesh."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is not a Jew who is one outwardly. This gives the sense of the original; but in this and the succeeding verse the construction is peculiar. The one who shows only the outward marks of a Jew is not a true Jew." (Romans 2:28)
2. "Which is outward. The same phrase just rendered â€˜outwardly.â€™" (Romans 2:28)
3. "In the flesh. This is a further explanation of â€˜outward,â€™ and is to be taken literally." (Romans 2:28)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Which is one outwardly"


### John Gill:
1. "He is not a Jew which is one outwardly...neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; which takes away the flesh of the foreskin, but not the carnality of the heart; leaves a mark upon the flesh, but no impression on the mind."


### John Wesley:
1. "For he is not a Jew â€” In the most important sense, that is, one of God's beloved people."
2. "Who is one in outward show only."
3. "Neither is that the true, acceptable circumcision, which is apparent in the flesh."
