# Romans 2:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The true essence of being a Jew is not based solely on external factors like name, nationality, or religious affiliation. Merely conforming to outward rituals like circumcision does not encompass the genuine transformation of the heart. It is important to recognize that true spiritual circumcision, which is pleasing to God, goes beyond external appearances and is a matter of the heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The name of 'Jew' and the rite of 'circumcision' were designed but as outward symbols of a separation from the irreligious and ungodly world unto holy devotedness in heart and life to the God of salvation."
2. "It is a sad mark of depravity when all that is designed and fitted to melt only hardens the heart."
3. "The law written on the heart- or the Ethics of Natural Theology- may be said to be the one deep foundation on which all revealed religion reposes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He who is merely descended from Abraham, and is circumcised, and externally conforms to the Law only, does not possess the true character, and manifest the true spirit, contemplated by the separation of the Jewish people."
2. "Neither does it meet the full design of the rite of circumcision, that it is externally performed. It contemplated much more."

### John Calvin:
1. "That a real Jew is not to be ascertained, either by natural descent, or by profession, or by an external symbol."
2. "The circumcision which constitutes a Jew, does not consist in an outward sign only, but that both are inward."
3. "Circumcision then signified the mortification of the whole flesh."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is not a Jew who is one outwardly. The one who shows only the outward marks of a Jew is not a true Jew."
2. "Which is outward. The same phrase just rendered 'outwardly.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He is not a Jew which is one outwardly"; by mere name, nature, nation, religion, and profession.
2. "Neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh"; which takes away the flesh of the foreskin, but not the carnality of the heart.
3. This is nothing, is not the true, solid, substantial, spiritual circumcision, which only avails in the sight of God.

### John Wesley:
1. "He is not a Jew...one of God's beloved people."
2. "One in outward show only."
3. "Not the true, acceptable circumcision, which is apparent in the flesh."
