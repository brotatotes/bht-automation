# Romans 2:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul emphasizes that true identity as a Jew is not based on outward rituals or physical circumcision, but on an inner transformation of the heart. The circumcision that truly matters is a spiritual one, characterized by sincerity, repentance, and turning away from sin. Such individuals worship God in spirit and truth and are marked by a genuine righteousness that comes from faith. Rather than seeking approval or praise from others, their ultimate goal is to receive the approval of God, who sees and knows the heart.
