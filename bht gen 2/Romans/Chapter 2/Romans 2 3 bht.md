# Romans 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is a mistaken belief for anyone, even the Jews, to think that they can escape the judgment of God. This misconception arises from a sense of pride and self-righteousness. The Jews believed that because they were the chosen people, they were exempt from the consequences of their actions. However, this is not the case. God is just and holy, and He will judge everyone impartially, without showing favoritism based on one's heritage or religious privileges. None should think themselves immune to the consequences of their sins, for God's judgment extends to all.
