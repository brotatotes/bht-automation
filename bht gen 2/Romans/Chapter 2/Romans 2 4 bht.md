# Romans 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question posed is whether one despises or thinks lightly of God's abundant kindness and patience, not realizing that it is meant to draw them into repentance. The riches of God's goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering are not to be abused, but rather to lead and encourage a change of heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "inasmuch as God spares thee day by day, dost thou set light by His long-suffering, ignorant that His intent in it is to lead thee to repentance?"
2. "the fulness, 'abundance.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil."
2. "The tendency, the design of the goodness of God is to induce people to repent of their sins, and not to lead them to deeper and more aggravated iniquity."
3. "The mercy and forbearance of God are constant. The manifestations of his goodness come in every form; in the sun, and light, and air; in the rain, the stream, the dew-drop; in food, and raiment, and home; in friends, and liberty, and protection; in health, and peace; and in the gospel of Christ, and the offers of life; and in all these ways God is appealing to his creatures each moment."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The indicative mood unites a declaration with the question: 'Do you despise? Aye, you do.'"
2. "It is that forbearance or suspense of wrath, that truce with the sinner, which by no means implies that the wrath will not be executed at the last; nay, involves that it certainly will, unless he be found under new conditions of repentance and obedience."
3. "This reliance on God's tolerance to suspend the rule of His administration in your case is contempt."


### John Calvin:
1. "Where then the fear of God does not rule, confidence, on account of prosperity, is a contempt and a mockery of his great goodness."

3. "But if any one brings this objection — that the Lord sings to the deaf as long as he does not touch inwardly their hearts; we must answer — that no fault can be found in this case except with our own depravity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The despising of the divine goodness is the contemptuous unconcern as to its holy purpose, which produces as a natural consequence security in sinning."
2. "To the present hour in each life, the series of the Divine Goodness may be counted by the succession of a man’s sins."
3. "Is leading thee to repentance. This is its purpose, and its tendency, but it is thwarted by man’s wilful ignorance."
