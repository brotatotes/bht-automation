# Romans 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of thinking that you are accumulating treasures and goodness while disregarding the impending day of judgment. In this short life, you can either store up treasures for yourself or experience the revelation of God's wrath. Remember that the goodness and forbearance of God are juxtaposed with His righteous judgment. His forbearance is shown towards you, but His judgment awaits those who persist in unrepentance. So, do not take God's patience for granted, but rather seek His mercy and live in the light of His coming kingdom.
