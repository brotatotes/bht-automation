# Romans 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who will render (ος αποδωσε). God will render to every person according to their deeds, whether wicked or righteous. The wicked will be punished and receive the recompense they deserve for their sins. On the other hand, the righteous will be rewarded with eternal life, not because of the merit of their good works, but because of God's grace and their genuine faith in Him. Ultimately, God's judgment will be just and in accordance with the true character of each person's actions.
