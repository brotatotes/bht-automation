# Romans 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False Jews are characterized by their disobedience, stubbornness, and impatience. They refuse to obey the truth and sow discord among people. As a result, God's response to their actions is indignation and wrath, bringing upon them tribulation and anguish. This serves as a warning that in the day of judgment, the punishment for their actions will be even more severe than what the Egyptians experienced in the plagues.
