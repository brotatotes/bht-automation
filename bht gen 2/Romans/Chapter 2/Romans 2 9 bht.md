# Romans 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's judgment will bring tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that does evil. This refers to the torments of hell, the punishment for a life of sin. The Jews, having been given greater opportunities to know and follow God's will, bear a greater responsibility and will be held accountable first. Their privileged status as God's chosen people places them in the forefront of those who reject the truth. In this universal judgment, both Jews and Gentiles will face the consequences of their actions.
