# Romans 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The advantage or surplus of being a Jew, or being circumcised, is questioned here. Some may ask, what extra benefits does a Jew have compared to the Gentiles, considering that true circumcision is spiritual and in the heart? One may argue that being born and raised in Jewish customs and traditions does not make one a true Jew; rather, true circumcision is about being born again of water and the Spirit, regardless of one's nationality.

### Albert Barnes:
