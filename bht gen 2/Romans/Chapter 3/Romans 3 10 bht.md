# Romans 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The psalmist's observations of human depravity in his own time are applied by the apostle to demonstrate the sinful nature of all humanity, including the Jewish people. Through these passages, the apostle establishes that there is none righteous and all are under sin. By confirming his assertions with Scripture, the apostle emphasizes the importance of using the Word of God as a foundation for teaching. These passages serve as a reminder that regardless of our religious affiliation, all people are in need of salvation and stand in need of God's grace and mercy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These statements of the Psalmist were indeed suggested by particular manifestations of human depravity occurring under his own eye."
2. "But as this only showed what man, when unrestrained, is in his present condition, they were quite pertinent to the apostle's purpose."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To show this, the apostle adduces texts to show what was the character of the Jewish people; or to show that according to their own Scriptures, they were sinners no less than the Gentiles."
2. "That the apostle applies the passages to the case of the Jews is admitted, yet it is evident more is contained in them than the single proof of Jewish depravity. They go all the length of proving the depravity of mankind, and are cited expressly with this view."
3. "The scope of the whole passage then, is, that all people are depraved, and that the Jews form no exception."

### John Calvin:
1. "And hence let ecclesiastical teachers learn what their office is; for since Paul asserts here no truth but what he confirms by the sure testimony of Scripture, much less ought such a thing to be attempted by those, who have no other commission but to preach the gospel, which they have received through Paul and others."
2. "The Apostle, who gives the meaning rather than the entire words, seems, in the first place, before he comes to particulars, to state generally the substance of what the Prophet declares to be in man, and that is â€” that none is righteous; he afterwards particularly enumerates the effects or fruits of this unrighteousness."
3. "The Hebrew is, 'There is none that doeth good;' and the Septuagint, 'There is none doing kindness, there is not even one.' So that the Apostle quotes the meaning, not the words."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul here uses a catena or chain of quotations to prove his point in verse Romans 3:9 that Jews are in no better fix than the Greeks for all are under sin."
2. "Paul may have used one of them or he may have put these passages together himself."
3. "This sentence is like a motto for all the rest, a summary for what follows."

### John Gill:
1. "The words are not always literally expressed, but the sense is attended to, as in this passage; for in the original text of Psalms 14:1, it is, 'there is none that doth good'; from whence the apostle rightly infers, 'there is none righteous'; for he that does not do good, is not righteous." 
2. "There is none righteous as Adam was, in a state of innocence; for all have sinned, and are filled with unrighteousness, and are enemies to righteousness."
3. "None are righteous by their obedience to the law of works; nor are there any righteous in the sight of God, upon the foot of their own righteousness, however they may appear in their own eyes, and in the sight of others."

### John Wesley:
1. "That all men are under sin appears from the vices which have raged in all ages."
2. "St. Paul therefore rightly cites David and Isaiah, though they spoke primarily of their own age, and expressed what manner of men God sees when he 'looks down from heaven.'"
3. "There is none righteous - this is the general proposition."
