# Romans 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Among the children of men, God looks down from heaven seeking to find those who have understanding and seek after Him. Sadly, His search reveals that there is no one who comprehends the things of God. Those who lack understanding also lack knowledge of God, true self-awareness, and a grasp of the teachings of the Gospel. It is only through the work of the Holy Spirit that one can truly understand these spiritual truths.
