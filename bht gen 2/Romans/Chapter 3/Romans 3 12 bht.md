# Romans 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All humanity has turned away from the right path, forsaking righteousness and failing to benefit themselves or others. They have become bankrupt in their moral and spiritual debts, left with no resources to save themselves. However, there is hope in Christ, who took on the responsibility of paying off these debts and has restored humanity to a better state than before. Even those who strive to do good on their own cannot do so perfectly without the grace of God, the strength of Christ, and the assistance of the Spirit.
