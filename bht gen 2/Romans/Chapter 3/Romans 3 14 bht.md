# Romans 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their mouths are filled with cursing and bitterness, directing their anger not only towards their fellow man but also towards God Himself. Such cursing can manifest internally through their thoughts and externally through their words. The frequency of their sin is evident as their mouths are continually filled with curses, leaving little room for anything else to come forth. The bitterness referred to here encompasses the general presence of sin, including deceitful and wrathful words.
