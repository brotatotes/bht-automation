# Romans 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The feet of those described in Isaiah 59:7,8 are depicted as being eager and swift to commit acts of wickedness and shed the blood of others. This passage portrays the sins of action, highlighting the readiness and evil in the hearts of individuals to harm and kill. It is a reflection of the dark times of Manasseh, during which innocent blood was shed abundantly, staining the city of Jerusalem. Jeremiah 6:7 seems to echo this sentiment, emphasizing the resulting destruction and suffering caused by their wicked ways, as they remained oblivious to the path of peace.
