# Romans 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fear of God, a reverential affection for God, is absent from the hearts of those who do not have a true sense of divine goodness and lack holiness in their lives. This fear stands in opposition to pride and haughtiness, and is a blessing that comes through the covenant of grace. It becomes evident from the overall conduct and behavior of those who are unconverted that the fear of God is not present in their hearts or guiding their actions. As it is written, The fear of God is not before their eyes (Psalm 36:1).
