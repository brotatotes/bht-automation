# Romans 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law speaks to those who are under the law, convicting them of sin and stopping their mouths from boasting. It reveals that all individuals are guilty before God and in need of His grace. These words from the Scriptures were intended not to make people criminal, but to serve as evidence of their guilt.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He proves the applicability of these texts to the Jews by their being found in the Jewish Scriptures: not in any Gentile representation, which might exclude Jews, but spoken universally, in those very books which were the cherished possession of the Jews themselves."
2. "τοῖς ἐν τῷ ν.  λαλεῖ] it speaks...to (or for, dat. commodi: i.e. its language belongs to, is true of, when not otherwise specified) those who are in (under) the law. So that the Jews cannot plead exemption from this description or its consequences."
3. "ἵνα in order that not 'so that': the bringing in all the world guilty before God is an especial and direct aim of the revelation of God’s justice in the law, that His grace by faith in Christ may come on all who abandon self-righteousness and believe the gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Scriptures, considered as a law of duty, saith to them that are under the law."
2. "Every mouth, opened in self-justification, may be stopped."
3. "All the world may become guilty and so condemned before God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle makes this remark in order to prevent the Jew from evading the force of his conclusion."
2. "It denotes that they would be thoroughly convinced; that the argument would be so conclusive as that they would have nothing to reply; that all objections would be silenced."
3. "I regard, therefore, the word 'that' here as referring, not particularly to the argument from the Law of the Jews, but to the whole previous train of argument, embracing both Jews and Gentiles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "May be stopped [φραγη] . Lit., fenced up. The effect of overwhelming evidence upon an accused party in court." 
2. "May become guilty before God [υποδικος γενηται τω θεω] . Rev., brought under the judgment of God. Upodikov under judgment, occurs only here. In classical Greek it signifies brought to trial or liable to be tried."
3. "The rendering brought under judgment regards God as the judge; but He is rather to be regarded as the injured party. Not God's judgments, but His rights are referred to."

### John Calvin:
1. "And he indeed mentions those evasions which he well understood the Jews were ready to bring forward; for whatever was said in the law unfavorably of mankind, they usually applied to the Gentiles, as though they were exempt from the common condition of men..."
2. "And we indeed see the discretion of the Apostle in undertaking to refute these objections; for to whom but to the Jews had the law been given, and to whose instruction but theirs ought it to have served? What then it states respecting others is as it were accidental..."
3. "That every mouth may be stopped, etc.; that is, that every evasion may be cut off, and every occasion for excuse... He indeed says, that though he was not altogether without some kind of excuse, he would yet cease to justify himself, and submit to the sentence of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law faith,   i.e.,  the Old Testament, as a whole; not the Mosaic law alone, since other parts of Scripture have been cited. Regarded as a rule of life, the whole Old Testament is properly called ‘the law.’"
2. "Every mouth may be stopped.  Jew as well as Gentile. The reference is not to the final judgment, but to the more immediate effect of the law: it cuts off every wrong ground of justification; every one is without excuse."
3. "All the world.  This is the positive side of the purpose. All men are here included."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stopping mouths is a difficult business."
2. "Paul seems here to be speaking directly to Jews, the hardest to convince."
3. "Every one is 'liable to God,' in God's court."

### John Gill:
1. "The law charges them with sin, and convicts them of it, both of its pollution and guilt, so that every mouth may be stopped."
2. "The law makes such a representation of things to them, that their mouths are stopped from glorying in themselves, and in their works, which are far from being adequate to the demands of the law."
3. "All the individuals of mankind are guilty before God, and will be found to be so, sooner or later."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whatsoever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law." 
2. "Every mouth may become guilty."
