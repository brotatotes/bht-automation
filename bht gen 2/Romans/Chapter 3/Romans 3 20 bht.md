# Romans 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one can be justified before God by obeying the law, whether through external actions or a lack of conformity in the heart. The law reveals our sinfulness and our inability to achieve righteousness on our own. Works have no worthiness and can never merit salvation. Only through faith in Christ and God's grace can we be forgiven and accepted by Him. The law may condemn us, but it also directs us to the freedom and justification found in Christ.
