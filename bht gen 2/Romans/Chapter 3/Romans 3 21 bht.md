# Romans 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The righteousness of God, which is the way in which He has ordained for us to become righteous, stands apart from any reliance on the law. It is a righteousness that is not achieved through our obedience to the law, but rather through faith in Jesus Christ. This righteousness, although hidden in the past, has now been fully manifested and made known to us. It is confirmed and witnessed by the law and the prophets, as the Old Testament Scriptures foretold and foreshadowed the coming of Christ and the justification that would be through Him.
