# Romans 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's plan of justification is made available to all, both Jews and Gentiles, through faith in Jesus Christ. There is no distinction or difference in the need for justification or in the way it is obtained. Faith is the means by which we receive and apprehend the righteousness of God, renouncing our own righteousness and submitting to the sufficiency of Christ's righteousness. By this faith, we are justified in the sight of God, regardless of our background or status.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the righteousness of God (i.e. ‘I mean, the righteousness of God διὰ πίστεως Ἰ . χρ.’)"
2. "which is (ἡ is not necessary, the art. being often omitted in cases where the ear is reminded of a usage of the cognate verb with a preposition, such as δικαιοῦσθαι διὰ πίστεως."
3. "εἰς πάντ . [ κ . ἐπὶ πάντ .] depends on πεφανέρωται, (is revealed) unto (‘towards,’ ‘so as to penetrate to’) all [ , and upon (‘over,’ so as to be shed down on,’ but in the theological meaning, no real difference of sense from εἰς; this repetition of prepositions to give force is peculiar to Paul, see Romans 3:30, and Gal 1:1) all ] who believe."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "by faith of—that is, 'in' Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe" 
2. "perhaps brought nigh 'unto all' men the Gospel, and actually 'upon all' believing men, as theirs in possession"
3. "most interpreters understand both statements' of believers as only a more emphatic way of saying that all believers, without distinction or exception, are put in possession of this gratuitous justification, purely by faith in Christ Jesus"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle, having stated that the design of the gospel was to reveal a new plan of becoming just in the sight of God, proceeds here more fully to explain it."
2. "The phrase so often used by him, 'righteousness of God,' does not refer to an attribute of God, but to his plan of making people righteous."
3. "The benefits of this plan must actually come upon all, or must be applied to all, if they would be justified."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Faith of Jesus Christ. A common form for "faith in Christ." Difference [διαστολη] . Only by Paul here, Romans 10:12; 1 Corinthians 14:7. Better, as Rev., distinction.

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows in few words what this justification is, even that which is found in Christ and is apprehended by faith."
2. "When therefore we are justified, the efficient cause is the mercy of God, the meritorious is Christ, the instrumental is the word in connection with faith."
3. "For the sake of amplifying, he repeats the same thing in different forms; it was, that he might more fully express what we have already heard, that faith alone is required, that the faithful are not distinguished by external marks, and that hence it matters not whether they be Gentiles or Jews."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even the righteousness of God through faith, or, 'a righteousness, however (mediated), through faith' (Meyer); the article being omitted, as in Romans 3:21, before 'righteousness.' There is a contrast implied between 'the righteousness of God' in general, and this specific form."
2. "In Jesus Christ. Lit., 'of Jesus Christ,' but as He is the object of faith, the proper English expression is 'in.' To explain the whole phrase of Christ's faithfulness to us, or of faith produced by Him, is opposed by Paul's usage."
3. "For there is no distinction. This assigns the reason for what precedes. There is no other way for any; all must believe, in order to obtain this righteousness. There may be other points of difference among men, but as respects this point, there is no 'distinction' made in God's dealing with them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Through faith in Jesus Christ... the objective nature of faith in Christ is shown... by the added words 'unto all them that believe' in Jesus."
2. "The Jew was first in privilege as in penalty, but justification or setting right with God is offered to both on the same terms."

### John Gill:
1. "The righteousness of God, revealed and manifested, is by faith of Jesus Christ."
2. "Faith is a means of apprehending and receiving righteousness; it views the excellency of Christ's righteousness; it owns the sufficiency of it; the soul by it renounces its own righteousness, submits to Christ's, rejoices in it, and gives him the glory of it."
3. "The righteousness is equally applied to one as to another, and one is as much justified by it in the sight of God as another."

### John Wesley:
1. To all — The Jews.And upon all — The gentiles That believe: for there is no difference - Either as to the need of justification, or the manner of it.
