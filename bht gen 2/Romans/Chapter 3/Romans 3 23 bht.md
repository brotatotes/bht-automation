# Romans 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For all have sinned in their nature, thoughts, and actions. They have fallen short of the glorious image of God and the joy of being in His presence. There is no distinction among mankind, for all are guilty and in need of the righteousness that can only come through Christ. Our own attempts at righteousness are futile, and our sinful state leaves us lacking. But through faith in Christ, we can find the approval and grace of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὑστεροῦνται should be rendered fall short, not, as E. V., “come short,” since this latter may be taken for the past tense, after the auxiliary “have.”"
2. "τῆς δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ Of the praise which comes from God, see reff. (so Grot., Thol., Reiche, Fritz., Meyer, Rückert, De Wette): not, ‘of praise in God’s sight’ (Luther, Calv., Estius, Köllner): nor, ‘of glory with God,’ as ch. Romans 5:2 (Œc [15], Beza, al.), for the Apostle is not speaking here of future reward, but of present worthiness: nor, of the glorious image of God which we have lost through sin (Calov., al., Rückert, Olsh.), which is against both the usage of the word, and the context of the passage."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though men differ greatly in the nature and extent of their sinfulness, there is absolutely no difference between the best and the worst of men, in the fact that 'all have sinned,' and so underlie the wrath of God."
2. "Come short of the glory—or 'praise' of God—that is, 'have failed to earn His approbation.'"
3. "So the best interpreters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For all have sinned - This was the point which he had fully established in the discussion in these chapters."
2. "Have come short - Greek, 'Are deficient in regard to;' are lacking, etc. Here it means, that they had failed to obtain, or were destitute of."
3. "The glory of God - The praise or approbation of God. They had sought to be justified, or approved, by God; but all had failed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They sinned, and therefore they are lacking." 
2. "The glory of God is used of the aggregate of the divine attributes and coincides with His self-revelation." 
3. "The sense of the phrase here is: they are coming short of the honor or approbation which God bestows."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no other way of attaining righteousness; for some cannot be justified in this and others in that way; but all must alike be justified by faith."
2. "Since we are all sinners, Paul concludes, that we are deficient in, or destitute of, the praise due to righteousness."
3. "It is then certain, there is no righteousness where there is sin, until Christ removes the curse."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Have sinned,’ is not altogether objectionable, since it implies a relation to what precedes."
2. "Fall short. As the result of their having become sinners."
3. "Glory from God. His approval is meant (although it is true this glory from Him alone can stand before Him), since the next verse closely joins the thought of justification."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This tense gathers up the whole race into one statement (a timeless aorist)." 
2. "Present middle indicative of υστερεω, to be υστερος (comparative) too late, continued action, still fall short."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the general character of all mankind; all have sinned in Adam, are guilty by his sin, polluted with it, and condemned for it; all are sinners in themselves, and by their own actual transgressions."
2. "Hence there is no difference in the state and condition of men by nature; nor is there any reason from and in themselves, why God saves one and not another; nor any room to despair of the grace and righteousness of Christ, on account of persons being, in their own view, the worst of sinners."
3. "Man has no righteousness, nor can he work out one; nor will his own avail, he wants a better than that."

### John Wesley:
1. "For all have sinned... by a sinful nature, sinful tempers, and sinful actions."
2. "And are fallen short of the glory of God... short of his image on earth, and the enjoyment of him in heaven."
