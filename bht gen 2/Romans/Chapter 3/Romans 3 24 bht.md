# Romans 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being justified, each being set right, is not based on anything done on our part. It is a free gift, a result of the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. This redemption, a deliverance from the captivity of sin, is made possible through His death. It is important to understand that our justification is not achieved through our own works or obedience, but solely by the grace of God. This truth emphasizes that our salvation is purely a result of God's unmerited goodness and not our own efforts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is not necessary, in the interpretation, that the subjects of πάντες and δικαιούμενοι should be in matter of fact strictly commensurate: 'all have sinned all are (must be, if justified) justified freely, &c.'"
2. "δωρεάν] here 'without merit or desert as arising from earnings of our own; 'gratis.'"
3. "By means of the propitiatory redemption which is in (has been brought about by, and is now in the Person of) Christ Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "justified freely—without anything done on our part to deserve."
2. "through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus—a most important clause; teaching us that though justification is quite gratuitous, it is not a mere fiat of the divine will, but based on a 'Redemption,' that is, 'the payment of a Ransom,' in Christ's death."
3. "That this is the sense of the word 'redemption,' when applied to Christ's death, will appear clear to any impartial student of the passages where it occurs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being justified - Being treated as if righteous; that is, being regarded and treated as if they had kept the Law."
2. "To them it is a mere undeserved gift, It does not mean that it has been obtained, however, without any price or merit from anyone, for the Lord Jesus has purchased it with his own blood, and to him, it becomes a matter of justice that those who were given to him should be justified."
3. "The word used here denotes that deliverance from sin, and from the evil consequences of sin, which has been effected by the offering of Jesus Christ as a propitiation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being justified. The fact that they are justified in this extraordinary way shows that they must have sinned."
2. "Freely [δωρεαν]. Gratuitously. Compare Matthew 10:8; John 14:25; 2 Corinthians 11:7; Revelation 21:6."
3. "Redemption [απολυτρωσεως]. From ajpolutrow to redeem by paying the lutron price. Mostly in Paul. See Luke 21:28; Hebrews 9:15; Hebrews 11:35. The distinction must be carefully maintained between this word and lutron ransom. The Vulgate, by translating both redemptio, confounds the work of Christ with its result."

### John Calvin:
1. "The meaning is, — that since there remains nothing for men, as to themselves, but to perish, being smitten by the just judgment of God, they are to be justified freely through his mercy; for Christ comes to the aid of this misery, and communicates himself to believers, so that they find in him alone all those things in which they are wanting."
2. "There is, perhaps, no passage in the whole Scripture which illustrates in a more striking manner the efficacy of his righteousness; for it shows that God’s mercy is the efficient cause, that Christ with his blood is the meritorious cause, that the formal or the instrumental cause is faith in the word, and that moreover, the final cause is the glory of the divine justice and goodness."
3. "But what he means is, that we are not otherwise just than through Christ propitiating the Father for us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because they are all in this condition (fallen short of the glory of God), if they are justified it is in this way, namely, freely; as a gift, not by their own merit."
2. "God’s grace, i.e., His unmerited favor. His love to the sinner, is the efficient cause of justification; this led to the objective means: through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."
3. "Hence the redemption is said to be in Him, not through Him; the next verse clearly shows that the reference is to His vicarious death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being justified... each being set right." 
2. "Salvation as God's free gift." 
3. "God did not set men right out of hand with nothing done about men's sins."

### John Gill:
1. "The moving cause of [justification] is the free grace of God; for by 'the grace of God' here, is not meant the Gospel, or what some men call the terms of the Gospel, and the constitution of it; nor the grace of God infused into the heart; but the free love and favour of God, as it is in his heart; which is wonderfully displayed in the business of a sinner's justification before him."
2. "The meritorious cause of justification is the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: redemption supposes a former state of captivity to sin, Satan, and the law, in which God's elect were by nature, and is a deliverance from it; it is of a spiritual nature, chiefly respects the soul, and is plenteous, complete, and eternal: this is in and by Christ."


### John Wesley:
1. "And are justified — Pardoned and accepted.Freely — Without any merit of their own."
2. "By his grace — Not their own righteousness or works."
3. "It is not possible to find words that should more absolutely exclude all consideration of our own works and obedience, or more emphatically ascribe the whole of our justification to free, unmerited goodness."
