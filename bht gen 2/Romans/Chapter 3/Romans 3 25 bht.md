# Romans 3:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, whom God has publicly presented before all, serves as a propitiation, appeasing an offended God. The concept of propitiation implies the need for reconciliation, for if God were never offended, there would be no need for such an act. Through Christ's sacrifice, God not only reveals His mercy but also His justice, demonstrating His righteousness and the necessity of punishing sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "a propitiation, as a propitiatory offering."
3. "the Death of Christ is not only a proof of God’s grace and love, but also of His judicial righteousness which requires punishment and expiation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, in His blood, through faith." 
2. "Now that God can 'set forth' Christ as a 'propitiation for sin through faith in His blood,' the righteousness of His procedure in passing by the sins of believers before, and in now remitting them, is 'manifested,' declared, brought fully out to the view of the whole world."
3. "Our translators have unfortunately missed this glorious truth, taking 'the sins that are past' to mean the past sins of believers—committed before faith—and rendering, by the word 'remission,' what means only a 'passing by'; thus making it appear that 'remission of sins' is 'through the forbearance of God,' which it certainly is not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God has publicly exhibited Jesus Christ as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of people."
2. "Christ is thus represented, not as a mercy-seat, but as the medium, the offering, the expiation, by which reconciliation is produced between God and man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Set forth [προεθετο]. Publicly, openly [προ]; correlated with to declare. He brought Him forth and put Him before the public. Bengel, "placed before the eyes of all;" unlike the ark of the covenant which was veiled and approached only by the high - priest."
2. "Propitiation [ιλαστηριον]. This word is most important, since it is the key to the conception of Christ's atoning work."
3. "The true meaning of the offering of Christ concentrates, therefore, not upon divine justice, but upon human character; not upon the remission of penalty for a consideration, but upon the deliverance from penalty through moral transformation; not upon satisfying divine justice, but upon bringing estranged man into harmony with God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul refers to the gratuitous mercy of God, in having appointed Christ as our Mediator, that he might appease the Father by the sacrifice of his death."
2. "God does not indeed hate in us his own workmanship, that is, as we are formed men; but he hates our uncleanness, which has extinguished the light of his image. When the washing of Christ cleanses this away, he then loves and embraces us as his own pure workmanship."
3. "By faith we come to the possession of this benefit. But by mentioning blood only, he did not mean to exclude other things connected with redemption, but, on the contrary, to include the whole under one word: and he mentioned 'blood' because by it we are cleansed." (Words: 81)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God set forth. One historical fact is spoken of... 'publicly set forth or himself' is the full sense of the term here."
2. "To be a propitiatory sacrifice... 'a propitiatory sacrifice,' either taking the word in that sense, or supplying the noun."
3. "The atoning death of Christ is the ground of the ‘reconciliation'... since it satisfies the demands of Divine justice on the one hand, and on the other draws men to God."

2. "God demanded the atonement and provided it."
3. "The sins before the coming of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Redemption by Christ is further explained by his being 'a propitiation': which word may design either Christ the propitiator, the author of peace and reconciliation; or the propitiatory sacrifice, by which he is so; and both in allusion to the mercy seat, which was a type of him as such."
2. "Christ is the propitiation to God for sin; which must be understood of his making satisfaction to divine justice, for the sins of his people; these were imputed to him, and being found on him, the law and justice of God made demands on him for them; which he answered to satisfaction, by his obedience and sacrifice; and which, as it could not be done by any other, nor in any other way, is expressed by 'reconciliation', and 'atonement'."
3. "Christ has not, by his sacrifice and death, procured the love and favour of God, but has removed the obstructions which lay in the way of love's appearing and breaking forth; there was, a law broken, and justice provoked, which were to be attended to, and Christ by his sacrifice has satisfied both; so that neither the wrath of God, nor any of the effects of it, can fall upon the persons Christ is the propitiation for, even according to justice itself."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whom God hath set forth — Before angels and men." 
2. "A propitiation — To appease an offended God. But if, as some teach, God never was offended, there was no need of this propitiation. And, if so, Christ died in vain." 
3. "To declare his righteousness — To demonstrate not only his clemency, but his justice; even that vindictive justice whose essential character and principal office is, to punish sin."
