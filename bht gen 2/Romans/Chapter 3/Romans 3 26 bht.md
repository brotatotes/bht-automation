This harmonious plan allows all of God's attributes to be glorified, without compromising or overshadowing any of them. In this way, God demonstrates his righteousness and the perfection of his character.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The shewing forth that He was righteous throughout His dealings with the whole world, by means of setting forth an adequate and complete propitiation in the death of Christ, was towards, formed a subsidiary manifestation to, His great manifestation of His righteousness under the Gospel."
2. "in order that He may be (shewn to be: the whole present concern is with ἔνδειξις, the exhibition to men of the righteousness of God) just and (yet, on the other side) justifying him who is of (the) faith in Jesus."
3. "him who belongs to, stands in, works from as his standing-point, faith in Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Just in punishing," and "merciful in pardoning," men can understand; but "just in justifying the guilty," startles them.
2. "God hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin," justice has full satisfaction; and in that "we are made the righteousness of God in Him," mercy has her heart's delight!
3. On the atoning blood of Christ, as the one propitiatory sacrifice which God hath set forth to the eye of the guilty, that the faith of the convinced and trembling sinner fastens for deliverance from wrath.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the plan of salvation, he has shown a regard to the Law by appointing his Son to be a substitute in the place of sinners; not to endure its precise penalty, but he endured so much as to accomplish the same ends as if those who shall be saved by him had been doomed to eternal death."
2. "He showed that he had so great a regard for it, that he would not pardon one sinner without an atonement. And thus he secured the proper honor to his character as a lover of his Law, a hater of sin, and a just God."
3. "Even while pardoning, and treating the ill-deserving as if they were innocent, he can retain his pure and holy character."

### John Calvin:
1. "For nothing is more difficult than to persuade man that he ought to disclaim all things as his own and to ascribe them all to God."
2. "God had indeed in all ages given some evidence of his righteousness; but it appeared far brighter when the sun of righteousness shone."
3. "Then the righteousness of God shines in us, whenever he justifies us by faith in Christ; for in vain were Christ given us for righteousness, unless there was the fruition of him by faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By setting forth Christ, in His blood, as a propitiation, to be appropriated by faith, God not only demonstrated His judicial righteousness which had been obscured in past ages, but also and mainly, He accomplished this purpose and result, that His own character was displayed, as just and justifier, as righteous and accounting righteous him that hath faith in Christ." 
2. "The fact that ‘righteousness’ in the immediate context refers to God’s judicial righteousness, as well as the leading thought of ‘propitiation,’ combine with the lexical requirements of the passage itself in warranting the statement, that every reference to sanctification is a gratuitous importation, the result of theological prejudgment." 
3. "In the death of Christ, God punished sin and saved the sinner; Divine justice was vindicated in the culminating act of redeeming love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The only possible way to save some was the propitiatory offering of Christ and the call for faith on man's part."
2. "Nowhere has Paul put the problem of God more acutely or profoundly."
3. "God's mercy would not allow him to leave man to his fate. God's justice demanded some punishment for sin."

### John Gill:
1. "This end is further explained, it being to declare the righteousness of God 'at this time', under the Gospel dispensation; in which there was such a display of the grace, mercy, and goodness of God."
2. "God is naturally and essentially just in himself; and he is evidentially so in all his works, particularly in redemption by Christ."
3. "God is the justifier of such in a declarative way, and God only, though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit; and which sentence of justification is pronounced by him on the foot of a perfect righteousness, which neither law nor justice can find fault with, but entirely approve of; and so he appears just and righteous, even though he justifies the sinner and the ungodly."

### John Wesley:
1. "For a demonstration of his righteousness — Both of his justice and mercy."
2. "That he might be just - Might evidence himself to be strictly and inviolably righteous in the administration of his government, even while he is the merciful justifier of the sinner that believeth in Jesus."
3. "On this plan all the attributes harmonize; every attribute is glorified, and not one superseded no, nor so much as clouded."
