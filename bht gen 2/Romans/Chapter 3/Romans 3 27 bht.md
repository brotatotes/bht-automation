# Romans 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is no room for boasting, whether it be in the Jews who were prone to boast about their position or in the Gentiles who were inclined to boast about their accomplishments. Boasting is completely shut out, excluded, and not allowed in the realm of justification. By the law of faith, which is the divine constitution that makes faith, not works, the condition of acceptance, boasting is replaced with humble reliance on Christ's righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The boasting, viz. of the Jews, of which he had spoken before, ch. 2, not 'boasting' in general, which will not suit Romans 3:29." 
2. "By what law (is it excluded)? (is it by that) of works? No, but by the law (norma, the rule) of faith." 
3. "The contrast is not here between the law and the Gospel as two dispensations, but between the law of works and the law of faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since all have sinned, and since all have failed of being able to justify themselves by obeying the Law, and since all are alike dependent on the mere mercy of God in Christ, all ground of boasting is of course taken away."
2. "By what law? - The word 'law' here is used in the sense of 'arrangement, rule, or economy.' By what arrangement, or by the operation of what rule, is boasting excluded?"
3. "The law of faith - The rule, or arrangement which proclaims that we have no merit; that we are lost sinners; and that we are to be justified only by faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "But he says that glorying is beyond all doubt excluded, for we cannot adduce anything of our own, which is worthy of being approved or commended by God."
2. "If the material of glorying be merit, whether you name that of congruity or of condignity, by which man would conciliate God, you see that both are here annihilated; for he treats not of the lessening or the modifying of merit, but Paul leaves not a particle behind."
3. "This contrast between faith and works ought to be carefully noticed: works are here mentioned without any limitation, even works universally. Then he neither speaks of ceremonies only, nor specifically of any external work, but includes all the merits of works which can possibly be imagined."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Where is the boasting (or 'glorying') then? We have here an inference (‘then’) vivaciously set forth in question and answer. In view of this manifestation of God’s righteousness apart from the law, the Jew cannot boast."
2. "‘Glorying’ would cover both the good and bad senses of the Greek term, which, however, has here the bad sense, namely, ‘boasting.’"
3. "‘If we were saved by our own works, we might put the crown upon our own heads. But the law of faith, the way of justification by faith, doth forever exclude boasting .... therefore it is most for God’s glory, that thus we should be justified’ (Mathew Henry)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is completely shut out."
2. "By a law of faith, by the principle of faith in harmony with God's love and grace."

### John Gill:
1. "There is no room nor reason for it, either in Jews or Gentiles: not in the Jews, who were very apt to boast... nor in the Gentiles, who were ready to boast..."
2. "It is excluded; it is shut out of doors; the key is turned upon it; it is not allowed of; it is entirely exploded..."
3. "The doctrine of a sinner's justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ; according to which doctrine the most unlikely persons are justified, even ungodly persons, the worst and vilest of sinners; and that without any consideration of works, by faith only, which is freely given them; and by faith in Christ's righteousness only: so that there is not the least room for boasting in the creature, but all their boasting is in Christ..."

### John Wesley:
1. "By what law? of works? Nay - This would have left room for boasting."
2. "The law of faith is that divine constitution which makes faith, not works, the condition of acceptance."
