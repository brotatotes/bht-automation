# Romans 3:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Justification by faith alone, separate from works of the law, is the central message conveyed. This highlights that our righteousness is not achieved through our own actions, but by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. It abolishes any grounds for boasting, as it is solely based on God's grace. This doctrine applies universally, with no distinction between individuals of different backgrounds or beliefs. The emphasis lies on the significance of faith as the means through which we receive the righteousness granted by God. It underscores the essentiality of trust and belief in our salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For we hold (as explanatory of the verse preceding, on the other supposition the two verses are disjointed, and the conclusion comes in most strangely), that a man is justified by faith [apart from] (without [but more than without so distinctly without as to be utterly and entirely separate from and independent of]) the works of the law."
2. "Therefore boasting is excluded."
3. "We reckon, not 'we conclude,' but we hold, we reckon, see reff.: the former is against N. T. usage; and has probably caused the change of Œ≥Œ¨œÅ into Œø·ΩñŒΩ, by some who imagined that this verse was a conclusion from the preceding argument."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the unavoidable tendency of dependence upon our own works, less or more, for acceptance with God, to beget a spirit of 'boasting.'"
2. "The doctrine that our faith receives a righteousness that makes the sinner just, manifestly and entirely excludes 'boasting' and this is the best evidence of its truth."
3. "This and no other way of salvation is adapted alike to Jew and Gentile."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Is justified by faith - Is regarded and treated as righteous, by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "No righteousness of their own will be the ground of their justification."
3. "If this doctrine is held entire, all others will be held with it. If this is abandoned, all others will fall also."

### John Calvin:
1. "Justification by faith is indeed made very clear, while works are expressly excluded."
2. "Paul affirms in this passage that justification is so gratuitous, that he makes it quite evident, that it can by no means be associated with the merit of works."
3. "What, James says, that man is not justified by faith alone, but also by works, does not at all militate against the preceding view."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Glorying is excluded by the law of faith, for (we have already proved and hence) we reckon."
2. "By faith apart from the works of the law... the phrase 'faith alone' has been a watchword of evangelical Protestantism."
3. "The emphasis rests on 'faith,' which 'is the alone instrument of justification; yet it is not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We reckon therefore (ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∂ŒøŒºŒµŒ∏Œ± ŒøœÖŒΩ). Present middle indicative."
2. "The accusative and infinitive construction occurs after ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∂ŒøŒºŒµŒ∏Œ± here."
3. "Paul restates verses Romans 3:21."

### John Gill:
1. "that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law."
2. "the apostle names neither Jew nor Gentile, but 'man', to show that Christ's righteousness is unto all, and every man, that believes, be he who he will."
3. "by faith without works joined to it, in the affair of justification; or by the righteousness of Christ imputed by God the Father, without any consideration of them, and received by faith, and relied upon by the believer, without any regard unto them."

### John Wesley:
1. "A man is justified by faith - And even by this, not as it is a work, but as it receives Christ."
2. "Has something essentially different from all our works whatsoever."
3. "Faith receives Christ."
