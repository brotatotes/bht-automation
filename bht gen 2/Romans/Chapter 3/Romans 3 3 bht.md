# Romans 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unbelief of some does not negate the faithfulness of God. Though there were Jews who did not believe, this does not nullify the promises of God to those who have faith. God's faithfulness remains unchanged, and He will fulfill His promises to those who trust in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And this advantage is not cancelled, nor the covenant annulled, by their disobedience."
2. "For what? The γάρ confirms the preceding, the τί indicates some difficulty, or anticipated objection to it."
3. "If we place an interrogation at γάρ, we must render this, suppose some were unfaithful."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the unbelief of the great body of the nation which the apostle points at; but as it sufficed for his argument to put the supposition thus gently, he uses this word 'some' to soften prejudice."
2. "Shall their unbelief make the faith of God, or 'faithfulness of God,' nullify, invalidate it?"


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine of the apostle Romans 2:0 would seem to imply that in certain respects they were on a level with the Gentile nations; that if they sinned, they would be treated just like the pagan; and hence, they asked of what value was the promise of God? Had it not become vain and nugatory?"
2. "Make the faith - The word “faith” here evidently means the “faithfulness” or “fidelity of God to his promises.”
3. "The meaning of the objection is, that the fact supposed, that the Jews would become unfaithful and be lost, would imply that God had failed to keep his promises to the nation; or that he had made promises which the result showed he was not able to perform."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Rev. rendering is preferable, as bringing out the paronomasia between the Greek words: were without faith; their want of faith; the faithfulness of God."
2. "The good faith of God; His fidelity to His promises."
3. "The radical meaning is to make inert or idle. Dr. Morison acutely observes that it negatives the idea of agency or operation, rather than of result or effect. It is rather to make inefficient than to make without effect."

### John Calvin:
1. "Shall their unbelief... hinder its effect and fulfillment as to men."
2. "It cannot be that the truth of God should lose its stability through man's wickedness."
3. "Some ever remained in that nation, who by continuing to believe in the promise, had not fallen away from the privileges of the covenant."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such objections would be addressed to the Apostle continually, as he labored, more or less assailed by Jewish opposition; while the confirmation of the fact of Romans 3:2 seems unnecessary."
2. "We prefer (2), and find an objection growing out of the unbelief of the Jews at that time, which is more fully discussed in chaps. 9-11."
3. "The word used is ‘faith,’ but that it has here the sense of faithfulness is plain, from the Old Testament usage, and from the fact that no other sense is appropriately applied to God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Some were without faith (ηπιστησαν). First aorist active indicative of απιστεω, old verb, to disbelieve. This is the common N.T. meaning... Some of them "disbelieved," these "depositaries and guardians of revelation" (Denney)."
2. "But the word also means to be unfaithful to one's trust and Lightfoot argues for that idea here... Either makes sense here and both ideas are true of some of the Jews, especially concerning the Messianic promises and Jesus."
3. "The faithfulness of God (την πιστιν του θεου). Undoubtedly πιστις has this sense here and not 'faith.' God has been faithful... whether the Jews (some of them) were simply disbelievers or untrue to their trust."

### John Gill:
1. "It is suggested, that though the Jews enjoyed such a privilege, some of them did not believe; which is an aggravation of their sin, that they should have such means of light, knowledge, and faith, such clear and full evidences of things, and yet be incredulous."
2. "This was no objection to the advantage they had of the Gentiles, since this was not owing to want of evidence in the word of God, but to the darkness and unbelief of their minds."
3. "And he took it away only until 'the fulness of the Gentiles', Romans 11:25, is brought in; and then the Gospel shall come to them again with power, and 'all Israel shall be saved.'"

### John Wesley:
1. Shall their unbelief disannul the faithfulness of God — Will he not still make good his promises to them that do believe?
