# Romans 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is one in nature and essence, and He is one in will and the methods of His grace. As one God, He shows mercy to both the circumcision, the Jews, and the uncircumcision, the Gentiles, by the very same means. His mercy and the means of justification are not limited to a specific group but extend to all who have faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God is One, who shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through their faith." 
2. "The former expresses the ground of justification, generally taken, by faith: the latter the means whereby the man lays hold on justification, by his faith: the former is the objective ground, the latter the subjective medium."
3. "To understand τῆς πίστεως as referring to πίστεως just mentioned 'by the instrumentality of the identical faith which operates in the case of the circumcised,' is to contradict the fact: the faith was not, strictly speaking, identical in this sense, or the two cases never need have been distinguished."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is one God who shall justify - 'has unchangeably fixed that He shall justify.'"
2. "The justification of the Jews, as the born heirs of the promise, may be here purposely said to be 'of faith,' while that of the Gentiles...may be said to be 'through faith,' as thus admitted into a new family."

### John Calvin:
1. "In saying that some are justified by faith, and some through faith, he seems to have indulged himself in varying his language, while he expresses the same thing, and for this end, — that he might, by the way, touch on the folly of the Jews, who imagined a difference between themselves and the Gentiles..."
2. "...since men became partakers of this grace by faith only, and since faith in all is the same, it is absurd to make a distinction in what is so much alike."
3. "...let him take this, — that the one obtains righteousness by faith, and the other through faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The unity of God implies that He is God, not merely of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles; for otherwise another special Deity must rule over the Gentiles, which would do away with monotheism" (Meyer).
2. "But the unity of God’s being involves the uniformity of His method of justification. If God is one, there can be no contradictory revelations from God; hence Christianity, based equally with Judaism upon monotheism, cannot admit of being one among several religions equally true."
3. "Some distinguish the former, as giving the general ground of justification (as opposed to that of works); the latter, the particular means, through his faith (as opposed to want of faith). To make the former imply a different position on the part of the Jew, is to oppose the whole current of Paul’s thought."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If on the whole God is one... it is used of that about which there is no doubt."
2. "By faith, springing out of."
3. "Through faith, by means of the faith."

### John Gill:
1. "God is one in nature and essence, though there are three persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."
2. "God, as he is one in nature, so he is one in will, in his promises, and in the methods of his grace."
3. "The objects of justification are 'the circumcision', the circumcised Jews, and 'the uncircumcision', the uncircumcised Gentiles; the circumcision of the one does not forward, and the uncircumcision of the other does not hinder, nor neither of them effect the grace of justification."

### John Wesley:
1. Seeing it is one God who — Shows mercy to both, and by the very same means.
