## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Surely the law is set aside and made void. That this is not so, the Apostle both here asserts, and is prepared to show by working out the proposition of Romans 3:29."
2. "The law itself belonged to a covenant whose original recipient was justified by faith, and whose main promise was, the reception and blessing of the Gentiles."
3. "The law of God, insofar as written in their consciences, when speaking of the Gentiles: and when including both, the law of God generally, His written as well as His unwritten will."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is a fundamental requisite of all true religion that it tend to humble the sinner and exalt God; and every system which breeds self-righteousness, or cherishes boasting, bears falsehood on its face."
2. "The fitness of the Gospel to be a universal religion, beneath which the guilty of every name and degree are invited and warranted to take shelter and repose, is a glorious evidence of its truth."
3. "The glory of God's law, in its eternal and immutable obligations, is then only fully apprehended by the sinner, and then only is it enthroned in the depths of his soul, when, believing that 'He was made sin for him who knew no sin,' he sees himself 'made the righteousness of God in Him.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do we then make void the law...by the doctrine of justification by faith?...This is an objection which would naturally be made; and which has thousands of times been since made, that the doctrine of justification by faith tends to licentiousness."
 
2. "Yea, we establish the law...by this scheme of treating people as righteous, the moral law is confirmed, its obligation is enforced, obedience to it is secured...The plan of justification by faith leads to an observance of the Law."
3. "This is an advantage in moral influence which no cold, abstract law always has over the human mind. And one of the chief glories of the plan of salvation is, that while it justifies the sinner, it brings a new set of influences from heaven...to produce obedience to the Law of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence it was that he made this protest, â€” 'I came not to undo, but to fulfill the law.'" (Matthew 5:17.)
2. "For the moral law is in reality confirmed and established through faith in Christ, inasmuch as it was given for this end â€” to lead man to Christ by showing him his iniquity."
3. "Let us then also bear in mind, so to dispense the gospel that by our mode of teaching the law may be confirmed; but let it be sustained by no other strength than that of faith in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do we then make void the law through faith? This verse may be regarded either as the proposition of chap. 4, or as the conclusion of the preceding argument."
2. "The Apostle indignantly denies that faith abrogates the law, as might be objected."
3. "We establish the law, cause the law to stand. Not as a ground of justification, but as itself teaching justification by faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Apart from Christ and the help of the Holy Spirit no one can keep God's law."
2. "The Mosaic law is only workable by faith in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The law is not made void, neither by the grace nor doctrine of faith: not by the grace of faith; for that faith is not right which is not attended with works of righteousness; and those works are not right which do not flow from faith."
2. "Moreover, none but believers are capable of performing good works aright, and they do them, and they ought to do them: besides, faith, as a grace, looks to Christ, as the end of the law for righteousness, and therefore do not make it void."
3. "The law is so far from being made void, that it is established by this doctrine; for by it the perpetuity of it is asserted, the spirituality of it is acknowledged, the perfect righteousness of it is secured."

### John Wesley:
