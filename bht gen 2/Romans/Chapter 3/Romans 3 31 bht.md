# Romans 3:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law is not abolished or disregarded through the doctrine of faith, but rather upheld and affirmed. True faith is accompanied by righteous actions, and believers are empowered to live out these good works. The doctrine of faith establishes the law by affirming its eternal significance, acknowledging its spiritual nature, and securing its perfect righteousness. Through faith, the law's authority, purity, and ultimate purpose are defended and fulfilled in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Surely the law is set aside and made void. That this is not so, the Apostle both here asserts, and is prepared to shew by working out the proposition of Romans 3:29."
2. "The law itself belonged to a covenant whose original recipient was justified by faith, and whose main promise was, the reception and blessing of the Gentiles."
3. "The design being to shew that the law itself contained this very doctrine, and was founded in the promise to Abraham on a covenant embracing Jews and Gentiles, and therefore was not degraded from its dignity by the doctrine, but rather established as a part of God’s dealings, consistent with, explaining, and explained by, the Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is a fundamental requisite of all true religion that it tend to humble the sinner and exalt God."
2. "The fitness of the Gospel to be a universal religion, beneath which the guilty of every name and degree are invited and warranted to take shelter and repose, is a glorious evidence of its truth."
3. "The glory of God's law, in its eternal and immutable obligations, is then only fully apprehended by the sinner, and then only is it enthroned in the depths of his soul when, believing that 'He was made sin for him who knew no sin,' he sees himself 'made the righteousness of God in Him.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Yea, we establish the law - That is, by the doctrine of justification by faith; by this scheme of treating people as righteous, the moral law is confirmed, its obligation is enforced, obedience to it is secured."
2. "The sinner sees the evil of transgression. He sees the respect which God has shown to the Law. He gives his heart to God, and yields himself to obey his Law. All the sentiments that arise from the conviction of sin; that flow from gratitude for mercies; that spring from love to God; all his views of the sacredness of the Law, prompt him to yield obedience to it."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the moral law is in reality confirmed and established through faith in Christ... it was given for this end — to lead man to Christ by showing him his iniquity... without this it cannot be fulfilled, and in vain will it require what ought to be done..." 
2. "Similar is the case with ceremonies, which indeed cease and vanish away when Christ comes, but they are in reality confirmed by him... when they are viewed in themselves they are vain and shadowy images, and then only do they attain anything real and solid, when their end is regarded."
3. "Let us then also bear in mind, so to dispense the gospel that by our mode of teaching the law may be confirmed; but let it be sustained by no other strength than that of faith in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The objection to making it begin the next chapter is the form of Romans 3:1 (which see)."
2. "The Apostle indignantly denies that faith abrogates the law, as might be objected."
3. "Not as a ground of justification, but as itself teaching justification by faith, the next chapter giving the historical proof."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Nay, we establish the law."

### John Gill:
1. "The law is not made void, neither by the grace nor doctrine of faith: not by the grace of faith; for that faith is not right which is not attended with works of righteousness; and those works are not right which do not flow from faith."
2. "Moreover, none but believers are capable of performing good works aright, and they do them, and they ought to do them."
3. "The law is so far from being made void, that it is established by this doctrine; for by it the perpetuity of it is asserted, the spirituality of it is acknowledged, the perfect righteousness of it is secured."

### John Wesley:
1. "We establish the law - Both the authority, purity, and the end of it."
2. "By defending that which the law attests."
3. "By pointing out Christ, the end of it; and by showing how it may be fulfilled in its purity."
