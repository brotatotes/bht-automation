# Romans 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul strongly rejects any notion that the truth of God could be nullified due to human unfaithfulness. Rather, he affirms that God is always true and faithful to His word, even if it means that every person is proven to be a liar. This echoes the sentiment expressed in Psalm 51:4, emphasizing the need to justify and confirm God's righteousness, regardless of the personal cost. It is crucial to hold onto the unwavering truth of God, trusting in His faithfulness, and recognizing the imperative to uphold His righteousness in every circumstance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is often found in Polybius, Arrian, and the later Greek writers."
2. "Let us believe all men on earth to have broken their word and truth, than God His. Whatever becomes of men and their truth, His truth must stand fast."
3. "That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest conquer when Thou art judged."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God forbid—literally, "Let it not be," that is, "Away with such a thought"—a favorite expression of our apostle, when he would not only repudiate a supposed consequence of his doctrine, but express his abhorrence of it."
2. "yea, let God be—held true, and every man a liar—that is, even though it should follow from this that every man is a liar."
3. "when thou art judged—so in Psalms 51:4, according to the Septuagint; but in the Hebrew and in our version, 'when thou judgest.' The general sentiment, however, is the same in both—that we are to vindicate the righteousness of God, at whatever expense to ourselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The veracity of God was a great first principle, which was to be held, whatever might be the consequence."
2. "Let God be esteemed true and faithful, whatever consequence may follow."
3. "This showed his firm conviction that the doctrine which he advanced was strictly in accordance with the veracity of the divine promise."

### Marvin Vincent:
"God forbid [μη γενοιτο] . Lit., may it not have come to pass. Used by Paul fourteen times. It introduces the rebuttal of an inference drawn from Paul 's arguments by an opponent." (1)
"Let God be true [γινεσθω ο θεος αληθης] . Rev., better, 'let God be found true;' thus giving the force of ginomai to become." (2)
"Let God turn out to be or be found to be by His creatures. Be justified. Acknowledged righteous. The figure is forensic. God 's justice is put on trial." (3)

### John Calvin:
1. "God is true, not only because he is prepared to stand faithfully to his promises, but because he also really fulfills whatever he declares; for he so speaks, that his command becomes a reality."
2. "So far is it that the truth of God is destroyed by our falsehood and unfaithfulness, that it thereby shines forth and appears more evident, according to the testimony of David, who says, that as he was a sinner, God was a just and righteous Judge in whatever he determined respecting him, and that he would overcome all the calumnies of the ungodly who murmured against his righteousness."
3. "Since all the sins of mortals must serve to illustrate the glory of the Lord, and since he is especially glorified by his truth, it follows, that even the falsehood of men serves to confirm rather than to subvert his truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression is used in animated discussions, fourteen times by Paul (ten times in this Epistle), and elsewhere in the New Testament (Luke 20:16). It is an indignant denial, including pious horror, and hence is equivalent to the English phrase 'God forbid,' to which, however, objection has been raised, both because it is not a translation of the Greek, and on account of the unnecessary use of the name of God."
2. "'Rather let us believe all men on earth to have broken their word and troth, than God His. Whatever becomes of men and their truth His truth must stand fast.'"
3. "The quotation is from the LXX., which varies verbally from the Hebrew. As here used, it gives exactly the profound sense of the original."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let God be found true (γινεσθω ο θεος αληθης)."
2. "But every man a liar (πας δε ανθρωπος ψευστης)."
3. "As it is written (καθως γεγραπτα)."
4. "That thou mightest be justified (οπως αν δικαιωθηις)."
5. "Mightest prevail (νικησεις)."
6. "When thou comest into judgement (εν τω κρινεσθα σε)."

### John Gill:
1. "Let no such thing ever enter into the minds of any, that the truth of God can be, or will be made of none effect by the want of faith in man... God is true, faithful to his word, constant in his promises, and will always fulfil his purposes..." 
2. "God made a promise to David... David sinned greatly... but his sin did not make of no effect the truth and faithfulness of God: though David showed himself to be a weak sinful man, yet God appeared true and faithful to every word of promise which he had sworn in truth to him..."
3. "This now is brought as a full proof... that God is always true to his word, though men fail in theirs, and fall into sin."

### John Wesley:
1.  Psalm 2:4.
