# Romans 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unrighteousness of men actually serves to commend the righteousness of God. God's justice and fidelity are displayed and established through the punishment of human unrighteousness and the fulfillment of His promises despite our failings. Therefore, it seems unjust for God to punish us for our unrighteousness, as it ultimately brings glory to Him. This reasoning may appear problematic, but it is important to understand that these statements are made from a human perspective, acknowledging our limitations in comprehending the ways of God.

3. "The phrase is thrown in apologetically, under a sense that the mode of speech is unworthy of the subject."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is, indeed, no doubt, but that this was an ordinary, and everywhere a common calumny, as it will presently appear."
2. "Hence Paul could not have covertly passed it by; but that no one should think that he expressed the sentiments of his own mind, he premises that he assumes the person of the ungodly."

1. "Hence it appears, that the unrighteousness of men commends the righteousness, or faithfulness of God."
2.

3. "Is God unrighteous, who taketh vengeance? If the premises are true, this is a just consequence of them; whereas God does take vengeance on men for their unrighteousness, both here and hereafter, it must be a piece of unrighteousness in him so to do."
