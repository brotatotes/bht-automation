# Romans 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God forbid that anyone would suggest that God is unjust in His judgment of the world. It is universally accepted that God will judge all mankind, and it is impossible for Him to be unrighteous in doing so. In fact, the very idea of God being unjust is unthinkable. If it were unjust for God to punish unrighteousness, how could He judge the world? However, we know that all the unrighteousness in the world will ultimately serve to commend the righteousness of God.
