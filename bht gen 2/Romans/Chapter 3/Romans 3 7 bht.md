# Romans 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The objection raised against the concept of doing evil for good to come from it is utterly flawed. It falsely assumes that by our wickedness, we bring glory to God. The truth is, our unfaithfulness and falsehood only serve to highlight God's faithfulness and truth even more. While God can use our sins to display His glory in a providential way, it does not justify our wrongdoing or exempt us from punishment. Our only anchor in understanding God's ways and reconciling His purposes with human free agency lies in acknowledging the abounding truth and faithfulness of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The supposition if carried out, would overthrow all God’s judgment, and the whole moral life of man."
2. "If the truth of God abounded by means of my falsehood, to His glory, why any longer am I also judged as a sinner?"
3. "Not only by the preceding argument, but by the common detestation of all men, for such a maxim as doing evil that good may come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such reasoning amounts to this—which indeed we who preach salvation by free grace are slanderously accused of teaching—that the more evil we do, the more glory will redound to God a damnable principle."
2. "God's eternal purposes and man's free agency, as also the doctrine of salvation by grace and the unchanging obligations of God's law, have ever been subjected to the charge of inconsistency by those who will bow to no truth which their own reason cannot fathom."
3. "Amidst all the clouds and darkness which in this present state envelop the divine administration and many of the truths of the Bible, such broad and deep principles as are here laid down, and which shine in their own luster, will be found the sheet-anchor of our faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His 'truth' will be shown by the fulfillment of all his promises to his people, and of all his predictions."
2. "Every lost sinner will be, therefore, an eternal monument of the truth of God."
3. "The fault in the reasoning of the objector is this, that he takes for granted that the direct tendency of his conduct is to promote God’s glory, whereas it is just the reverse."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression carries us back to ver. 4, and is general for moral falsehood, unfaithfulness to the claims of conscience and of God." 
2. "especially with reference to the proffer of salvation through Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "If by our unfaithfulness the truth of God becomes more conspicuous, and in a manner confirmed, and hence more glory redounds to him, it is by no means just, that he, who serves to display God’s glory, should be punished as a sinner."
2. "The particle γὰρ here gives no reason, but is to be viewed as meaning then, or indeed, verily."
3. "The idea is substantially the same, which is designated by these respectively corresponding appellations. Fidelity, uprightness, integrity, are designated byπίστιν, δικαιοσύνην, and ἀλήθεια; while ἀλήθεια, and ἀπιστία ἀδικία, designate unfaithfulness, want of uprightness and false dealing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘The argument accordingly rests on the basis, that in the case put (" then" from Romans 3:6) the relation of God to the judgment of the world would yield two absurd consequences.’(Meyer.)" 
2. "The absurd consequence as respects God, is that He has no right to judge man as a sinner, because man’s falsehood glorifies His truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul 'uses the first person from motives of delicacy' (Sanday and Headlam) in this supposable case for argument's sake as in 1 Corinthians 4:6." 
2. "So here he 'transfers by a fiction' (Field) to himself the objection."


### John Gill:
1. "The 'truth of God' is the same with 'the righteousness of God', Romans 3:5, and means his faithfulness."
2. "The truth of God is commended, illustrated, and made to abound, when it is asserted, that he is true and faithful, and every man is a liar, fallacious, and deceitful."
3. "Though God may overrule, in a providential way, the sins of others for his glory, this is no excuse for their sins, nor will it be an exemption of them from punishment."

### John Wesley:
1. "Has been more abundantly shown."
2. "If my lie, that is, practice contrary to truth, conduces to the glory of God, by making his truth shine with superior advantage."
3. "Can this be said to be any sin at all? Ought I not to do what would otherwise be evil, that so much 'good may come?'"
