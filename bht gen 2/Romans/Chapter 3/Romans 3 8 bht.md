# Romans 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who suggest that sin should be promoted to bring glory to God are misguided. Doing evil to bring about good is not a principle to be followed. The idea that any imaginable good justifies the commission of evil is false. The apostle firmly denies such a notion, emphasizing that evil is not to be done in any circumstance. Those who embrace and teach this doctrine are deserving of condemnation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the glory of God is to be promoted by sin, and if a man is not therefore to be condemned, or held guilty for it; if this fact absolves man from crime, 'why not carry the doctrine out, and make it a principle of conduct, and do all the evil we can, in order to promote his glory.'"
2. "He expressly disavows, in strong language, the doctrine charged on Christians...Thus, he silences the objection. And thus he teaches, as a great fundamental law, 'that evil is not to be done that good may come.' This is a universal rule."
3. "Whatever is evil is not to be done under any pretence. Any imaginable good which we may think will result from it...will not sanction or justify the deed."

### John Calvin:
1. "The pretense, indeed, is this, — 'If God is by our iniquity glorified, and if nothing can be done by man in this life more befitting than to promote the glory of God, then let us sin to advance his glory!'"
2. "God has prescribed to us the way, by which he would have himself to be glorified by us, even by true piety, which consists in obedience to his word."
3. "Since Paul speaks so reverently of the secret judgments of God, it is a wonder that his enemies should have fallen into such wantonness as to calumniate him: but there has never been so much reverence and seriousness displayed by God’s servants as to be sufficient to check impure and virulent tongues."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The second absurd consequence, as respects man, is the evil principle, so strongly condemned, as carrying its refutation with it."
2. "Slanderously reported; lit, 'blasphemed.' Such slander was in the last instance blasphemy, since thus God’s character was outraged."
3. "A doctrine directly leading to immoral results cannot belong to the gospel Paul is setting forth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And why should it not happen?"
2. "Let us do evil that good may come."
3. "It sounds almost uncanny to find this maxim of the Jesuits attributed to Paul in the first century by Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "Why do not you go on? Why do you stop here?" 
2. "A slander cast upon the apostle's doctrine of unconditional election, free justification, and of God's overruling the sins of men for good."
3. "And all such persons are deserving of damnation, who teach such things or practice after this sort."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whose condemnation is just - The condemnation of all who either speak or act in this manner."
2. "So the apostle absolutely denies the lawfulness of 'doing evil,' any evil, 'that good may come.'"
