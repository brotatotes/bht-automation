# Romans 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are we, as Jews, better than the Gentiles? No, not at all. Both Jews and Gentiles are under the power and guilt of sin, equally condemned. The Jews, privileged as they were with the oracles of God, did not have any advantage in escaping divine condemnation. They, like the Gentiles, were born in sin and remained under its dominion.
