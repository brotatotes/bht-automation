# Romans 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What does our father Abraham, according to his flesh, have to boast about? Was he justified by his own efforts and obedience to the law? And what about circumcision? If Abraham was justified by faith and not by works, what purpose did circumcision serve? These questions are raised to emphasize that Abraham's justification was not based on his own merit but on his faith in God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The question is not one which requires any such distinction between his fleshly and spiritual paternity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "How does your doctrine of justification by faith agree with what the Scriptures say of Abraham? Was the Law set aside in his case? Did he derive no advantage in justification from the rite of circumcision, and from the covenant which God made with him?"
2. "The Jews valued themselves much on the fact that he was their father; and an argument, drawn from his example or conduct, therefore, would be especially forcible."
3. "If people are justified by faith; if works are to have no place; if, therefore, all rites and ceremonies, all legal observances, are useless in justification; what is the advantage of circumcision? What benefit did Abraham derive from it? Why was it appointed? And why is such an importance attached to it in the history of his life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then’ connects with what precedes, but the exact reference is open to discussion."
2. "The sense then is: what shall we say then that Abraham our forefather hath found (i.e., attained) according to the flesh (i.e., through his own natural efforts as distinct from the grace of God)."
