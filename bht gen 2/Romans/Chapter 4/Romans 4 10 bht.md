# Romans 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's justification did not come through circumcision, as he was justified before he even underwent this rite, which took place years later. His faith was reckoned to him for righteousness before the birth of Ishmael. This demonstrates that circumcision was not the cause of his justification, and it emphasizes that Gentiles, even when uncircumcised, can also be justified through faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The interval between the recognition of his faith and his circumcision, was perhaps as much as twenty-five, certainly not less than fourteen years."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For if he was justified by faith after he was circumcised, the Jew might pretend that it was in virtue of his circumcision; that even his faith was acceptable, because he was circumcised."
2. "But if it was before he was circumcised, this plea could not be set up; and the argument of the apostle was confirmed by the case of Abraham, the great father and model of the Jewish people."
3. "Circumcision and the deeds of the Law did not conduce to justification; and that as Abraham was justified without those works, so might others be, and the pagan, therefore, might be admitted to similar privileges."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "How then was it reckoned? Not, what was the mode in which it was reckoned, but, ‘how was he situated when this took place?’ The rest of the verse makes this clear."
2. "Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. The ‘reckoning’ took place (Genesis 15:6) at least fourteen years before the circumcision of Abraham (Genesis 17:25); consequently the latter was the Divine ratification of grace already received, not the effective cause or condition of the bestowal of grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To him being in a state of circumcision or in a state of uncircumcision?"
2. "A pertinent point that the average Jew had not noticed."

### John Gill:
1. "Was he justified, or his faith reckoned to him for righteousness, when he was a circumcised, or an uncircumcised person?"
2. "Circumcision could not be the cause of his justification, since it followed it."
3. "If Abraham when uncircumcised was a justified person, as it is certain he was, why may not uncircumcised Gentiles be justified also?"

### John Wesley:
1. Not in circumcision — Not after he was circumcised; for he was justified before Ishmael was born, Genesis 15:1-21; but he was not circumcised till Ishmael was thirteen years old, Genesis 17:25.
