# Romans 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Circumcision served as a sign and seal, distinguishing those who were in covenant with God. It confirmed Abraham's faith and the righteousness that came through faith. Additionally, it is important to note that the faith that justifies is not dependent on circumcision but is accessible to those who believe, even if they are not circumcised.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And he received (from God) the sign (token, or symbol) of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith"
2. "The Apostle’s point is, that the righteousness was reckoned, and the promise made, to Abraham, not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
3. "Abraham is the father of the faithful. But the triumph and recognition of that faith whereby he was constituted so, was not during his circumcision, but during his uncircumcision: therefore the faithful, his descendants, must not be confined to the circumcised, but must take in the uncircumcised also."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Circumcision is called a seal of the covenant which God had made with Abraham... he appointed this as a public attestation to the fact that he had previously approved of Abraham, and had made important promises to him." 
2. "Abraham might be held up as an example... the ancestor of all true believers; that he was their model, and example. They are regarded as his children because they are possessed of his spirit; are justified in the same way, and are imitators of his example."
3. "As the apostle had shown that Abraham enjoyed the favor of God previous to his being circumcised, that is, without circumcision; so it followed that others might on the same principle also. This instance settles the point; and there is nothing which a Jew can reply to this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sign - a seal. Sign refers to the material token; seal to its religious import."
2. "That he might be. Not so that he became, but expressing the divinely appointed aim of his receiving the sign."

### John Calvin:
1. "In order to anticipate an objection, he shows that circumcision was not unprofitable and superfluous, though it could not justify; but it had another very remarkable use, it had the office of sealing, and as it were of ratifying the righteousness of faith."
2. "We have indeed here a remarkable passage with regard to the general benefits of sacraments. According to the testimony of Paul, they are seals by which the promises of God are in a manner imprinted on our hearts, and the certainty of grace confirmed."
3. "Circumcision is expressly called 'a token,' or a sign...the design of circumcision is...a 'seal,' a confirmation, an evidence, a proof, or a pledge, 'of the righteousness' obtained 'by faith.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘sign’ was ‘circumcision,’ which is described as ‘a seal,’ etc."
2. "The righteousness of the faith which he had while in uncircumcision...circumcision...sealed the promise or covenant, and not less the righteousness reckoned to Abraham."
3. "The true idea of a sacrament is here suggested; it is a sign, seal, and means of grace, but not the grace itself. Circumcision is not the covenant; nor is baptism regeneration."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Circumcision being the sign... gave outward confirmation."
2. "Whatever parallel exists between baptism and circumcision... argues for faith before baptism and for baptism as the sign and seal of the faith already had before baptism."
3. "This idiom may be God's purpose... or even actual result... in the condition of uncircumcision."

### John Gill:
1. "Circumcision was a distinctive sign or badge, which distinguished the posterity of Abraham from other people, and was also a typical one."
2. "Circumcision was a seal, not for secrecy, but for certainty; it being a confirmation, not merely of the sincerity of Abraham's faith, but of his justifying righteousness."
3. "The apostle uses the word 'seal' concerning circumcision, it being a word his countrymen made use of when they spoke of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Circumcision, which was a sign or token of his being in covenant with God."
2. "An assurance on God's part, that he accounted him righteous, upon his believing, before he was circumcised."
3. "Who believe in uncircumcision — That is, though they are not circumcised."
