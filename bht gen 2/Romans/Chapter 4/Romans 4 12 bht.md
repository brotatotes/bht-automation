# Romans 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham is the father of the circumcision, not only of those who are physically circumcised, but also of those who walk in the footsteps of his faith. This highlights the importance of both outward sign and inward belief. Abraham is the example for those who follow him in faith, and he is not a father to those who do not believe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Marvin Vincent:
