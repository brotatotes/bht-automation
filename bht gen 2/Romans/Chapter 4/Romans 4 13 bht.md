# Romans 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith was not dependent on the law, but solely on the mercy of God. The promise made to him was not just about inheriting Canaan, but about being the heir of the world and blessing all nations. This promise is not limited to Abraham alone, but extends to all believers who possess the same faith. Just as Christ is the heir of the world, so too are Abraham's spiritual descendants. The fulfillment of this promise will come when the kingdoms of the world are given to the people of God and Christ returns to rule.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If these believers are Abraham’s seed, then his promised inheritance is theirs."
2. "But by the righteousness of faith. This specification of the promise has perplexed most of the Commentators. The actual promise... was the possession of the land of Canaan."
3. "The inheritance of the world then is not the possession of Canaan merely... but that ultimate lordship over the whole world which Abraham, as the father of the faithful in all peoples, and Christ, as the Seed of Promise, shall possess."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the promise, &c.—This is merely an enlargement of the foregoing reasoning, applying to the law what had just been said of circumcision."
2. "That he should be the heir of the world—or, that 'all the families of the earth should be blessed in him.'"
3. "Was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law—in virtue of obedience to the law. But through the righteousness of faith—in virtue of his simple faith in the divine promises."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To show that the faith of Abraham, on which his justification depended, was not by the Law, the apostle proceeds to show that the promise concerning which his faith was so remarkably evinced was before the Law was given."
2. "The precise expression used here, 'heir of the world,' is not found in the promises made to Abraham... As this latter promise is one to which the apostle particularly refers, it is probable that he had this in his eye."
3. "When the apostle calls him 'the heir of the world,' he sums up in this comprehensive expression all the promises made to Abraham, intimating that his spiritual descendants... shall yet be so numerous as to possess all lands."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul here takes the Jewish conception of the universal dominion of the Messianic theocracy prefigured by the inheritance of Canaan, divests it of its Judaistic element, and raises it to a christological truth."
2. "The idea underlies the phrases kingdom of God, kingdom of Heaven."
3. "Compare Matthew 19:28, Matthew 19:29; Luke 22:30."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if faith borrows nothing from the law in order to justify, we hence understand, that it has respect to nothing else but to the mercy of God."
2. "That he should be the heir of the world... the Apostle rightly teaches us, that the dominion of the world was promised to him."
3. "The inheritance was given him by grace through faith; it was to descend, as it were, to all his lawful posterity, to all his legitimate seed, that is, to all who possessed the like faith with himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Mosaic law was in no sense the ground or cause of the promise, for the law was not then in existence; and this fact is the ground of the position of Abraham as father of all believers, whether Gentiles or Jews."
2. "The promise is to both, as one. Here 'his seed' is not directly referred to Christ, as in Galatians 3:16, but to all believers, as the spiritual descendants of Abraham."
3. "The promise will be literally fulfilled when the kingdoms of the world are given to the people of the Most High, and Christ returns to rule."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That he should be the heir of the world... The whole chain of promises about his son, his descendants like the stars in heaven, the Messiah and the blessing to the world through him." 
2. "In these verses (Romans 4:13-17) Paul employs the keywords of his gospel (faith, promise, grace) and arrays them against the current Jewish theology (law, works, merit)."

### John Gill:
1. "to this it may be objected, that the promise here spoken of is made to Abraham's seed, as well as to himself; by which is meant not the Messiah, who is indeed heir of the world, and all things in it, but all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles"
2. "Abraham and all believers are the 'heirs' of this world, and of all things in it; 'all things' are theirs, and, among the rest, the world"
3. "this large and comprehensive promise, which takes in the things of time and eternity, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith"

### John Wesley:
1. "The promise, that he should be the heir of the world — Is the same as that he should be 'the father of all nations,' namely, of those in all nations who receive the blessing."
2. "The whole world was promised to him and them conjointly."
3. "Christ is the heir of the world, and of all things; and so are all Abraham's seed, all that believe in him with the faith of Abraham."
