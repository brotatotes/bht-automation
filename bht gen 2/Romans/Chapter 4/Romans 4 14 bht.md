# Romans 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the promise of inheritance is based on the merit of obedience to the law, then faith has no purpose and is rendered worthless. The promise becomes empty and ineffective if one's standing before God depends on adherence to the law. This highlights the absurdity of relying on works for salvation, as it nullifies the power of faith and diminishes the significance of God's promise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If they who are of the law... are inheritors... faith is made empty and the promise is annulled." 
2. "Faith is robbed of its virtue and rendered useless."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 14. For if they which are of the law
	be heirs—If the blessing is to be earned by obedience to the
	law. 
	faith is made void—the
	whole divine method is subverted.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If people are justified by the Law, they cannot be by faith, and faith would be useless in this work."
2. "All the promises of God have this design and tendency; and consequently, as God has given many promises, the object is to call forth the lively and constant faith of people, all going to show that in the divine estimation, faith is of inestimable value."
3. "If people seek to be justified by their morality or their forms of religion, they cannot depend on any promise of God; for he has made no promise to any such attempt."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if this condition had been interposed — that God would favor those only with adoption who deserved, or who performed the law, no one could have dared to feel confident that it belonged to him."
2. "Void then would faith be made; for an impossible condition would not only hold the minds of men in suspense and anxiety, but fill them also with fear and trembling: and thus the fulfillment of the promises would be rendered void."
3. "The Apostle teaches us, that faith perishes, except the soul rests on the goodness of God. Faith then is not a naked knowledge either of God or of his truth; nor is it a simple persuasion that God is, that his word is the truth; but a sure knowledge of God’s mercy, which is received from the gospel, and brings peace of conscience with regard to God, and rest to the mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The proof of Romans 4:13 is now given (Romans 4:14-17), from the nature of the law, and the consequent necessity of faith as the ground of inheritance."
2. "Those who belong to the law are of that party whose religious life springs from the law, and who are legalists in character."
3. "Faith is made void, is made empty and continues so, there is no use of it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If legalists are heirs of the Messianic promise to Abraham, the faith is emptied of all meaning and the promise to Abraham is made permanently idle."


### John Gill:
1. "For if the right to the inheritance is by the works of the law, there is no room for faith; that can be of no use or service."
2. "If salvation is by works, it is to no purpose for God to promise, or men to believe; for the thing promised depends not upon God's promise, but upon man's obedience to the law."
3. "The apostle here argues from the absurdities which follow upon the doctrine of justification by works, as he does from the different effects of the law, in the following verse."

### John Wesley:
1. "If they only who are of the law — Who have kept the whole law. Are heirs, faith is made void."
2. "No blessing being to be obtained by it; and so the promise is of no effect."
