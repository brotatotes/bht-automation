# Romans 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law of God condemns sinners and leads to divine wrath, rather than justifying them or bringing peace. Its purpose is not to deny the existence of God's law written in the heart, but to show that inheritance promises cannot be obtained through the law. The law reveals transgression and makes it known to those who break it, thereby generating condemnation and punishment. Without a law, there is no transgression and no wrath, but where the law exists, transgression, wrath, and punishment are present.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of the Apostle here is not to deny the existence of the law of God written in the heart before Moses, but to show that no promise of inheritance can be by the law."
2. "The property of the law is, the more it is promulgated, to reveal transgression more, not to unfold grace."
3. "This reasoning does not touch the doctrine of the original taint of our nature in Adam, only referring to the discrimination of acts, words, and thoughts by the conscience in the light of the law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law worketh wrath—has nothing to give to those who break is but condemnation and vengeance." 
2. "For where there is no law, there is no transgression—it is just the law that makes transgression, in the case of those who break it; nor can the one exist without the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "While man is fallen, and a sinner, its tendency, so far from justifying him, and producing peace, is just the reverse."
2. "The Law of God, demanding perfect purity, and denouncing every sin condemns the sinner, and consigns him to punishment."
3. "Law is a rule of conduct...If there is no command to pursue a certain course, no injunction to forbid certain conduct, actions will be innocent."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the law causeth wrath, etc. This is a confirmation of the last verse, derived from the contrary effect of the law; for as the law generates nothing but vengeance, it cannot bring grace."
2. "By wrath, understand God’s judgment, which meaning it has everywhere."
3. "Where there is no law, there is no transgression, and therefore no wrath or punishment; but where law is, there is transgression, wrath, and punishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law does, indeed, stir up the wrath of man against God, as is set forth in chap. Romans 7:5, etc., but the train of thought in that chapter is distinct from that found here."
2. "Where there is a law, there is transgression of it, thus producing a more pronounced form of sin, upon which God’s wrath is visited; thus the law ‘works wrath.’"
3. "Sins without positive law...are likewise, and, indeed, on account of the natural law, objects of the divine wrath."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The law is so far from justifying sinners, that it curses and condemns them."
2. "When [the law] comes into the heart and is let into the conscience of a sinner, it fills with terrible apprehensions of the wrath of God."
3. "The law is come, and there is a law by which is the knowledge of sin, and therefore no man can be justified by it; since that convinces him of sin, and fills him with a sense of divine wrath on account of it."
