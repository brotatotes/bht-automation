# Romans 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage emphasizes that salvation is received by faith, not by our own efforts, in order to demonstrate that it is a result of God's grace. This points to the assurance and certainty of the promise, which is not dependent on our merits but solely on God's unearned favor. By including all who share in Abraham's faith, the promise becomes firm and reliable for all believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was by faith that the inheritance (not the promise) was according to grace, in order that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is of the faith of Abraham."
2. "The part of the seed which is of the law here is of course confined to believing Jews; the seed being believers only."
3. "By the last declaration, the paternity of Abraham, which is co-extensive with the inheritance, has been extended to all who are of his faith; here therefore it is reasserted: 'our father Abraham, who is the father of all believers.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Justification is by faith, in order that its purely gracious character may be seen." 
2. "All who follow in the steps of Abraham's faith...may be assured of the like justification with the parent believer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is of faith - Justification is by faith; or the plan which God has devised of saving people is by faith."
2. "If people were justified by law, it would be by their own merits; now it is of mere unmerited favor."
3. "To all the seed - Romans 4:13. Not to that only - Not to that part of his descendants alone who were Jews, or who had the Law. But to that ... - To all who should possess the same faith as Abraham. The father of us all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sure [Œ≤ŒµŒ≤Œ±ŒπŒ±ŒΩ] . Stable, valid, something realized, the opposite of made of none effect, ver. 14.

### John Calvin:
1. "If the heirship of salvation comes to us by works, then faith in it vanishes, the promise of it is abolished; but it is necessary that both these should be sure and certain; hence it comes to us by faith, so that its stability being based on the goodness of God alone, may be secured."
2. "Here, in the first place, the Apostle shows, that nothing is set before faith but mere grace; and this, as they commonly say, is its object: for were it to look on merits, absurdly would Paul infer, that whatever it obtains for us is gratuitous."
3. "Hence, also, we may easily learn, that grace is not to be taken, as some imagine, for the gift of regeneration, but for a gratuitous favor: for as regeneration is never perfect, it can never suffice to pacify souls, nor of itself can it make the promise certain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is of faith. What? Not the promise, but the inheritance, in view of the contrast in Romans 4:14." 
2. "As the law, bringing the knowledge of guilt, works wrath, so the promise awakening faith, manifests God‚Äôs free grace, the end for which it was given."
3. "That the promise may be (the present is preferable here also). This is the purpose of God in making men heirs by the way of grace; His free unmerited favor thus makes the promise sure to all the seed..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of faith (ŒµŒ∫ œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ). As the source."
2. "According to grace (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œáŒ±œÅŒπŒΩ). As the pattern."
3. "Sure (Œ≤ŒµŒ≤Œ±ŒπŒ±ŒΩ). Stable, fast, firm. Old adjective from Œ≤Œ±ŒπŒΩœâ, to walk."

### John Gill:
1. "It is of faith that it might be by grace, appear to be of the free grace and favour of God, as each of these blessings are."
2. "Every blessing is received by faith, it is manifest it must be by grace; since faith itself is a gift of God's grace, and lies purely in receiving favours at the hand of God."
3. "The promise of the above blessings... becomes sure to all believers, to all Abraham's spiritual seed."

### John Wesley:
1. "The blessing is of faith, that it might be of grace."
2. "That it might appear to flow from the free love of God."
3. "The promise might be firm, sure, and effectual, to all the spiritual seed of Abraham."
