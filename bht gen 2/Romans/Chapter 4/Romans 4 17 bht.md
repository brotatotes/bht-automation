# Romans 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham, the father of many nations, was called by God even before he physically became a father. This promise extended beyond his natural descendants to include all who would believe in God, regardless of their heritage. God's ability to bring life to the dead and to call things into existence that do not yet exist was evident in His interaction with Abraham. While it may have seemed impossible to human eyes, God saw the future and spoke of it as though it had already happened, instilling faith in His promises.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Abraham was the father of us all, though not physically, nor in actuality, seeing that we were not as yet, yet in the sight and estimation of God, in his relation with God, with whom no obstacles of nature or time have force."
2. "Who quickens the dead, a general description of God’s almighty creative power, applied particularly to the matter in hand the deadness of generative physical power in Abraham himself, which was quickened by God."
3. "Who calleth (nameth, speaketh of) the things that are not, as being (as if they were). This He did in the present case with regard to the seed of Abraham, which did not as yet exist."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus Abraham, in the reckoning of Him whom he believed, is the father of us all, in order that all may be assured, that doing as he did, they shall be treated as he was."
2. "The nature and greatness of that faith of Abraham which we are to copy is here strikingly described. What he was required to believe being above nature, his faith had to fasten upon God's power to surmount physical incapacity, and call into being what did not then exist."
3. "But God having made the promise, Abraham believed Him in spite of those obstacles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "[God] spoke of a thing as already done, which he had promised or purposed to do."
2. "The apostle evidently understands this promise as referring, not to [Abraham's] natural descendants only, but to the great multitude who should believe as he did."
3. "The giving of this promise, and its fulfillment, were such as strongly to remind us that God has power to give life to the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Originally his name was Abram, exalted father; afterward Abraham, father of a multitude." 
2. "The verb shows that the paternity was the result of a special arrangement. It would not be used to denote the mere physical connection between father and son." 
3. "The seed of Abraham 'which were at present in the category of things which were not, and the nations which should spring physically or spiritually from him, God spoke of as having an existence, which word Abraham believed."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then who denies them to be capable of grace, does wrong to Abraham, whose faith was sustained by this thought, — that it matters not whether he was dead or not who is called by the Lord."
2. "That we may indeed on the other hand be in a suitable state to hear the call of God, we must be altogether dead in ourselves."
3. "The character of the divine calling is, that they who are dead are raised by the Lord, that they who are nothing begin to be something through his power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise was of a spiritual seed from many nations."
2. "God treats non-existent things as existent."
3. "The phrase suggests the numerous seed of Abraham, in regard to which God had decreed and spoken while they were nonexistent, except in His purpose."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A father of many nations. Quotation from Genesis 17:5. Only true in the sense of spiritual children as already explained, father of believers in God."
2. "Before him whom he believed even God. Incorporation of antecedent into the relative clause and attraction of the relative ω into ου. See Mark 11:2 for κατεναντ, 'right in front of.'"
3. "Calleth the things that are not as though they were. 'Summons the non-existing as existing.' Abraham's body was old and decrepit. God rejuvenated him and Sarah (Hebrews 11:19)."

### John Gill:
1. "The passage referred to, is in Genesis 17:4; which proves him to be a father not of the Jews only, since they cannot be called 'many nations', but of the Gentiles also."
2. "Abraham was the father of them, before him whom he believed, [even] God; that is, he was so, either in the sight of God, who sees not as man sees; in his account, he was the father of many nations, long before he really in fact was."
3. "The consideration of which is sufficient to engage faith in the promises of God, and a dependence on him for the fulfilment of them: and who stands further described as he, who calleth those things which be not, as though they were."

### John Wesley:
1. "Before God — Though before men nothing of this appeared, those nations being then unborn."
2. "The dead are not dead to him and even the things that are not, are before God."
3. "Summoning them to rise into being, and appear before him. The seed of Abraham did not then exist; yet God said, 'So shall thy seed be.'"
