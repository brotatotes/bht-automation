# Romans 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith went against all rational grounds of hope, as there was nothing to hope for based on what he saw. However, he believed in the promise of God, trusting that he would become the father of many nations. His faith was not based on what was visible, but rather on the word of God. By believing in the supernatural aid of God's promise, Abraham demonstrated a faith that surpassed human understanding.

"Faith, as it lays hold on God's promise of free acceptance and forgiveness, can alone, in the very nature of things, be imputed for righteousness: it is not indispensably necessary that the way, or medium, or the meritorious cause of acceptance and forgiveness, should be clearly known and distinctly seen; the gracious promise of God is enough, so that faith may become a justifying faith."
