# Romans 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith was strong and unwavering, despite the unfavorable circumstances and physical obstacles that could have discouraged him. He considered all the challenges, but his faith remained unaffected. He did not let the fact that his body was unable to bear children hinder his belief in God's promise. He confidently entrusted himself to God, disregarding the doubts and difficulties that could have undermined his faith. Instead, he focused on the strength of God and the certainty of His promises.

1. "Of these, the second agrees the better with εἰς δὲ τὴν ἐπ . Romans 4:20 , but the first very much better suits the context; the object being, to extol Abraham’s faith, not to introduce the new and somewhat vapid notice of his being well aware of those facts of which it may be assumed as a matter of course that he could not be ignorant."
2. "The Apostle does not want to prove that Abraham was in his sound senses when he believed the promise, but that he was so strong in faith as to be able to overleap all difficulties in its way."
3. "Abraham did indeed feel and express the difficulty (Gen 17:17), but his faith overcame it, and he ceased to regard it. But most probably Paul here refers only to Genesis 15:5-6, where his belief was implicit and unquestioning."

### Philip Schaff:
