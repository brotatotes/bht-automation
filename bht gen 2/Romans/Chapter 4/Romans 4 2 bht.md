# Romans 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's justification could not have been based on his own merits or works, as he would then have had reason to boast. The Scriptures themselves affirm that Abraham's righteousness was attained through his unwavering belief and trust in God. This proves that it was not mere faith alone, but faith in Christ Jesus that justifies believers. Therefore, it is clear that Abraham had no grounds for boasting before God but found his righteousness solely in his faith and trust in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if Abraham was justified... by works, he hath matter of boasting... Then, in disproof of this, that Abraham has matter of boasting... one thing at least is clear, that he has none before God." 
2. "This we can prove... for what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God... and it was reckoned to him as righteousness."
3. "But though the same righteousness is imputed to us who believe, and by means of faith also, it is no longer the mere fact of believing implicitly in God's truth, but the reception of Christ Jesus the Lord by faith, which justifies us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If works were the ground of Abraham's justification, he would have matter for boasting; but as it is perfectly certain that he hath none in the sight of God, it follows that Abraham could not have been justified by works."
2. "And to this agree the words of Scripture."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If Abraham was justified on the ground of his own merits, he would have reason to boast, or to claim praise."
2. "To show this, the apostle appeals at once to the Scriptures, to show that there was no such record as that Abraham could boast that he was justified by his works."
3. "If Abraham was justified by his works, he might boast of his own merits. But he has no ground of boasting before God. Therefore he was not justified by works."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls that glorying when we pretend to have anything of our own to which a reward is supposed to be due at God’s tribunal."
2. "Since he takes this away from Abraham, who of us can claim for himself the least particle of merit?"
3. "That πρὸς θεόν is used in a similar manner, is evident from other passages: τα πρὸς θεόν — 'things which pertain to God,' i.e., to God’s work or service."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For if Abraham was justified by works. Notice that even in their view, justification was a matter where God’s verdict was concerned."
2. "If Abraham, as the Jews suppose, was justified by works, he has reason to glory toward God (for he could claim justification from God as 'of debt'), but he has no ground of glorying toward God, for the Scripture says he was justified by faith."
3. "Some commentators take the clause: 'but not toward God,' as implying that his justification by faith gives him a ground of glorying toward God, but the supposed justification by works would give him only a ground of glorying toward men, God having nothing to do with it except to acknowledge it as justly earned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The rabbis had a doctrine of the merits of Abraham who had a superfluity of credits to pass on to the Jews." 
2. "Abraham deserved all the respect from men that came to him, but his relation to God was a different matter."
3. "He had there no ground of boasting at all."

### John Gill:
1. "That Abraham was not and could not be justified by works is clear from hence, that if this was his case, he hath whereof to glory; which will be allowed him before men, on account of his pious life and conversation: but not before God."
2. "Glorying before God in a man's own works is contrary to the scheme and method of God's grace, is excluded by the doctrine of faith; nor is there any place for glorying before God but in Christ, and his righteousness."
3. "To this it may be replied that the two apostles, Paul and James, are not speaking of the same thing: Paul speaks of justification before God, James of justification before men; Paul speaks of the justification of the person, James of the justification of a man's cause, as the truth of his faith, or the uprightness of his conduct."

### John Wesley:
1. The meaning is, If Abraham had been justified by works, he would have had room to glory. But he had not room to glory. Therefore he was not justified by works.
