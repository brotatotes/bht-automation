# Romans 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith was deemed righteous not because of its strength or assurance, but because it was grounded in God's promise and reliant on His power and faithfulness. While the righteousness of faith is not imputed to nominal believers, it is extended to all who possess true faith, even if it may be weak. For faith, in its nature, kind, and object, is the same in all genuine believers, and thus the same righteousness is imputed to each one.

### John Calvin:

2. "This connection of faith with the word ought to be well understood and carefully remembered; for faith can bring us nothing more than what it receives from the word."
