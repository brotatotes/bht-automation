# Romans 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith serves as both a personal testimony and a universal lesson for believers. It is through faith, like his, that righteousness is imputed. The examples recorded in Scripture are not mere historical facts, but sources for profit and sound doctrine. By applying the case of Abraham to gospel believers, Paul establishes God's universal lordship and the establishment of the law through faith. These reminders of our duty and examples of faith should be used to draw sound instruction for our lives.
