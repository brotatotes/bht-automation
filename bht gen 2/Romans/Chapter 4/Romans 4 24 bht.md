# Romans 4:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Resurrection of Jesus holds utmost importance in Paul's gospel, signifying God's power over death and revealing that justification comes through faith, not works. Just as Abraham's belief in God's promise was credited to him as righteousness, we too are justified by our faith in God. The Resurrection serves as a testament to God's omnipotence and grace, and by placing our trust in Him, we receive the imputed righteousness that comes through Christ. The Old Testament scriptures, including the stories of Abraham and David, further exemplify the significance of faith in our justification.

1. "Belief in the resurrection of Jesus is an essential aspect of faith. It goes beyond mere intellectual acceptance and requires an active trust in God's power to bring forth life from death."

3. "The imputation of righteousness is not based on our own works but on our faith in God's power to raise Jesus from the dead. It is a declaration of righteousness that comes from placing our trust in Him who has the authority to conquer death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is recorded for our encouragement and imitation, to show that we may in a similar manner be accepted and saved."
2. "Abraham showed his faith in God by believing just what God revealed to him."
3. "The main or leading truths that God has made known to us are, that he has given his Son to die; that he has raised him up; and that through him he is ready to pardon."

2. "For it is the ground of our hope as to eternal life."
3. "When Christ comes forth and presents to us in his own resurrection a sure pledge of life, it then appears evident from what fountain the imputation of righteousness flows."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The design was not merely to show how Abraham was justified, but also to show how we should be justified."
2. "The justification of each believer is a single act, but that of believers as a whole is continuous."
3. "The birth of Isaac was a proof of God‚Äôs omnipotence, but Christ‚Äôs resurrection is a still higher proof, both of this omnipotence, and, at the same time, of Divine grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fact of the Resurrection of Jesus is central in Paul's gospel." (Commentary)


### John Gill:
1. "What was written in the books of the Old Testament, was not written merely on account of them who are the subjects thereof, but for the use, learning, instruction and profit of saints under the New Testament dispensation."

3. "The faith of New Testament believers is described as believing in 'God that quickeneth the dead' and believing on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "To establish us in seeking justification by faith, and not by works; and to afford a full answer to those who say that, 'to be justified by works means only, by Judaism; to be justified by faith means, by embracing Christianity, that is, the system of doctrines so called.'"
2. "Sure it is that Abraham could not in this sense be justified either by faith or by works; and equally sure that David (taking the words thus) was justified by works, and not by faith."
3. "God the Father therefore is the proper object of justifying faith."
