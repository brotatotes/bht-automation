# Romans 4:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Resurrection plays a pivotal role in Paul's gospel, emphasizing the importance of justification through faith rather than works. Abraham's faith serves as an example, with the imputation of righteousness applying to those who believe in a similar way. The Old Testament scriptures hold valuable lessons for believers in the New Testament era, redirecting their focus to having faith in God as the object of their justification. The acknowledgement of faith in the resurrected Jesus carries significant weight, particularly for the Jewish community.
