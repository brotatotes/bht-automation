# Romans 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ was delivered up to death as an atonement for our sins, and He was raised up for our justification. His death served to make amends for our offenses, while His resurrection secured our acceptance and justification before God. These two events are intricately connected, as they demonstrate the completeness and efficacy of Christ's work on our behalf. Through His sacrifice and triumph over death, we are granted the assurance of our acquittal and acceptance by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord was delivered up (to death) for or on account of our sins (i.e. because we had sinned): He was also raised up (from the dead) for or on account of our justification (i.e. not because we had been, but that we might be justified)."
2. "The great complex event by which our justification (death unto sin and new birth unto righteousness) has been made possible, may be stated in one word as the GLORIFICATION of Christ."
3. "So that, though these great events have their separate propriety of reference to the negative and positive sides of our justification, the one of them cannot be treated separately and exclusively of the other, any more than can the negative side of our justification, the non-imputation of our sin, without the positive, the imputation of God‚Äôs righteousness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As His resurrection was the divine assurance that He had 'put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself,' and the crowning of His whole work, our justification is fitly connected with that glorious act."
2. "The sacraments of the Church were never intended, and are not adapted, to confer grace, or the blessings of salvation, upon men. Their proper use is to set a divine seal upon a state already existing, and so, they presuppose, and do not create it."
3. "Justification, in this argument, cannot be taken‚Äîas Romanists and other errorists insist‚Äîto mean a change upon men's character... Beyond all doubt it means exclusively a change upon men's state or relation to God; or, in scientific language, it is an objective, not a subjective change‚Äîa change from guilt and condemnation to acquittal and acceptance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was delivered up to death in order to make expiation for our sins."
2. "His resurrection was a proof that his work was accepted by the Father. Our justification, therefore, became sure."
3. "The fact that he was raised becomes the ground of hope that we shall be raised and accepted of God. The fact that he was raised, and that all who love him shall be raised also, becomes one of the most efficient motives to us to seek to be justified and saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Raised again for our justification."
2. "But if the whole matter of the justification depends on what He has suffered for our offenses, we shall as certainly be justified or have our account made even, if He does not rise, as if He does."
3. "Doubtless the rising has an immense significance, when the justification is conceived to be the renewing of our moral nature in righteousness; for it is only by the rising that His incarnate life and glory are fully discovered, and the righteousness of God declared in His person in its true moral power."

### John Calvin:
1. "But the meaning is, that when we possess the benefit of Christ‚Äôs death and resurrection, there is nothing wanting to the completion of perfect righteousness."
2. "For if justification means renovation, then that he died for our sins must be taken in the same sense, as signifying that he acquired for us grace to mortify the flesh; which no one admits."
3. "He therefore still speaks of imputative justification; and this will be confirmed by what immediately follows in the next chapter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‚Äòjustification‚Äô points to the act, though the state (of being justified) which results may be implied."
2. "Without the resurrection, Christ‚Äôs grave would be the grave of all our hopes."
3. "The sinner cannot be buried with Christ, without rising with Him as a new creature; the death with Christ is inseparable from the new life in Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first clause is from Isaiah 53:12, and the first Œ¥ŒπŒ± with œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄœÑœâŒºŒ±œÑŒ± is probably retrospective, though it will make sense as prospective (to make atonement for our transgressions)."
2. "The second Œ¥ŒπŒ± is quite clearly prospective with a view to our justification."
3. "Paul does not mean to separate the resurrection from the death of Christ in the work of atonement, but simply to show that the resurrection is at one with the death on the Cross in proof of Christ's claims."

### John Gill:
1. "He was delivered to death...for the offenses of all God's elect."
2. "The nature and end of Christ's death may be learned from hence...in the room and stead of his people."
3. "Christ's resurrection did not procure the justification of his people...but was for the testification of it...and for the application of it."

### John Wesley:
1. Who was delivered ‚Äî To death.For our offences ‚Äî As an atonement for them.And raised for our justification ‚Äî To empower us to receive that atonement by faith.
