# Romans 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith was not in his own riches or righteousness, but in God Himself - the Son of God, the Word of the Lord, the promised Messiah. It was his trust in God's promise of numerous descendants that he believed, and this act of faith was counted to him as righteousness. This does not mean that Abraham imputed righteousness to God, but rather God reckoned him as righteous. Thus, Abraham's faith in the promised seed and the righteousness of the Messiah was what made him righteous in the eyes of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it—his faith, was counted to him for righteousness." (Genesis 15:6). 
2. "The meaning, therefore, cannot possibly be that the mere act of believing was counted to Abraham for all obedience. The meaning plainly is that Abraham believed in the promises which embraced Christ, as we believe in Christ Himself, and in both cases, faith is merely the instrument that puts us in possession of the blessing gratuitously bestowed."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The faith which Abraham exercised was, that his posterity should be like the stars of heaven in number."
2. "The reason why it was counted to him for righteousness was, that it was such a strong, direct, and unwavering act of confidence in the promise of God."
3. "While the word 'faith' is sometimes used to denote religious doctrine, or the system that is to be believed, when it is used to denote that which is required of people, it always denotes an acting of the mind exercised in relation to some object, or some promise, or threatening, or declaration of some other being."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Scripture [η γραφη] . The scripture passage."
2. "It was counted for righteousness [ελογισθη εις δικαιοσυνην] ."
3. "The phrases ejlogisqh eijv and ejl. wJv are thus shown to be substantially equivalent."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if Abraham was justified, because he embraced, by faith, the bountiful mercy of God, it follows, that he had nothing to glory in; for he brought nothing of his own, except a confession of his misery, which is a solicitation for mercy."
2. "But they are in this mistaken; first, because they have not considered that believing extends to the whole context, and ought not to be confined to one clause."
3. "There is some difference in the wording, though not in the meaning, of the sentence from Genesis 15:6. Paul gives it literally according to the Septuagint."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The New Testament citations all follow the LXX: And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness." 
2. "The word we translate 'reckon' occurs eleven times in this chapter, and is represented in the E. V. by 'count,' 'reckon,' 'impute;' elsewhere in this Epistle by 'account'." 
3. "How far Abraham, in thus believing, had faith in a Messiah, we cannot tell. In any case, his faith was not a purely subjective matter; it rested upon God, real and revealed, as its object, and the contents of his faith would correspond with the extent of the revelation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was reckoned unto him for righteousness." 
2. "What was set down? His believing God."

### John Gill:
1. "The object of his faith and trust were not his riches, nor his righteousness, but Jehovah, the Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, styled in Genesis 15:1, 'the Word of the Lord', the essential Word of God, and called his 'shield', and 'exceeding great reward'; characters which are very applicable to Christ."
2. "It was counted to him for righteousness, the meaning of which is not, that Abraham imputed righteousness to God...but that God reckoned him righteous, or imputed it to him for righteousness."
3. "It remains then that it was the promised seed, the Messiah, and his righteousness, which Abraham, by faith, looked unto, and believed in, that was made unto him righteousness by imputation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Abraham believed God - That promise of God concerning the numerousness of his seed." 
2. "God accepted him as if he had been altogether righteous."
