# Romans 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The workman mentioned in this passage represents the legal method of achieving salvation through one's own efforts. Unlike grace, which is based on favor, this method operates under a system of debt and restitution. In this context, it becomes clear that righteousness cannot be earned through works, but is instead freely bestowed upon believers. Therefore, justification is not a matter of merit, but of humble acceptance and reliance on the goodness of God. This truth applies not only to Abraham, but to all believers who seek righteousness through faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "to the workman (him that works for hire, that earns wages, compare προσηργάσατο, Luk 19:16) his wages are not reckoned according to (as a matter of) grace (favour), but according to (as a matter of) debt." 
2. "The stress is on κατὰ χάριν, not on λογίζεται, which in this first member of the sentence, is used hardly in the strict sense, of imputing or reckoning, but of allotting or apportioning: its use being occasioned by the stricter λογίζεται below."
3. "And the sentence is a general one, not with any peculiar reference to Abraham, except that after κατὰ χάριν we may supply ὡς τῷ Ἀβραάμ, if we will; for this is evidently assumed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 4, 5. Now to him that worketh—as
	a servant for wages. 
	is the reward not reckoned of
	grace—as a matter of favor. 
	but of debt—as a matter
	of right.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It expresses a general truth in regard to works."
2. "On that plan, if a man were justified by his works, it would be a matter due to him."
3. "The reward - The pay, or wages."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not grace but debt is the regulative standard according to which his compensation is awarded."
2. "The workman for hire represents the legal method of salvation; he who does not work for hire, the gospel method."
3. "Grace is out of the question when wages is in question."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not he, whom he calls a worker, who is given to good works, to which all the children of God ought to attend, but the person who seeks to merit something by his works."
2. "He argues from what is contrary, — that God confers not righteousness on us because it is due, but bestows it as a gift."
3. "Faith is counted for righteousness, not that it procures any merit for us, but because it lays hold on the goodness of God: hence righteousness is not due to us, but freely bestowed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A workman whose business it is to labor for hire represents the legal method, the plan of making one's own moral character and doings the basis of acceptance with God."
2. "Not reckoned; this takes up the verb from Romans 4:3, but without emphasizing it."
3. "Of grace, but of debt; not according to, as a matter of favor, but of debt. That Abraham's case was 'of grace' is so heavily implied, that it was not necessary to express it, especially as the thought is now quite general."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  But as of debt  (αλλα κατα οφειλημα). An illustration of the workman (εργαζομενω) who gets his wages due him, "not as of grace" (ου κατα χαριν). 

### John Gill:
1. "The worker here is one that works upon nature's principles, and with selfish views; one that works in the strength of nature, trusting to, and glorying in what he does; seeking righteousness by his work, and working for eternal life and salvation."
2. "There is no reward due to the creature's work, though ever so perfect, arising from any desert or dignity in itself."
3. "It remains therefore, that if it is reckoned for his works, it must be of debt: it must be his due, as wages are to a hireling."

### John Wesley:
1. "All that the law requires, the reward is no favour, but an absolute debt."
2. "If then neither of these was justified by his own obedience, if they both obtained acceptance with God, not as upright beings who might claim it, but as sinful creatures who must implore it, the consequence is glaring."
3. "It is such as must strike every attentive understanding, and must affect every individual person."
