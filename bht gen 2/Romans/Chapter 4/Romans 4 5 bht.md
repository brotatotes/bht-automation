# Romans 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be justified, one must not rely on works or merit. Instead, they must believe in God, who justifies the ungodly by reckoning their faith as righteousness. Faith is not a substitute for righteousness, but it obtains the favor of God. Through faith, we seek the righteousness of another, recognizing our ungodliness. God imputes the righteousness of His Son to us, accepting the germ of faith as containing the fruit of righteousness. This truth of justification by faith alone underscores the grace of God, who pardons the guilty and remains just in His actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But to him who works not, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness."
2. "á¼€ÏƒÎ­Î²ÎµÎ¹Î± is the state of all men by nature."
3. "His faith is reckoned as righteousness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To him that worketh notâ€”who, despairing of acceptance with God by 'working' for it the work of obedience, does not attempt it."
2. "But believeth on him that justifieth the ungodlyâ€”casts himself upon the mercy of Him that justifieth those who deserve only condemnation."
3. "Second: David sings of the same justification."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But to him that worketh not - Who does not rely on his conformity to the Law for his justification; who does not depend on his works; who seeks to be justified in some other way."
2. "That justifieth the ungodly - This is a very important expression. It implies, (1) That people are sinners, or are ungodly. (2) That God regards them as such when they are justified."
3. "He regards them as united by faith to the Lord Jesus; and in this relation he judges that they should be treated as his friends, though they have been, are, and always will be, personally undeserving."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The preposition eijv has the force of as, not the telic meaning with a view to, or in order that he may be (righteous); nor strictly, in the place of righteousness. Faith is not a substitute for righteousness, since righteousness is involved in faith." 
2. "When a man is reckoned righteous through faith, it is not a legal fiction. He is not indeed a perfect man, but God does not reckon something which has no real existence."
3. "God recognizes no true life apart from holiness, and 'he that believeth on the Son hath life.' He is not merely regarded in the law's eye as living. God accepts the germ, not in place of the fruit, but as containing the fruit."

### John Calvin:
1. "He indeed clearly shews that faith brings us righteousness, not because it is a meritorious act, but because it obtains for us the favor of God."
2. "No one will seek the righteousness of faith except he who feels that he is ungodly; for this sentence is to be applied to what is said in this passage, â€” that faith adorns us with the righteousness of another, which it seeks as a gift from God."
3. "If by faith, then faith itself is not that righteousness...This, in fact, were just animating with a legal spirit the whole phraseology and doctrine of the gospel. It is God who justifies. He drew up the title-deed, and he bestowed the title-deed. It is ours simply to lay hold of it...Any other view of faith than that which excludes boasting must be altogether unscriptural."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But to him that worketh not; to one who does not work for hire."
2. "Believeth on him. The idea of trustfully resting on is suggested by the original."
3. "The ungodly; the ungodly individual, the original is in the singular. The word is chosen to present a strong contrast of â€˜justifying,â€™ one who is alienated from God is yet accounted righteous by God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The man is taken as he is and pardoned."
2. "The whole Pauline gospel could be summed up in this one word-- God who justifies the ungodly."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the believer does not work at all, but not from such principles, and with such views as the other."
2. "He does not work in order to obtain life and salvation; he does not seek for justification by his doings."
3. "He imputes the righteousness of another, even that of his own Son, unto them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Therefore God's affirming of Abraham, that faith was imputed to him for righteousness, plainly shows that he worked not; or, in other words, that he was not justified by works, but by faith only." 
2. "For the sinner, being first convinced of his sin and danger by the Spirit of God, stands trembling before the awful tribunal of divine justice; and has nothing to plead, but his own guilt, and the merits of a Mediator." 
3. "Thus God justifies the ungodly, and yet remains just, and true to all his attributes!"
