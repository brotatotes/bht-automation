# Romans 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
David's description of the blessedness of the man who is forgiven and treated as righteous is a fitting continuation of Abraham's example. This righteousness, which is imputed to believers without any works on their part, is not a result of the law but the righteousness of Christ. It is important to note that this righteousness is received through faith alone, without any consideration given to previous good works.

2. "To the same purpose is the negative clause, — that God justifies men by not imputing sin: and by these words we are taught that righteousness, according to Paul, is nothing else than the remission of sins..."

1. "The quotation is of forgiveness, of not being reckoned a sinner; but the Apostle takes this as equivalent to the Lord reckoneth righteousness."
2. "It is implied by Paul, that the remission of sin is equivalent to the imputation of righteousness, that there is no negative state of innocence, none intermediate between acceptance for righteousness, and rejection for sin."
