# Romans 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. The expression conveys the idea of sin being covered by divine mercy until the work of Christ is complete. It refers to the future judgment, where those who have received true forgiveness of sins will be regarded as blameless. Through the imputation of righteousness, they will stand before God without fault and be remembered no more for their transgressions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression is an O. T. one, regarding sin as lying covered by the divine long-suffering till the completion of the work of Christ."
2. "[The future tense] must be referred to the great final judgment."
3. "Real forgiveness of sins was imparted to the ancient believers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who shall not be reckoned or regarded as guilty."
2. "It is to pardon sin, and to treat with favor; not to reckon or charge a man’s sin to him; but to treat him, though personally undeserving and ungodly, as though the sin had not been committed."
3. "The word 'impute' here is used in its natural and appropriate sense, as denoting to charge on man what properly belongs to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Will not reckon sin." - The negation is very strong, 'will in no wise reckon.' This may refer to the final judgment, but more probably points to the method of entire forgiveness (future to David's eye) revealed in the gospel.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The best MSS. read ου like the LXX and so Westcott and Hort, 'whose sin.'" 
2. "Will not reckon (ου μη λογισητα). Strong negation by double negative and aorist middle subjunctive."

### John Gill:
1. "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin."
2. "They now appear before the throne without fault, and are blameless and irreproachable in the sight of God."
3. "He will never think of their sins any more to their hurt; he will remember them no more."
