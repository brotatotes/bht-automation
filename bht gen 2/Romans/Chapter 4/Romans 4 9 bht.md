# Romans 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Is this happiness only for a select few? Does it extend to the Gentiles, the uncircumcised? Yes, indeed, they too can partake in this blessedness. Through faith, just as Abraham experienced, we too can have righteousness imputed to us. This is consistent with our justification, as by believing in Jesus, our sins are forgiven and we are accepted by God. It is remarkable to see how forgiveness and righteousness are intimately connected in this passage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The form of the question, with ἢ καί , presupposes an affirmative answer to the latter clause."
2. "The stress is on τῷ Ἀβραάμ, not on ἡ πίστις: for we say that TO ABRAHAM faith was reckoned for righteousness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Say not, All this is spoken of the circumcised, and is therefore no evidence of God's general way of justifying men."
2. "Abraham's justification took place long before he was circumcised, and so could have no dependence upon that rite."
3. "'The sign of circumcision' was given to Abraham as 'a seal' (or token) of the (justifying) righteousness which he had before he was circumcised; in order that he might stand forth to every age as the parent believer—the model man of justification by faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the father of the Jewish nation was so justified, and reckoned as a friend of God, without being circumcised, that is, in the condition in which the pagan world then was, then it would follow that the Gentiles might be justified in a similar way now."
2. "This blessedness - This happy state or condition. This state of being justified by God, and of being regarded as his friends. This is the sum of all blessedness; the only state that can be truly pronounced happy."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must ever bear in mind, that circumcision is here mentioned as the initial work, so to speak, of the righteousness of the law."
2. "The Jews gloried not in it as the symbol of God’s favor, but as a meritorious observance of the law: and on this account it was that they regarded themselves better than others."
3. "You see that the argument rests on the order of causes and effects; for the cause is always before its effect; and righteousness was possessed by Abraham before he had circumcision."

### John Wesley:
