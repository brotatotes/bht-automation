# Romans 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As sure as our reconciliation to God by the death of His Son, we can have confidence that we will be sanctified and glorified through His life. The unchanging love of God is evident in the fact that He took the initiative to reconcile with us, and He continues to intercede for us in heaven. This assurance of salvation is based on the work of Christ, who not only accomplished our reconciliation on the cross, but also continues to advocate for us in His exalted position.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by means of the death of His Son..."
2. "Much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by means of His Life."
3. "Both these, the objective reception into God’s favour by the death of Christ, and the subjective appropriation, by faith, of that reception, are included."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If that part of the Saviour's work which cost Him His blood, and which had to be wrought for persons incapable of the least sympathy either with His love or His labors in their behalf...is already completed; how much more will He do all that remains to be done..." 
2. "He has it to do, not by death agonies any more, but in untroubled 'life,' and no longer for enemies, but for friends—from whom, at every stage of it, He receives the grateful response of redeemed and adoring souls?" 
3. "To be 'saved from wrath through Him,' denotes here the whole work of Christ towards believers, from the moment of justification...till the Judge on the great white throne shall discharge that wrath upon them..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The work was undertaken while we were enemies. From being enemies we were changed to friends by that work."
2. "To effect this is the great design of the plan of salvation; it means that there were obstacles existing on both sides to a reconciliation, and that these have been removed by the death of Christ."
3. "If in this state, when humble, despised, dying, dead, he had power to accomplish so great a work as to reconcile us to God, how much more may we expect that he will be able to keep us now that he is a living, exalted, and triumphant Redeemer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The context favors the latter sense; not, however, with the conventional meaning of hated, denoting the revengeful, passionate feeling of human enmity, but simply the essential antagonism of the divine nature to sin."
2. "It is used of both mutual and one-sided enmity. In the former case, the context must show on which side is the active enmity."
3. "A consequent change of character in man; the covering, forgiving, cleansing of his sin; a thorough revolution in all his dispositions and principles."

### John Calvin:
1. "We hence have ample proofs to strengthen our hearts with confidence respecting our salvation."
2. "For we do not know the gratuitous mercy of God otherwise than as it appears from this — that he spared not his only-begotten Son; for he loved us at a time when there was discord between him and us."
3. "'By his life,' the abstract for the concrete; it means, 'through him being alive,' being at God’s right hand, having every power committed to him, and making intercession for us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Being enemies... the objects of God’s holy wrath. That this was while we, on our part, were opposed to God is certainly true; but the best commentators agree in declaring that the other sense is the logical one."
2. "The primary sense, therefore, points to the great change which has taken place in the relation of God to us, by means of the voluntary atoning sacrifice of Christ... men are reunited to Him as a loving and reconciled Father."
3. "The living Christ cannot leave without final success what His death effected. This, however, is accomplished not merely through His intercession, but also through His whole working in His kingly office for believers up to the completion of His work and kingdom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We were reconciled to God." 
2. "God has attended to that himself."
3. "We become reconciled to God by means of the death of God's Son."

### John Gill:
1. "Reconciliation implies a former state of friendship, a breach of that friendship, and a making of it up again; which no ways contradicts the everlasting and unchangeable love of God to his people."
2. "This expresses the wonderful love of God, since this reconciliation arises purely from himself; the scheme of it is of his own contriving; he, whose justice was affronted, and whose law was broken, took the first step towards it, and conducted the whole affair."
3. "Now from both these reconciliations is inferred the sure and certain salvation of persons so reconciled:we shall be saved by his life; by the life of Christ... the interceding life of Christ in heaven, where he lives, and ever lives to make intercession for his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "If" - As sure as; so the word frequently signifies; particularly in this and the eighth chapter.
2. "We shalt be saved" - Sanctified and glorified.
3. "Through his life" - Who "ever liveth to make intercession for us."
