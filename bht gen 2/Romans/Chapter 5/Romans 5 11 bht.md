In the midst of difficulties, we not only find joy in the hope of experiencing God's glory, but we also take delight in God Himself through our Lord Jesus Christ. It is through Him that we have received the reconciliation, which fills us with a triumphant confidence and a joyful hope. Even in the midst of trials, we can still find reasons to rejoice and give glory to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A further step still not only has the reconciled man confidence that he shall escape God’s wrath, but triumphant confidence, joyful hope in God."
2. "But not only so, but glorying in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our first feeling towards God, after we have found peace with Him, is
that of clinging gratitude for so costly a salvation; but no sooner
have we learned to cry, Abba, Father, under the sweet sense of
reconciliation, than 'gloriation' in Him takes the place of
dread of Him, and now He appears to us 'altogether lovely!'" 
(2) "As only believers
possess the true secret of patience under trials, so, although 'not
joyous but grievous' in themselves, when trials divinely sent afford them the opportunity of
evidencing their faith by the grace of patience under them, they
should 'count it all joy'." 
(3) "'Hope,'
in the New Testament sense of the term, is not a lower degree of
faith or assurance; but invariably means 'the confident
expectation of future good.' It presupposes faith; and what
faith assures us will be ours, hope accordingly expects."
