# Romans 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The entrance of sin into the world, leading to the introduction of death, had significant consequences for all of humanity. Sin brought about death for every individual as a punishment for their own sins. This connection between sin and death stems from the corruption and pollution of human nature inherited from Adam's sin. It is crucial to understand that physical death symbolizes eternal death in Paul's understanding. Despite these dire circumstances, Christ offers redemption from sin and a perfect righteousness to those who believe, providing a way to overcome the effects of Adam's transgression.

### John Calvin:
1. "For since Christ came to redeem us from the calamity into which Adam had fallen, and had precipitated all his posterity with him, we cannot see with so much clearness what we have in Christ, as by having what we have lost in Adam set before us, though all things on both sides are not similar."

3. "There is a participation of the sin; for all his posterity were seminally in his loins, so that all sinned in his sin, as Levi paid tithes in the loins of Abraham; and as children are a part of their parents, so children are in a manner partakers of their parents‚Äô sin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The main difficulty is in regard to what should correspond with ‚Äòas,‚Äô the construction not being regular...the rush of ideas suggested by the parallel, Paul intentionally suspends the mention of the second half, until he has proven one point in regard to the first half."
