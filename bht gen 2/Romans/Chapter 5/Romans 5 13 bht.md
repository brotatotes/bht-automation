# Romans 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin existed in the world before the law was given. Without the law to specifically condemn and punish sin, it was not reckoned as transgression by God. However, this does not mean that sin went unpunished, as the fact that all people died is evidence that all had sinned. The law of Moses only magnified and made more apparent the sinfulness of sin, which was already present and deserving of punishment even before the law was given.

2. "Without the law reproving us, we in a manner sleep in our sins... when the difference between good and evil is laid aside, they securely and joyfully indulge themselves, as if there was no judgment to come."
