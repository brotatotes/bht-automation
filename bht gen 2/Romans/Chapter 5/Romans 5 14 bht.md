# Romans 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Death's dominion is universal, reigning from Adam to Moses and extending even to those who did not sin in the same manner as Adam. This shows that death is the consequence of sin. Death is depicted as a monarch, with an extensive kingdom. Adam's transgression had dire consequences for the entire human race, including infants and those without a revealed law. Both Adam and Christ serve as representative figures, with Adam foreshadowing Christ's redemptive work. Through Adam, sin and death entered the world; through Christ, righteousness and life abound.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the universality of death is a proof that all sinned, for death is the consequence of sin"
2. "The aim is to prove, that the seed of sin planted in the race by the one man Adam, has sprung up and borne fruit in all, so as to bring them under death"
3. "who is a figure of the future (Adam [the second Adam, viz. Christ])"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The meaning then must be, that 'death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those that had not, like Adam, transgressed against a positive commandment, threatening death to the disobedient.'" 
2. "The point of analogy intended here is plainly the public character which both sustained, neither of the two being regarded in the divine procedure towards men as mere individual men, but both alike as representative men."
3. "The simple meaning is, as nearly all interpreters agree, that Adam is a type of Him who was to come after him in the same public character, and so to be 'the second Adam'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression 'death reigned' is one that is very striking. It is a representation of death as a monarch; having dominion over all that period, and overall those generations."
2. "The difference between their case and that of Adam was plainly that Adam had a revealed and positive law. They had not. They had only the law of nature, or of tradition."
3. "In this place it is evidently applied to the Messiah. The expression 'he who was to come' is often used to denote the Messiah. As applied to him, it means that there was in some respects a similarity between the results of the conduct of Adam and the effects of the work of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "This verse is to be connected with the preceding clause, which says, that those who were without the law did not impute sin to themselves. Hence they sinned not after the similitude of Adamâ€™s transgression..."
2. "The Apostle then intended to imply, that it did not happen through the difference between Adam and his posterity that they were exempt from condemnation. Infants are at the same time included in their number."
3. "But in saying that Adam bore a resemblance to Christ, there is nothing incongruous; for some likeness often appears in things wholly contrary. As then we are all lost through Adamâ€™s sin, so we are restored through Christâ€™s righteousness: hence he calls Adam not inaptly the type of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Death reigned. â€˜Lorded it.â€™ The consequence of sin (â€˜death through sin,â€™ Romans 5:12) was universal, even before the law: from Adam until Moses."
2. "Death, which here includes more than physical death, as the penalty of sin, lorded it over even such as did not sin, etc., i.e., were not guilty of a definite transgression, the transgression of a definite command of God."
3. "The first Adam, the one man through whom sin and death entered into the world, is the type of the one man Jesus Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Adam violated an express command of God and Moses gave the law of God clearly. And yet sin and death followed all from Adam on till Moses, showing clearly that the sin of Adam brought terrible consequences upon the race."
2. "Death has come upon infants and idiots also as a result of sin, but one understands Paul to mean that they are not held responsible by the law of conscience."
3. "Adam is a type of Christ in holding a relation to those affected by the headship in each case, but the parallel is not precise as Paul shows."

### John Gill:
1. "Death is represented as a king, as sin and Satan sometimes are; and indeed, death reigns by sin, and Satan both by sin and death; their empires rise, stand, and fall together."
2. "The subjects of his government were not only adult persons, but he reigned even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression."
3. "The true reason of their dying is here suggested by the apostle; which is the transgression of Adam: who is the figure of him that was to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "Death reigned â€” And how vast is his kingdom! Scarce can we find any king who has as many subjects, as are the kings whom he hath conquered."
2. "Even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression â€” Even over infants who had never sinned, as Adam did, in their own persons; and over others who had not, like him, sinned against an express law."
3. "As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; so by one man righteousness entered into the world, and life by righteousness."
