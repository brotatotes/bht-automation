# Romans 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The comparison between the fall and the free gift reveals a significant difference in terms of their extent. While sin came from one man, the gift of righteousness came from another with much greater power. This distinction is crucial to understand the reason behind the contrasting outcomes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if by the transgression of the one (man) the many (have) died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift abound in (by means of) the grace of the one man Jesus Christ towards the many."
2. "Here (Rom 5:16) the contrast is between the judgment, coming of one sinner, to condemnation, and the free gift, of (see note below) many offenses, to justification."
3. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (His self-offering love, see 2Co 8:9) is the medium by which the free gift is imparted to men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two cases present points of contrast as well as resemblance."
2. "By 'the many' is meant the mass of mankind represented respectively by Adam and Christ."
3. "The 'much more'... does not mean that we get much more of good by Christ than of evil by Adam, but that we have much more reason to expect... that the many should be benefited by the merit of one, than that they should suffer for the sin of one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The favor, benefit, or good bestowed gratuitously on us. It refers to the favors bestowed in the gospel by Christ. These are free, that is, without merit on our part, and bestowed on the undeserving."
2. "If a wise, merciful, and good Being has suffered such a train of woes to be introduced by the offence of one, have we not much more reason to expect that his grace will superabound?"
3. "The grace of God - The favor or kindness of God. We have reason to expect under the administration of God more extensive benefits than we have ills, flowing from a constitution of things which is the result of his appointment."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of one [œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒΩŒøœÇ]. Rev., correctly, the one - Adam. So the many."
2. "Much more."
3. "The character of God is such, from a Christian point of view, that the comparison gives a much more certain basis for belief, in what is gained through the second Adam, than in the certainties of sin and death through the first Adam."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though he mentions oftentimes a difference, yet there are none of these repetitions in which there is not a want of a corresponding clause, or in which there is not at least an ellipsis."
2. "The righteousness of Christ will be no less efficacious to save many."
3. "Grace means the free goodness of God or gratuitous love, of which he has given us a proof in Christ, that he might relieve our misery: and gift is the fruit of this mercy, and hath come to us, even the reconciliation by which we have obtained life and salvation, righteousness, newness of life, and every other blessing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'But not as the fall, or, ‚Äòtrespass.‚Äô The word here used refers to an act of sin, and is almost the same as ‚Äòtransgression‚Äô (Romans 5:14), and ‚Äòdisobedience‚Äô (Romans 5:19)... All these words are less inclusive than ‚Äòsin‚Äô (Romans 5:12-13). ‚ÄòBut‚Äô marks a strong contrast."
2. "So also is the free gift, or, ‚Äògift of grace,‚Äô the atoning and justifying act of divine grace in Jesus Christ (Meyer). Four different words are used in this passage to express the same thought of free grace, and it is difficult to distinguish them in English."
3. "'Much more. Not simply that the gift was more abundant, but with much more certainty is it to be expected from God, or has God proved, that grace abounds."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "the trespass" (œÑŒø œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄœÑœâŒºŒ±, the slip, fall to one side) over against the free gift (œÑŒø œáŒ±œÅŒπœÉŒºŒ±, of grace œáŒ±œÅŒπœÇ).
2. Much more  (œÄŒøŒªŒªœâ ŒºŒ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ). Another a fortiori argument. As a God of love he delights much more in showing mercy and pardon than in giving just punishment.
3. The gift surpasses the sin. It is not necessary to Paul's argument to make "the many" in each case correspond, one relates to Adam, the other to Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the offence', or 'fall', as the word signifies, is meant the first sin of Adam; by which he offended God, and fell from that estate in which he was created, and all his posterity with him; and by the 'free gift' is meant, the righteousness of Christ, which justifies from that, and all other offences."
2. "Both are sole authors of what they convey to their respective offspring, Adam of sin, Christ of righteousness; both convey single things, Adam only one sin, not more, for when he had committed one sin, he broke the covenant made with him and his posterity, and so ceased in after acts to be a representative of them; Christ conveys his righteousness, or obedience to the law, without any additional works of righteousness of ours to complete it."
3. "The righteousness of Christ, in which the grace of God is so illustrious, is much more effectual to the giving of life to all his seed and offspring; not barely such a life as Adam had in innocence, and which he lost by the offence, but a spiritual and an eternal one; which sheds the exuberance of this grace, which secures and adjudges to a better life than what was lost by the fall."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now the fall and the free gift differ, 1. In amplitude, Romans 5:15" 
2. "He from whom sin came, and He from whom the free gift came, termed also 'the gift of righteousness,' differ in power, Romans 5:16" 
3. "The reason of both is subjoined, Romans 5:17"
