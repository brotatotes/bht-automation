# Romans 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through one single offense, Adam brought condemnation upon himself and all of humanity, resulting in the sentence of death for all. This one act had a profound effect on his descendants, overwhelming them with the consequences of his sin. However, the free gift of righteousness through Christ is different. It is able to cover the multitude of offenses committed by many, leading to justification and acquittal from all guilt.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And not as (that which took place) by one that sinned, so is the gift."
2. "For the judgment (pronounced by God upon Adam) came of (was by occasion of) one (man having sinned) unto condemnation, but the gift of grace was by occasion of many transgressions unto justification."
3. "The first seems to me to be right, as standing most exactly in contrast with κατάκριμα; the use of the -μα being partly perhaps accounted for by the alliteration of the ending marking more strongly the antithesis. Thus as κατάκριμα is a sentence of condemnation, so δικαίωμα will be a sentence of acquittal. This in fact amounts to justification."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The condemnation by Adam was for one sin; but the justification by Christ is an absolution not only from the guilt of that first offense, mysteriously attaching to every individual of the race, but from the countless offenses it, to which, as a germ lodged in the bosom of every child of Adam, it unfolds itself in his life."
2. "It is a grace not only rich in its character, but rich in detail; it is a 'righteousness' not only rich in a complete justification of the guilty, condemned sinner; but rich in the amplitude of the ground which it covers, leaving no one sin of any of the justified uncancelled."
3. "Making him, though loaded with the guilt of myriads of offenses, 'the righteousness of God in Christ.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The effects of Adam’s sin, whatever they were, pertained to the one sin; the effects of the work of Christ, to many sins."
2. "The effect of the sin of Adam was to involve the race in condemnation, or to secure this as a result that all mankind would be under the condemning sentence of the Law, and be transgressors."
3. "The work of Christ is designed to have reference to many offences, so as to produce pardon or justification in regard to them all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "One man, from the preceding (one) that sinned."
2. "One trespass, from ver. 17."
3. "Not the subjective state of justification, but a righteous act or deed."

### John Calvin:
1. "By one offense guilt issued in the condemnation of us all, but that grace...is efficacious to our justification from many offenses."
2. "He had not hitherto expressed, how or in what respect Christ excelled Adam."
3. "Their opinion is impious, who have taught that we recover nothing else by Christ but a freedom from original sin, or the corruption derived from Adam."
4. "These many offenses...are not to be understood only of those which every one must have committed before baptism, but also of those by which the saints contract daily new guilt."
5. "He sets gift in opposition to judgment: by the latter he means strict justice; by the former, gratuitous pardon."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A single act of sin is referred to in either case."
2. "The judicial sentence of God...may refer to a favorable or unfavorable sentence."
