# Romans 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The distinction between grace and the gift is examined here. Grace is set in contrast to the offense, while the gift is set in contrast to death. The gift referred to is the gift of life, which is given through Jesus Christ. By highlighting this contrast, the passage emphasizes the tremendous value of the gift of life that we receive through Christ's grace and underscores the sharp difference between life and death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The distinction the third, also in kind; that which came in by the one sinner, was the reign of death: that which shall come in by the One, Jesus Christ, will be a reigning in life."
2. "If by the transgression of the one man death reigned by means of the one man, much more shall they who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life by means of the one Man Jesus Christ."
3. "'Antithesis to ὁ θάνατος ἐβας. We should expect ἡ ζωὴ βασιλεύσει, but Paul designedly changes the form of expression that he may bring more prominently forward the idea of free personality."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We have here the two ideas of Romans 5:15; Romans 5:16 sublimely combined into one, as if the subject had grown upon the apostle as he advanced in his comparison of the two cases."
2. "Here, for the first time in this section, he speaks of that LIFE which springs out of justification, in contrast with the death which springs from sin and follows condemnation."
3. "It is worthy of note, too, that while he says death 'reigned over' us through Adam, he does not say Life 'reigns over us' through Christ; lest he should seem to invest this new life with the very attribute of death—that of fell and malignant tyranny, of which we were the hapless victims."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If, under the administration of a just and merciful Being, it has occurred, that by the offence of one, death hath exerted so wide a dominion; we have reason much more to expect under that administration, that they who are brought under his plan of saving mercy shall be brought under a dispensation of life." 
2. "The abundant favor; the mercy that shall counterbalance and surpass the evils introduced by the sin of Adam. That favor shall be more than sufficient to counterbalance all those evils."
3. "This stands opposed to the evils introduced by Adam. As the effect of his sin was to produce condemnation, so here the gift of righteousness refers to the opposite, to pardon, to justification, to acceptance with God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The effect of the second Adam cannot fall behind that of the first."
2. "If death reigned, there must be a reign of life."
3. "Not believingly accept, but simply the recipients."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the whole is this — that Christ surpasses Adam; the sin of one is overcome by the righteousness of the other; the curse of one is effaced by the grace of the other; from one, death has proceeded, which is absorbed by the life which the other bestows."
2. "The benefit of Christ does not come to all men, while Adam has involved his whole race in condemnation; for as the curse we derive from Adam is conveyed to us by nature, it is no wonder that it includes the whole mass; but that we may come to a participation of the grace of Christ, we must be ingrafted in him by faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'In life' is to be taken in its fullest sense; this is the sphere in which those who receive the abundance of the grace shall reign." 
2. "The whole clause has a triumphant tone, pointing from present grace to future glory, all mediated through the one, Jesus Christ."
3. "If, as a fact, sin and death were through Adam, then much more certain is it that abundant present grace and triumphant future glory shall be through our one head, Jesus Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Much more (πολλω μαλλον)."
2. "Argument a fortiori again."
3. "Note balanced words in the contrast (transgression, grace; death, life; the one Adam, the one Jesus Christ; reign in both)."

### John Gill:
1. "Adam, say the Jewish doctors, transgressed,על פקודא חד דאורייתא, one commandment of the law."
2. "in which death is represented as a mighty monarch, a powerful king; and designs not only corporeal death, which has mounted the throne by sin, and is supported in its dominion by an ordinance of heaven; but also a moral or spiritual death, which has seized on all mankind, and reigns in every power and faculty of the soul of man; and likewise an eternal one, which will have power over all those, who have no part in the first resurrection."
3. "by which "righteousness" is meant, not righteousness or holiness infused into us; but the righteousness of Christ, which is a free grace gift, and is enjoyed in a way of receiving; which denotes the act of faith, and supposes giving; and hence there is no room for boasting, but great reason for thankfulness."

### John Wesley:
1. There is a difference between grace and the gift. Grace is opposed to the offence; the gift, to death, being the gift of life.
