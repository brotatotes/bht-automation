# Romans 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reign of death came through the sin of one person, while the reign of life will come through the one, Jesus Christ. We will reign in life by receiving the abundance of God's grace and the gift of righteousness, which will enable us to live a spiritual and moral life. The concept of reigning signifies the highest development of freedom and the fulfillment of all desires. It represents a state of blessedness, both theocratic and subjective, as we partake in the reign of saints with Christ and experience the highest satisfaction of our souls.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That which came in by the one sinner, was the reign of DEATH: that which shall come in by the One, Jesus Christ, will be a reigning in LIFE." 
2. "If by the transgression of the one man death reigned, much more shall they who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life by means of the one Man Jesus Christ." 
3. "ζωή is not only corporeal (the resurrection), but also spiritual and moral, as also in θάνατος we must include διὰ τῆς ἁμαρτίας Romans 5:12. βασιλεύσουσιν is brought in by the antithesis: but it is elsewhere used to signify the state of blessedness, partly in an objective theocratic import (of the reign of the saints with Christ), partly in a subjective moral one, because reigning is the highest development of freedom, and the highest satisfaction of all desires."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We shall reign in life."
2. "If one man's one offense let loose against us the tyrant power of Death, to hold us as its victims in helpless bondage, 'much more,' when we stand forth enriched with God's 'abounding grace' and in the beauty of a complete absolution from countless offenses, shall we expatiate in a life divinely owned and legally secured, 'reigning' in exultant freedom and unchallenged might, through that other matchless 'One,' Jesus Christ!"
3. "Right to live"—"Righteous life"—life possessed and enjoyed with the good will, and in conformity with the eternal law, of "Him that sitteth on the Throne"; life therefore in its widest sense—life in the whole man and throughout the whole duration of human existence, the life of blissful and loving relationship to God in soul and body, for ever and ever.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If, under the administration of a just and merciful Being, it has occurred, that by the offence of one, death hath exerted so wide a dominion; we have reason much more to expect under that administration, that they who are brought under his plan of saving mercy shall be brought under a dispensation of life."
2. "The evils which they suffer in consequence of the sin of Adam bear no comparison with the mercies of eternal life that shall flow to them from the work of the Saviour."
3. "It means that they shall be exalted to a glorious state of happiness in heaven; that they shall be triumphant over all their enemies; shall gain an ultimate victory; and shall partake with the Captain of their salvation in the splendors of his dominion above."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If death reigned, there must be a reign of life."
2. "They which receive... simply the recipients."
3. "Abundance of grace... the abundance of the grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the whole is this — that Christ surpasses Adam; the sin of one is overcome by the righteousness of the other; the curse of one is effaced by the grace of the other; from one, death has proceeded, which is absorbed by the life which the other bestows."
2. "The other difference is, that the benefit of Christ does not come to all men, while Adam has involved his whole race in condemnation; and the reason of this is indeed evident; for as the curse we derive from Adam is conveyed to us by nature, it is no wonder that it includes the whole mass; but that we may come to a participation of the grace of Christ, we must be ingrafted in him by faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The correspondence between the clauses is in other respects not exact."
2. "If this was God's way of justice, with much more certainty will His way of grace be."
3. "The whole clause has a triumphant tone, pointing from present grace to future glory, all mediated through the one, Jesus Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
Apologies for the mistake. Here are the exact quotes from the commentary:
1. "Much more (πολλω μαλλον). Argument a fortiori again."
2. "Condition of first class assumed to be true."
3. "Note balanced words in the contrast (transgression παραπτωματ, grace χαριτος; death θανατος, life ζωη; the one or Adam του ενος, the one Jesus Christ; reign βασιλευω in both)."

### John Gill:
1. "It was the single sin of Adam, the first sin that was committed by him, which gave death its reigning power over the sons of men."
2. "In which death is represented as a mighty monarch, a powerful king; and designs not only corporeal death, but also a moral or spiritual death."
3. "Such persons who have received this abundant grace and free gift shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ; in corporeal life, they are not now subject to death as a penal evil, as other persons are."

### John Wesley:
1. There is a difference between grace and the gift. Grace is opposed to the offence; the gift, to death, being the gift of life.
