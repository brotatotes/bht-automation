# Romans 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The offense of one led to condemnation for all, but the righteousness of one led to justification and the restoration of favor with God. Through one act of obedience, Christ's righteousness is imputed to all, offering a justifying verdict that brings life. While this righteousness is available to all, it does not guarantee universal salvation, but rather provides a plan that is perfectly suited to overcome the effects of the fall and offer justification and eternal life to those who have faith in Christ.

2. "In this summing up, the Apostle puts the antithetical elements as strongly and nakedly as possible in contrast."
3. "The Death of Christ viewed as the acme of His Obedience, see Philippians 2:8 = ἡ ὑπακοὴ τοῦ ἑνός below; not as in Romans 5:16, nor Righteousness, as Thol., which would not contrast with παραπτ., a single act."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "In this case, the apostle, resuming the statement of Romans 5:12, expresses it in a more concentrated and vivid form—suggested no doubt by the expression in Romans 5:16, 'through one offense,' representing Christ's whole work, considered as the ground of our justification, as 'ONE RIGHTEOUSNESS.'"
3. "The expression 'justification of life,' is a vivid combination of two ideas already expatiated upon, meaning 'justification entitling to and issuing in the rightful possession and enjoyment of life'."

### John Calvin:
1. "As by the offense of one we were made (constitute) sinners; so the righteousness of Christ is efficacious to justify us."
2. "He does not say the righteousness — δικαιοσύνην, but the justification — δικαίωμα, of Christ, in order to remind us that he was not as an individual just for himself, but that the righteousness with which he was endued reached farther, in order that, by conferring this gift, he might enrich the faithful."
3. "Justification of life is to be taken, in my judgment, for remission, which restores life to us, as though he called it life-giving."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With this phrase, which means ‘in consequence of all this, it follows that,’ Paul resumes the parallel, summing up all the previously stated points of resemblance and difference; the design being to show how the inheritance and imputation of sin confirms, renders more certain, the imputation of righteousness and the abounding reign of grace."
2. "Here Christ’s obedience, viewed as one act, as the ground of justification, seems to be meant, yet a reference to the justifying verdict gives a good sense."
