# Romans 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the disobedience of Adam, all humans were found guilty and became sinners. However, through the obedience of Jesus Christ, who willingly died for us, all believers are justified and declared righteous in the sight of God. This contrasts the guilt and sinfulness inherited from Adam with the righteousness and forgiveness offered through faith in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "...the disobedience of (the) one man...were made sinners...actual sinners by practice..."
2. "...by means of the obedience (unto death) of (the) One (man)...the many...shall be made righteous..."
3. "When we say that man has no righteousness of his own, we speak of him as out of Christ: but in Christ and united to Him, he is made righteous, not by a fiction or imputation only of Christ's righteousness, but by a real and living spiritual union with a righteous Head as a righteous member..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By the 'obedience' of Christ here is plainly not meant more than what divines call His active obedience, as distinguished from His sufferings and death it is the entire work of Christ in its obediential character."
2. "The change of tense from the past to the futureâ€”'as through Adam we were made sinners, so through Christ we shall be made righteous'â€”delightfully expresses the enduring character of the act, and of the economy to which such acts belong, in contrast with the forever-past ruin of believers in Adam."
3. "Only in this latter case it is the redeemed family of man that is alone in view; it is humanity as actually lost, but also as actually saved, as ruined and recovered."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By the former statements it might perhaps be inferred that people were condemned without any guilt or blame of theirs. The apostle in this verse guards against this, and affirms that they are in fact sinners."
2. "The whole scope of the argument is, moreover, against this; for the object of the apostle is not to show that they were charged with the sin of another, but that they were in fact sinners themselves."
3. "The facts here stated accord with all the analogy in the moral government of God. The drunkard secures as a result commonly, that his family will be reduced to beggary, want, and woe. A pirate, or a traitor, will overwhelm not himself only, but his family in ruin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Parakoh is therefore, primarily, a failing to hear or hearing amiss."
2. "The exact meaning in this passage is disputed. The following are the principal explanations: 1. Set down in a declarative sense; declared to be. 2. Placed in the category of sinners because of a vital connection with the first transgressor. 3. Became sinners; were made."
3. "Note the play on the words, parakoe, hypokoe, disobedience, obedience."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he shows that we are guilty through the offense of one man, in such a manner as not to be ourselves innocent."
2. "He at the same time shows what sort of righteousness it is, by calling it obedience."
3. "We may also hence learn, how false are the schemes which they take to pacify God, who of themselves devise what they obtrude on him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As a consequence of the disobedience of the one man (Adam) the many were constituted sinners, so also in consequence of the obedience of the one (Christ) shall the many be constituted righteous." 
2. "The contrasts are exact... the actual efficacy of the gospel is here spoken of, and not the objective sufficiency."
3. "Through the disobedience of the one man, has the position of all become that of sinners... on the other hand, God has forgiven believers on account of the death of Christ, and counted their faith as righteousness... at the judgment the many shall by God's sentence enter into the category of the righteous."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here again we have 'the one' with both Adam and Christ..."
2. "...'disobedience' contrasted with 'obedience'..."
3. "...'the many' in both cases (but with different meaning as with 'all men' above)."

### John Gill:
1. "For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners...by the obedience of Christ, all his seed are made righteous." 
2. "The persons made sinners are said to be 'many', in opposition to the 'one man'... and mean all the natural descendants of Adam."
3. "The persons made righteous by [Christ's] obedience... are all made righteous in the sight of God, are justified from all their sins, and entitled to eternal life and happiness."

### John Wesley:
1. "By the disobedience of one man many (that is, all men) were constituted sinners..."
2. "So by the obedience of one â€” By his obedience unto death; by his dying for us..."
3. "Many â€” All that believe. Shall be constituted righteous â€” Justified, pardoned."
