# Romans 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through Jesus, we have been given access to God's grace, which grants us favor in His sight. This access is not based on our own merit or works, but is obtained solely through faith in Christ. It is by His work and sacrifice that we are introduced into this state of favor and are able to stand confidently before God. This is not something temporary, but a permanent standing that we can rejoice in, having peace with God and hope in the glory that is to come.
