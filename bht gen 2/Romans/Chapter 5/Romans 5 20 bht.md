# Romans 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the law, the divine plan was revealed - to highlight the necessity of Christ as the deliverer from sin and the bringer of righteousness. The law served as a preparation, exposing the magnitude of transgressions and the need for God's grace to abound beyond measure. The law multiplied transgressions, but grace overflowed to provide a way of redemption. The law was meant to emphasize the universal depravity of humanity, and the abundance of grace was intended to far exceed the increasing sins caused by the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No possible objection can be taken to this statement by those who view the Law as a preparation for Christ. If it was so, then the effect of the Law, the creating and multiplying transgression, was an end in the divine purposes, to bring out the necessity of One who should deliver from sin and bring in righteousness."
2. "But (this terrible end, the multiplying of transgression, was not, however, God’s ultimate end: He had a further and gracious one) where sin was multiplied, (God’s) grace did beyond measure abound."
3. "The E. V. has likewise destroyed the force of the comparison by rendering the different words πλεονάζω and περισσεύω both by one word ‘abound’."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The promulgation of the law at Sinai was no primary or essential feature of the divine plan, but it was 'added' for a subordinate purpose—the more fully to reveal the evil occasioned by Adam, and the need and glory of the remedy by Christ."
2. "All our multitudinous breaches of the law are nothing but that one first offense, lodged mysteriously in the bosom of every child of Adam as an offending principal, and multiplying itself into myriads of particular offenses in the life of each."
3. "The comparison here is between the multiplication of one offense into countless transgressions, and such an overflow of grace as more than meets that appalling case."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He therefore shows them that the effect of the Law of Moses was to increase rather than to diminish the sins which had been introduced into the world."
2. "The Law expresses the duty of man; it is spiritual and holy; it is opposed to the guilty passions and pleasures of the world; and it thus excites opposition, provokes to anger, and is the occasion by which sin is called into exercise, and shows itself in the heart."
3. "The introduction of the Mosaic Law, instead of diminishing the sins of people, only increases them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It was taken up into the divine plan or arrangement, and made an occasion for the abounding of grace in the opening of the new way to justification and life."
2. "Not primarily of the greater consciousness and acknowledgment of sin, but of the increase of actual transgression."
3. "Abounded over and above."

### John Calvin:
1. "He indeed teaches us, that it was needful that men’s ruin should be more fully discovered to them, in order that a passage might be opened for the favor of God."
2. "And we may hence learn, that our condemnation is not set before us in the law, that we may abide in it; but that having fully known our misery, we may be led to Christ, who is sent to be a physician to the sick, a deliverer to the captives, a comforter to the afflicted, a defender to the oppressed."
3. "It hence follows, that sin is increased by the law, since now the authority of the lawgiver is despised and his majesty degraded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The design of the law was not to multiply sin as such, but to make it appear, to reveal it to the conscience, as a transgression of the law of God."
2. "The ultimate purpose of the exceeding abounding of grace is to bring good out of evil; to make it the occasion of the most wonderful display of his glory and grace."
3. "Grace reigns through righteousness, unto eternal life. Physical death is not abolished, but grace reigns through righteousness, eternal life as the result."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Mosaic law came into this state of things, in between Adam and Christ."
2. "If we take it so here, the meaning is 'so that the trespass abounded.' This was the actual effect of the Mosaic law for the Jews, the necessary result of all prohibitions."
3. "The flood of grace surpassed the flood of sin, great as that was (and is)."

### John Gill:
1. "Through it the grace of God much more abounded, in the sacrifice of Christ prefigured by it." 
2. "The moral law...intervened, or came between Adam's sin and Christ's sacrifice." 
3. "Grace has superabounded in the same nature, being assumed by the Son of God, and united to him, who has appeared in it 'full of grace and truth'."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law came in between — The offence and the free gift."
2. "Yet where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
3. "Not only in the remission of that sin which Adam brought on us, but of all our own; not only in remission of sins, but infusion of holiness; not only in deliverance from death, but admission to everlasting life, a far more noble and excellent life than that which we lost by Adam's fall."
