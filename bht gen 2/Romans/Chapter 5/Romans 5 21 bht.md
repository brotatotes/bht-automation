# Romans 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Grace and sin are presented as contrasting forces in the Christian's life. Sin has a dominion over man, exerting its power to draw and enslave. However, grace is not to be outdone. It reigns in the salvation of believers, exerting its governing and commanding power through righteousness. This reign of grace leads to eternal life, a gift made possible by Jesus Christ our Lord. It is through His righteousness that grace prevails and brings us to the ultimate goal - eternal life. All of these blessings come from the abundant and unmerited grace of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of this abounding of grace: its ultimate prevalence and reign, by means of righteousness, unto life eternal."
2. "That, as sin reigned... in death... so also grace may reign by means of righteousness, unto life eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord."
3. "'Jam ne memoratur quidem Adamus, solius Christi mentio viget.' Bengel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the great general term sin... triumphing and reveling in that complete destruction of its victims."
2. "the grace which originated the scheme of salvation... makes us to be the righteousness of God in Him."
3. "the (justifying) righteousness of Christ... the stable throne from which Grace as a Sovereign dispenses its saving benefits to as many as are brought under its benign sway."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The provisions of redemption are in themselves ample to meet all the ruins of the fall."
2. "The triumphs of the gospel here celebrated cannot refer to the number of the subjects, for it has not actually freed all people from the dominion of sin. But the apostle refers to the fact that the gospel is able to overcome sin of the most malignant form, of the most aggravated character, of the longest duration."
3. "Christianity proposes a remedy; and it is permitted to the Christian to rejoice that that remedy is ample to meet all the evils; that it is just suited to recover our alienated world; and that it is destined yet to raise the race up to life, and peace, and heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "How much is lost by the inaccurate rendering of the prepositions."
2. "Ellicott remarks that there are few points more characteristic of the apostle's style than his varied but accurate use of prepositions, especially of two or more in the same or in immediately contiguous clauses."
3. "And now - so this last word seems to say - Adam has passed away; Christ alone remains."

### John Calvin:
1. "As sin is said to be the sting of death, and as death has no power over men, except on account of sin; so sin executes its power by death: it is hence said to exercise thereby its dominion."
2. "He had previously said, that death reigned; he now ascribes reigning to sin; but its end or, effect is death. And he says, that it has reigned, in the past tense; not that it has ceased to reign in those who are born only of flesh... Hence as soon as the grace of Christ begins to prevail in any one, the reign of sin and death ceases."
3. "The first part is differently rendered... The preposition is εν and not εἰ, and its common meaning is 'in,' and it may be here translated, 'in death,' i.e., in a state of death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Final ινα here, the purpose of God and the goal for us through Christ."
2. "The force of the aorist indicative (εβασιλευσεν, established its throne) and the aorist subjunctive (βασιλευση, might establish its throne), the ingressive aorist both times."
3. "This full rhetorical close has almost the value of a doxology."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin has such a power over man in a state of nature, as amounts to a dominion; it has not only an enticing, ensnaring power, to draw into compliance with it, and an obstructive power to hinder that which is good, and an operative one of that which is evil, and a captivating, enslaving one to the same; but it has a kingly, governing, and commanding power..." 
2. "Grace reigns or bears sway in man's salvation in all the parts of it, 'through righteousness'; consistent with the justice of God..." 
3. "Grace as it is in the hearts of converted persons, is meant where it reigns, has the dominion, is the governing principle, and that in a way of righteousness and true holiness; and will reign until it is perfected in glory, or is crowned with eternal life..."

### John Wesley:
