# Romans 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of our trials and tribulations, we can find hope and even rejoice. These difficulties are not to be endured passively, but rather embraced with a sense of triumph, knowing that they are ultimately for our own good. The patience we develop through these experiences is not an ordinary kind of endurance, but a steadfastness born out of the grace and consolation of the Holy Spirit. It is through these tribulations and our patient response to them that we are prepared for greater blessings and a deeper understanding of God's love.

### John Calvin:
1. "He meets this objection, and declares, not only that the godly are prevented by these calamities from being blessed, but also that their glorying is thereby promoted."
2. "By saying that the saints glory in tribulations, he is not to be understood, as though they dreaded not, nor avoided adversities, or were not distressed with their bitterness when they happened, but as in their grief and sorrow they are not without great consolation, because they regard that whatever they bear is dispensed to them for good by the hand of a most indulgent Father, they are justly said to glory."
3. "Tribulation produces patience; this is not the natural effect of tribulation; but when that inward meekness, which is infused by the Spirit of God, and the consolation, which is conveyed by the same Spirit, succeed in the place of our stubbornness, then tribulations become the means of generating patience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Christians do not glory in suffering, as such, or for its own sake; but as the Bible teaches: 1. Because they consider it an honor to suffer for Christ. 2. Because they rejoice in being the occasion of manifesting His power in their support and deliverance; and, 3. Because suffering is made the means of their own sanctification and preparation for usefulness here, and for heaven hereafter. The last of these reasons is that to which the Apostle refers in the context’ (Hodge)."
2. "Knowing that, since we know that; the believer finds this out in his own experience. This knowledge extends to the whole series of successive results; the climax is set forth in Romans 5:5."
3. "Worketh patience. Not ‘patience’ as we generally understand it, but ‘constancy,’ patient endurance, steadfastness, holding out bravely against trials and persecutions."

"The tribulations of the saints are many and various, through the hatred of the world, the temptations of Satan, their own corruptions; and are the will of their heavenly Father; what Christ has foretold, and they expect; and here particularly design such as are for Christ's sake, which being supported under, and carried through, they glory in."
2. "They glory in them as they are for Christ's sake, and in a good cause; as they are trials of grace, and of use for the exercise of it: and as they are in the exercise of grace, amidst these tribulations, and are comforted under them, and are helped to have regard to the heavenly glory."
3. "The ground of which glorying is, that these afflictions are the means of promoting patience, experience, and hope."
