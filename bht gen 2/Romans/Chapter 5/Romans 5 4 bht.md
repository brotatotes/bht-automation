# Romans 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Patient endurance in the midst of trials is not in vain, for it produces valuable experience and proof of the genuineness of our faith. These trials serve to test and solidify our belief in God, strengthening our hope in Him. The process of enduring tribulations showcases the reality of our religion and points us towards the assurance of a glorious future. As we face and overcome trials, we are shown the reality and trustworthiness of our faith, leading to a deepened hope and a firm conviction in the love, grace, and faithfulness of our Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Patience worketh experience—proof."
2. "We have hope in two distinct ways, and at two successive stages of the Christian life: first, immediately on believing... next, after the reality of this faith has been 'proved,' particularly by the patient endurance of trials sent to test it."
3. "We first get it by looking away from ourselves to the Lamb of God; next by looking into or upon ourselves as transformed by that 'looking unto Jesus.' In the one case, the mind acts objectively; in the other, subjectively. The one is the assurance of faith; the other, the assurance of sense."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Patient endurance of trial produces experience."  
2. "The meaning is, that long afflictions borne patiently show a Christian what he is; they test his religion, and prove that it is genuine."  
3. "The result of such long trial is to produce hope. They show that religion is genuine; that it is from God; and not only so, but they direct the mind onward to another world; and sustain the soul by the prospect of a glorious immortality there."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Here it can only be the latter: tried integrity, a state of mind which has stood the test."
2. "The process has already been expressed by tribulation."
3. "The more accurate rendering is proof or approval."

### John Calvin:
1. "Patience, probation, etc. James, adopting a similar gradation, seems to follow a different order; for he says, that patience proceeds from probation: but the different meaning of the word is what will reconcile both."
2. "According to the present passage, we then only make advances in patience as we ought, when we regard it as having been continued to us by God’s power, and thus entertain hope as to the future, that God’s favor, which has ever succored us in our necessities, will never be wanting to us."
3. "Hence he subjoins, that from probation arises hope; for ungrateful we should be for benefits received, except the recollection of them confirms our hope as to what is to come."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Experience' is too wide, since it may include the whole Christian life."
2. "The term here used refers to the state of one who has successfully stood a test."
3. "'The more the Christian has become tried, the more also will hope continually possess him'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Knowing (ειδοτες). Second perfect participle of ειδον (οιδα), giving the reason for the previous exhortation to glory in tribulations."
2. "He gives a linked chain, one linking to the other (tribulation θλιψις, patience υπομονη, experience δοκιμη, hope ελπις) running into verse Romans 5:5."
3. "On δοκιμη, see 2 Corinthians 2:9."

### John Gill:
1. "As tribulations tend to exercise and increase patience, so patience being exercised and increased, enlarges the saints' stock and fund of experience."
2. "Experience, hope; hope is a gift of God's grace, and is implanted in regeneration, but abounds, increases, and becomes more strong and lively by experience of the love, grace, mercy, power, and faithfulness of God."

### John Wesley:
1. And patience works more experience of the sincerity of our grace, and of God's power and faithfulness.
