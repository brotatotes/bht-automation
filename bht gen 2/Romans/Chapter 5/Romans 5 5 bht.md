# Romans 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hope we have in God does not disappoint or shame us like empty hopes do. Instead, it gives us the highest glorying because the love of God has been poured out abundantly in our hearts. The love we experience from God is not a small trickle but a steady stream that fills our souls with the assurance of His favor. This is all made possible by the work of the Holy Spirit, who is the source and cause of these present blessings and the guarantee of future ones.
