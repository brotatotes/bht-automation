# Romans 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rarely does one find an example of someone sacrificing their life for a righteous person, let alone for an ungodly individual. However, Christ's death for the ungodly showcases the immense magnitude of God's love. The distinction between a righteous person and a good person is significant - a righteous individual simply upholds justice without sympathy, whereas a good person exudes kindness and benevolence. The willingness to die for someone who is truly good and brings blessings to others is a testament to the depth of love.
