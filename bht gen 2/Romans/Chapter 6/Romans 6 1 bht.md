# Romans 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In response to the idea that we can persist in sin to multiply God's grace, the apostle firmly denies and renounces this notion. Continuing in sin does not lead to an increase in grace. Instead, sin incurs God's wrath. The glorious display of God's grace comes not from the commission of sin, but from the forgiveness of it. Thus, the apostle refutes this erroneous thinking and emphasizes that grace teaches us to live differently, to abstain from sin, and to embrace a new way of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What then shall we say? Must we think that we may persist in sin, that God's grace may be multiplied?" (ch. Romans 5:20)
2. "Are we to continue in our natural state and commission of sin, that God's grace may be multiplied?" (ch. Romans 5:20)
3. "May we persist in sin, that God's grace may be multiplied?" (ch. Romans 5:20)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Shall we (or, as the true reading is, 'May we,' 'Are we to') continue in sin, that grace may abound?"  - The objection to the apostle's doctrine of a purely gratuitous justification is plausible and has been brought against the apostles. However, the apostle here proceeds to show that it is a total perversion of the doctrine of Grace.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What shall we say to such a sentiment as that where sin abounded grace did much more abound?" 
2. "If sin has been the occasion of grace and favor, ought we not to continue in it, and commit as much as possible, in order that grace might abound?" 
3. "He shows that the consequence does not follow; and proves that the doctrine of justification does not lead to it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What shall we say then?" - A transition - expression and a debater's phrase.
2. "Shall we continue [ÎµÏ€Î¹Î¼ÎµÎ½Ï‰Î¼ÎµÎ½]" - The verb means primarily to remain or abide at or with, and secondarily, to persevere. So better here, persist.

### John Calvin:
1. "He (the Apostle) proves, that they who imagine that gratuitous righteousness is given us by him, apart from newness of life, shamefully rend Christ asunder."
2. "Let us, however, go on in our course; nor let Christ be suppressed, because he is to many a stone of offense, and a rock of stumbling; for as he is for ruin to the ungodly, so he is to the godly for a resurrection."
3. "The refutation of this we shall hereafter meet with."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜Then,â€™ in view of chap. Romans 5:20-21. Comp. the similar phrase in chap. Romans 4:1."
2. "The form of the question in the original indicates that this is the statement of a point to be discussed, or rather of a wrong inference that might be drawn from the abounding of grace."
3. "This wrong inference is a standing objection to the gospel, urged by those who have not felt its power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall we continue in sin? The practice of sin as a habit is here raised."
2. "That grace may abound. Final clause with ingressive aorist subjunctive, to set free the superfluity of grace alluded to like putting money in circulation."
3. "Horrible thought and yet Paul faced it. There are occasionally so-called pietists who actually think that God's pardon gives them liberty to sin without penalty."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin is not 'per se', the cause of the glorifying God's grace, but 'per accidens': sin of itself is the cause of wrath, and not of grace; but God has been pleased to take an occasion of magnifying his grace, in the forgiveness of sin."
2. "For it is not by the commission of sin, but by the pardon of it, that the grace of God is glorified, or made to abound."
3. "Moreover, grace in conversion is glorified by putting a stop to the reign of sin, and not by increasing its power, which would be done by continuing in it; grace teaches men not to live in sin, but to abstain from it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle here sets himself more fully to vindicate his doctrine from the consequence above suggested."
2. "He had then only in strong terms denied and renounced it: here he removes the very foundation thereof."
