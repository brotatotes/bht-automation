## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If we attempt to make it more definite, ‘for sin,’ or ‘to that state, in which He suffered the punishment of sin,’ we shall lose the point of comparison, which lies in ‘to sin,’ and ‘to God.’"
2. "Our Lord at death passed into a state in which He had 'no more to do with sin' either as tempting Him, or as requiring to be atoned for, or as met by Him in daily contradiction which He endured from sinners."
3. "He liveth unto God, as being glorified by and with the Father, as entirely rid of conflict with sin and death, and having only God’s work to do, as waiting till, in the purposes of the Father, all things are put under Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
