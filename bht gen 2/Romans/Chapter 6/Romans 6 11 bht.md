# Romans 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believe that you have been acquitted from the guilt and condemnation of sin, and do not fear its damning power over you. Those who are in a state of spiritual ignorance may think they are spiritually alive, but when they experience the work of the Spirit of God, they understand their true state. The life of faith in Christ's righteousness brings glory to God and leads to eternal life with Him.
