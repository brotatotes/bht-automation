# Romans 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The call is clear - do not let sin rule over you, even in your mortal body. While our bodies are subject to death, they should not be subject to the power of sin. We have the ability to resist and overcome the reign of sin, and instead live in obedience to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "The word [τῷ θνητῷ ὑμ . σώματι] inserted to remind us of the other life, and the shortness of the conflict, or... to point out that it is dishonourable to us to serve Sin, whose reign is confined to the mortal body."
3. "The Apostle wishes to keep in view the connection between sin and death on the one hand, and that συνζῆν which is freed from death on the other."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though sin dwells in us, it is inconsistent that it should be so vigorous as to exercise its reigning power; for the power of sanctification ought to be superior to it, so that our life may testify that we are really the members of Christ."
2. "The nature of man is said to be corporeal, because he is destitute of celestial grace, and is only a sort of empty shadow or image."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is no matter of comparison between reigning and indwelling merely, but between reigning and being deposed." 
2. "The connection with Romans 6:11 suggests that this ‘mortal body’ is under the power of sin; but it is the mortality of the body that is emphasized, in contrast with the life we have in fellowship with Christ who dieth no more (Romans 6:9); hence, to allow sin to reign there is contrary to living ‘unto God in Christ Jesus’ (Romans 6:11)."
3. "The reign of sin in our mortal body would have as its aim obedience to the desires of the body, which are sinful, because we are sinful. Obeying these is living unto sin, hence opposed to the principle of Romans 6:11."

2. "The reign of sin is over with you."
3. "Self-indulgence is inconsistent with trust in the vicarious atonement."

2. "They are indeed dead to sin, but sin is not dead in them; it struggles, it makes war, leads captive, and threatens absolute and universal dominion."
3. "The lusts of the body, or flesh, which are therefore sometimes called fleshly lusts, are many, and have great power and influence; and may be said to be obeyed, when provision is made to fulfil them, when these are the business of a man's life, and the whole of his conversation is taken up in them, without struggle against them, or opposition to them; and herein lies the reign of sin."

### John Wesley:
1. Let not sin reign even in your mortal body — It must be subject to death, but it need not be subject to sin.
