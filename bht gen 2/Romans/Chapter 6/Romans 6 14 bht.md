# Romans 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are assured that sin will not have dominion over them because it lacks the authority and strength to do so. Instead, they are under grace, freed from the bondage of the law, which only exposes sin but does not empower them to overcome it. This gospel dispensation of grace provides the means for believers to experience complete victory over sin through the powerful work of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, it is not only their privilege but also their duty to fight against sin and live a life in abhorrence of it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stress is on κυριεύσει: q. d. 'Your efforts to live a life of freedom from the tyranny of sin shall not be frustrated by its after all tyrannizing over you and asserting its dominion.'"
2. "It will be seen from the above, that I interpret κυριεύσει rather of the eventual triumph of sin by obtaining domination over us, than of its reducing us under its subjection as servants in this life."
3. "The assertion being merely that of the general matter of fact, about which there can be no question, that we (Christians) are not under the law, placed in a covenant of legal obedience, but under grace, placed in a covenant of justification by faith and under the promise of the indwelling Spirit subjects of a higher law even the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To be 'under the law' is, first, to be under its claim to entire obedience; and so, next under its curse for the breach of these."
2. "To be 'under grace,' is to be under the glorious canopy and saving effects of that 'grace which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord'."
3. "The curse of the law has been completely lifted from off them; they are made 'the righteousness of God in Him'; and they are 'alive unto God through Jesus Christ'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For sin ... - The propensity or inclination to sin."
2. "But it may be asked here, What is meant by this declaration? Does it mean that Christians are absolved from all the obligations of the law? ... The apostle means to say that Christians are not under the law as legalists, or as attempting to be justified by it."
3. "Justification by works would destroy no sin, would check no evil propensity, but would leave a man to all the ravages and riotings of unsubdued passion. ... But under grace - Under a scheme of mercy, the design and tendency of which is to subdue sin, and destroy it."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is then no doubt but that he meant here to indicate some freedom from the very law of God."
2. "The yoke of the law cannot do otherwise than tear and bruise those who carry it."
3. "For how much soever we may be harassed by the stings of sin, it cannot yet overcome us, for we are enabled to conquer it by the Spirit of God; and then, being under grace, we are freed from the rigorous requirements of the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The future tense is that of confident assertion, and hence of consolation."
2. "'Freedom from the law gives you so little freedom to sin, that it is only by the exercise of grace upon you that your freedom from sin has begun.'"
3. "If the reason sin will not lord it over us, is that we are not under the law but under grace, then grace sanctifies us, not the law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall not have dominion" - [It means] "shall not lord it over you," even if not yet wholly dead.


### John Gill:
1. "It is an absolute promise, that sin shall not have the dominion over believers; and means not its damning power, though that is took away, but its tyrannical, governing power."
2. "Now this is a noble argument why saints should use their members as weapons of righteousness for God and against sin; since they are sure of being conquerors, and are secure from the tyrannical government of sin over them."
3. "The apostle's view in this is, to affect the saints with their present privilege, and to engage them in a cheerful conflict with sin, and to stir up in them an abhorrence of living in it." (42 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Sin shall not have dominion over you — It has neither right nor power."
2. "For ye are not under the law — A dispensation of terror and bondage, which only shows sin, without enabling you to conquer it."
3. "But under grace — Under the merciful dispensation of the gospel, which brings complete victory over it to every one who is under the powerful influences of the Spirit of Christ."
