# Romans 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Does our freedom from the law mean that we can now freely sin and continue in it? This objection arises from a misunderstanding, as believers may not be under the law in the same way as before, but they are still under its authority as it is in the hands of Christ. Misinterpreting grace as a license for sinning reveals a lack of understanding about the true nature and effects of God's grace. Those who make such arguments fail to comprehend the power of grace in transforming our hearts and leading us to live a life of holiness.
