# Romans 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we choose to obey sin, we become its willing servants, bound by its laws and doomed to its consequences. Yet, if we instead choose to offer ourselves as servants to righteousness, we will experience the blessedness and eternal life that come with a life of holiness. The choice is clear - there is no middle ground. Loyalty to Christ does not allow for occasional allegiance to sin. Our service to God should be wholehearted and unwavering, for it is through obedience to Him that we will find true righteousness.
