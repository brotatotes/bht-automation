# Romans 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You have been set free from the bondage of sin and now obey the teachings of the Gospel from the depths of your heart. The apostle Paul is not glorifying your past life as servants of sin, but rather expressing gratitude that you have been transformed and delivered into a new form of doctrine. This Gospel, which is sound and godly, acts as a pattern or exemplar for both ministers and followers alike. Your obedience is not superficial, but genuine and sincere, like molten metal taking the shape of the mould into which it is poured.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ye obeyed from the heart that form of teaching"
2. "most probably used of the practical norma agendi accompanying the doctrine of the gospel"
3. "to which ye were delivered... after which they were to be fashioned"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of Sin—that is, that this is a state of things now past and gone."
2. "Ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you—rather, 'whereunto ye were delivered' (Margin), or cast, as in a mould."
3. "The idea is, that the teaching to which they had heartily yielded themselves had stamped its own impress upon them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ground of the thanksgiving was not that they had been the slaves of sin; but it is, that notwithstanding this, or although they had been thus, yet that they were now obedient."
2. "To give thanks that people were sinners would contradict the whole spirit of this argument, and of the Bible. But to give thanks that although people had been sinners, yet that now they had become obedient; that is, that great sinners had become converted, is in entire accordance with the spirit of the Bible, and with propriety."
3. "No other obedience is genuine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The thanksgiving bear only on the second proposition, ye obeyed, etc., and regarding the first as inserted by way of contrast or background to the salutary moral change."
2. "Ye were the servants of sin, but are so no more."
3. "The Pauline type of teaching as contrasted with the Judaistic forms of Christianity."

### John Calvin:
1. "We may hence learn, that we are not freed from the bondage of the law that we may sin; for the law does not lose its dominion, until the grace of God restores us to him, in order to renew us in righteousness."
2. "Christ inwardly forms our souls in a better way, than when the law constrains them by threatening and terrifying us."
3. "He does not indeed allow his people unbridled freedom, that they might frisk about without any restraint, like horses let loose in the fields; but he brings them to a regular course of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That ye were the servants of sin. ‘Were’ is emphatic; this state is past, and for this the Apostle is thankful, although this negative side of salvation cannot be separated from the positive."
2. "But ye obeyed from the heart. The moral change at conversion made their true, internal attitude that of obedience."
3. "That form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered. This rendering is greatly to be preferred to that of the E. V. The change to the passive suggests the Divine agency in delivering them to this ‘form of teaching.’ This phrase, literally, ‘type of teaching,’ is interpreted: (1) of Christian doctrine in general; which is objectionable, because in that case ‘type’ would be unmeaning; (2) of the Pauline teaching, over against the Judaistic forms of Christianity; (3) of the ideal, or, ‘pattern,’ presented by the gospel, the ethical rule of life it gives. The second interpretation is the best."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul is not grateful that they were once slaves of sin, but only that, though they once were, they turned from that state."
2. "To that form of doctrine whereunto ye were delivered (εις ον παρεδοθητε τυπον διδαχης)."
3. "It is hardly proper to take 'form' here to refer to Paul's gospel (Romans 2:16), possibly an allusion to the symbolism of baptism which was the outward sign of the separation."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the apostle must be thought to give thanks to God for that these persons had been the servants of sin, than which nothing is more disagreeable to God, or caused more shame to themselves; but that inasmuch as they had been in the drudgery and service of sin, they were now freed from it."
2. "By 'the form of doctrine,' is meant the Gospel, which is the 'doctrine' of the Scriptures, of Christ and his apostles, and is sound and according to godliness; and is a 'form,' or contains a summary and compendium of truths, and is a pattern or exemplar, according to which ministers are to preach, and people to hear and receive."
3. "And this obedience did not lie in words, or proceed on mercenary views, and in a hypocritical way; but was 'from the heart'; and was real and sincere." (38 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "The form of doctrine into which ye have been delivered..."
2. "...our minds, all pliant and ductile, should be conformed to the gospel precepts..."
3. "...as liquid metal, take the figure of the mould into which they are cast."
