# Romans 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being set free from sin means being liberated from its bondage and the wrath of God. This comes through the revelation of God's righteousness in Christ and is received by faith. Through justification, God forgives all past sin and freely accepts the sinner. Additionally, the gift of the Holy Spirit brings a sense of God's love and new inward life. As a result, believers are now able to serve righteousness freely, embracing the freedom and joy that comes from living in accordance with God's ways.
