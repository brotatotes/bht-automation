# Romans 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to grasp the importance of serving righteousness rather than being enslaved by sin, it is necessary to consider various illustrations. One analogy used is that of slavery, which though imperfect, serves to convey the spiritual truth. Believers ought to apply the same level of devotion they once had for sin to serving God. This transformation requires recognizing the weakness of human nature that impedes understanding. True righteousness involves not just conforming to God's will, but embracing His divine nature. Believers are called to redirect their efforts towards righteousness, employing the same members previously enslaved to sin.

"As ye were formerly ready with all your faculties to serve sin, it is hence sufficiently evident how wretchedly enslaved and bound did your depravity hold you to itself: now then ye ought to be equally prompt and ready to execute the commands of God; let not your activity in doing good be now less than it was formerly in doing evil."
3. "By righteousness I understand the law or the rule of a holy life, the design of which is sanctification, as the case is when the faithful devote themselves to serve God in purity."
