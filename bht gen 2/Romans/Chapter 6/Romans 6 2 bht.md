# Romans 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we are dead to sin, it signifies that it has no influence over us. Just as a dead person is unaffected by the living, we who have died to sin are no longer bound to its grip. This profound change is not to be taken lightly, for it is through the grace of Christ that we have been set free. It would be absurd to think that such grace would nourish our vices. Instead, as justified and sanctified individuals, we are called to live lives that reflect God's holiness, serving Him with hearts devoted to righteous living.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "An acknowledged fact in the Christian life follows, which precludes our persisting in our sin."
2. "We became as separate from and apathetic towards sin as the dead corpse is separate from and apathetic towards the functions and stir of life."
3. "How shall we live any longer [in sin]? It implies introition, and not merely sympathy.‚Äù

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God forbid‚Äî"That be far from us"; the instincts of the new creature revolting at the thought."
2. "We who died to sin (as presently to be explained), how shall we live any longer therein?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To be dead to a thing is a strong expression denoting that it has no influence over us. A man that is dead is uninfluenced and unaffected by the affairs of this life."
2. "It is just as absurd to suppose that a Christian should desire to live in sin as that a dead man should put forth the actions of life."
3. "The best way to silence objections is, sometimes, to show that they violate the feelings of all Christians, and that therefore the objection must be wrong."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing can be more inconsistent than that the grace of Christ, the repairer of our righteousness, should nourish our vices."
2. "The faithful are never reconciled to God without the gift of regeneration; nay, we are for this end justified, ‚Äî that we may afterwards serve God in holiness of life."
3. "It would then be a most strange inversion of the work of God were sin to gather strength on account of the grace which is offered to us in Christ; for medicine is not a feeder of the disease, which it destroys."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let it never be. Comp. note in chap. Romans 3:4. Here, as there, an indignant denial: ‚Äòlet it not be that we continue in sin.‚Äô"
2. "How shall we who. ‚ÄòWe who are of such a kind as.‚Äô"
3. "Died to sin. Not, ‚Äòare dead.‚Äô When this death ‚Äòwith respect to sin‚Äô took place is shown in Romans 6:3-4. There is throughout an implied appeal to Christian consciousness, as witnessing the ethical change. The remission of sin, which is signified and sealed by baptism, involves a death to sin. The reference, therefore, is to the time of baptism, which, in the Apostolic church, usually coincided with conversion and justification. This is preferable to the view that the reference is to Christ‚Äôs death and our fellowship in it. Observe, that the Apostle assumes the inseparable connection between justification and sanctification, and yet distinguishes them; the justified man is sanctified, not the reverse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
I apologize for the confusion. Here is the quote from the original commentary:
1. "Died to sin (Œ±œÄŒµŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ Œ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ±). Second aorist active of Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏ŒΩŒ∑œÉŒ∫œâ and the dative case. When we surrendered to Christ and took him as Lord and Saviour. Qualitative relative (ŒøŒπœÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ, we the very ones who). How (œÄœâœÇ). Rhetorical question."

### John Gill:
1. "God forbid,.... By which he expresses his abhorrence of such a practice, and that this was a consequence which did not follow from the premises, and was far enough from his thoughts, and which he had in the greatest detestation."
2. "There is a death for sin, a death in sin, and a death to sin; the latter is here mentioned, and persons may be said to be 'dead to sin', both as justified and sanctified"
3. "To live in sin, is to live after the dictates of corrupt nature... those who are dead to sin, cannot thus live in it." (69 words)

### John Wesley:
1. Dead to sin ‚Äî Freed both from the guilt and from the power of it.
