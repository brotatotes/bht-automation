# Romans 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called as Christians to turn away from sin and live a life that is pleasing to God. We are to be dead to sin, separate from its power and influence. Grace does not nourish our vices; instead, it transforms us to serve God in holiness. Living in sin is detestable to those who have experienced God's grace. We are freed both from the guilt and power of sin, justified and sanctified to live a life that honors God. Let us strive to live in righteousness, for we are dead to sin and alive in Christ.

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing can be more inconsistent than that the grace of Christ, the repairer of our righteousness, should nourish our vices."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Died to sin (Œ±œÄŒµŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ Œ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ±). Second aorist active of Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏ŒΩŒ∑œÉŒ∫œâ and the dative case."
2. "When we surrendered to Christ and took him as Lord and Saviour."
3. "Qualitative relative (ŒøŒπœÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ, we the very ones who)."

### John Gill:
1. "Persons may be said to be 'dead to sin', both as justified and sanctified: justified persons are discharged from it; it cannot hurt them, or exert its damning power over them; it is crucified, abolished, and made an end of by Christ."
2. "Sanctified persons are dead to sin; sin is no longer a pleasure to them, it is loathsome and abominable; it does not reign, it has not the dominion over them; it is subdued in them, and its power weakened; and as to the members of the flesh, and deeds of the body, it is mortified."
3. "Living in sin is detestable to gracious minds, it seems impossible they should live in it; which is suggested by this question, 'how shall we?'"

### John Wesley:
1. Dead to sin ‚Äî Freed both from the guilt and from the power of it.
