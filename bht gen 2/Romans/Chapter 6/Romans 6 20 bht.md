# Romans 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we were slaves to sin, we were completely detached from righteousness. We had no desire for righteousness and lived in opposition to it. But now, having been set free from sin's bondage, it is only logical that we should also be liberated from unrighteousness. Let us be as devoted and passionate in serving God as we once were in serving the devil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[γάρ] introduces a motive for the foregoing ... for Rom 6:22 is the contrast to it." 
2. "For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in relation to righteousness."
3. "There is doubtless a latent irony in the use of ἐλεύθεροι here; but it must not be brought out too strongly: it does not appear, till the end of that freedom is declared."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Since no servant can serve two masters, much less where their interests come into deadly collision, and each demands the whole man, so, while ye were in the service of Sin ye were in no proper sense the servants of Righteousness, and never did it one act of real service: whatever might be your conviction of the claims of Righteousness, your real services were all and always given to Sin: Thus had ye full proof of the nature and advantages of Sin's service."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye were free from righteousness - That is, in your former state, you were not at all under the influence of righteousness."
2. "It settles the question; and proves that they had no native goodness."
3. "The argument which is implied here rather than expressed is, that now they ought to be equally free from sin, since they had become released from their former bondage, and had become the servants of another master."

### John Calvin:
1. "For when ye were, etc. He still repeats the difference, which he had before mentioned, between the yoke of righteousness and that of sin; for these two things, sin and righteousness, are so contrary, that he who devotes himself to the one, necessarily departs from the other."
2. "He calls those free from righteousness who are held by no bridle to obey righteousness. This is the liberty of the flesh, which so frees us from obedience to God, that it makes us slaves to the devil."
3. "Wretched then and accursed is this liberty, which with unbridled or rather mad frenzy, leads us exultingly to our destruction."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only freedom they had was this sad freedom as respects the right service; the deepest slavery in fact."
2. "To be servants of righteousness is the truest freedom."
3. "They were uninfluenced by its demands."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Free in regard of righteousness  (ελευθερο τη δικαιοσυνη). Ye wore no collar of righteousness, but freely did as ye pleased. They were "free." Note dative case, personal relation, of δικαιοσυνη. 

### John Gill:
1. "When they were employed in the drudgery of sin, they were free from righteousness."
