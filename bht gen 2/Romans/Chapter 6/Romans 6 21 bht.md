# Romans 6:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle, in discussing those things, presents them as if they were far away in the past. This distancing language indicates that what he is referring to is no longer relevant or significant in the present. The notion of distance underscores the idea that these things are no longer a part of the reader's life and should be regarded as separate and removed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But this though good as far as construction is concerned, is inconsistent with the N. T. meaning of Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄœåœÇ, which is ‚Äòactions,‚Äô the fruit of the man considered as the tree, not ‚Äòwages,‚Äô or ‚Äòreward,‚Äô the fruit of his actions."
2. "So that I much prefer (2) the punctuation of Theod. Mops, Theodoret, Theophyl., Luth., Melancth., Koppe, Flatt, Tholuck, R√ºckert, K√∂llner, Olsh., Lachm., Griesb., De Wette, al., placing the interrogation at œÑœåœÑŒµ, and making ·ºêœÜ  º Œø·º∑œÇ ŒΩ. ·ºêœÄŒ±ŒπœÉœá. the answer. What fruit then had ye at that time? (Things, deeds) of which ye are now ashamed."
3. "the reason of their present shame. For the end of those things is death (death in the widest sense, see note on Romans 6:16, physical, which has been the end of sin, in which we are all involved, and spiritual and eternal, which will be the end of actual sin if followed out)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What permanent advantage, and what abiding satisfaction, have those things yielded? The apostle answers his own question: 'Abiding satisfaction, did I ask? They have left only a sense of shame. Permanent advantage? 'The end of them is death.'"
2. "By saying they were 'now ashamed,' he makes it plain that he is not referring to that disgust at themselves, and remorse of conscience by which those who are the most helplessly 'sold under sin' are often stung to the quick; but that ingenuous feeling of self-reproach, which pierces and weighs down the children of God..."
3. "...as they think of the dishonor which their past life did to His name, the ingratitude it displayed, the violence it did to their own conscience, its deadening and degrading effects, and the death‚Äîthe 'second death'‚Äîto which it was dragging them down, when mere Grace arrested them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument here is drawn from the past experience which Christians have had in the ways of transgression. They have tried it; they know its effects; they have tasted its bitterness; they have reaped its fruits."
2. "It is implied here that having once experienced these effects, and knowing the tendency of sin, they will not indulge in it now."
3. "For the end - The tendency; the result. Those things lead to death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What fruit were ye having during your service of sin?" 
2. "The question is of having fruit, not of the quality of the fruit."

### John Calvin:
1. "Indeed the godly, as soon as they begin to be illuminated by the Spirit of Christ and the preaching of the gospel, do freely acknowledge their past life, which they have lived without Christ, to have been worthy of condemnation; and so far are they from endeavouring to excuse it, that, on the contrary, they feel ashamed of themselves."
2. "He intimates that we are possessed with extreme blind love for ourselves, when we are involved in the darkness of our sins, and think not that there is so much filth in us. The light of the Lord alone can open our eyes to behold the filthiness which lies hid in our flesh."
3. "He only then is imbued with the principles of Christian philosophy, who has well learnt to be really displeased with himself, and to be confounded with shame for his own wretchedness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‚ÄòWhat fruit therefore had ye then? Things whereof ye are now ashamed.‚Äô"
2. "the question in antithesis to Romans 6:21, is the having of fruit, not its quality"
3. "For the end of those things is death; here in its most comprehensive meaning in contrast with close of Romans 6:22."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What fruit then had ye at that time? Imperfect active, used to have. A pertinent question."
2. "Ashes in their hands now. They are ashamed now of the memory of them."
3. "The end of them is death."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin yields no real profit to the servants of it... nor is there any true pleasure in sin... nor is there any satisfaction in it... nor is there any true honour in sin." 
2. "When persons are wrought upon by the Spirit of God, they are ashamed of sin... the odious and detestable nature of sin... sin is hereby seen in its own proper colours, as exceeding sinful, loathsome, and abominable." 
3. "Not only shame will be the fruit of sin, but it will also issue in death... sin not only brings a spiritual or moral death on persons, on all the powers and faculties of their souls, and is followed with a corporeal death; but if grace prevent not, it will end in an eternal one."

### John Wesley:
1. Those things ‚Äî He speaks of them as afar off.
