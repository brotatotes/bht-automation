# Romans 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For every kind of sin, big or small, the wages paid in full is death. It includes the consequences of original sin and every act of wrongdoing. On the other hand, eternal life is not earned or deserved; it is a free gift bestowed by God. It is important to remember that the gift of God encompasses more than just eternal life. It may include the gift of righteousness, the grace of God in the process of regeneration and sanctification, or a combination of these, which ultimately leads to eternal life.
