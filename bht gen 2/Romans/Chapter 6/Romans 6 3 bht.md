# Romans 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have been baptized into Jesus Christ have also been baptized into his death. This baptism signifies our surrender to sin and our pledge to live for God. Through baptism, we participate in Christ's death and share in the benefits of his sacrifice. We are called to live a new life, dead to sin and alive in Christ. In baptism, we are united with Christ, drawing new spiritual life from him and being transformed by his Spirit to be more like him, conforming to his death and resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Or (supposing you do not assent to the argument in the last verse, see reff.) are ye ignorant (the foregoing axiom is brought out into recognition by the further statement of a truth universally acknowledged) that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?"
2. "The Apostle refers to an acknowledged fact, in the signification, and perhaps also in the manner of baptism that it put upon us a state of conformity with and participation in Christ."
3. "This state involves a death τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ even as He died τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ; the meaning being kept in the background, but all the while not lost sight of, that the benefits of His Death were likewise made ours by our introduction into the covenant."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whoso, then, has been baptized into Christ's death has formally surrendered the whole state and life of sin, as in Christ a dead thing. He has sealed himself to be not only 'the righteousness of God in Him,' but 'a new creature'."
2. "And since He was 'made sin' and 'a curse for us', 'bearing our sins in His own body on the tree,' and 'rising again for our justification', our whole sinful case and condition, thus taken up into His Person, has been brought to an end in His death."
3. "He has bidden farewell, by baptism into Christ's death, to his entire connection with sin. 'How,' then, 'can he live any longer therein?' The two things are as contradictory in the fact as they are in the terms."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By our very profession made in baptism, we have renounced sin, and have pledged ourselves to live to God."
2. "The act of baptism denotes dedication to the service of him in whose name we are baptized."
3. "Our baptism had a strong resemblance to his death. By that he became insensible to the things of the world; by baptism we in like manner become dead to sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The indicative mood presupposes an acquaintance with the moral nature of baptism, and a consequent absurdity in the idea of persisting in sin."
2. "As He died to sin, so we die to sin, just as if we were literally members of His body."
3. "Such is the image of my life in the midst of the world since I believed in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ destroys sin in his people."
2. "It is beyond any question, that we put on Christ in baptism."
3. "When we become partakers of the grace of Christ, immediately the efficacy of his death appears."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If this is doubtful, then I appeal directly to your experimental knowledge."
2. "Baptism into Christ Jesus was the sign of participation in Him, union with Him, and the Apostle asserts that they all knew that this union meant fellowship with His death, so that they were baptized into his death; hence with Him they die unto sin."
3. "The reference to baptism does not suggest baptismal regeneration; it both connects and distinguishes baptism and regeneration, as the visible sign and the invisible grace of the renewing Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Were baptized unto Christ or in Christ."
2. "Baptism is the public proclamation of one's inward spiritual relation to Christ attained before the baptism."
3. "Into his death," "unto his death," "in relation to his death."

### John Gill:
1. "You must know this, you cannot be ignorant of it, that whoever were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death: and therefore must be dead to sin, and consequently ought not to live, nor can they live in sin."
2. "The true meaning of the phrase 'baptized into Christ', I take to be, is to be baptized purely for the sake of Christ, in imitation of him, who has set us an example, and because baptism is an ordinance of his."
3. "Such who are thus baptized, are 'baptized into his death'; they not only resemble Christ in his sufferings and death, but they declare their faith in the death of Christ, and also share in the benefits of his death; such as peace, pardon, righteousness, and atonement."

### John Wesley:
1. "As many as have been baptized into Jesus Christ have been baptized into his death."
2. "In baptism we, through faith, are ingrafted into Christ; and we draw new spiritual life from this new root, through his Spirit, who fashions us like unto him, and particularly with regard to his death and resurrection."
