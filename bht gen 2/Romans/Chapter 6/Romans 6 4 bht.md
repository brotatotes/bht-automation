# Romans 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through baptism, we are not only symbolically buried with Christ, but also sever our connection with our sinful past. Just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, we too are called to walk in a newness of life. The act of baptism represents our death to sin and our resurrection to a life that is holy and transformed.
