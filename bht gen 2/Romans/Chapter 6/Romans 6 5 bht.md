# Romans 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are united to Christ in his death and resurrection, growing together like a field of grain. Through our union with him, we die to sin and experience newness of life. Baptism symbolizes our likeness to Christ in his death and serves as a prophecy of the new life we have in him. We are implanted together with Christ, bearing the fruit of the Spirit and experiencing the power of his resurrection. Surely, our conformity to his death will be accompanied by knowing the power of his resurrection.
