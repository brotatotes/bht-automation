# Romans 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to put to death their old sinful nature, which encompasses the corruption and depravity that has spread throughout all aspects of their being. Through their union with Christ, this old nature is gradually crucified and killed. As a result, they are no longer to serve sin or indulge in its desires, but instead, they are to destroy the sinful behaviors that are associated with their old selves. This ongoing process of transformation leads to a life marked by holiness and obedience to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The great key to our text is the ref. Gal. As the death of the Lord Jesus was by crucifixion, the Apostle uses the same expression of our death to our former sinful self, which is not only by virtue of, but also in the likeness of, Christ’s death, as signal, as entire, as much a death of cutting off and putting to shame and pain."
2. "The aim and end of the συσταυρωθῆναι is that the body of sin might be annulled, meaning that it should no longer be under the dominion of sin."
3. "The word καταργηθῇ does not appear to signify absolute annihilation, but rather being rendered powerless, annulled as far as regards activity and energy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our old selves, all that we were in our old unregenerate condition, before union with Christ."
2. "The body of sin, as it dwells in us in our present embodied state, under the law of the fall."
3. "To the end that henceforth we should not serve sin, be in bondage to sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is a new illustration drawn from the fact that by his crucifixion our corrupt nature has been crucified also, or put to death; and that thus we should be free from the servitude of sin."
2. "And the apostle here by the expression 'is crucified' doubtless refers to the painful and protracted struggle which everyone goes through when his evil propensities are subdued; when his corrupt nature is slain; and when, a converted sinner, he gives himself up to God."
3. "Sin becomes enervated, weakened, and finally annihilated, by the work of the Cross."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The old, unrenewed self. Paul views the Christian before his union with Christ, as, figuratively, another person."
2. "The phrase body of sin denotes the body belonging to, or ruled by, the power of sin, in which the members are instruments of unrighteousness."
3. "Death and its consequences are used as the general illustration of the spiritual truth."

### John Calvin:
1. "The old man, as the Old Testament is so called with reference to the New; for he begins to be old, when he is by degrees destroyed by a commencing regeneration."
2. "This old man... is fastened to the cross of Christ, for by its power he is slain... we cannot be otherwise put to death than by partaking of his death."
3. "The body of sin... does not mean flesh and bones, but the corrupted mass... man, left to his own nature, is a mass made up of sin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This refers to what follows, the whole defining the last clause of Romans 6:5."
2. "Our sinful nature is here personified, almost equivalent to ‘flesh’ in the ethical sense."
3. "Sin is conceived as an organism, with many members; the whole is but another form of the expression ‘our old man.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The body of which sin has taken possession" (Sanday and Headlam), the body marked by sin.
2. "Purpose clause with του and the present active infinitive of δουλευω, continue serving sin (as slaves)." 
3. "Adds 'slavery' to living in sin."

### John Gill:
1. "By the old man is meant the corruption of nature... it lives and dwells in them; it has spread itself over the whole man; it rules and governs in men."
2. "This is so crucified by the death, and at the cross of Christ, as that it cannot exert its damning power over believers; and is so crucified by the Spirit and grace of Christ in them, as that it cannot reign over them, or exercise its domineering power over them."
3. "That henceforth we should not serve sin; not that it should not be in us, but that we should not serve it, make provision for it, indulge it and obey it, in the lusts thereof."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our old man — Coeval with our being, and as old as the fall; our evil nature; a strong and beautiful expression for that entire depravity and corruption which by nature spreads itself over the whole man, leaving no part uninfected."
2. "This in a believer is crucified with Christ, mortified, gradually killed, by virtue of our union with him."
3. "That the body of sin — All evil tempers, words, and actions, which are the 'members' of the 'old man,' Colossians 3:5, might be destroyed."
