# Romans 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as a man who has died is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage, those who have died to sin through Christ are also freed from the guilt and power of sin. In the same way that death separates a person from the authority of their former master, believers have been set free from the dominion of sin. This freedom does not mean that we no longer struggle with sin, but rather that sin no longer has power over us and we are no longer under its control.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For, as a man that is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage: so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage."
2. "I express δεδικ . by this periphrasis in both cases, because I believe that all this is implied in it: ‘is acquitted,’ ‘has his quittance,’ from sin, so that Sin (personified) has no more claims on him, either as a creditor or as a master: cannot detain him for debt, nor sue him for service."
3. "A larger reference is thus given to δεδικ . than the purposes of the present argument, which is treating of the power, not the guilt of sin, required: but that it is so, lies in the nature of ἁμαρτία, the service of which is guilt, and the deliverance from whose service necessarily brings with it acquittal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As death dissolves all claims, so the whole claim of sin, not only to 'reign unto death,' but to keep its victims in sinful bondage, has been discharged once for all, by the believer's penal death in the death of Christ."
2. "He is no longer a 'debtor to the flesh to live after the flesh' (Romans 8:12)."
3. "The believer has been set free, justified, and acquired his discharge from sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When a man dies he is exempt from the power and dominion of his master, of him who reigned over him."
2. "The Christian being now dead to sin, on the same principle, is released from the control of his former master, sin."
3. "The design of the apostle is not to say that the Christian is perfect, but that sin has ceased to have dominion over him, as a master ceases to have power over a slave when he is dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As a man that is dead is acquitted and released from bondage among men, so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage" (Alford).
2. "Just as the dead person sins no more, being released from sin as from a legal claim" (Commentary).
3. "A man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage" (Alford).

### John Calvin:
1. "For if death destroys all the actions of life, we who have died to sin ought to cease from those actions which it exercised during its life."
2. "If thou art a Christian, there must appear in thee an evidence of a fellowship as to the death of Christ; the fruit of which is, that thy flesh is crucified together with all its lusts; but this fellowship is not to be considered as not existing, because thou findest that the relics of the flesh still live in thee; but its increase ought to be diligently labored for, until thou arrivest at the goal."
3. "It is indeed well with us, if our flesh is continually mortified; nor is it a small attainment, when the reigning power, being taken away from it, is wielded by the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘He that died’ is more literal, but ‘hath died’ better expresses the relation to what follows."
2. "The word ‘justified’ is to be taken here in its strictly legal sense, absolved, acquitted, freed."

### John Gill:
1. "This is not to be understood of a natural or a corporeal death; for this is the effect of sin, and is inflicted by way of punishment for it, on Christless persons."
2. "But here it is to be understood of a spiritual or mystical death, and of persons who are dead to the law, by the body of Christ; dead to sin by the sacrifice and grace of Christ."
3. "Such are 'freed from sin'; not from the being of it; nor from the burden of it; nor from a continual war with it; nor from slips and falls into it; no, not even freed from it, in the most solemn services and acts of religion; but they are freed from the dominion of it, from servitude to it, and also from the guilt of it, and from obligation to punishment on account of it."

### John Wesley:
1. For he that is dead — With Christ. Is freed from the guilt of past, and from the power of present, sin, as dead men from the commands of their former masters.
