# Romans 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In light of our union with Christ, we have died to sin and been planted together in his likeness. This death to sin involves conforming to his death and dying to our sinful nature. Through faith, we believe that this death will lead to resurrection with Christ and a life lived in fellowship with him. This fellowship is not only about justification and sanctification but also the experience of the highest pleasure and consummate happiness in intimate communion with him.
