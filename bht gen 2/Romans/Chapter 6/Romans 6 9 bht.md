# Romans 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, we can be certain that there is no need for Him to die again, as His death was a complete atonement for our sins. His resurrection confirms the efficacy of His sacrifice, putting away sin forever. This truth refutes the notion of a repeated sacrificial offering, as Christ's death on the cross was a sufficient and once-for-all sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This and the following verse explain what sort of a life with Christ is meant, by what we know of the Resurrection-life of Christ himself."
2. "The only difficulty here is in οὐκ ἔτι κυριεύει, as implying that Death had dominion over Christ, which we know it had not."
3. "But this vanishes, when we remember that our Lord, by submitting to Death, virtually, and in the act of death, surrendered Himself into the power of Death."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him." 
2. "Though Christ's death was in the most absolute sense a voluntary act, that voluntary surrender gave death such rightful 'dominion over Him' as dissolved its dominion over us."
3. "But this once past, 'death hath,' even in that sense, 'dominion over Him no more.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He seems to imply that death once ruled over Christ; and indeed when he gave himself up to death for us, he in a manner surrendered and subjected himself to its power; it was however in such a way that it was impossible that he should be kept bound by its pangs, so as to succumb to or to be swallowed up by them."
2. "He, therefore, by submitting to its dominion, as it were, for a moment, destroyed it for ever."
3. "The meaning is, that Christ, who now vivifies the faithful by his Spirit, or breathes his own life into them by his secret power from heaven, was freed from the dominion of death when he arose, that by virtue of the same dominion he might render free all his people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Knowing; ‘since we know.’ The ground of our belief is the knowledge of His enduring life, after His triumphant resurrection."
2. "Being raised from the dead. The resurrection is the pledge of His enduring life."
3. "Hath dominion over him no more. It had dominion over Him, as God decreed (chap. Romans 5:8-10) and as He voluntarily gave Himself up to it, but there its power ended. The sentence stands independently."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Dieth no more  (ουκετ αποθνησκε). "Christ's particular death occurs but once" (Shedd). See Hebrews 10:10. A complete refutation of the "sacrificial" character of the "mass." 

### John Gill:
1. "Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead,.... That Christ is risen from the dead, is a certain fact, well attested, thoroughly known, and firmly believed."
2. "There is no need of his dying again, his death having been a full atonement and expiation of all the sins and transgressions of his people."
3. "Both on account of the dignity of his person, as the Son of God, and the virtue and efficacy of his sacrifice, as the surety of his people, having put away sin for ever by it."
