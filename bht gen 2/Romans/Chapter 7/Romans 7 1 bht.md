# Romans 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, are addressed in this passage, implying that they have some knowledge of their freedom from the law. The apostle continues to explain and defend the principle that the law is no longer binding. He compares the former state under the law to the present state of believers, seeking to detach Jewish believers from their attachment to the Mosaic law. This truth is so clear that no one can doubt it, as the law is considered dead when it is abrogated and no longer in full force.
