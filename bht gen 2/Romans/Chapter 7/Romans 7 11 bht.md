# Romans 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandment has the power to excite doubt and objection while also stirring up lust for forbidden things. Sin takes advantage of this and deceives, promising life but ultimately leading to death. The experience of being deceived and led astray by sin is universal, as the law exposes our departure from the right course and reveals the darkness of our own hearts. Sin is like a tempter, luring us away from the path of righteousness, and then like an accuser, condemning us for our transgressions. It is sin that deceives and kills, leading us away from life and hope.
