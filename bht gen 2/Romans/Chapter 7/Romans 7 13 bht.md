# Romans 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law of God exposes the deep depravity within a person's heart, revealing the true nature of sin. This revelation shows that sin is not caused by the law itself, but rather sin takes an opportunity through the law to bring about death. The law, being good, serves as a mirror that reflects the enormity and hideousness of sin. Sin, when provoked by the law, becomes exceedingly sinful, demonstrating its true character. Therefore, the purpose of the law is not to bring death, but to show the sinfulness and guilt of humanity apart from God's grace.
