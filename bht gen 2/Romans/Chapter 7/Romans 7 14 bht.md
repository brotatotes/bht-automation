# Romans 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
St. Paul's reference to being carnal should not be understood as his current state as a Christian, but rather as a comparison between his past state and his present one. In this contrast, the law, being spiritual, cannot bring about sanctification and peace in the fleshly nature of man. By saying he is sold under sin, Paul vividly portrays the total enslavement to sin, akin to the complete control a master has over a slave. These descriptions invite us to consider the journey of reasoning, groaning, striving, and ultimately finding freedom from legalism in the gospel.

### John Calvin:
1. "Since in human things there is no greater discord than between spirit and flesh, the law being spiritual and man carnal, what agreement can there be between the natural man and the law? Even the same as between darkness and light."
2. "The law requires a celestial and an angelic righteousness, in which no spot is to appear, to whose clearness nothing is to be wanting: but I am a carnal man, who can do nothing but oppose it."
3. "By this clause he shows what flesh is in itself; for man by nature is no less the slave of sin, than those bondmen, bought with money, whom their masters ill treat at their pleasure, as they do their oxen and their asses."

3. "Sold under sin (πεπραμενος υπο την αμαρτιαν). Perfect passive participle of πιπρασκω, old verb, to sell. Sin has closed the mortgage and owns its slave."

### John Gill:
1. "We who have a spiritual understanding of the law, who have been led into the true nature of it by the Spirit of God, know by experience that that itself is 'spiritual'; and therefore can never be the cause of sin or death."
2. "The law may be said to be 'spiritual', because it comes from the Spirit of God; and reaches to the spirit of man; it requires truth in the inward parts; spiritual service and obedience."
3. "The distinctions between flesh and spirit, the inward and the outward man, and the struggle there is between them, are to be found in none but regenerate persons; and to say no more, the thanksgiving for deliverance from sin by Christ can only come from such."

### John Wesley:
1. "I am carnal" - St. Paul, having compared together the past and present state of believers, that "in the flesh," Romans 7:5, and that "in the spirit," Romans 7:6, in answering two objections, (Is then the law sin? Romans 7:7, and, Is the law death? Romans 7:13,) interweaves the whole process of a man reasoning, groaning, striving, and escaping from the legal to the evangelical state.
2. "Sold under sin" - Totally enslaved; slaves bought with money were absolutely at their master's disposal.
