# Romans 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's words in this passage depict the internal struggle experienced by believers. We desire to do what is right, yet find ourselves falling into actions that go against our better judgment. This conflict between our renewed nature and remaining sinful tendencies is a common experience for all Christians. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing journey of sanctification, where we strive to align our will with God's and resist the power of sin. It is through the grace of God that we are able to continue growing and overcoming the battles within us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (a proof of this πεπράσθαι under sin, viz. not being able to do what I would, Rom 7:15-17) that which I perform (am in the habit of doing) I know not (act blindly, at the dictates of another: which is proper to a slave." 
2. "The meaning, ‘I approve not,’ introduced by Aug [45] and held by Erasm., Beza, Grot., Estius, Semler, al., is not sanctioned by usage, see note on 1 Corinthians 8:3, and would make the following clause almost a tautology): for (explanation of last assertion, shewing how such blind service comes to pass) not what I desire, that do I."
3. "but without power to draw it: -we have θέλω in the sense of to wish, 1Co 7:7; 1 Corinthians 7:32; 1 Corinthians 14:5; 2Co 12:20), but what I hate (= οὐ θέλω, Romans 7:19; no distinction in intensity between θέλω and μισῶ), that I do."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In obeying the impulses of my carnal nature I act the slave of another will than my own as a renewed man?"
2. "For not what I would (wish, desire) that do I, but what I hate that I do."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The prevailing propensity; the habitual fixed inclination of the mind of the Christian, is to do right. The evil course is hated, the right course is loved."
2. "The evil which is done is disapproved; is a source of grief; and the habitual desire of the mind is to avoid it, and be pure. This also distinguishes the Christian from the sinner."
3. "All are conscious of doing that, under the excitement of passion and prejudice, which their conscience and better judgment disapprove. A conflict thus exists, which is attended with as much metaphysical difficulty as the struggle in the Christian’s mind referred to here."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul says: 'What I carry out I do not recognize in its true nature, as a slave who ignorantly performs his master's behest without knowing its tendency or result.'" 
 2. "Rather desire than will in the sense of full determination, as is shown by I consent (ver. 16), and I delight in (ver. 22)." 
 3. "When I have acted [πρασσω] I find myself face to face with a result which my moral instinct condemns.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence the case of a regenerated man is the most suitable; for by this you may know how much is the contrariety between our nature and the righteousness of the law."
2. "For regeneration only begins in this life; the relics of the flesh which remain, always follow their own corrupt propensities, and thus carry on a contest against the Spirit."
3. "Is not a Christian, yea, the best, in this world carnal, as well as spiritual? Is he not 'sold under sin?' that is, subjected to a condition, in which he is continually annoyed, tempted, hindered, restrained, checked, and seduced by the depravity and corruption of his nature; and in which he is always kept far below what he aims at, seeks and longs for."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thus one thing dawns upon him that he acts in gloomy self-distraction, and in contradiction of a better but helpless desire and repugnance."
2. "The main question here is respecting these two contrasted verbs, 'will' (or, 'wish') and 'hate.' Some strengthen the former into 'love,' in the interest of an exclusive reference to the regenerate; others weaken the latter into 'do not wish.' We prefer to regard 'hate' as stronger than 'wish,' while 'practise' is stronger than 'do.' This suggests that the desire for good is less strong than the hatred of evil."
3. "To admit that an unregenerate man can use the language of this verse, is perfectly consistent with a belief in the depravity of the human will."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I know not (ου γινωσκω). 'I do not recognize' in its true nature. My spiritual perceptions are dulled, blinded by sin."
2. "The dual life pictured here by Paul finds an echo in us all, the struggle after the highest in us ('what I really wish,' ο θελω, to practise it steadily, πρασσω) and the slipping into doing (ποιω) 'what I really hate' (ο μισω) and yet sometimes do."
3. "It is the unregenerate man's experience, surviving at least in memory into regenerate days, and read with regenerate eyes" (Denney).

### John Gill:
1. "That which I do, I allow not...This is to be understood not of any notorious crime committed by him, and repeated again and again...but of internal lusts, the workings of corruptions in his heart."
2. "I do not approve of them, I dislike, abhor, and detest them; I cannot excuse or palliate them, but must condemn them."
3. "what he desired and willed was good, though he did it not...such a will as this is never to be found in unregenerate persons; this is from God, and the power of his grace."
