# Romans 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is no longer I who perform it, but sin that dwells in me. The apostle Paul's words here reveal a deep understanding of the inner conflict experienced by believers. He clarifies that the sinful actions he takes do not align with his true, spiritual self. Instead, he attributes them to the presence of indwelling sin. This opposition between the desired good and the actual performance of evil is a universal struggle, as seen in all who have experienced regeneration. Sin, like another person, exercises control and dominates the will, resulting in actions contrary to one's higher nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Now however, it is no longer I that perform it, but sin that dwelleth in me." 
2. "The not bearing this in mind has led to error in interpretation and doctrine: e.g. when it is supposed that the Christian is not responsible for his sins committed against his spiritual will and higher judgment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To explain this and the following statements, as many do...is to do painful violence to the apostle's language."
2. "That coexistence and mutual hostility of 'flesh' and 'spirit' in the same renewed man...is the true and only key to the language of this and the following verses."
3. "His sole object in thus expressing himself was to bring more vividly before his readers the conflict of two opposite principles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He means to say that he does not approve or love it in his present state, but that it is the result of his native propensities and passions."
2. "Thus, every Christian can say that he does not choose to do evil, but would wish to be perfect; that he hates sin, and yet that his corrupt passions lead him astray."
3. "This expression stands in contrast with another that occurs, where it is said that 'the Spirit of God dwells' in the Christian... The sense is, that he is strongly influenced by sin on the one hand, and by the Spirit on the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Now - no more [νυνι - ουκετι]. Not temporal, pointing back to a time when it was otherwise, but logical, pointing to an inference."
2. "After this statement you can no more maintain that, etc."
3. "I [εγω]. My personality proper; my moral self - consciousness which has approved the law (ver. 16) and has developed vague desires for something better."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is not the pleading of one excusing himself, as though he was blameless... but it is a declaration, by which he shows how very far he dissented from his own flesh in his spiritual feeling."
2. "For as long as man remains like himself, whatsoever he may be, he is justly deemed corrupt... Paul here denies that he is wholly possessed by sin; nay, he declares himself to be exempt from its bondage."
3. "Sin was in him as in a house or dwelling; it was an in-habiting sin, or that which is in-abiding or resident."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is no longer I that perform it, i.e., 'what I wish not.' I am a slave under sin, what 'I perform, I know not' (Romans 7:16)."
2. "The desire is powerless; the 'I' is enslaved."
3. "There is no sign of release, no assertion of power to do good of which the 'I' approves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But the dwelling in me sin." 
2. "Not my true self, my higher personality, but my lower self due to my slavery to indwelling sin." 
3. "To be saved from sin, a man must at the same time own it and disown it."

### John Gill:
1. "since he did not approve, but hated what he did, and willed the contrary, it was not he as spiritual, as born again, as a new man, a new creature, that did it"
2. "the old man, the carnal I, the evil present with him, the law in his members; which not only existed in him, and wrought in him, and that at times very strongly, but dwelt in him, had its abode in him"

### John Wesley:

3. "Makes, as it were, another person, and tyrannizes over me."
