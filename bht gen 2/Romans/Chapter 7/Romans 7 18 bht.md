# Romans 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The phrase in my flesh refers to the corrupt nature that exists in every person by default. This corrupt nature is not limited to the physical body or the soul, but rather extends throughout the entire being. It is a corruption that taints all aspects of our existence. By acknowledging that there is no inherent good in this flesh, the speaker highlights the need for divine grace and intervention.
