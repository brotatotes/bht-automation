# Romans 7:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage emphasizes that the source of sinful actions does not lie in the person's true self, but in the corrupted nature within them. This insight sheds light on the underlying cause of their sinful desires and behaviors, allowing them to acknowledge their responsibility for their struggles. By recognizing that it is the sinful nature, not the law of God or their renewed self, that drives these actions, they can work towards addressing the root issue of sin within them.

### Albert Barnes:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But if what I wish not, etc. Since this is the case (as Romans 7:19 shows), then the position of Romans 7:17 is sustained: it is no longer I, etc."
2. "The repetition in this clause is exact, but in the phrase ‘I wish,’ some emphasis rests on ‘I.’"
3. "This is taken by many as indicating a progress in thought. But there is no sign as yet of a more hopeful condition. The progress is still toward wretchedness, despite, or perhaps because of, this increased desire."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The same conclusion is formed here, as in Romans 7:17, not with any view to excuse himself from blame in sinning, but to trace the lusts of his heart, and the sins of his life, to the source and fountain of them, the corruption of his nature..."
2. "...to ascribe them to the proper cause of them, which was not the law of God, nor the new man, but sin that dwelt in him."
