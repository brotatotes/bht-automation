# Romans 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Paul acknowledges the presence of a law within him that opposes his desire to do good. This law is not the Mosaic law but refers to the internal struggle between his renewed nature and his sinful inclinations. He describes it as an inward constraining power, a constant rule of experience that hinders his efforts to live righteously. Despite his genuine intentions, he finds evil present within him, impeding his progress. This conflict emphasizes the need for transformation and redemption, as it is a shared experience among all humanity.
