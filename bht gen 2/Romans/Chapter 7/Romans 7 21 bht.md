# Romans 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whenever I desire to do good, I am met with a force within me, a law that compels me to fulfill its sinful desires. This law, arising from the corruption of nature, serves as the source and origin of all evil. It exerts a powerful influence, coercing me against my will, and preventing me from carrying out the good that I truly desire. Despite this struggle, there is a comfort in knowing that the law of God is on my side, encouraging and supporting me in my pursuit of righteousness.
