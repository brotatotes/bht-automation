# Romans 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The regenerate man delights in the law of God, finding pleasure in it rather than mere agreement. This delight stems from the work of the Holy Spirit in the renewed heart, where the inward man resides. The inward man, also referred to as the mind, is the spiritual part of the believer that is conscious of itself as an ethical personality. It is this inner self that rejoices in and is aligned with the law of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man—'from the bottom of my heart.'" 
2. "The word here rendered 'delight' is indeed stronger than 'consent' in Romans 7:16; but both express a state of mind and heart to which the unregenerate man is a stranger."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It indicates not only intellectual assent, but emotion, an emotion of pleasure in the contemplation of the Law."
2. "If this expression can be applied to an unrenewed man, there is, perhaps, not a single mark of a pious mind which may not with equal propriety be so applied."
3. "The 'inward man' is called elsewhere 'the new man' and denotes not the mere intellect, or conscience, but is a personification of the principles of action by which a Christian is governed; the new nature; the holy disposition; the inclination of the heart that is renewed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I delight in [συνηδομαι] . Lit., I rejoice with. Stronger than I consent unto (ver., 16). It is the agreement of moral sympathy."
2. "The inward man [τον εσω ανθρωπον] . The rational and moral I, the essence of the man which is conscious of itself as an ethical personality."
3. "Not to be confounded with the new man (Ephesians 4:24; Colossians 3:10). It is substantially the same with the mind (ver. 23)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here then you see what sort of division there is in pious souls, from which arises that contest between the spirit and the flesh, which Augustine in some place calls the Christian struggle."
2. "The inner man then is not simply the soul, but that spiritual part which has been regenerated by God, and the members signify the other remaining part."
3. "We in fact find a gradation in the way in which it [the law of sin] is set forth: in Romans 7:21, he calls it simply 'a law'; in this verse he first calls it 'another law in his members,' and then, 'the law of sin in his members.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Delight in' is stronger than 'agree with'...but must not be pressed too far."
2. "Before renewal by the Holy Spirit, the inner man, despite all its agreement with the law...is in a helpless condition."
3. "When the Christian is 'under the law,' his delight may be more pronounced, but so long as he seeks sanctification through the law, he is quite as helpless."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For I delight in the law of God."
2. "my real self 'after the inward man'"
3. "I rejoice with the law of God"

### John Gill:
1. "Only a regenerate man delights in the law of God; which he does, as it is fulfilled by Christ, who has answered all the demands of it."
2. "He serves it with his mind, of a ready mind freely, and without any constraint but that of love."
3. "The apostle adds, after the inward man; by which he means the renewed man, the new man, or new nature, formed in his soul; which had its seat in the inward part, is an internal principle... this in its nature is agreeable to the law of God, and according to this a regenerate man delights in it."

### John Wesley:
