# Romans 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul intimately understands the internal conflict that exists within himself. He recognizes the presence of two opposing forces at work: the law of sin, representing his sinful desires and bodily appetites, and the law of his mind, which aligns with God's righteousness. Although he acknowledges the goodness and truth of God's law, he finds himself unable to completely resist the allure of sin. This creates an ongoing battle within Paul, a struggle between his inclination towards good and his captivity to sin. Despite his earnest resistance, he acknowledges that sin still holds a measure of power over him.

3. "Here the apostle describes himself, when drawn under the power of his sinful nature, as forcibly seized and reluctantly dragged to his enemy's camp, from which he would gladly make his escape."

2. "The key to its Pauline usage is furnished by the contrast in 1 Corinthians 14:14-19, between speaking with a tongue and with the understanding [Ï„Ï‰ Î½Î¿Î¹] , and between the spirit and the understanding (ver. 14). There it is the faculty of reflective intelligence which receives and is wrought upon by the Spirit."
3. "The nouv mind is in the foreground. Bringing into captivity [Î±Î¹Ï‡Î¼Î±Î»Ï‰Ï„Î¹Î¶Î¿Î½Ï„Î±] . Only here, 2 Corinthians 10:5, and Luke 21:24. See on captives, Luke 4:18.

2. "The state of regenerate persons is a warfare, they have many enemies to combat with, as Satan and the world; but those of their own household, within themselves, in their own hearts, are the worst of all; there is a civil war in them."
3.

### John Wesley:
