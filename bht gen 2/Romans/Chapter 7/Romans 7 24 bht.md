# Romans 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The cry of a believer in the midst of a fierce internal battle is expressed in the exclamation, O wretched man that I am. This cry stems from the torment caused by the conflict between the flesh and the spirit. The believer, fully aware of their own desperate state, pleads for deliverance from the body of sin and death. This cry is not a mere wish, but an appeal for divine intervention. The weight of sin and corruption in their life prompts them to seek liberation from their wretchedness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The division of the man against himself, his inward conflict, and miserable state of captivity to sin in the flesh."
2. "The body of this death will mean, 'the body whose subjection to the law of sin brings about this state of misery.'"
3. "The cry is uttered in full consciousness of the deliverance which Christ has effected."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He calls it 'the body of this death,' as feeling, at the moment when he wrote, the horrors of that death into which it dragged him down."
2. "But the language is not that of a sinner newly awakened to the sight of his lost state; it is the cry of a living but agonized believer, weighed down under a burden which is not himself, but which he longs to shake off from his renewed self."
3. "Nor does the question imply ignorance of the way of relief at the time referred to. It was designed only to prepare the way for that outburst of thankfulness for the divinely provided remedy which immediately follows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The effect of this conflict is... 
(1) To produce pain and distress. It is often an agonizing struggle between good and evil; a struggle which annoys the peace, and renders life wretched."
2. "It tends to produce humility. It is humbling to man to be thus under the influence of evil passions... In such circumstances, the mind is overwhelmed with wretchedness, and instinctively sighs for relief."
3. "The expression 'body of this death' is a Hebraism, denoting a body deadly in its tendency; and the whole expression may mean the corrupt principles of man; the carnal, evil affections that lead to death or to condemnation... An earnest wish to be delivered from it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The body serving as the seat of the death into which the soul is sunk through the power of sin."
2. "The literal body, regarded as the principal instrument which sin uses to enslave and destroy the soul."
3. "Paul associates the dominion and energy of sin prominently with the body, though not as if sin were inherent in and inseparable from the body."

### John Calvin:
1. "He closes his argument with a vehement exclamation, by which he teaches us that we are not only to struggle with our flesh, but also with continual groaning to bewail within ourselves and before God our unhappy condition."
2. "And he mentions the word rescue, in order that he might show, that for his liberation no ordinary exercise of divine power was necessary."
3. "This passage is indeed remarkably fitted for the purpose of beating down all the glory of the flesh; for Paul teaches us, that the most perfect, as long as they dwell in the flesh, are exposed to misery, for they are subject to death; nay, when they thoroughly examine themselves, they find in their own nature nothing but misery."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prominent ideas are of helplessness and wretchedness; the cry for deliverance follows. A believer may thus speak, doubtless often does; but this condition is precisely that from which we are delivered."
2. "Not merely a wish: would that I were delivered, but rather: who will deliver me, who can do it; not without a reference to help from a person."
3. "There is, however, no reference to physical death, but to the whole condition of helplessness, guilt, and misery just described, which is, in effect, spiritual death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A heart-rending cry from the depths of despair."
2. "If one feels that Paul has exaggerated his own condition, he has only to recall 1 Timothy 1:15 when he describes himself a chief of sinners."
3. "He dealt too honestly with himself for Pharisaic complacency to live long."

### John Gill:
1. "O wretched man that I am.... this exclamation he made on account of the troubles he met with in his Christian race; and... on account of that continual combat between, the flesh and spirit in him."
2. "Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?... That mass of corruption and body of sin he carried about with him... this did not arise from the troubles and anxieties of life... but from the load of sin, and burden of corruption, under which he groaned, and still bespeaks him a regenerate man."
3. "It is better by 'this body of death' to understand what he in Romans 6:6 calls 'the body of sin'; that mass of corruption that lodged in him, which is called 'a body', because of its fleshly carnal nature... and 'a body of death', because it makes men liable to death."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wretched man that I am — The struggle is now come to the height; and the man, finding there is no help in himself, begins almost unawares to pray, Who shall deliver me?"
2. "The word which we translate deliver, implies force. And indeed without this there can be no deliverance."
3. "The body of this death — That is, this body of death; this mass of sin, leading to death eternal, and cleaving as close to me as my body to my soul."
