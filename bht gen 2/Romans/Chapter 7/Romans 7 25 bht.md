## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thanks to God (who hath accomplished this) by means of Jesus Christ our Lord."
2. "This exclamation and thanksgiving more than all convince me, that Paul speaks of none other than himself, and carries out as far as possible the misery of the conflict with sin in his members, on purpose to bring in the glorious deliverance which follows."
3. "He now sums up his vindication of the law as holy; and at the same time, sums up the other side of the evidence adduced in the passage, from which it appears that the flesh is still, even in the spiritual man, subject (essentially, not practically and energetically) to the law of sin, which subjection, in its nature and consequences, is so nobly treated in ch. 8."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such then is the unchanging character of these two principles within me. God's holy law is dear to my renewed mind, and has the willing service of my new man; although that corrupt nature which still remains in me listens to the dictates of sin."
2. "Here we see that Inability is consistent with Accountability. As the Scriptures constantly recognize the truth of these two things, so are they united in Christian experience."
3. "If the first sight of the Cross by the eye of faith kindles feelings never to be forgotten...the experimental discovery of its power to beat down and mortify inveterate corruption, to cleanse and heal from long-continued backslidings and inconsistencies, and to triumph over all that threatens to destroy those for whom Christ died...is attended with yet more heart-affecting wonder, thankfulness, and adoration of Him whose work Salvation is from first to last."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I thank God for effecting a deliverance to which I am myself incompetent... complete deliverance can be expected there, and there alone."
2. "The superiority of the gospel to the Law in overcoming all the evils under which man labors, is thus triumphantly established."
3. "The corruption of the flesh leads to sin; it has no tendency to holiness; and its corruptions can be overcome only by the grace of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then immediately subjoined this thanksgiving, lest any should think that in his complaint he perversely murmured against God."
2. "It does not become the saints, while examining their own defects, to forget what they have already received from God."
3. "The faithful never reach the goal of righteousness as long as they dwell in the flesh, but that they are running their course, until they put off the body."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This thanksgiving is for deliverance: it is a deliverance through Jesus Christ our Lord. Not simply that the thanksgiving is through Him, but the fact that the thanks to God is due to Jesus Christ."
2. "I in myself, notwithstanding whatever progress in righteousness the Spirit of Christ may have wrought in me, or will work in this life, am still most imperfect; with my mind, indeed, I serve the law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin; and, tried by the law, could not be justified but would come under condemnation, if viewed in myself, and not in Christ Jesus."
3. "The service of the law, whose excellence is recognized by the mind, is attempted, but the flesh interferes, as the ruling power it brings into captivity in every case where the mere service of law, even of the law of God, is the aim."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Note of victory over death through Jesus Christ our Lord."
2. "Paul proved the obligation to be sanctified."
3. "He discusses the possibility of sanctification, only for the renewed man by the help of the Holy Spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of God the Father, which is communicated through Christ the Mediator by the Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life which is in Christ, the principle of grace formed in the soul by the Spirit of God, which reigns in the believer as a governing principle, through righteousness unto eternal life, will in the issue deliver from indwelling sin, and all the effects of it."
2. "The thing for which thanks is given is not expressed, but is implied, and is deliverance; either past, as from the power of Satan, the dominion of sin, the curse of the law, the evil of the world, and from the hands of all spiritual enemies, so as to endanger everlasting happiness; or rather, future deliverance, from the very being of sin."
3. "He divides himself as it were into two parts, the mind, by which he means his inward man, his renewed self; and 'the flesh', by which he designs his carnal I, that was sold under sin... he serves, at different times, two different laws; 'the law of God', written on his mind, and in the service of which he delighted as a regenerate man; 'and the law of sin', to which he was sometimes carried captive." (144 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord — That is, God will deliver me through Christ. But the apostle, as his frequent manner is, beautifully interweaves his assertion with thanksgiving;"
2. "the hymn of praise answering in a manner to the voice of sorrow, 'Wretched man that I am!'"
3. "So then - He here sums up the whole, and concludes what he began, Romans 7:7."
