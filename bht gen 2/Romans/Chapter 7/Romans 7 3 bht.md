# Romans 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True indeed it is that while her husband is alive, if she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress. However, this is the case unless her husband has died. In that circumstance, she is free from the law of marriage that previously bound her. Therefore, it is evident that second marriages are lawful.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle is insisting on the fact, that DEATH DISSOLVES LEGAL OBLIGATION: but he is not drawing an exact parallel between the persons in his example, and the persons in his application."
2. "Further it will not hold: for in the example, the liberated person is the survivor, in the thing treated, the liberated person is the dead person."
3. "It is not necessary... to suppose that in Rom 7:4 there is an euphemistic inversion, 'we are dead to the law,' instead of 'the law is dead to us;' indeed such a supposition would, from what is said above, much weaken the argument, which rests on our being slain with Christ, and so freed from the law."

4. "So that she is not an adulteress. This clause may express either the result (‘so that’) or the purpose, ‘in order that’ The latter is perhaps grammatically more exact; the purpose of this freedom was to prevent the woman from being an adulteress in case of a second marriage."
