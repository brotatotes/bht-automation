# Romans 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are freed from the Mosaic law, just as a husband is free when his wife is deceased. This freedom is made possible through the death of Christ, whose sacrifice brings an end to the law. The body of Christ, offered up on the cross, serves as the means by which the law is cancelled. This liberation allows believers to be united with Christ and bear fruit for God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "You also were slain to the law by means of the crucified Body of Christ, that you should become attached to another, even to Him who was raised from the dead."
2. "We should bring forth fruit to the honor of God."
3. "Not merely final, as Thol., Meyer, De W., &c. Not merely ecbatic, as Fritzsche."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "were slain," to make it clear that he meant their being "crucified with Christ"
2. "the law died to us," not "we to the law," but that purposely inverted the figure, to avoid the harshness to Jewish ears of the death of the law
3. believers are here viewed as having a double life—the old sin-condemned life, which they lay down with Christ, and the new life of acceptance and holiness to which they rise with their Surety and Head; and all the issues of this new life, in Christian obedience, are regarded as the "fruit" of this blessed union to the Risen One.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea there is, that death dissolves a connection from which obligation resulted."
2. "The meaning is, as death dissolves the connection between a wife and her husband... so the death of the Christian to the Law dissolves that connection."
3. "He does not say that we are dead to it, or released from it as a rule of duty, or as a matter of obligation to obey it; for there neither is, nor can be, any such release, but we are dead to it as a way of justification and sanctification."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This ethical death is fellowship with Christ's death, which was by violence."
2. "The real point of analogy is the termination of relations to the old state."
3. "Matter is not essentially evil. The flesh is not necessarily sinful in itself; but as it has existed from the time of the introduction of sin through Adam, it is recognized by Paul as tainted with sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, by the glorious victory of the cross, first triumphed over sin; and that he might do this, it was necessary that the handwriting, by which we were held bound, should be cancelled."
2. "But the Apostle goes farther, and says, that the bond of the law was destroyed; not that we may live according to our own will, but that we may be now bound to another husband, that is, from the law to Christ."
3. "It is indeed no abatement to our liberty that we serve God; nay, if we desire to enjoy so great a benefit as there is in Christ, it will not henceforth be right in us to entertain any other thought but that of promoting the glory of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression is chosen, not merely because Christ’s death was a violent one, but also because it describes the death of Christians to the law as a death incurred by virtue of the administration of the law."
2. "This refers to the death of Christ, either (1) as the ground of justification, or (2) as involving our fellowship in His death. The latter 'is preferable; it implies the former, and suits the tenor of the whole passage."
3. "The purpose of the death to the law was union to Christ; the figure of a marriage is still present, and quite appropriate. 'The exalted Christ is the husband of His Church that has become independent of the law by dying with Him'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He changes the structure and makes them dead to the law as the husband (Romans 6:3-6). The relation of marriage is killed 'through the body of Christ' as the 'propitiation' (Romans 3:25) for us." 
2. "The saints as wedded to Christ as their Husband occurs in 1 Corinthians 6:13; Galatians 4:26. See further Ephesians 5:22-33."
3. "He changes the metaphor to that of the tree used in Romans 6:22."

### John Gill:
1. "Believers being dead to the law, and the law dead to them, which is all one, they are loosed from it, and may be, and are lawfully married to Christ, that they may bring forth the genuine fruits of good works."
2. "The reason why the law is become so to them, and they to that, is that ye should be married to another; or 'that ye should be to another', or 'be another's'; that is, that ye should appear to be so in a just and legal way."
3. "The end of being dead to the law, and of being married to Christ, is that we should bring forth fruit unto God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Are now as free from the Mosaic law as an husband is, when his wife is dead."
2. "By the body of Christ — Offered up; that is, by the merits of his death, that law expiring with him."
