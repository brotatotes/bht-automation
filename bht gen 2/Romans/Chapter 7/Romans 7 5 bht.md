# Romans 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we were in a corrupt and unregenerate state, our flesh was marked by sinful passions and the motions of sin worked in our members. Even though the flesh itself is not inherently sinful, it is subject to sin, and even the seemingly virtuous can be in an unregenerate state. The law does not cause sin but rather stirs and increases it because of the depravity and corruption within man. This vivid picture portrays the aim and consequence of the working of these sinful passions, which spread throughout the entirety of a person.
