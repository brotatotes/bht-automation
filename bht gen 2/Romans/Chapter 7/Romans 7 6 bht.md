# Romans 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We have been delivered and set free from the law, no longer bound to its regulations and restrictions. Through Christ, we have died to the law and are now able to serve God in the newness of the Spirit rather than the oldness of the letter. This means that our service to God is not merely outward, following external rules, but it is a heartfelt and spiritual devotion that comes from within. We have been released from the law so that we can live a new life, guided by the Spirit and walking in the ways of righteousness and holiness.
