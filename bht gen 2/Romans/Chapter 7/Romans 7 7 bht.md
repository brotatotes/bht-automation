# Romans 7:7 Commentary Help Text

2. "The only meaning which suits all that is said of it in this place is 'the principle of sin in the heart of fallen man.' The sense, then, is this: 'It was by means of the law that I came to know what a virulence and strength of sinful propensity I had within me.'"
3. "The apostle saw in it the prohibition not only of desire after certain things there specified, but of 'desire after everything divinely forbidden'; in other words, all 'lusting' or 'irregular desire.'"

2. "The apostle replies with great wisdom, by showing that the evil was not in the Law, but in man; that though these effects often followed, yet that the Law itself was good and pure."

2. "He perceived not his own coveting. And he designedly referred to this one kind of sin, in which hypocrisy especially prevails, which has ever connected with itself supine self-indulgence and false assurance."
3. "The law is only the occasion. And though he may seem to speak only of that excitement, by which our lusting is instigated through the law, so that it boils out with greater fury; yet I refer this chiefly to the knowledge the law conveys; as though he had said, 'It has discovered to me every lust or coveting which, being hid, seemed somehow to have no existence.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law discovers sin, and in a measure incites to it, but it is not itself sin nor the cause of sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is a kind of a digression, to the beginning of the next chapter, wherein the apostle, in order to show in the most lively manner the weakness and inefficacy of the law, changes the person and speaks as of himself, concerning the misery of one under the law."
2. "To have spoken this of himself, or any true believer, would have been foreign to the whole scope of his discourse; nay, utterly contrary thereto, as well as to what is expressly asserted."
