# Romans 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin, our inbred corruption, finds a way to attack when the law provides the occasion. The commandment, although it forbids, fails to subdue sin, causing it to stir up even more evil desires within me. Without the knowledge of the law, sin was dormant and didn't pose a threat. It is through these prohibitions that sin takes the opportunity to work in me, rousing and exciting my sinful cravings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law is not sin, but sin found occasion in the law."

3. "To man everything forbidden appears as a desirable blessing; but yet, as it is forbidden, he feels that his freedom is limited, and now his lust rages more violently, like the waves against the dyke."

### John Calvin:

2. "It is a general truth, which he presently applies to his own case."
3. "I hence wonder what could have come into the minds of interpreters to render the passage in the preterimperfect tense, as though Paul was speaking of himself; for it is easy to see that his purpose was to begin with a general proposition, and then to explain the subject by his own example."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'To man everything forbidden appears as a desirable blessing; but yet, as it is forbidden, he feels that his freedom is limited, and now his lust rages more violently, like the waves against the dyke'" (Tholock).
2. "'That this may be and is misused by the principle of sin, in the way indicated, arises from the fact, that it comes forward merely with the outward command (thou shalt, thou shalt not), without giving the power of fulfilment'" (Meyer).
