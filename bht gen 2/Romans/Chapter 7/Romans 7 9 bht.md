# Romans 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In my former state of ignorance, I considered myself righteous and entitled to God's favor, unaware of the true power and demands of the law. However, when the commandment came, it had the opposite effect of what I expected. Instead of bringing life, it stirred sin to life within me, revealing its strength and leading to my spiritual death. This awakening to the reality of sin and the condemnation of the law was a humbling and transformative experience, showing me the need for redemption and the insufficiency of my own righteousness.

2. "But the death of sin is the life of man, and again the life of sin is the death of man."
