# Romans 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are no longer condemned by sin, but set free through Jesus Christ. The gospel offers pardon and liberation from a fearful condemnation. Those who walk after the Spirit, though still beset by sin, are exempt from the power of death and every curse, living not in the flesh but in the Spirit. In vital union with Christ, the saints experience no condemnation, as all their sins are transferred to Him who removed them completely.

### Henry Alford:
1. "the body indeed is dead on account of sin"
2. "the spirit is life on account of righteousness"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The scope of [Romans 8:1] is to show how 'the law of sin and death' is deprived of its power to bring believers again into bondage, and how the holy law of God receives in them the homage of a living obedience."
2. "As Christ, who 'knew no sin,' was, to all legal effects, 'made sin for us,' so are we, who believe in Him, to all legal effects, 'made the righteousness of God in Him' and thus, one with Him in the divine reckoning. There is to such 'NO CONDEMNATION.'"
3. "Believers, through the indwelling of Christ's Spirit in them, having one life with Him, as truly as the head and the members of the same body have one life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The function of the law is to condemn, but the gospel does not pronounce condemnation. Its function is to pardon."
2. "The gospel frees lost and ruined people from a most fearful and terrible condemnation."
3. "If a man has the fruits of the Spirit, he is a Christian; if not, he is a stranger to religion, whatever else he may possess."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "That though they were still beset by sin, they were yet exempt from the power of death, and from every curse, provided they lived not in the flesh but in the Spirit..."
2. "...the trembling consciences of the godly have an invincible fortress, for they know that while they abide in Christ they are beyond every danger of condemnation."
3. "Those who walk after the Spirit are not such as have wholly put off all the emotions of the flesh, so that their whole life is redolent with nothing but celestial perfection; but they are those who sedulously labor to subdue and mortify the flesh, so that the love of true religion seems to reign in them."
