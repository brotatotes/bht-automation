# Romans 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is clear that there is no condemnation for believers in Christ. Through His sacrifice, they are freed from the guilt and punishment of sin, both present and past. This assures them of their eternal life and union with Christ, who has taken away their guilt through His blood. With this freedom, believers can now walk after the Spirit rather than the flesh, living a life consecrated to Christ. The apostle Paul brings this reassurance of freedom and liberty to his readers, emphasizing the unbroken flow of his message.

### Henry Alford:
1. "[...] the body indeed is dead on account of sin (still remains dead, see 2 Corinthians 4:11-14, under the power of death physical (and eternal?) because of sin which it, per se, stands in, and serves)"
2. "[...] but the (your) spirit is life (this would hardly be said if only our human spirits were meant, but the description would be in the adjectival form)"
3. "[...] regarding our spirits as possessed and penetrated by God's Spirit)"
4. "[...] the implanted righteousness of the sanctification of the Spirit"
5. "[...] the διὰ ἁμαρτίαν, which answers to it"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The scope of [Romans 8:1] is to show how 'the law of sin and death' is deprived of its power to bring believers again into bondage, and how the holy law of God receives in them the homage of a living obedience."
2. "As Christ, who 'knew no sin,' was, to all legal effects, 'made sin for us,' so are we, who believe in Him, to all legal effects, 'made the righteousness of God in Him' and thus, one with Him in the divine reckoning. There is to such 'NO CONDEMNATION.'"
3. "But this is no mere legal arrangement: it is a union in life; believers, through the indwelling of Christ's Spirit in them, having one life with Him, as truly as the head and the members of the same body have one life."
4. "The evidence of manuscripts seems to show that this clause formed no part of the original text of this verse, but that the first part of it was early introduced, and the second later, probably as an explanatory comment, and to make the transition to Romans 8:4 easier."
