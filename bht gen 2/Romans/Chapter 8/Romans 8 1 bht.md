## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "if Christ is in you... the body indeed is dead on account of sin, but the spirit is life on account of righteousness."
2. "the body... still remains dead... under the power of death physical (and eternal?) because of sin which it, per se, stands in, and serves"
3. "the spirit is life... on account of righteousness... the implanted righteousness of the sanctification of the Spirit"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The scope of Romans 8:1 is to show how 'the law of sin and death' is deprived of its power to bring believers again into bondage, and how the holy law of God receives in them the homage of a living obedience."
2. "Believers, through the indwelling of Christ's Spirit in them, having one life with Him, as truly as the head and the members of the same body have one life."
3. "The evidence of manuscripts seems to show that this clause formed no part of the original text of this verse, but that the first part of it was early introduced, and the second later, probably as an explanatory comment, and to make the transition to Romans 8:4 easier."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No condemnation - This does not mean that sin in believers is not to be condemned as much as any where, for the contrary is everywhere taught in the Scriptures; but it means...(1) That the gospel does not pronounce condemnation like the Law. Its function is to pardon; the function of the law is to condemn."
2. "There is no final condemnation under the gospel. The function, design, and tendency of the gospel is to free from the condemning sentence of law. This is its first and its glorious announcement, that it frees lost and ruined people from a most fearful and terrible condemnation."
3. "The union between Christ and his people is compared to that between the vine and its branches...believe

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being freed through Jesus Christ, there is therefore no condemnation now."
2. "Condemnation [κατακριμα]. As ch. 5 16, sentence of condemnation."
3. "Who walk not, etc. The best texts omit to the end of the verse."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though they were still beset by sin, they were yet exempt from the power of death, and from every curse, provided they lived not in the flesh but in the Spirit."
2. "He joins together these three things - the imperfection under which the faithful always labor, the mercy of God in pardoning and forgiving it, and the regeneration of the Spirit."
3. "Those who walk after the Spirit are not such as have wholly put off all the emotions of the flesh, but they are those who sedulously labor to subdue and mortify the flesh, so that the love of true religion seems to reign in them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'No condemnation.' 'No' is in emphatic position. Some confine this to the act of Justification at the beginning of the Christian life, but it is better to refer it to the state of justification which culminates in final acquittal and glory."
2. "In Christ Jesus. In vital union with Him; the phrase being a deeply significant one."
3. "The clause: ‘who walk not,’ etc., is to be rejected, being probably taken from Romans 8:4. This addition weakens the Apostle’s statement, by making the walk appear as the ground of ‘no condemnation.'"

### John Gill:
1. "There is not one condemnation lies against them, with respect to their numerous sins".
2. "Condemnation is sometimes put for the cause of it, which is sin, original and actual; now though God's elect are sinners, both by nature and practice, and after conversion have sin in them, their sanctification being imperfect, yet there is none in them with respect to justification".
3. "This walk and conversation of the saints, is not the cause of there being no condemnation to them; but is descriptive of the persons interested in such a privilege; and is evidential of their right unto it, as well as of their being in Christ".

### John Wesley:
1. "There is therefore now no condemnation - Either for things present or past."
2. "Now he comes to deliverance and liberty."
3. "The apostle here resumes the thread of his discourse."
