# Romans 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the indwelling of Christ's Spirit, believers experience life in their spirit while their bodies remain subject to the effects of sin. This union between Christ and his people is not merely symbolic, but a real and vital connection formed by the Holy Spirit. Though the physical body may face death, the spirit is filled with new and undying life, brought about by the righteousness of Christ. This mystical union is founded on the unity within the Godhead, and the believers' transformation from death to life reflects the power of the Holy Spirit and the righteousness of Christ.
