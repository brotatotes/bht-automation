# Romans 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The indwelling of Christ through His Spirit is a powerful reality for believers. While our physical bodies are subject to death because of sin, our spirits are filled with the life of righteousness. The union of the Holy Spirit with believers brings about a transformation in our souls, making us alive with new principles of righteousness. Our spiritual life is not based on our own perfection, but on the newness of life that begins in us. The presence of Christ in us through his Spirit is the assurance of our spiritual life, as it connects us intimately to him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If Christ be in youâ€”by His indwelling Spirit in virtue of which we have one life with him."
2. "the body... is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness."
3. "If Christ be in you by His indwelling Spirit, though your 'bodies' have to pass through the stage of 'death' in consequence of the first Adam's 'sin,' your spirit is instinct with new and undying 'life,' brought in by the 'righteousness' of the second Adam."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is language which is not infrequently used... The close connection between him and Christians... is expressed by this strong figurative language."
2. "This real and vital union is formed by the one Spirit of Christ... It is true, indeed, that the essential presence of Christâ€™s Spirit is everywhere, but he is present in Christâ€™s members, in a special way, as the fountain of spiritual influence."
3. "The body refers to that of which the apostle had said so much... It is subject to corrupt passions and desires, and may be said thus to be dead, as it has none of the elements of spiritual life... The soul, the immortal part, the renovated man, was alive, or was under the influence of living principles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The body
The believer's natural body.

The spirit

The believer's human spirit.

### John Calvin:
1. "The children of God are counted spiritual, not on the ground of a full and complete perfection, but only on account of the newness of life that is begun in them."
2. "The power of quickening is in the Spirit of Christ, which will be effectual in swallowing up our mortality."
3. "Although sin adjudges us to death as far as the corruption of our first nature remains in us, yet the Spirit of God is its conqueror: nor is it any hindrance, that we are only favored with the first-fruits, for even one spark of the Spirit is the seed of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The underlying basis of the mystical union of Christ and the believer is the yet more mysterious unity of the Persons of the Godhead."
2. "The body is dead. This refers to the certain fact of physical death, since Romans 8:11 takes up this thought."

### John Gill:
1. "He is formed in their hearts by the Spirit of God in regeneration, when the Father reveals him not only to them, but in them."
2. "Sin is the true reason of it, sin original and actual, indwelling sin, but not by way of punishment for it, for Christ has bore that, death is one of the saints' privileges, it is for their good, and therefore desired by them."
3. "This may be said in believers to be life or live, for it not only lives naturally, but spiritually; it lives a life of holiness from Christ, a life of faith upon him, and a life of justification by him, and will live eternally."

### John Wesley:
