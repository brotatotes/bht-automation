# Romans 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The indwelling of the Spirit of Christ signifies the presence of Christ Himself in believers. This union is a real and vital connection formed by the Holy Spirit. Though the believer's natural body is subject to sin and its consequences, the spirit is infused with new and undying life through the righteousness of Christ. The Spirit of God triumphs over sin and death, even if believers only experience a partial manifestation of His power. Even a small spark of the Spirit is the seed of eternal life, enabling believers to enjoy communion with Christ and live a life of holiness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The power of quickening is in the Spirit of Christ, which will be effectual in swallowing up our mortality."
3. "Although sin adjudges us to death as far as the corruption of our first nature remains in us, yet the Spirit of God is its conqueror: nor is it any hindrance, that we are only favored with the first-fruits, for even one spark of the Spirit is the seed of life."

1. "Notice that the indwelling of the Spirit of God, having the Spirit of Christ, belonging to Christ, having Christ in us, are only varied expressions of the same great fact."

2. "This fleshly body, because liable to afflictions, which are called deaths, has the seeds of mortality in it, and shall in a little time die... the reason of it is not merely the decree of God, nor does it arise from the original constitution of the body, but sin is the true reason of it."
3. "The soul of man is here meant, in opposition to the body, which is of a spiritual nature, immaterial and immortal... it lives a life of holiness from Christ, a life of faith upon him, and a life of justification by him, and will live eternally."
