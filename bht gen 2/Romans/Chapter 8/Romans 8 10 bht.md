# Romans 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The indwelling of the Spirit of God in believers is a profound reality. This union is not simply a legal or relative connection, but a genuine and vital one. Christ, by His Spirit, enters into their beings, manifests Himself to them, and bestows His grace upon them. Although our physical bodies are subject to death as a consequence of sin, our spirits are filled with new and undying life through the righteousness of Christ. This real and transformative union is made possible by the Holy Spirit, who unites us with Christ and grants us the assurance of eternal life.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If Christ be in you—by His indwelling Spirit in virtue of which we have one life with him."
2. "The body indeed is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness."
3. "If Christ be in you by His indwelling Spirit, though your 'bodies' have to pass through the stage of 'death' in consequence of the first Adam's 'sin,' your spirit is instinct with new and undying 'life,' brought in by the 'righteousness' of the second Adam."

2. "The power of quickening is in the Spirit of Christ, which will be effectual in swallowing up our mortality."
3. "Although sin adjudges us to death as far as the corruption of our first nature remains in us, yet the Spirit of God is its conqueror: nor is it any hindrance, that we are only favored with the first-fruits, for even one spark of the Spirit is the seed of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Notice that the indwelling of the Spirit of God, having the Spirit of Christ, belonging to Christ, having Christ in us, are only varied expressions of the same great fact."

2. "This fleshly body, because liable to afflictions, which are called deaths, has the seeds of mortality in it, and shall in a little time die... the reason of it is not merely the decree of God, nor does it arise from the original constitution of the body, but sin is the true reason of it."
3. "The soul of man is here meant, in opposition to the body, which is of a spiritual nature, immaterial and immortal... it lives a life of holiness from Christ, a life of faith upon him, and a life of justification by him, and will live eternally."
