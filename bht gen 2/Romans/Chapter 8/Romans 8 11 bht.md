# Romans 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power of God's Spirit, demonstrated in the resurrection of Jesus, assures believers that they too will experience a resurrection. The indwelling Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, possesses the ability to give life to mortal bodies. Even though our bodies are subject to the effects of sin and death, the Spirit will revive and restore them. The victory of redemption will be complete when these bodies are made alive. This assurance is possible because the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead now dwells in believers, guaranteeing their ultimate physical resurrection.

### John Calvin:
1. "Since by the power of God's Spirit Christ was raised, and since the Spirit possesses eternal power, he will also exert the same with regard to us."
2. "For it might have been objected, 'That Christ was able by his own power to raise up himself, and this is what no man can do.' But when he says, that God raised up Christ by his Spirit, and that he also communicated his Spirit to us, there is nothing that can be alleged to the contrary; so that he thus makes sure to us the hope of resurrection."
3. "By mortal bodies he understands all those things which still remain in us, that are subject to death... the continued working of the Spirit, by which he gradually mortifies the relics of the flesh and renews in us a celestial life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that the indwelling Spirit is the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is a pledge that the spiritual quickening will be followed by the physical quickening."

3. "If this Spirit now dwells in the body of the believer, that body will not be left unredeemed."

### John Gill:
1. "To understand the words in such a sense, is not so agreeable to the resurrection of Christ here mentioned; whereas Christ's resurrection is often used as an argument of ours, which is designed here, where the apostle argues from the one to the other."
2. "The Spiritdwells in the saints as his temples: the Spirit that dwells in them is, 'the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead'; by whom is meant God the Father, to whom the resurrection of Christ from the dead is here and elsewhere ascribed."
3. "The bodies of the saints are the temples of the Holy Ghost, they are sanctified by him, where he continues to dwell by virtue of union to Christ, and in consequence of it will quicken them at the last day."
