# Romans 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse speaks of the power of the Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead, showing that the same power will also give life to believers. The resurrection of Christ serves as an argument and a pledge of our own resurrection, with our mortal bodies being quickened by the Spirit of God. This act of quickening is a peculiar blessing for the saints, signifying their union with Christ and eternal life, distinct from the resurrection of the wicked. The Spirit is not just an instrument but a cause of this quickening, working together with the Father and Son.
