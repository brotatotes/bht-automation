# Romans 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The resurrection of Christ serves as a compelling argument for our own resurrection, demonstrating that the power of the Holy Spirit, who dwells in us as temples, will triumph over even physical death. This indwelling Spirit, who is the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead, namely God the Father, will not only bring about a spiritual renewal but also ensure the eventual physical resurrection of our mortal bodies. Despite our bodies being subject to sin and death, the victory of redemption will be complete when the Holy Spirit quickens us at the last day.
