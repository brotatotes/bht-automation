# Romans 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Once we were in bondage to sin, but now that we have been set free by the grace of God, we owe nothing to the desires of the flesh. Our allegiance lies with righteousness and we must disown the unrighteous claims of the flesh. We are called to live for God, guided by His Spirit. This obligation is not a burden, but a glorious sentiment. We are debtors to live according to God's will, for in doing so, we find life and peace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Once we were sold under sin, but now that we have been set free from that hard master and become servants to Righteousness, we owe nothing to the flesh, we disown its unrighteous claims and are deaf to its imperious demands."

### John Calvin:
1. "This conclusion has the force of an exhortation; for he is ever wont to draw exhortations from his doctrine."
2. "Thus indeed we ought to reason, not as some blasphemers are wont to do, who talk idly, and say, ‚Äî that we must do nothing, because we have no power. But it is as it were to fight against God, when we extinguish the grace offered to us, by contempt and negligence."
3. "He did not mention the other part, says [Pareus], 'because it was so evident.' Besides, what he had already stated, and what he proceeds to state, are so many evidences of our obligations to live after the Spirit, that it was unnecessary to make such an addition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore, or, 'so then,' as the phrase is usually translated; here introducing an exhortation based upon the previous statement: because the indwelling of the Spirit involves such glorious results."
2. "We are debtors, not to the flesh. 'Flesh' is here used in the ethical sense; the antithesis is suggested indirectly in Romans 8:13."
3. "The truths of Romans 8:10-11 imply that we are under obligation not to do this, but on the contrary to live after the Spirit. Strictly rendered, this clause is one of design, in order to live after the flesh."
