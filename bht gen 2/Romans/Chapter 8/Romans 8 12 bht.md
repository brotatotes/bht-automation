# Romans 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we have a responsibility to renounce the flesh and live according to the leading of the Spirit. We no longer owe anything to the flesh, as we have been set free from its bondage. Our allegiance is now to righteousness and we must not consent to the desires of the flesh. Our obligation is to live in obedience to God, following the promptings of the Spirit, for in doing so, we find life and peace. Neglecting the grace offered to us is akin to fighting against God, extinguishing the very grace that has been extended to us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Once we were sold under sin; but now that we have been set free from that hard master and become servants to Righteousness, we owe nothing to the flesh, we disown its unrighteous claims and are deaf to its imperious demands." 
2. "Glorious sentiment!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are debtors - We owe it as a matter of solemn obligation."
2. "But we are bound to live to God, and to follow the leadings of his Spirit, for the end is life and peace."
3. "The reason for this is stated in the following verse."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if we are to renounce the flesh, we ought not to consent to it; and if the Spirit ought to reign in us, it is inconsistent not to attend to his bidding."
2. "And this is the case, when we renounce carnal lusts, so as to devote ourselves, as those who are bound, to the righteousness of God."
3. "But it is as it were to fight against God, when we extinguish the grace offered to us, by contempt and negligence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore, or, 'so then,' as the phrase is usually translated; here introducing an exhortation based upon the previous statement: because the indwelling of the Spirit involves such glorious results."
2. "We are debtors, not to the flesh. 'Flesh' is here used in the ethical sense; the antithesis is suggested indirectly in Romans 8:13. 'Not' applies to the following clause also: to live after the flesh."
3. "The truths of Romans 8:10-11 imply that we are under obligation not to do this, but on the contrary to live after the Spirit. Strictly rendered, this clause is one of design, in order to live after the flesh."

### John Gill:
1. "The use of it by the apostle, shows his great humility and condescension, and his love and affection for them."
2. "They were debtors...not as sinners, who as such had been greatly in debt, and had nothing to pay, and were liable to the prison of hell; but they were so as saints, as men freed from condemnation and death."
3. "It does not exempt from obedience, but the more and greater the favors are which such men enjoy, the more obliged they are to be grateful and obey."

### John Wesley:
1. We are not debtors to the flesh â€” We ought not to follow it.
