# Romans 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's exhortation in the verse is a reminder that we are not indebted to the flesh. As freed individuals, we are no longer bound by its hold on us. We should not feel obliged to follow its desires and live according to its ways. Instead, we should recognize that we are debtors to a higher calling, to live in righteousness and to serve God faithfully. Our gratitude for the freedom we have been granted should lead us to walk in obedience to His Spirit and to disown the unrighteous claims of the flesh.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Once we were sold under sin, but now that we have been set free from that hard master and become servants to Righteousness, we owe nothing to the flesh, we disown its unrighteous claims and are deaf to its imperious demands."
2. "Glorious sentiment!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are debtors - We owe it as a matter of solemn obligation."
2. "This obligation arises...To the corrupt propensities and passions."
3. "But we are bound to live to God, and to follow the leadings of his Spirit, for the end is life and peace."

### John Calvin:
1. "This conclusion has the force of an exhortation; for he is ever wont to draw exhortations from his doctrine."
2. "Thus indeed we ought to reason, not as some blasphemers are wont to do, who talk idly, and say, — that we must do nothing, because we have no power. But it is as it were to fight against God, when we extinguish the grace offered to us, by contempt and negligence."
3. "He did not mention the other part, says [Pareus], 'because it was so evident.' Besides, what he had already stated, and what he proceeds to state, are so many evidences of our obligations to live after the Spirit, that it was unnecessary to make such an addition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore, or, 'so then,' as the phrase is usually translated; here introducing an exhortation based upon the previous statement: because the indwelling of the Spirit involves such glorious results."
2. "We are debtors, not to the flesh. 'Flesh' is here used in the ethical sense; the antithesis is suggested indirectly in Romans 8:13."
3. "The truths of Romans 8:10-11 imply that we are under obligation not to do this, but on the contrary to live after the Spirit. Strictly rendered, this clause is one of design, in order to live after the flesh."

### John Gill:
1. "The use of it by the apostle, shows his great humility and condescension, and his love and affection for them"
2. "They were debtors as saints, as men freed from condemnation and death"
3. "The more and greater the favors are which such men enjoy, the more obliged they are to be grateful and obey"

### John Wesley:
1. We are not debtors to the flesh — We ought not to follow it.
