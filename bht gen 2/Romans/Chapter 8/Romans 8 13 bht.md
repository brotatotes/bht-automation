# Romans 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you continue living in sin, you will experience the consequences of eternal death. However, by the power of the Holy Spirit, you can put to death the desires and thoughts that are contrary to God's righteousness. This process of mortifying the flesh and its sinful inclinations is necessary for believers to live a life pleasing to God. By doing so, you will experience a life of abundance and glory, filled with the fruits of the Spirit.
