# Romans 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we do not actively fight against sin, it will lead to our spiritual death. Sanctification requires the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit, not only for justification but also for our daily transformation. Our thoughts, affections, and pursuits reveal the true nature of our character. It is crucial to mortify our sinful desires with the help of the Spirit, as this is the only way to subdue their power. By putting sin to death and cultivating a life of righteousness, we can experience the abundant life of faith here and the promised life of glory hereafter.
