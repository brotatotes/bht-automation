# Romans 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who choose to live according to their sinful desires will face the consequence of death, not only physical death but also spiritual and eternal death. To overcome this, we must actively put to death the sinful practices and habits of our bodies, allowing the Holy Spirit to work in us. It is not a mere outward display, but rather a transformation of our inner being driven by the grace of God. By mortifying the deeds of the body, we can experience the abundant life of faith and the assurance of resurrection and eternal life.
