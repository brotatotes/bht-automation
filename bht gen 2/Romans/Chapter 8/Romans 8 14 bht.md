# Romans 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. This verse establishes that those who willingly submit to the guidance of the Holy Spirit are recognized as the true sons of God. The leading of the Spirit is not merely a display of power or a means of mortifying sin, but a gracious and loving guidance that directs believers towards the path of righteousness and life. It distinguishes them from those who claim the title of sons of God without valid reason. The sanctifying work of the Spirit is a mark of divine favor and sets apart the elect as sons of God.
