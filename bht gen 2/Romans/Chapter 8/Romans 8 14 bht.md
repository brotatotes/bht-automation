# Romans 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God in all the ways of righteousness, they are the sons of God, not simply as professed believers, but as those who have been adopted by God with special favor. These individuals, described by the apostle Paul, become heirs to the blessings of glorification. The path to such glory often involves facing trials and hardships, as the way of suffering ultimately leads to the ultimate glory.
