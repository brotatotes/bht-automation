# Romans 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers have not received the spirit of bondage, but the spirit of freedom and confidence in God. Before their conversion, they lived in legal bondage, plagued by fear due to a sense of unpardoned sin. However, upon receiving the Spirit of God, they experienced a transformation from bondage to being adopted as children of God. This adoption is not solely a work of grace in believers, but an act of grace by God Himself. The Spirit of adoption brings a complete change in their relationship with God, allowing them to confidently cry out as His beloved children.

1. "Have not received the spirit of bondage â€” The Holy Ghost was not properly a spirit of bondage, even in the time of the Old Testament. Yet there was something of bondage remaining even in those who then had received the Spirit."

3. "The spirit of bondage here seems directly to mean, those operations of the Holy Spirit by which the soul, on its first conviction, feels itself in bondage to sin, to the world, to Satan, and obnoxious to the wrath of God. This, therefore, and the Spirit of adoption, are one and the same Spirit, only manifesting itself in various operations, according to the various circumstances of the persons."
