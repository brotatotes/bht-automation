# Romans 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit ye received was not a spirit of bondage, for the Spirit of God produces the condition of adoption. The adopted son of God becomes one with the heavenly Father, with whom we can cry out Abba, Father. This crying out is a spontaneous and vehement expression of our confidence and constancy in God's paternal mercy and forgiveness. We, as Christians, have the privilege of experiencing the spirit of adoption, free from the bondage of sin, fear, and legalism. This adoption is not dependent on our own works, but is an act of grace from God Himself.

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not then pursue only the argument which he had before stated, but dwells more on another clause, which he had connected with it, even the paternal mercy of God, by which he forgives his people the infirmities of the flesh and the sins which still remain in them." 
2. "By such a comparison of contrary things the certainty of our salvation, which he intended to confirm, is, as you see, made more evident."
3. "The faithful also under the law did indeed call God their Father, but not with such full confidence, as the vail kept them at a distance from the sanctuary: but now, since an entrance has been opened to us by the blood of Christ, we may rejoice fully and openly that we are the children of God; hence arises this crying."

1. "By 'the spirit of bondage' is meant...a man's own spirit whilst in a state of unregeneracy, and particularly while under a work of the law..."
2. "Men in a state of nature are under a spirit of bondage to the lusts of the flesh...subject to bondage."
3. "Adoption is not a work of grace in us, but an act of grace without us, having its complete being in the mind of God...it is antecedent to a work of grace, inherent grace is a consequence of it, though no man knows, or has the comfort of his adoption, until he believes."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have not received the spirit of bondage — The Holy Ghost was not properly a spirit of bondage, even in the time of the Old Testament. Yet there was something of bondage remaining even in those who then had received the Spirit."
2. "Cry — The word denotes a vehement speaking, with desire, confidence, constancy."
3. "The spirit of bondage here seems directly to mean, those operations of the Holy Spirit by which the soul, on its first conviction, feels itself in bondage to sin, to the world, to Satan, and obnoxious to the wrath of God. This, therefore, and the Spirit of adoption, are one and the same Spirit, only manifesting itself in various operations, according to the various circumstances of the persons."
