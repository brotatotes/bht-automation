# Romans 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The spirit of bondage mentioned refers to the state of being in a legalistic mindset or being under the influence of one's own spirit in a state of unregeneracy. In this state, one is captive to the lusts of the flesh and filled with fear of death, judgment, and wrath. However, the Holy Spirit as the spirit of adoption brings freedom, confidence, and a filial childlike spirit. It is this spirit that enables believers to approach God with reverence, love, and obedience, as children to a loving Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The spirit ye received was not a spirit of bondage."
2. "Such was your condition before ye believed, living in legal bondage, haunted with incessant forebodings under a sense of unpardoned sin."
3. "'Abba' is the Syro-Chaldaic word for 'Father'; and the Greek word for that is added, not surely to tell the reader that both mean the same thing, but for the same reason which drew both words from the lips of Christ Himself during his agony in the garden."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The spirit of religion is that of freedom and of confidence; the spirit of children, and not of slaves."
2. "It implies the habitual spirit of a child of God; a disposition to approach him with confidence, love, and tender affection, as a child does a father."
3. "He that can in sincerity, and with ardent affection apply this term to God, addressing him with a filial spirit as his Father, has the spirit of a Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Spirit of God, producing the condition of adoption."
2. "The adopted son of God becomes, in a peculiar and intimate sense, one with the heavenly Father."
3. "A Syrian term, to which Paul adds the Greek Father. The repetition is probably from a liturgical formula which may have originated among the Hellenistic Jews who retained the consecrated word Abba."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does this by mentioning the special effect produced by the Spirit; for he has not been given for the purpose of harassing us with trembling or of tormenting us with anxiety; but on the contrary, for this end — that having calmed every perturbation, and restoring our minds to a tranquil state, he may stir us up to call on God with confidence and freedom."
2. "He teaches us that our confidence in this respect is made certain by the Spirit of adoption, who could not inspire us with confidence in prayer without sealing to us a gratuitous pardon."
3. "The repetition of the name is for the sake of amplification; for Paul intimates, that God’s mercy was so published through the whole world, that he was invoked, as Augustine observes, indiscriminately in all languages."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the spirit of bondage' is meant... a man's own spirit whilst in a state of unregeneracy, and particularly whilst under a work of the law... it refers to that 'pharisaical' spirit which prevailed among the Jews."
2. "Men in a state of nature are under a spirit of bondage to the lusts of the flesh; by these they are captivated and enslaved, and the consequence of it is a fearful apprehension, when convicted, of death, judgment, and wrath to come."
3. "Rather a filial child like spirit, such a spirit as becomes the children of God is here meant; a spirit of freedom with God, of reverence of him, and of love of him, and of obedience to him; springing from filial affection and without mercenary views; a meek, harmless, and inoffensive spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Holy Ghost was not properly a spirit of bondage, even in the time of the Old Testament."
2. "The word denotes a vehement speaking, with desire, confidence, constancy."
3. "The spirit of bondage here seems directly to mean, those operations of the Holy Spirit by which the soul, on its first conviction, feels itself in bondage to sin, to the world, to Satan, and obnoxious to the wrath of God."
