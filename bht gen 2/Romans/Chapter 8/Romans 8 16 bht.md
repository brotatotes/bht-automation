# Romans 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The witness of the Spirit is distinct from our subjective inferences and conclusions. It is a certitude of the Spirit's presence and work within us that assures us of our adoption into God's family. This direct testimony is the foundation of our conviction in Christ and His work. It gives us the evidence and confidence to approach God as our Father, knowing that we are His children. The Spirit's witness is a faithful and powerful testimony that cannot be denied by the skepticism of the world. Those who embrace and seek this witness are truly blessed in their faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What is this witness of the Spirit itself? All have agreed, and indeed this verse is decisive for it, that it is something separate from, and higher than, all subjective inferences and conclusions."
2. "But on the other hand it does not consist in mere indefinite feeling, but in a certitude of the Spiritâ€™s presence and work continually asserted within us."
3. "On this direct testimony of the Holy Ghost rests, ultimately, all the regenerate manâ€™s conviction respecting Christ and His work."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
- "The Spirit itselfâ€”It should be 'Himself'... beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children... of God" 
- "The testimony of our own spirit is borne in that cry of conscious sonship, 'Abba, Father'; but we are not therein alone; for the Holy Ghost within us, yea, even in that very cry... sets His own distinct seal to ours..."
- "The apostle had before called us 'sons of God,' referring to our adoption; here the word changes to 'children,' referring to our new birth. The one expresses the dignity to which we are admitted; the other the new life which we receive."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Holy Spirit furnishes evidence to our minds that we are adopted into the family of God."
2. "It is his to renew the heart; to sanctify the soul; to produce 'love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.'"
3. "If a man has these, he has evidence of the witnessing of the Spirit with his spirit. If not, he has no such evidence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This rendering assumes the concurrent testimony of the human spirit with that of the divine Spirit."
2. "The human spirit can give no testimony until acted upon by the Spirit of God."
3. "Children [Ï„ÎµÎºÎ½Î±]. See on John 1:12."

### John Calvin:
1. "But Paul means, that the Spirit of God gives us such a testimony, that when he is our guide and teacher, our spirit is made assured of the adoption of God."
2. "For we must ever hold fast this principle, â€” that we do not rightly pray to God, unless we are surely persuaded in our hearts, that he is our Father, when we so call him with our lips."
3. "Let this truth then stand sure, â€” that no one can be called a son of God, who does not know himself to be such; and this is called knowledge by John, in order to set forth its certainty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The clause is an important one, in warranting an assurance of salvation, and also in marking the distinction between the Holy Spirit and our spirit."
2. "This is what is testified, and for such assurance we may seek, however fanaticism has perverted the passage."
3. "That the world deny any such testimony in the hearts of believers, and that they look on it with scorn and treat it with derision, proves only that they are unacquainted with it; not that it is an illusion."

### John Gill:
1. "The testimony of the Spirit is not the satisfaction of others, but the saints themselves; who are ready to doubt of it at times, because of the greatness of the favour, and their own sinfulness and unworthiness."
2. "Now it is 'the Spirit itself' that bears this witness, and not others, or by others, but he himself in person; who is a divine witness, whose testimony therefore must be greater than others, and a faithful one, who will never deceive."
3. "His very being and habitation in the saints are witnesses and proofs of their adoption; his powerful operations and divine landings persuade to a belief of the truth of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The same Spirit beareth witness with our spirit â€” With the spirit of every true believer, by a testimony distinct from that of his own spirit, or the testimony of a good conscience."
2. "Happy they who enjoy this clear and constant."
