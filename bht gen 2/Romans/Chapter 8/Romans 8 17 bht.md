# Romans 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inheritance that God will give us is a great one, just as He has given a great inheritance to His Son. In order to partake in this inheritance, we must willingly and cheerfully suffer with Christ, for the sake of righteousness. This is an important reminder for us in our journey towards receiving the glorious inheritance that God has prepared for His children.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The dignity of the inheritance is shown by its being God's possession, and by its being the possession of the Firstborn of God."
2. "In the joint-heirship we must not bring out this point, that Christ is the rightful Heir, who shares His inheritance with the other children of God: it is as adoptive children that they get the inheritance, and Christ is so far only the means of it, as He gives them power to become sons of God."
3. "If at least we are suffering with Him, that we may also be glorified with Him: i.e. 'if (provided that) we are found in that course of participation in Christ's sufferings, whose aim and end, as that of His sufferings, is to be glorified as He was, and with Him.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "heirs also." heirs of God—of our Father's kingdom.
2. "joint-heirs with Christ—as the "First-born among many brethren" and as "Heir of all things."
3. "This necessity of conformity to Christ in suffering in order to participate in His glory, is taught alike by Christ Himself and by His apostles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An adopted son comes in for a part of the inheritance."
2. "This is an honor infinitely higher than to be heir to the most princely earthly inheritance; or than to be the adopted son of the most magnificent earthly monarch."
3. "If united in the same kind of sufferings, there is propriety in being united in destiny beyond the scenes of all suffering, the kingdom of blessedness and love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Roman law made all children, including adopted ones, equal heritors."
2. "The Roman law was naturally in Paul's mind, and suits the context, where adoption is the basis of inheritance."
3. "Mere suffering does not fulfill the condition. It is suffering with Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then intimates what sort of inheritance it is — that it is heavenly, and therefore incorruptible and eternal, such as Christ possesses; and his possession of it takes away all uncertainty."
2. "It is a commendation of the excellency of this inheritance, that we shall partake of it in common with the only-begotten Son of God."
3. "We are co-heirs with Christ, provided, in entering on our inheritance, we follow him in the same way in which he has gone before."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The kingdom of glory is their inheritance. 'As He Himself will be all in all, so shall His children receive with Him, in His Son, everything for an inheritance'" (Lange).
2. "The Roman law made all children (adopted ones included) equal heritors; but the Jewish law gave a double portion to the eldest son. Hence a discussion has arisen as to the exact reference in this clause. The Roman law would be naturally in the Apostle’s mind when addressing Romans, and suits the context, where adopted sonship is the basis of inheritance. The other view emphasizes the mediation of Christ, through whom we inherit" (Commentary on Romans 8:17).
3. "'He who would be Christ’s brother and joint-heir, must bear in mind to be also a joint-martyr and joint-sufferer; not feeling Christ’s sufferings and shame after Him, but with Him'" (Luther).

2. "If we suffer with him – Willingly and cheerfully, for righteousness' sake. This is a new proposition, referring to what follows."
