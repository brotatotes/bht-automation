# Romans 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As children and heirs of God, we are not just ordinary beneficiaries, but joint heirs with Christ. This means that we share in the same privileges and rights that He does. Our inheritance is vast, encompassing all things that belong to Christ. However, this inheritance is not obtained without cost. We must be willing to suffer with Christ, willingly enduring afflictions and trials for His sake. Through these sufferings, which serve to purify and prepare us, we are being shaped into the likeness of Christ and will ultimately be glorified together with Him.
