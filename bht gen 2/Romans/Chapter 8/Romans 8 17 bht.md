# Romans 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As children of God, we are not only heirs of His kingdom, but also joint-heirs with Christ, sharing in His possessions and glory. The inheritance God has ordained for us is heavenly, incorruptible, and eternal. However, this inheritance is not given to us without conditions. We must be willing to suffer with Christ, bearing afflictions and persecutions for His sake, in order to fully partake in His glory. It is through our union with Christ, in both His sufferings and His triumph, that we truly become co-heirs with Him.
