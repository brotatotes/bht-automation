# Romans 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sufferings of this present time pale in comparison to the glory that will be revealed to us. While the trials we face may seem great, they are insignificant when compared to the eternal weight of glory. We must remember that our sufferings are temporary, while the glory we will experience is everlasting. Through these trials, we can see the power of the gospel in sustaining us and strengthening our faith. The sufferings we endure now are a small part of the grand plan of God, as we await the full revelation of His glory in us as His children.
