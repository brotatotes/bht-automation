# Romans 8:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The earnest expectation and longing seen in creation is a lively hope and vehement longing for the manifestation and glorification of the sons of God. This includes all of creation, both animate and inanimate, which have suffered from the effects of sin and are eagerly waiting for deliverance and restoration to their paradisiacal state. Even the Gentile world, representing the creature, earnestly waits for the revelation of the sons of God. This anticipation extends to upright heathens as well, and may even be found in the most unlikely of people at times.
