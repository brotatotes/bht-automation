# Romans 8:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The intense eagerness and longing for the future glory of the saints is like a watchman awaiting the signal, and the entire unredeemed creation, both animate and inanimate, collectively desires the revelation of the sons of God. This expectation extends to the universe, which suffered greatly due to human sin, as well as the Gentile world eagerly awaiting the manifestation of the sons of God. The future glorification of God's children will be fully revealed at Christ's second coming, and even upright heathens may possess some level of this earnest expectation.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It properly denotes a state of earnest desire to see any object when the head is thrust forward; an intense anxiety; an ardent wish; and is thus well employed to denote the intense interest with which a Christian looks to his future inheritance." 
2. "The main design of the passage is to show the sustaining power of the gospel in the midst of trials, by the prospect of the future deliverance and inheritance of the sons of God."
3. "The whole irrational creation is interested in the future glory of the sons of God, and is anxiously waiting for it. For then the curse will be removed from the very ground, and the lower animals relieved from oppression and cruelty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Earnest expectation [αποκαραδοκια] . The classical student will recall the watchman in the opening of Aeschylus' "Agamemnon," awaiting the beacon which is to announce the capture of Troy."
2. "Creature [κτισεως] . The interpretations vary: 1. The whole unredeemed creation, rational and irrational. 2. All creation, except humanity. The second explanation is preferable, the non-rational creation viewed collectively, animate and inanimate. Equivalent to all nature."
3. "Waiteth [απεκδεχεται] . The whole passage, with the expressions waiting, sighing, hoping, bondage, is poetical and prophetic."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no element and no part of the world which, being touched, as it were, with a sense of its present misery, does not intensely hope for a resurrection."

### John Gill:
1. "Some by the creature understand the universe, all created beings animate and inanimate, which having suffered much by the sin of man, are introduced by a rhetorical figure, as waiting for deliverance and a restoration to their paradisiacal estate."
2. "It is best of all by 'the creature' to understand the Gentile world...now what 'the creature', the Gentile world, is represented as earnestly waiting, and wistly looking out for, is the manifestation of the sons of God."
3. "But the full manifestation of the sons of God will be in their glorification at Christ's second coming; when they shall be openly taken into God's family, and shall be owned by Christ in this relation, before angels and men."
