# Romans 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus refers to the gospel, which brings freedom from the Mosaic Law and the power of sin and death. It is through the work of the Holy Spirit, who imparts life and sanctification, that believers are made free from the guilt and condemnation of sin. This freedom is not a release from obedience, but a deliverance from the curse and condemnation of the Law. It is in union with Christ, who fulfilled the Law and liberated us, that we find true freedom.
