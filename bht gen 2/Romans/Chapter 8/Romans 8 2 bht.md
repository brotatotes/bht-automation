# Romans 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus refers to the gospel which acts as a liberating force from the law of sin and death, that is, the Mosaic dispensation. Through this new principle of living, the Holy Spirit enables believers to live a new life in Christ and be pardoned from the power of sin. The law of sin and death, represented by the Mosaic law, intensifies sin but provides no hope for life. In contrast, the law of the Spirit brings freedom from sin's dominion and condemnation.

1. "The Gospel may be designed by 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus'; which may be called a law, not as succeeding the law of works, by which that is abrogated; nor as requiring conditions to be performed, or as enjoining duties to be observed, or as delivering out threatenings in case of disobedience; but as it is a doctrine, order, and chain of truths, as the Hebrew word תורה signifies, and which is sometimes used for the Gospel..." 

2. "The law of sin and death may intend the law of Moses, called 'the law of sin'; not as if it was sinful, or commanded or encouraged sin, for it severely prohibits it; but because by it, through the corruption of man's nature, sin is irritated, and made to abound; it is the strength of sin, and by it is the knowledge of it: and it may be called 'the law of death', because it threatened with death, in case of disobedience; it sentences and adjudges transgressors to death; and when it is attended with power, it strikes dead all a man's hopes of life, by obedience to it; it leaves persons dead as it finds them, and gives no life, nor hopes of it; by it none can live, or be justified..." 

3. "The life which the Spirit is the author and giver of, is in Christ as the head of his people, the proper repository of all grace, and the fountain of life; the Spirit himself is in him, both as God and as man, and as Mediator, hence the saints receive him and his gifts and graces from him; and the law of the Spirit, or his power and efficacy in working, is 'in' or 'by' Christ, through his sufferings and death, and in consequence of his mediation..." 

4. "Not from the being of sin; nor from the rage of it, and disturbance it gives; nor from such power of it, but that they may fall into sin; but so as that sin does not properly reign over them, nor legally, nor universally, or so as to bring a death on their graces, and their persons into condemnation." 

5. "For as 'the law of sin and death' may design inherent corruption, and the force and power of it in the saints; so the opposite to it, 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ,' may mean the purity and holiness of his human nature. That Christ's human nature is pure and holy is certain, from express texts of Scripture, from its union to the Son of God, from the ends and purposes of its assumption, from the inefficacy of Satan's temptations, and from the whole course of his life and conversation..."

### John Wesley:
