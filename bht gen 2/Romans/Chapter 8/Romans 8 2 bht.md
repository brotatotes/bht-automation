# Romans 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law of the Spirit of life, which refers to the gospel, has freed me from the law of sin and death, which represents the Mosaic dispensation. The gospel is the new principle of living bestowed by the Holy Spirit in Christ Jesus, bringing life and liberation. It is in Christ, as the head of His people, that the Spirit is the author and giver of this life. Through the gospel, believers are pardoned, freed from the old law of sin and death, and empowered to live the new life in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life freed me in Jesus Christ." 
2. "This 'law of the Spirit of life' having freed him from the law of sin and death, so that he serves another master, all claim of sin on him is at an end he is acquitted, and there is no condemnation for him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
2. "And as the word 'law' here has the same meaning as in Romans 7:23, namely, 'an inward principle of action, operating with the fixedness and regularity of a law,' it thus appears that 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus' here means, 'that new principle of action which the Spirit of Christ has opened up within us—the law of our new being.' This 'sets us free,' as soon as it takes possession of our inner man, 'from the law of sin and death'...the triumph of believers over their inward corruption, through the power of Christ's Spirit in them, proves them to be in Christ Jesus, and as such absolved from condemnation."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life...sprinkles our souls with the blood of Christ, not only to cleanse us from the stain of sin with respect to its guilt, but also to sanctify us that we may be really purified."
2. "The law of God condemns men, and...they are oppressed with the bondage of sin...but the Spirit of Christ...does at the same time deliver us from the peril of death."
3. "The grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of righteousness...Paul had said, that the grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of righteousness."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Law’ is here to be taken in its wide sense, the principle, ruling power, etc. The reference is not to the moral law, or the Mosaic law, or to the law of the mind, nor yet to the gospel as a system, but to the new principle of living which comes from the working of the Holy Spirit, here called the Spirit of life, because it gives life, works life in us."

3. "That Christ's human nature is pure and holy is certain, from express texts of Scripture, from its union to the Son of God, from the ends and purposes of its assumption, from the inefficacy of Satan's temptations, and from the whole course of his life and conversation."
