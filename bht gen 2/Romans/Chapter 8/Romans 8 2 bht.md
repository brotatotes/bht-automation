# Romans 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, which is the gospel, has freed me from the law of sin and death, that is, the Mosaic dispensation. This freedom is not achieved by the law or by our own efforts to keep it, but through the work of the Holy Spirit, who imparts life, grace, and salvation. In Christ, we are liberated from the condemnation and bondage brought by sin, and are united to Him who fulfills the law and delivers us from its yoke.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life freed me in Jesus Christ." 
2. "This 'law of the Spirit of life' having freed him from the law of sin and death, so that he serves another master, all claim of sin on him is at an end he is acquitted, and there is no condemnation for him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
2. "And as the word 'law' here has the same meaning as in Romans 7:23, namely, 'an inward principle of action, operating with the fixedness and regularity of a law,' it thus appears that 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus' here means, 'that new principle of action which the Spirit of Christ has opened up within us—the law of our new being.' This 'sets us free,' as soon as it takes possession of our inner man, 'from the law of sin and death'...the triumph of believers over their inward corruption, through the power of Christ's Spirit in them, proves them to be in Christ Jesus, and as such absolved from condemnation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'the Spirit of life' then means the Holy Spirit producing or giving life; that is, giving peace, joy, activity, salvation; in opposition to the law spoken of in Romans 7:0 that produced death and condemnation."
2. "The Spirit is sent by Christ; his influence is a part of the Christian scheme; and his power accomplishes what the Law could not do."
3. "But the design, the tendency, and the spirit of the gospel was to produce this freedom from what the Law could not deliver; and he was now brought under the general power of this scheme."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life...proceeding from the life of Jesus and producing and imparting life."
2. "The Spirit, the divine Spirit who inspires the law."
3. "In Christ Jesus... hath made me free."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life...sprinkles our souls with the blood of Christ, not only to cleanse us from the stain of sin with respect to its guilt, but also to sanctify us that we may be really purified."
2. "The law of God condemns men, and...they are oppressed with the bondage of sin...but the Spirit of Christ...does at the same time deliver us from the peril of death."
3. "The grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of righteousness...Paul had said, that the grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of righteousness."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Law’ is here to be taken in its wide sense, the principle, ruling power, etc. The reference is not to the moral law, or the Mosaic law, or to the law of the mind, nor yet to the gospel as a system, but to the new principle of living which comes from the working of the Holy Spirit, here called the Spirit of life, because it gives life, works life in us."
2. "The deliverance took place in virtue of union to Him who fulfilled the law and delivers from its bondage."
3. "The whole verse refers to what occurs in the man who is in Christ Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel may be designed by 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus'; which may be called a law, not as succeeding the law of works, by which that is abrogated; nor as requiring conditions to be performed, or as enjoining duties to be observed, or as delivering out threatenings in case of disobedience; but as it is a doctrine, order, and chain of truths..."
2. "The life which the Spirit is the author and giver of, is in Christ as the head of his people, the proper repository of all grace, and the fountain of life."
3. "That Christ's human nature is pure and holy is certain, from express texts of Scripture, from its union to the Son of God, from the ends and purposes of its assumption, from the inefficacy of Satan's temptations, and from the whole course of his life and conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law of the Spirit — That is, the gospel."
2. "Hath freed me from the law of sin and death — That is, the Mosaic dispensation."
