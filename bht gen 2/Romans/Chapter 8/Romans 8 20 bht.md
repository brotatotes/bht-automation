# Romans 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The creation, including the minds of the Gentiles, was subjected to a state of disorder, emptiness, and corruption, not by its own choice, but due to the impact of sin. The devil played a role in leading people into idolatry and wicked practices, but ultimately it was God who allowed this subjection for wise purposes. Although Adam's sin introduced the consequences, it was God who determined the subjection of creation, and there is still a glimmer of hope amidst the brokenness.
