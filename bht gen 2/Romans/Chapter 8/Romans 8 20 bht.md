# Romans 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The creation was made subject to vanity, represented as instability and decay, due to the fall of man. It willingly submitted to this state, not by choice but by divine decree. This state of vanity is not the desired condition for creation, but it is an arrangement of God, offering hope for deliverance and freedom from corruption. Though we may not fully comprehend why, we can trust in God's wisdom and purposes. This subjection to vanity is not a self-imposed state, but rather the result of God's act.

1. "This is given as a reason for its aspiring to the full privileges of adoption, that the present state is not one of choice, or one which is preferred, but one to which it has been subjected for wise reasons by God."
2. "It is not what they desire, to be subjected to the toils of this life, and to the temptations and vanities of this world. They sigh for deliverance."
3. "Their lot in life; their being subjected to this state of vanity, is the arrangement of God. Why it is, he has not seen fit to inform us fully.

### John Calvin:

2. "God has given to everything its charge; and he has not only by a distinct order commanded what he would to be done, but also implanted inwardly the hope of renovation."
