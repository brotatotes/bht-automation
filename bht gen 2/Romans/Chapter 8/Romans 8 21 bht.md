# Romans 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The creation eagerly awaits the manifestation of the sons of God, hoping that it too will be freed from the bondage of decay and corruption. This expectation is in line with the overarching theme of the passage. The creation, along with the Gentiles, longs for deliverance from corruption and looks forward to the freedom found in the glorious liberty of the children of God. It is not destruction, but true deliverance that the creation desires, as it seeks to enter into the excellent state in which it was originally created.
