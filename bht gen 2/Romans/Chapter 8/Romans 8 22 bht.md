# Romans 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse reminds us that the entire creation is subjected to a state of servitude, pain, vanity, and death. This includes everything we see and every living creature. But we should not be surprised by this condition because it is the same state that believers experience. The whole creation joins in a common lament, a universal groaning, as a dying world unitedly longs for deliverance. It is a groaning that has persisted until now, expressing the deep longing for the freedom from corruption that awaits both creation and believers. This is the general teaching of Scripture on the subject.

### Henry Alford:
1. "For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails together." 
2. "Not, groans and travails with us or with mankind, which would render the Œø·Ωê ŒºœåŒΩŒøŒΩ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·ºÄŒªŒªŒ¨ of the next verse superfluous." 
3. "Up to this time = from the beginning till now: no reference to time future, because Œø·º¥Œ¥Œ±ŒºŒµŒΩ Œ≥Œ¨œÅ expresses the results of experience."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "To represent [the earth] as sympathizing with man's miseries, and as looking forward to his complete redemption as the period of its own emancipation from its present sin-blighted condition, is a beautiful thought."
3. "In harmony with the general teaching of Scripture on the subject."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Everything which we see; every creature which lives, is thus subjected to a state of servitude, pain, vanity, and death."
2. "The whole creation is in just this condition; and we are not to be surprised, therefore, if it is the condition of the believer."
3. "It is one wide and loud lamentation, in which a dying world unites; and in which it has united 'until now.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Nature, with its melancholy charm, resembles a bride who, at the very moment when she was fully attired for marriage, saw the bridegroom die. She still stands with her fresh crown and in her bridal dress, but her eyes are full of tears" (Schelling, cited by Godet).

### John Calvin:
1. "He repeats the same sentiment, that he might pass over to us, though what is now said has the effect and the form of a conclusion; for as creatures are subject to corruption, not through their natural desire, but through the appointment of God, and then, as they have a hope of being hereafter freed from corruption, it hence follows, that they groan like a woman in travail until they shall be delivered." 
2. "The meaning is, that creatures are not content in their present state, and yet that they are not so distressed that they pine away without a prospect of a remedy, but that they are as it were in travail; for a restoration to a better state awaits them."
3. "By saying that they groan together, he does not mean that they are united together by mutual anxiety, but he joins them as companions to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This phenomenon, so universal and so unbroken, cannot be conducted without an aim; on the contrary, it presupposes as the motive of the painful travail that very hope, toward the final fulfillment of which it is directed."
2. "The word 'together' must be repeated to bring out the sense. It refers to the common groaning of the whole creation, and should not be explained as 'together with us'; this idea is first brought out in Romans 8:23."
3. "The reference to birth-pangs suggests a new form of nature, to which this pain is the necessary preliminary."

### John Gill:
1. "Regeneration is owing to the grace of God, which is compared to 'seed', of which men are born again."
2. "The apostles preached the word with much contention, and the Gentiles received it in much affliction, though with the joy of the Holy Ghost; as a woman rejoices when a man child is brought forth, though the birth has been attended with pain and labour."
3. "This was an united groan, and travail of all the converted Gentiles in the several parts of the world, together with the ministers of the Gospel, earnestly desiring more instances of conversion among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "For the whole creation groaneth together - With joint groans, as it were with one voice."
2. "And travaileth - Literally, is in the pains of childbirth, to be delivered of the burden of the curse."
3. "Until now - To this very hour; and so on till the time of deliverance."
