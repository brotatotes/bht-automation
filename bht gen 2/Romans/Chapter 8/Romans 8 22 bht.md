# Romans 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse speaks of the universal longing for redemption and restoration, as the entire creation groans and travails together. This collective groaning is not limited to humanity alone, but extends to all of creation. The imagery of childbirth is used to depict the intensity and anticipation of this longing. From the beginning till now, this longing has persisted, as creation awaits the time of deliverance. The hope of this deliverance is not without foundation, as it is rooted in the grace of God and the preaching of the Gospel, which brings both affliction and the joy of the Holy Spirit. This united groaning and travail expresses the earnest desire for more instances of conversion and the ultimate fulfillment of hope.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For we know...that the whole creation groans together and travails together."
2. "Not, groans and travails with us or with mankind, which would render the Œø·Ωê ŒºœåŒΩŒøŒΩ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·ºÄŒªŒªŒ¨ of the next verse superfluous."
3. "Until now = from the beginning till now: no reference to time future, because Œø·º¥Œ¥Œ±ŒºŒµŒΩ Œ≥Œ¨œÅ expresses the results of experience."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now‚ÄîIf for man's sake alone the earth was cursed, it cannot surprise us that it should share in his recovery."
2. "And if so, to represent it as sympathizing with man's miseries, and as looking forward to his complete redemption as the period of its own emancipation from its present sin-blighted condition, is a beautiful thought."
3. "In harmony with the general teaching of Scripture on the subject."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole creation is in just this condition; and we are not to be surprised, therefore, if it is the condition of the believer. It is a part of the universal system of things; it accords with everything we see; and we are not to be surprised that the church exists on the same principle of administration; in a state of bondage, imperfection, sorrow, and sighing for deliverance."
2. "All is united in a condition of sorrow. The expression denotes mutual and universal grief. It is one wide and loud lamentation, in which a dying world unites; and in which it has united 'until now.'"
3. "It has been the characteristic of every age. It is remarkable that the apostle does not here say of 'the whole creation,' that it had any hope of deliverance... The Scriptures say nothing of the future condition of the brutal creation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The simple verb wjdinw to travail, occurs Galatians 4:19, Galatians 4:27; Revelation 12:2; and the kindred noun wjdin birth - pang, in Matthew and Mark, Acts, and 1 Thessalonians 5:3."
2. "Nature, with its melancholy charm, resembles a bride who, at the very moment when she was fully attired for marriage, saw the bridegroom die. She still stands with her fresh crown and in her bridal dress, but her eyes are full of tears" (Schelling, cited by Godet).

### John Calvin:
1. "He repeats the same sentiment, that he might pass over to us, though what is now said has the effect and the form of a conclusion."
2. "The meaning is, that creatures are not content in their present state, and yet that they are not so distressed that they pine away without a prospect of a remedy, but that they are as it were in travail; for a restoration to a better state awaits them."
3. "The whole passage, from Romans 8:18 to the end of Romans 8:25, is in character with the usual style of the Apostle. He finishes the first part with Romans 8:22; and then in the second part he announces the same thing in a different form, in more explicit terms, and with some additions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This phenomenon, so universal and so unbroken, cannot be conducted without an aim; on the contrary, it presupposes as the motive of the painful travail that very hope, toward the final fulfillment of which it is directed."
2. "The word 'together' must be repeated to bring out the sense. It refers to the common groaning of the whole creation, and should not be explained as 'together with us'; this idea is first brought out in Romans 8:23."
3. "The reference to birth-pangs suggests a new form of nature, to which this pain is the necessary preliminary."

### John Gill:
1. "Regeneration is owing to the grace of God, which is compared to 'seed', of which men are born again."
2. "The apostles preached the word with much contention, and the Gentiles received it in much affliction, though with the joy of the Holy Ghost."
3. "This was an united groan, and travail of all the converted Gentiles in the several parts of the world, together with the ministers of the Gospel, earnestly desiring more instances of conversion among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "For the whole creation groaneth together ‚Äî With joint groans, as it were with one voice."
2. "And travaileth ‚Äî Literally, is in the pains of childbirth, to be delivered of the burden of the curse."
3. "Until now ‚Äî To this very hour; and so on till the time of deliverance."
