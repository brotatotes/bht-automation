# Romans 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, as believers, have received the firstfruits of the Spirit, which is an earnest of our complete possession by Him. Just as creation eagerly awaits the full harvest, we too long for the redemption of our bodies from corruption and sin. This redemption includes the public declaration of our adoption as sons and daughters of God, which will occur at the resurrection. Our hope lies in the complete restoration of our bodies, transforming them from corruption to glory and immortality. Therefore, we patiently endure the present groaning, knowing that our future inheritance is incorruptible, undefiled, and reserved in the heavens.
