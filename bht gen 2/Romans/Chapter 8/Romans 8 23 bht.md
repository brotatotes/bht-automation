# Romans 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The firstfruits of the Spirit, the indwelling and influences of the Holy Spirit, serve as an earnest and pledge of the complete possession of God. These firstfruits mold our hearts to a heavenly frame, attuning us to our future element. While we have already received a portion of heaven within us, we still groan under the burden of our present state, eagerly awaiting the fullness of our adoption and the redemption of our bodies. This redemption entails the rescue and deliverance of our bodies from corruption and sin, bringing about the glorious and eternal transformation of our mortal bodies into immortality and blessedness.
