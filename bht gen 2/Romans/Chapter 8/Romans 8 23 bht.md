# Romans 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we have the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, who is the first installment of our inheritance. We eagerly await the fullness of our adoption, when our bodies will be redeemed from corruption and brought into glorious immortality. Just as a Roman adoptee would be publicly acknowledged as a son in a grand assembly, so too will we be publicly acknowledged by God in the resurrection of our bodies. This redemption is our ultimate hope, a future inheritance that is incorruptible, undefiled, and everlasting.
