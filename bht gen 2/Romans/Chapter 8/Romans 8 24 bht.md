# Romans 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are saved, not by something we have already obtained, but in the hope of what is to come. Hope is not just wishful thinking, but a confident expectation that what is promised will be fulfilled. Our salvation is both present and future, as we eagerly await the fullness of redemption. The object of our hope is unseen, but our faith in Christ gives us a solid foundation for this hope. We are saved by grace through faith, and it is this hope that sustains us in our journey towards eternal salvation.

### John Calvin:

2. "The manner in which they are said to be saved, is "by", or "in hope"; not that hope is the cause of salvation, but the means by which souls are brought to the enjoyment of it; salvation, or glory, is the object of it."
3. "Hope laid up for them in heaven, where it is safe and secure; all which is unseen, and yet to come; but good reason there is to hope for it, since the Scriptures of truth so clearly express it; and the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, lay such a solid foundation for hope of it."

1. "Our salvation is now only in hope."
2. "We do not yet possess this full salvation."
