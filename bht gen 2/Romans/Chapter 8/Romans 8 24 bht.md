# Romans 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In our journey of faith, our salvation is not yet fully realized, but it is a hope that sustains us. Being saved in hope means that we have a confident expectation of future glory and eternal happiness. Although we have not yet obtained these promises, we have a solid foundation for our hope in the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ. As we eagerly await the fulfillment of these promises, we are encouraged to persevere in faith, knowing that our trials and challenges are preparing us for the future deliverance that we hope for.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For in hope we are saved"; that is, it is more a salvation in hope than as yet in actual possession.
2. "But hope that is seen is not hope"; for the very meaning of hope is the expectation that something now future will become present.
3. "For what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?"; the latter ending when the other comes.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It cannot be said that hope is the instrument or condition of salvation...we have arrived only to a condition in which we hope for future glory; and that we are in an attitude of waiting for the future state of adoption."
2. "Our trials are so great that nothing but the prospect of future deliverance would uphold us; and the prospect is sufficient to enable us to bear them with patience."
3. "Hope is a complex emotion, made up of an earnest desire, and an expectation of obtaining an object. It has reference, therefore, to what is at present unseen."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Hope - not hope. Here the word is used of the object of hope." 
3. "See Colossians 1:5; 1 Timothy 1:1; Hebrews 6:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since hope extends to things not yet obtained, and represents to our minds the form of things hidden and far remote, whatever is either openly seen or really possessed, is not an object of hope."
2. "If then it be grievous to any to groan, they necessarily subvert the order laid down by God, who does not call his people to victory before he exercises them in the warfare of patience."
3. "When we are said to be saved by hope, the meaning is that we are not fully or perfectly saved now, and that this is what we hope for."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Faith apprehends the object, in so far as it is present; hope, in so far as it is still future."

### John Gill:
1. "They were already saved in the preparations and purposes of God; in the covenant of grace; in the arms and hands of Christ, through his purchase; and as considered in him."
2. "Hope is the means by which souls are brought to the enjoyment of salvation, or glory."
3. "Eternal glory and happiness is the object of the hope of believers; it is unseen, and yet to come; but good reason there is to hope for it, since the Scriptures of truth so clearly express it; and the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, lay such a solid foundation for hope of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our salvation is now only in hope."
2. "We do not yet possess this full salvation."
