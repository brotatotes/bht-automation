# Romans 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In hope, we are saved. Our salvation is not yet fully obtained, but rather an expectation for the future. This hope is characterized by the desire for what is to come, reaching beyond what is currently seen or possessed. It is based on the promises of God and the foundation of our faith in Christ. This hope assures us of the unseen glory that awaits us, as we eagerly anticipate the fulfillment of our salvation. Though we may not experience it fully in the present, our hope remains steadfast as we trust in the faithfulness of God's Word.

3. "Hope laid up for them in heaven, where it is safe and secure; all which is unseen, and yet to come; but good reason there is to hope for it, since the Scriptures of truth so clearly express it; and the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, lay such a solid foundation for hope of it."
