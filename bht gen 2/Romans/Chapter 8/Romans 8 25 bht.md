# Romans 8:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to patiently wait for what we hope for, even though it may be unseen and yet to be fulfilled. This patient waiting is a fitting attitude for believers who have a strong desire for future glory and a steadfast expectation of obtaining it. In the midst of trials and persecutions, we can bear them patiently, knowing that our hope lies in the promise of future deliverance and the blessed eternity before us. Patience is the companion of faith, softening the feelings of present miseries when we console ourselves with the hope of a better condition.
