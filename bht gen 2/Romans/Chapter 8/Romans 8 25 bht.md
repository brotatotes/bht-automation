# Romans 8:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Patience is the state and medium in which our waiting takes place. It is the fitting attitude when we desire and expect something, but do not yet possess it. Patience sustains us in times when we could faint through despair. It is closely tied to faith and helps us endure present sufferings with the hope of a better future. Patience is motivated by belief in unseen realities like death, Christ's return, resurrection, and eternal glory. It requires valuing these promises and persevering through imperfection. Patience is a grace from God, exemplified by Christ, and cultivated through the Word.
