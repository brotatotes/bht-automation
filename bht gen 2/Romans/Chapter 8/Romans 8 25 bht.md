# Romans 8:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who hope for unseen promises, such as the hour of death, the second coming of Christ, and the resurrection of the dead, must wait patiently. This waiting is characterized by a belief in and affection for the promises, along with an acknowledgment of one's own imperfection. Patience in waiting for these promises is a grace bestowed by God, exemplified by Christ, and nurtured through the Word.
