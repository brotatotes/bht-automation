# Romans 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit of God helps us in our weakness, bearing the burdens upon us. He lifts us up in prayer, enabling us to express what would otherwise be unutterable. The Spirit supports us in deep emotions and intense feelings, giving us the language to communicate with God. He intercedes for us, enabling us to come to God as our Father and giving us boldness in His presence. In our weakness, the Spirit groans as He helps us, and through Him, our prayers become inexpressible, formed by the Spirit Himself.
