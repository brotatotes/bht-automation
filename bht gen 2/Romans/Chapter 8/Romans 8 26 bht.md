# Romans 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit of God also joins in our struggles, assisting us in our weaknesses. Our understanding and desires are feeble, and often we do not even know what or how to pray. However, the Spirit helps us by interceding for us, even with groanings and prayers that go beyond our ability to express. Thus, the Spirit plays an active role in our prayers, raising them to a higher level and aligning them with the perfect will of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the Spirit also helps our weakness, us who are weak, to bear the burden"
2. "the Holy Spirit of God dwelling in us, knowing our wants better than we, Himself pleads in our prayers, raising us to higher and holier desires than we can express in words"
3. "the Spirit suggests to us the proper words of acceptable prayer, which would otherwise have been unutterable by us"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For we know not what we should pray for as we ought—It is not the proper matter of prayer that believers are at so much loss about, but to ask for the right things 'as they ought' is the difficulty."
2. "In these circumstances, much uncertainty should surround all our spiritual exercises, and doubts should spring up within us whether our frame of mind in such exercises is well pleasing to God."
3. "But not in vain are these groanings. For 'the Spirit Himself' is in them, giving to the emotions which He Himself has kindled the only language of which they are capable; so that though on our part, they are the fruit of impotence to utter what we feel, they are at the same time the intercession of the Spirit Himself in our behalf."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Likewise the Spirit - This introduces a new source of consolation and support, what is derived from the Spirit."
2. "The Holy Spirit greatly assists or aids us in our infirmities, or aids us to bear them."
3. "The Spirit greatly aids or supports us in those deep emotions, those intense feelings, those inward sighs which cannot be expressed in language, but which he enables us to bear, and which are understood by Him that searcheth the hearts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lambanetai taketh. Precisely the same verb in precisely the same phrase, which is translated 'took our infirmities'", Matthew 8:17 (Bushnell).
2. "Maketh intercession for [υπερεντυγχανει]. Only here in the New Testament. The verb ejntugcanw means to light upon or fall in with; to go to meet for consultation, conversation, or supplication. So Acts 25:24, 'dealt with,' Rev., 'made suit.' Compare Romans 8:34; Romans 11:2; Hebrews 7:25."
3. "Which cannot be uttered [αλαλητοις]. This may mean either unutterable or unuttered."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is then no reason for any one to complain, that the bearing of the cross is beyond their own strength, since we are sustained by a celestial power."
2. "The Spirit takes on himself a part of the burden, by which our weakness is oppressed; so that he not only helps and succours us, but lifts us up; as though he went under the burden with us."

2. "The Spirit helps our weakness, in bearing the burden spoken of in Romans 8:23, in awaiting final redemption. The reference is not to weakness in prayer alone, nor is our weakness the burden which the Spirit helps us bear."
3. "The Holy Spirit is here spoken of in His saving work in us: while dwelling in us He makes intercession thus, Himself pleads in our prayers, raising us to higher and holier desires than we can express in words, which can only find utterance in sighings and aspirations."

### John Gill:

3. "We know not — Many times. What we should pray for — Much less are we able to pray for it as we ought: but the Spirit maketh intercession for us - In our hearts, even as Christ does in heaven."
