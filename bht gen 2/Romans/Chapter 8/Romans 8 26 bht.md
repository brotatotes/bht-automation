# Romans 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit of God helps us in our weaknesses, groaning and interceding on our behalf. We often struggle to know what to pray for or express our desires, but the Spirit guides us in choosing the right words and elevates our desires. The Spirit aids and supports us in bearing the burdens of our infirmities, going under the weight alongside us. In our prayers, the Spirit pleads on our behalf with unutterable groanings, indicating the presence of divine favor. Even if our prayers may not be answered as we expect, the Spirit's intercession assures us that God hears us.

2. "In these circumstances, much uncertainty should surround all our spiritual exercises, and doubts should spring up within us whether our frame of mind in such exercises is well pleasing to God."
3. "But not in vain are these groanings. For 'the Spirit Himself' is in them, giving to the emotions which He Himself has kindled the only language of which they are capable; so that though on our part, they are the fruit of impotence to utter what we feel, they are at the same time the intercession of the Spirit Himself in our behalf."

### Albert Barnes:

1. "Lambanetai taketh. Precisely the same verb in precisely the same phrase, which is translated 'took our infirmities'", Matthew 8:17 (Bushnell).
2. "Maketh intercession for [œÖœÄŒµœÅŒµŒΩœÑœÖŒ≥œáŒ±ŒΩŒµŒπ]. Only here in the New Testament. The verb ejntugcanw means to light upon or fall in with; to go to meet for consultation, conversation, or supplication. So Acts 25:24, 'dealt with,' Rev., 'made suit.' Compare Romans 8:34; Romans 11:2; Hebrews 7:25."
