# Romans 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The comforting assurance we have is that God, the Heart-Searcher, understands the inarticulate sighings of the Spirit within us. He knows the mind of the Spirit and interprets our prayers even when they are imperfectly expressed. Our prayers are heard and answered, not because of our own ability, but because the Spirit pleads on our behalf in accordance with God's will. We can find solace in knowing that God sees the true intentions of our hearts and responds to the voice of the Spirit within us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The assurance which we have that God the Heart-Searcher interprets the inarticulate sighings of the Spirit in us, is, not strictly speaking, His Omniscience, but the fact that the very Spirit who thus pleads, does it κατὰ θεόν, in pursuance of the divine purposes and in conformity with God’s good pleasure."
2. "All these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when inarticulately uttered; we may extend the same comforting assurance to the imperfect and mistaken verbal utterances of our prayers, which are not themselves answered to our hurt, but the answer is given to the voice of the Spirit which speaks through them, which we would express, but cannot."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He watches the surging emotions of them in prayer, and knows perfectly what the Spirit means by the groanings which He draws forth within us."
2. "It cannot but swell the heart of every intelligent Christian to think that if external nature has been mysteriously affected for evil by the fall of man, it only awaits his completed recovery, at the resurrection, to experience a corresponding emancipation from its blighted condition into undecaying life and unfading beauty."
3. "When believers, through sinful 'quenching of the Spirit,' have the fewest and faintest glimpses of heaven, that they sigh most fervently to be there; but, on the contrary, when through the unobstructed working of the Spirit in their hearts, 'the first-fruits' of the glory to be revealed are most largely and frequently tasted, then, and just for that reason, is it that they 'groan within themselves' for full redemption."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To search the heart is one of his attributes which cannot be communicated to a creature." 
2. "He does not need that those deep emotions should be expressed in words... but he sees the anxious feelings of the soul, and is ready to aid and to bless."
3. "That man is most safe who yields himself most entirely to the influence of the Holy Spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a remarkable reason for strengthening our confidence, that we are heard by God when we pray through his Spirit, for he thoroughly knows our desires, even as the thoughts of his own Spirit."
2. "God regards not these emotions of the Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as unreasonable, but that he allows them, and at the same time kindly accepts them, as allowed and approved by him."
3. "Let us also hence learn, that what holds the first place in prayer is consent with the will of the Lord, whom our wishes do by no means hold under obligation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though the groanings are unutterable, God understands their meaning."
2. "The mind of the Spirit...may be but partially recognized by us in our weakness."
3. "He approves what is the mind of the Spirit because...He pleadeth for the saints according to the will of God."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the prerogative of God: and he knows what is the mind of the Spirit; not the spirit of men, but of God..."
2. "The searcher of hearts knows this, not barely by his omniscience, but he regards it, approves of it, attends, and gives an answer to it; which is no small encouragement to pray..."
3. "He maketh intercession for holy things according to God; for spiritual blessings, divine favors, things that belong to God; or divine things, which are agreeably to his nature and will."

### John Wesley:
1. "He who searcheth the hearts...knoweth...what is the mind of the Spirit." 
2. "For he maketh intercession for the saints...according to God."
