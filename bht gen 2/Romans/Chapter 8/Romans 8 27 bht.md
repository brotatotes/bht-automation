The hearts of men are known only by God, as it is His divine attribute. The mind of the Spirit is understood by the heart-searching God, who hears and answers even the inarticulate and imperfect prayers of His saints. The intercession made by the Holy Spirit is in accordance with God's will, making it powerful and effective for the saints. It is this divine intercession that brings about the desired outcome, aligning with the purposes and desires of God Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The assurance which we have that God the Heart-Searcher interprets the inarticulate sighings of the Spirit in us, is, not strictly speaking, His Omniscience, but the fact that the very Spirit who thus pleads, does it κατὰ θεόν, in pursuance of the divine purposes and in conformity with God’s good pleasure."
2. "All these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when inarticulately uttered."
3. "We may extend the same comforting assurance to the imperfect and mistaken verbal utterances of our prayers, which are not themselves answered to our hurt, but the answer is given to the voice of the Spirit which speaks through them, which we would express, but cannot."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he—the Spirit maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God." 
2. "The spirit of bondage, to which many Protestants are 'all their lifetime subject,' and the 'doubtsome faith' which the Popish Church systematically inculcates, are both rebuked here, being in direct and painful contrast to that 'spirit of adoption,' and that witness of the Spirit, along with our own spirit, to the fact of our sonship, which it is here said the children of God, as such, enjoy."
3. "It cannot but swell the heart of every intelligent Christian to think that if external nature has been mysteriously affected for evil by the fall of man, it only awaits his completed recovery, at the resurrection, to experience a corresponding emancipation from its blighted condition into undecaying life and unfading beauty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To search the heart is one of his attributes which cannot be communicated to a creature."
2. "He does not need that those deep emotions should be expressed in words; he does not need the eloquence of language to induce him to hear."
3. "That man is most safe who yields himself most entirely to the influence of the Holy Spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a remarkable reason for strengthening our confidence, that we are heard by God when we pray through his Spirit, for he thoroughly knows our desires, even as the thoughts of his own Spirit."
2. "The suitableness of the word to know intimates that God regards not these emotions of the Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as unreasonable, but that he allows them, and at the same time kindly accepts them, as allowed and approved by him."
3. "Let us also hence learn, that what holds the first place in prayer is consent with the will of the Lord, whom our wishes do by no means hold under obligation. If then we would have our prayers to be acceptable to God, we must pray that he may regulate them according to his will."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though the groanings are unutterable, God understands their meaning."
2. "The mind of the Spirit... is an object of knowledge to the heart-searching God."
3. "What we cannot utter... is known to God, because in accordance with His will."

### John Gill:
1. "This is peculiar to God, and a 'periphrasis' of him; angels, neither good nor bad, can search into the hearts of men; one man cannot know the heart of another, nor any man fully know his own; this is the prerogative of God."
2. "The searcher of hearts knows this, not barely by his omniscience, but he regards it, approves of it, attends, and gives an answer to it; which is no small encouragement to pray, though it be but with sighs and groans unutterable."
3. "Since it is the Holy Spirit that makes intercession, and the persons are holy for whom he makes it, and this is made for holy things, and all according to the will of God, which the Spirit of God must fully know, saints may be confident of the prevalence and success of such intercession."

### John Wesley:
1. "He who searcheth the hearts...knoweth...what is the mind of the Spirit." 
2. "For he maketh intercession for the saints." 
3. "According to God...as is worthy of God and acceptable to him."
