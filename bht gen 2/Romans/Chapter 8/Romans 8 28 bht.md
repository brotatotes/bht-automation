# Romans 8:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We know that all things, whether ease or pain, poverty or riches, and the many changes of life, work together in a strong and sweet manner for our spiritual and eternal good. Just as we observe this in ourselves, God also applies it to himself. His providence and redemption are immense, and we may think of God as deliberating and decreeing to act according to his own will. But in reality, this is just a way for us to understand his infallible knowledge and unchangeable wisdom, as he does all things with deep consultation and pursues the most proper methods.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These may seem calculated to dash down hope, and surpass patience; but we know better concerning them."
2. "We know (as a point of the assurance of faith) that to those who love God all things work together."
3. "The divine side of their security from harm is brought out, as combining with and ensuring the other. They are sure that all things work for their good, not only because they love Him who worketh all things, but also because He who worketh all things hath loved and chosen them, and carried them through the successive steps of their spiritual life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We know that to them that love God, all things work together for good [even] to them who are called according to His (eternal) purpose." Glorious assurance!
2. This working of all things for good is done quite naturally to "them that love God" because such souls, persuaded that He who gave His own Son for them cannot but mean them well in all His procedure, learn thus to take in good part whatever He sends them, however trying to flesh and blood.
3. And knowing that it is in pursuance of an eternal "purpose" of love that they have been called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ, they naturally say within themselves, "It cannot be that He 'of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things,' should suffer that purpose to be thwarted by anything really adverse to us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All things - All our afflictions and trials; all the persecutions and calamities to which we are exposed. Though they are numerous and long-continued yet they are among the means that are appointed for our welfare." 
2. "They take off our affections from this world; they teach us the truth about our frail, transitory, and lying condition; they lead us to look to God for support, and to heaven for a final home; and they produce a subdued spirit, a humble temper, a patient, tender, and kind disposition."
3. "The Christian is made a better man by receiving afflictions as they should be received, and by desiring that they should accomplish the purpose for which they are sent; the sinner is made more hardened by resisting them, and refusing to submit to their obvious intention and design."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Work together. Or, are working together, now, while the creation is in travail."
2. "Together refers to the common working of all the elements included in panta all things."
3. "Paul, all things are working together for good."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though God does not immediately succour his people, he yet does not forsake them, for by a wonderful contrivance he turns those things which seem to be evils in such a way as to promote their salvation."
2. "The faithful do not love God before they are called by him...The faithful attain not religion by their own efforts, but are, on the contrary led by the hand of God, inasmuch as he has chosen them to be a peculiar people to himself."
3. "Paul made this express declaration, that our salvation is based on the election of God, in order to connect, as by a kind of necessary chain, our salvation with the bearing of the cross."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All things.  All events, even afflictive ones (Romans 8:35), indeed all created things (Romans 8:38-39)."
2. "Work  together. The usual sense: cooperate, combine to produce the result, is preferable."
3. "According to his  purpose. The call is in accordance with the purpose (comp. Romans 8:29-30); the former becomes a fact we can perceive, the latter we cannot perceive, but receive as a fact, for all things cannot work together for good to them that love God unless God has a purpose, with which what occurs accords."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is God who makes 'all things work together' in our lives 'for good' (εις αγαθον), ultimate good."
2. "Paul accepts fully human free agency but behind it all and through it all runs God's sovereignty as here and on its gracious side."

### John Gill:
1. "And we know that all things work together for good... There is a temporal good, and a spiritual good, and an eternal one."
2. "All created ones, as good angels, good magistrates, good ministers of the Gospel: all evil beings, as devils, persecuting magistrates, heretics, and false teachers: all things, good and bad: all good things, outward peace and prosperity, external gifts, the ministry of the word, the administration of ordinances, church censures, admonitions, and excommunications..."
3. "The persons to whom all things work together for good, are described as such that love God; a character, which does not agree with all the sons and daughters of Adam... They are further described, as such who are the called according to his purpose."

### John Wesley:
1. "All things — Ease or pain, poverty or riches, and the ten thousand changes of life. Work together for good — Strongly and sweetly for spiritual and eternal good." 
2. "Having observed this in ourselves, we are ready to apply it to God also; and he, in condescension to us has applied it to himself. The works of providence and redemption are vast and stupendous, and therefore we are apt to conceive of God as deliberating and consulting on them, and then decreeing to act according to 'the counsel of his own will;'" 
3. "This is only a popular representation of his infallible knowledge and unchangeable wisdom; that is, he does all things as wisely as a man can possibly do, after the deepest consultation, and as steadily pursues the most proper method as one can do who has laid a scheme beforehand."
