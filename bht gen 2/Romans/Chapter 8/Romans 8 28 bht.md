# Romans 8:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are assured that all things work together for good. This knowledge comes from our understanding of God's purpose to save humanity through the sacrifice of His Son. We see evidence in the examples of Jacob, Joseph, and Job, as well as our own experiences. As those who love God, we demonstrate our love by imitating Him and making His glory our supreme goal. Through this love, we can trust that everything happens as part of God's plan, working together for our ultimate benefit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Having given an example, in prayer, how the Spirit helps our weakness, and out of our ignorance and discouragement brings from God an answer of peace, he now extends this to all things, all circumstances by which the Christian finds himself surrounded."
2. "We know (as a point of the assurance of faith) that to those who love God, all things work together."
3. "The calling here and elsewhere spoken of by the Apostle is the working, in men, of 'the everlasting purpose of God whereby before the foundations of the world were laid, He hath decreed by His counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom He hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "This working of all things for good is done quite naturally to 'them that love God,' because such souls, persuaded that He who gave His own Son for them cannot but mean them well in all His procedure, learn thus to take in good part whatever He sends them, however trying to flesh and blood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They take off our affections from this world; they teach us the truth about our frail, transitory, and lying condition; they lead us to look to God for support, and to heaven for a final home; and they produce a subdued spirit, a humble temper, a patient, tender, and kind disposition."
2. "The Christian is made a better man by receiving afflictions as they should be received, and by desiring that they should accomplish the purpose for which they are sent."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the elect and the reprobate are indiscriminately exposed to similar evils, there is yet a great difference; for God trains up the faithful by afflictions, and thereby promotes their salvation."
2. "All things which happen to the saints are so overruled by God, that what the world regards as evil, the issue shows to be good."

3. "According to his purpose. The call is in accordance with the purpose (comp.
