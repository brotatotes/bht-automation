# Romans 8:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are foreknown by God are predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son. This conformity to Christ is the evidence and mark of those who are both foreknown and destined for glory. It is the result of God's everlasting love and approval of His own people, who are made partakers of the divine nature and share in the same family as Christ, though not on the same level of sonship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those who He foreknew would repent and believe," say Pelagians of every age and every hue. But this is to thrust into the text what is contrary to the whole spirit, and even letter, of the apostle's teaching."
2. "God's 'knowledge' of His people cannot be restricted to a mere foresight of future events, or acquaintance with what is passing here below."
3. "But probably God's foreknowledge of His own people means His 'peculiar, gracious, complacency in them,' while His 'predestinating' or 'foreordaining' them signifies His fixed purpose, flowing from this, to 'save them and call them with a holy calling.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It implies 'certain knowledge.' It was certainly foreseen, in some way, that they would believe, and be saved."
2. "The event which was thus foreknown must have been, for some cause, certain and fixed; since an uncertain event could not be possibly foreknown. To talk of foreknowing a contingent event, that is, of foreknowing an event as certain which may or may not exist, is an absurdity."
3. "The only evidence which we can have that we are the subjects of his gracious purpose is, that we are 'in fact' conformed to the Lord Jesus Christ."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is God's being aware in His plan, by means of which, before the subjects are destined by Him to salvation, He knows whom He has to destine thereto" (Meyer).
2. "In God is no before. All the past, present, and future are simultaneously present to Him."
3. "That a predetermination of God is clearly stated as accompanying or (humanly speaking) succeeding, and grounded upon the foreknowledge. That this predetermination is to the end of conformity to the image of the Son of God, and that this is the vital point of the passage."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then shows, by the very order of election, that the afflictions of the faithful are nothing else than the manner by which they are conformed to the image of Christ."
2. "The foreknowledge of God, which Paul mentions, is not a bare prescience, as some unwise persons absurdly imagine, but the adoption by which he had always distinguished his children from the reprobate."
3. "Hence those, to whom I have alluded, foolishly draw this inference, — That God has elected none but those whom he foresaw would be worthy of his grace. Peter does not indeed flatter the faithful, as though every one had been elected on account of his merit; but by reminding them of the eternal counsel of God, he wholly deprives them of all worthiness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole matter is stated as presenting the objective ground of confidence of believers."
2. "The beginning of the whole plan is in the good pleasure of God: He foreknew certain persons as those whom He would destine unto salvation, and those He foreordained."
3. "The purpose of grace began in Him, even as His glory is its end. Nothing can separate the first-born and His many brethren."

### John Gill:
1. "The foreknowledge of God here...is the everlasting love of God to his own people, his delight in them, and approbation of them."
2. "Christ is the firstborn of God, the begotten of the Father, he is the first begotten, and as such he is the only begotten."
3. "Christ is the firstborn with respect to the saints; who are of the same nature with him, are made partakers of the divine nature, are sons in the same family, though not in the same class of sonship."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whom he foreknew, he also predestinated conformable to the image of his Son."
2. "This is the mark of those who are foreknown and will be glorified."
3. "Those who are conformable to the image of his Son."
