# Romans 8:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse highlights the connection between God's foreknowledge, predestination, and the ultimate purpose of believers being conformed to the image of Christ. Their afflictions serve as a means of conforming them to Christ's likeness. The foreknowledge mentioned by Paul is not merely a predictive knowledge but rather an adoption by which God distinguishes His children. This adoption is inseparable from the decree that believers will bear the cross. Ultimately, the purpose of predestination is centered on Christ, as believers are called to be partakers of His divine nature and conform to Him as the firstborn among many brethren.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those who He foreknew would repent and believe," say Pelagians of every age and every hue. But this is to thrust into the text what is contrary to the whole spirit, and even letter, of the apostle's teaching."
2. "God's 'knowledge' of His people cannot be restricted to a mere foresight of future events, or acquaintance with what is passing here below."
3. "God's foreknowledge of His own people means His 'peculiar, gracious, complacency in them,' while His 'predestinating' or 'foreordaining' them signifies His fixed purpose, flowing from this, to 'save them and call them with an holy calling'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It does not here have reference to all the human family; for all are not, and have not, been conformed to the image of his Son."
2. "The event which was thus foreknown must have been, for some cause, certain and fixed; since an uncertain event could not be possibly foreknown."
3. "While the word used here, therefore, does not of necessity mean to decree, yet its use supposes that there was a purpose or plan."
4. "No passage could possibly teach in stronger language that it was Godâ€™s purpose to save those who will be saved."
5. "The only evidence which we can have that we are the subjects of his gracious purpose is, that we are 'in fact' conformed to the Lord Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is God's being aware in His plan, by means of which, before the subjects are destined by Him to salvation, He knows whom He has to destine thereto" (Meyer).
2. "In God is no before." All the past, present, and future are simultaneously present to Him. In presenting the two phases, the operation of God's knowledge and of His decretory will, the succession of time is introduced, not as metaphysically true, but in concession to human limitations of thought. Hence the coordinating force of kai also.
3. "That a predetermination of God is clearly stated as accompanying or (humanly speaking) succeeding, and grounded upon the foreknowledge."
4. "That this predetermination is to the end of conformity to the image of the Son of God, and that this is the vital point of the passage."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then shows, by the very order of election, that the afflictions of the faithful are nothing else than the manner by which they are conformed to the image of Christ..."
2. "But the foreknowledge of God, which Paul mentions, is not a bare prescience...but the adoption by which he had always distinguished his children from the reprobate."
3. "The meaning then is, that gratuitous adoption, in which our salvation consists, is inseparable from the other decree, which determines that we are to bear the cross..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse and the next prove the statement of Romans 8:28, showing how the calling agrees with Godâ€™s purpose, forming part of His plan; the successive steps of the unfolding of this purpose are indicated, up to the certain glorification of the chosen ones."
2. "The foreknowledge precedes the foreordaining, is its ground as it were (although strictly speaking, there is no  before nor  after in the eternal God). Hence we must not confound the two, nor apply them to other than the same individuals; nor should we depart from the obvious sense of â€˜foreknewâ€™ by explaining it as meaning â€˜approveâ€™ (introducing the idea of foreseen faith)."
3. "The final purpose of the predestination, is concerning Christ; comp. Ephesians 1:4-5. The first-born among many brethren. First in order of time, as well as chief in rank; comp. Colossians 1:15. The purpose of grace began in Him, even as His glory is its end."

### John Gill:
1. "The foreknowledge of God here...is the foundation of their predestination and election, of their conformity to Christ, of their calling, justification, and glorification."
2. "This conformity to Christ as sons, will more fully appear hereafter, when they shall be like him, and see him as he is."
3. "Christ is the firstborn with respect to the saints; who are of the same nature with him, are made partakers of the divine nature, are sons in the same family, though not in the same class of sonship."

### John Wesley:
1. "Those who are foreknown and will be glorified, 2 Timothy 2:19."
2. "This is the mark of those who are foreknown and will be glorified."
3. "Philippians 3:10,21."
