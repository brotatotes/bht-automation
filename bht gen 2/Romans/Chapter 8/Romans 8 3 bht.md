# Romans 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible passage being referred to here describes God's condemnation of sin and His victory over it through the sending of His Son. The commentary notes that the law is unable to secure its own fulfillment and cannot free us from sin and condemnation. However, through Christ's sacrifice, sin is not only condemned as evil but also weakened and ultimately destroyed. Christ took on our nature, yet without sin, and His holy character serves as a condemnation of unholiness. Through His death, God accomplished what the law could not do, condemning sin and securing our reconciliation with Him.

2. "God took the method now to be described for attaining that end." 
3. "He was made in the reality of our flesh, but only in the likeness of its sinful condition. He took our nature as it is in us, compassed with infirmities, with nothing to distinguish Him as man from sinful men, save that He was without sin."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "That he treats here of free justification or of the pardon by which God reconciles us to himself, we may infer from the last clause."
2. "Paul clearly declares that our sins were expiated by the death of Christ, because it was impossible for the law to confer righteousness upon us."
3. "God sent his Son in that flesh which was polluted by sin, though his Son’s flesh, i.e. human nature, was sinless; and he sent him on account of that sin which reigned in human nature or flesh; and for this end — to condemn, i.e., to doom to ruin, to adjudge to destruction, the sin which ruled in the flesh, i.e., in human nature as fallen and corrupted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For what the law could not do; lit, ‘the impossible (thing) of the law.’ The Mosaic law is certainly meant. What was impossible for the law to do, God did, i.e., condemned sin, etc. This is better than to explain: ‘in view of the powerlessness of the law.’"
2. "God sending his own Son. It was by sending Him, that He accomplished what was impossible for the law. ‘His own Son,’ preexisting before He was sent, and that too as Son, in a specific sense."
3. "By sending Christ God condemned sin entirely, both as to its punitive and polluting effects. The one great act by which sin was condemned in the flesh was the death of Christ, and this expiating act was the delivering act which should destroy the power of sin."

### John Gill:
1. "The weakness of the law is total and universal, it has no strength at all."
2. "The person sending is God, who gave the law weakened by the flesh, against whom we have sinned."
3. "This sending of the Son designs the manifestation of him in human nature; as appears from the form and manner in which he was sent, 'in the likeness of sinful flesh'; which expresses the reality of his incarnation, of his having a true real human nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "For what the law...could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh — Incapable of conquering our evil nature."
2. "If it could, God needed not to have sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh."
3. "But God sending his own Son...condemned that sin which was in our flesh; gave sentence, that sin should be destroyed, and the believer wholly delivered from it."
