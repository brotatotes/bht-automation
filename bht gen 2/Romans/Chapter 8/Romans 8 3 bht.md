# Romans 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage in question in Romans speaks to the inherent limitations of the law in freeing us from sin. The law, though able to accuse and condemn, could not ultimately conquer our sinful nature. Thus, God sent His Son, who took on human flesh but remained without sin, to both condemn sin and free believers from its dominion. Through Christ's sacrifice, sin is condemned and believers are delivered from its power.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For what the law could not do; lit, ‘the impossible (thing) of the law.’ The Mosaic law is certainly meant. What was impossible for the law to do, God did, i.e., condemned sin, etc. This is better than to explain: ‘in view of the powerlessness of the law.’"
2. "Because it was weak through the flesh. Its weakness has been proven by the experience of chap. 7, and this was ‘through the flesh,’ for this depraved nature was the means of setting forth its weakness."

4. "In the likeness of the flesh of sin. Notice the careful wording of this description of the humanity of Christ. The characteristic of ‘flesh,’ i.e., our ordinary human nature, is ‘sin;’ in the ‘likeness’ of this the Son of God appeared. He was entirely human, hence we do not find here, ‘in the likeness of flesh’; He was entirely sinless, hence He was not ‘in the flesh of sin,’ but only ‘in the likeness of the flesh of sin.’"
5. "Condemned sin in the flesh. This was what the law could not do. ‘Sin’ has the article in the original, pointing to the ‘sin’ on account of which the Law of God was sent into the world. ‘In the flesh’ is to be joined with ‘condemned,’ referring to the human nature which Christ has in common with us. It seems objectionable to take it in the ethical sense, or to apply it only to the human nature of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The moral law is here designed; this, though it can, and does accuse of sin, can convince of it, can curse, condemn, and condemn to death for it; yet it could not condemn sin itself, which is only abolished by Christ."
2. "The weakness of the law is total and universal, it has no strength at all; though not original and natural, but accidental; it is owing to the flesh, or the corrupt nature of man."
3. "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."
4. "The act of sending, does not suppose inequality of nature; for though he that is sent is not greater, yet as great as he that sends; two equals, by agreement, may send each other; a divine person may assume an office, and under that consideration be sent, without supposing inferiority of nature, as in the case of the Holy Spirit; and an inferiority as to office, is allowed in the case of the Son."
