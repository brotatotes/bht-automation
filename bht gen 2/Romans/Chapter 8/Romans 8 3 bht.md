# Romans 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The weakness of the law, caused by the sinful nature, made it incapable of conquering our evil tendencies. Recognizing this limitation, God sent His own Son, taking on the likeness of sinful flesh, in order to fulfill what the law could not. Through the sacrifice of Christ, God condemned the sin that resides in our flesh, pronouncing a sentence that would ultimately lead to its destruction and the complete deliverance of believers from its grip.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For what the law could not do; lit, â€˜the impossible (thing) of the law.â€™ The Mosaic law is certainly meant. What was impossible for the law to do, God did, i.e., condemned sin, etc. This is better than to explain: â€˜in view of the powerlessness of the law.â€™"
