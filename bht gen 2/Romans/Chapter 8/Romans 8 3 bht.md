# Romans 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What the law was unable to accomplish, because of our sinful nature, God fulfilled by sending his own Son, who took on the likeness of sinful flesh. In doing so, God condemned sin in the flesh, securing its destruction and delivering believers from its power. It is through Christ's sacrificial death that sin receives its rightful punishment and believers are set free from its grip.
