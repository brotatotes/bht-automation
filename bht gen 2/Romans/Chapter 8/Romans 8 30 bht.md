# Romans 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He not only predestined us to be conformed to the image of His Son, but also graciously justified us through His forgiveness and acceptance. While our calling and glorification are securely connected through predestination, it is important to acknowledge that believers have the potential to fall away before experiencing the fullness of glorification. Nonetheless, the grace we receive serves as both a foretaste and an earnest of the eternal glory that awaits us.
