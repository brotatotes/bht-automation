# Romans 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In God's gracious plan, predestination is intricately linked to the call, justification, and glorification of believers. It is by His divine grace that these blessings are secured for His chosen ones. Justification, a result of predestination, brings about forgiveness and acceptance. While there is a necessary connection between predestination and final salvation, believers must remember that falling away is a possibility. However, the grace experienced in the present serves as a foretaste and guarantee of the eternal glory that awaits them.

### Henry Alford:
1. "He did not merely, in His premundane decree, acquit them of sin, but also clothe them with glory."
2. "The Apostle, remember, is speaking entirely of God's acts on behalf of the believer: he says nothing now of that faith, through which this justification is, on his part, obtained."
3. "The aorist ἐδόξασεν being used, as the other aorists, to imply the completion in the divine counsel of all these, which are to us, in the state of time, so many successive steps, simultaneously and irrevocably."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that there is a certain connection between the predestination and the call, which will be manifested in due time. The connection is so certain that the one infallibly secures the other." 
2. "It means that there is a regular sequence of events - the predestination precedes and secures the calling; and the calling precedes and secures the justification. The one is connected in the purpose of God with the other; and the one, in fact, does not take place without the other."
3. "This proves, therefore, the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. There is a connection infallible and ever existing between the predestination and the final salvation. They who are subjects of the one are partakers of the other."

### John Gill:
1. "This predestination is of particular persons, who, in consequence of it, are called, justified, and glorified; it is the effect of divine grace, and entirely owing to it; it is the source of all the other blessings of grace, and is therefore placed at the head of them, and secures them all."
2. "By which they are justified before God, and in their own consciences, from all sin, and so secured from all wrath and condemnation; wherefore glorification stands inseparably connected with it."
3. "Eternal glory is here meant, which is what the apostle had been speaking of in the context; is what the elect are predestinated and called unto; and which their justification gives them a right and title to."

### John Wesley:

2. "He does not deny that a believer may fall away and be cut off between his special calling and his glorification."
