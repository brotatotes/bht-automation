# Romans 8:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These powerful words remind us that if God is on our side, no one and nothing can stand against us. The lavish display of God's love in giving us His Son ensures that we have access to all of His blessings. The incredible sacrifice of Christ on the cross secures an unbreakable bond between us and the love of God. Therefore, even in the face of trials and challenges, nothing can separate us from the eternal love and care of Jesus.
