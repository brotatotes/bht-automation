# Romans 8:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What answer can we find to the array of God's merciful acts of love towards believers? If God is for us, who could possibly be against us? God's support is proven through His foreknowledge, predestination, calling, justifying, and glorifying of us. No enemy can prevail against us if we have the assurance that God is resolved and engaged to bring us through every trial. With this truth, we find strong consolation. The power to injure or destroy us has been taken away. We can rest in the knowledge that God is mighty enough to defend and save us from all kinds of enemies. (94 words)
