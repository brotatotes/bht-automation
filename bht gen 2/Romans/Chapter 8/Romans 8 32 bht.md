God's act of not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up on behalf of us all, demonstrates the depth of His love and willingness to do good for those He loves. This act of self-sacrifice reflects the highest manifestation of a father's love and serves as a profound testament to God's desire to bless us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "(God) Who even did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up on behalf of us all." 
2. "How shall He not also with Him give freely to us all things?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In 'not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up,' or surrendering Him, God exercised, in His Paternal character, a mysterious act of Self-sacrifice."
2. "Christ's Sonship...ascribed to Him in virtue...of His miraculous birth, or His resurrection from the dead, or the grandeur of His works, or all of these togetherâ€”and the passages which speak of it neither explain of themselves nor harmonize with each other."
3. "How can we conceive that He should not [freely give us all things]? All other gifts being not only immeasurably less than this Gift of gifts, but virtually included in it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His own Son - Who thus gave the highest proof of love that a father could give, and the highest demonstration of his willingness to do good to those for whom he gave him."
2. "For them he endured as severe pangs, and expressed as much love, as for the rich and the great that shall be redeemed. The most humble and obscure believer may derive consolation from the fact that Christ died for him, and that God has expressed the highest love for him which we can conceive to be possible."

2. "It is a remarkable and clear evidence of inappreciable love, that the Father refused not to bestow his Son for our salvation."

1. "He who even, or, indeed."
2. "The entire humiliation may be included, but the special reference to death is obvious."

1. "He that spared not his own Son... is very amazing."

### John Wesley:
