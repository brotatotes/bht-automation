# Romans 8:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's act of not sparing His own Son demonstrates His unfathomable love and self-sacrifice. This act is a clear indication that God favors and loves us. We ought to remember that Christ was given to us filled with all celestial treasures, signifying God's infinite love and His desire to provide us with everything necessary for our well-being. Everything that comes through Christ is a favor freely bestowed, purely an act of grace and not something we can merit. This truth should remind us to fully trust in God's love and rejoice in His abundant blessings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Who even (taking one act as a notable example out of all) did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up on behalf of us all."
2. "How shall He not also with Him give freely to us all things?"
3. "It is a question 'a majori ad minus'."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In 'not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up,' or surrendering Him, God exercised, in His Paternal character, a mysterious act of Self-sacrifice."
2. "But this is inconceivable if Christ be not God's 'own (or proper) Son,' partaker of His very nature."
3. "Take it to be an artificial relationship, ascribed to Him in virtue either of His miraculous birth, or His resurrection from the dead, or the grandeur of His works, or all of these together—and the passages which speak of it neither explain of themselves nor harmonize with each other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His own Son - Who thus gave the highest proof of love that a father could give."
2. "It was not merely for the apostles; not only for the rich, and the great; but for the most humble and obscure of the flock of Christ."
3. "His giving his Son is a proof that he will give to us all things that we need."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All gifts of God are to be received, held, and enjoyed in communion with Christ."
2. "In contrast with spared, freely give."

### John Calvin:
1. "As it greatly concerns us to be so thoroughly persuaded of the paternal love of God, as to be able to retain our rejoicing on its account, Paul brings forward the price of our redemption in order to prove that God favors us."
2. "This passage ought to remind us of what Christ brings to us, and to awaken us to contemplate his riches; for as he is a pledge of God’s infinite love towards us, so he has not been sent to us void of blessings or empty, but filled with all celestial treasures, so that they who possess him may not want anything necessary for their perfect felicity."
3. "Christ himself, and everything that comes with or through him, is a favor freely bestowed, and not what we merit. This shuts out, as [Pareus] observes, everything as meritorious on the part of man. All is grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Spared not. The negative side of what is positively stated in the next clause."
2. "This points to the only begotten Son, to give emphasis to the display of love."
3. "Give as a matter of grace or favor, all those things already indicated... everything created that can work for good to us as those who are the objects of the love of God in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "God spared not the angels that sinned, nor the old world, nor Sodom and Gomorrah, nor the Egyptians and their firstborn, nor the Israelites themselves, but that he should not spare 'his own Son', his proper Son, is very amazing."
2. "God the Father delivered him [Jesus], according to his determinate counsel and foreknowledge, into the hands of wicked men; into the hands of justice, and to death itself."
3. "Christ is God's free gift to his elect; he is given to be a covenant to them, an head over them, a Saviour of them, and as the bread of life for them to live upon: he is freely given; God could never have been compelled to have given him; Christ could never have been merited by them."

### John Wesley:
1. "He spared not his own Son; therefore he will freely give us all things."
2. "He delivered him up for us all; therefore, none can lay anything to our charge."
3. "Freely - For all that follows justification is a free gift also."
