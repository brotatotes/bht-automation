# Romans 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chosen people of God were initially the Jews, but now the term encompasses all believers. God has chosen a select number of individuals whom He loves and has justified through the righteousness of His Son. No accusations can stand against them because it is God Himself who justifies. These chosen ones, whether they are from the Jewish nation or the gentile Christians, are declared righteous and are recipients of all the privileges of being the elect of God.
