# Romans 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The terms used in the New Testament have a strong connection to the Old Testament, reflecting the Jewish background of Jesus and the apostles. These phrases would have been familiar to the Jewish audience and carried significant meaning. The adoption of these titles by Christian Jews was a significant shift, as it indicated their acceptance into the chosen people of God. It was only through their deliberate rejection of the faith that they could lose these privileges, underscoring the importance of their continued commitment to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Shall God, who justifies them...lay any charge against the elect of God?" - Chrys. 
2. "Who is he that condemns them? (Is it) Christ who died, yea who rather is also risen, who also is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us?" - De W.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?"
2. "In what sense this is meant will appear in the next chapter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who shall lay anything to the charge - This expression is taken from courts of law, and means, who shall accuse, or condemn, or so charge with crime before the tribunal of God as to cause their condemnation?"
2. "As they are the chosen of God, they are dear to him; and as he purposed to save them, he will do it in such a way as that none can bring against them a charge that would condemn them."
3. "The fact that he has justified them is, therefore, a strong proof that they will be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who shall lay - to the charge. Only here by Paul. Frequent in Acts." 
2. "Lit., 'to call something in one.' Hence call to account; bring a charge against." 
3. "The following clauses are differently arranged by expositors. I prefer the succession of four interrogatives: Who shall lay? etc. Is it God? etc. Who is He that condemneth? Is it Christ? etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first and the chief consolation of the godly in adversities, is to be fully persuaded of the paternal kindness of God."
2. "He in the first place averts the danger of accusation. There is indeed but one God, at whose tribunal we must stand; then there is no room for accusation when he justifies us."
3. "He shows that the faithful are very far from being involved in the danger of condemnation, since Christ by expiating their sins has anticipated the judgment of God, and by his intercession not only abolishes death, but also covers our sins in oblivion, so that they come not to an account."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The term used is a legal one, and suggests an accusation resulting in condemnation."
2. "Only believers can with any propriety find comfort in the thought, and even they should be careful not to rest their faith upon a decree of election rather than the personal Saviour."
3. "If the common punctuation be accepted, this is the proof that no one can successfully accuse."

### John Gill:
1. "The elect of God are a certain select number of persons, whom he has so loved, as of his sovereign good will and pleasure, to choose in Christ before the foundation of the world, unto eternal life and salvation..."
2. "But are these persons chargeable with nothing criminal? yes, with Adam's sin; with a want of original righteousness; with multitudes of sins before conversion, some of them with very great ones; and all, even after conversion, with frequent infirmities and backsliddings..."
3. "...all these charges avail nothing, since none of the divine persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, lay anything against them: not God the Father, for it is God that justifieth; he against whom sin is committed, who is the lawgiver, and the righteous judge, justifies them from every charge..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now the gospel having the most strict connexion with the Books of the Old Testament, where these phrases frequently occur; and our Lord and his apostles being native Jews, and beginning to preach in the land of Israel, the language in which they preached would of course abound with the phrases of the Jewish nation."
 
2. "For they no longer continued to be the people of God; whereas this and those other honourable titles were continued to all such Jews as embraced Christianity."
 
3. "And the same appellations which once belonged to the Jewish nation were now given to the gentile Christians also together with which they were invested with all the privileges of 'the chosen people of God;' and nothing could cut them off from these but their own wilful apostasy."
