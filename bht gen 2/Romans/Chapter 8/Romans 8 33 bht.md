# Romans 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The quote references the concept of being chosen by God, which can be seen in the nation of the Jews being chosen as God's people. However, it is important to note that those who did not receive Christ were considered reprobated. This idea applies not just to the Jews, but also to the gentile Christians who became part of the chosen people of God. As believers, we are chosen and invested with the privileges of God's elect.
