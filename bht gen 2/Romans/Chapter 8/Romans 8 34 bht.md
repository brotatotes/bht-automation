# Romans 8:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we find great comfort and assurance in the work of Christ. The death of Christ is the foundation of our faith, but we should not stop there. We should also look to His resurrection, kingdom, and second coming for our hope and trust. Christ's intercession for us at the right hand of God is of utmost importance, as He presents His obedience, sufferings, and prayers, as well as our own prayers sanctified through Him. In Christ's death, resurrection, and intercession, we find complete security from condemnation and a sure hope of salvation.

1. "Our faith should rest on Christ's death, but it should rather also so far progress as to lean on His resurrection, dominion, and second coming." (Bengel)
2. "From the representations of the dead Christ, the early believers shrank as from an impiety. To them He was the living, not the dead Christ - the triumphant, the glorified, the infinite - not the agonized Christ in that one brief hour and power of darkness which was but the spasm of an eternal glorification." (Farrar, "Lives of the Fathers," 1. 14)

2. "Our Advocate paid the debt for our sins with his blood."
3. "The score is settled. We are free (Romans 8:1)."

1. "None of God's elect are, or shall be condemned: for they are loved with an everlasting love; they are chosen unto salvation; they are in Christ, where there is no condemnation."
