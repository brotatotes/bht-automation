# Romans 8:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our faith should extend beyond the death of Christ and encompass His resurrection, His kingdom, and His second coming. While His death on the cross was an act of redemption, His resurrection demonstrates His power over sin and death. As He sits at the right hand of God, interceding for us, He presents His obedience, sufferings, and prayers, including our own, which are sanctified through Him. It is through the entirety of Christ's work and His ongoing role as our advocate that we find assurance and security in our salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "not meaning that the resurrection of Christ was of more saving value than His death, but that having 'put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself'â€”which though precious to us was to Him of unmingled bitternessâ€”it was incomparably more delightful to think that He was again alive, and living to see to the efficacy of His death in our behalf."
2. "Christ's sitting at the right hand of Godâ€”predicted in Psalms 110:1, and historically referred to in Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33; Acts 7:56; Ephesians 1:20; Colossians 3:1; 1 Peter 3:22; Revelation 3:21â€”signifies the glory of the exalted Son of man, and the power in the government of the world in which He participates."
3. "His Session at God's right hand denotes His power to save us; His Intercession, His will to do it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The function of passing sentence of condemnation on people shall pertain to Christ, the judge of quick and dead, and the apostle proceeds to say that it was certain that he would not condemn the elect of God."
2. "As Christ died to save them, and not to destroy them, he will not condemn them. His death for them is a security that he will not condemn them."
3. "And this solemn enthronement and investiture with power over the universe, is with express reference to the salvation of his church and people; Matthew 28:18-19; John 17:2; Ephesians 1:20-23."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our faith should rest on Christ's death, but it should rather also so far progress as to lean on His resurrection, dominion, and second coming" (Bengel).
2. "From the representations of the dead Christ the early believers shrank as from an impiety. To them He was the living, not the dead Christ - the triumphant, the glorified, the infinite, - not the agonized Christ in that one brief hour and power of darkness which was but the spasm of an eternal glorification" (Farrar, "Lives of the Fathers," 1. 14).

### John Calvin:
1. "As no one by accusing can prevail, when the judge absolves; so there remains no condemnation, when satisfaction is given to the laws, and the penalty is already paid."
2. "He then who seeks hereafter to condemn us, must bring back Christ himself to death again."
3. "He teaches us also, that he thus sits, that he may be a perpetual advocate and intercessor in securing our salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We may paraphrase: 'Christ Jesus is the one who died,' etc."  
2. "The four great saving facts about Christ Jesus are here mentioned in order: His death, resurrection, ascension, and continued intercession."
3. "Not His death alone, but His death followed by His resurrection gives security."

### John Gill:
1. "None of God's elect are, or shall be condemned: for they are loved with an everlasting love; they are chosen unto salvation; they are in Christ, where there is no condemnation."
2. "Neither Father, Son, nor Spirit, will condemn them; not the Father, for he justifies; nor the Son, for it is Christ that died."
3. "The ascension of Christ, his entrance into heaven, and session at the right hand of God, are also a very considerable security of God's elect from condemnation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our faith should not stop at his death, but be exercised farther on his resurrection, kingdom, second coming."
2. "Presenting there his obedience, his sufferings, his prayers, and our prayers sanctified through him."
