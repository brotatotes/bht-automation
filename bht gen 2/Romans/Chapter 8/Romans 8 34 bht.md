# Romans 8:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our faith should be rooted not only in the death of Christ but also in his resurrection, kingdom, and second coming. Christ's triumph over sin and death through his resurrection signifies his power and authority. His intercession for us provides confidence and assurance in our salvation, as he presents his obedience, sufferings, and prayers before God. Through his intercession, our prayers are sanctified, and we can trust in the security of our salvation. Christ's death and resurrection, along with his ongoing intercession, are foundational to our faith and give us hope in the promises of God.

(Farrar, "Lives of the Fathers," 1. 14)
