# Romans 8:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of Christ, which is unshakeable and unfailing, is our anchor even in the face of trials and tribulations. It is not our love for Him, but His love for us that remains constant. No matter what challenges we may face, whether affliction, distress, or any adversities, nothing can separate us from His love. Our confidence should not waver, for even in the midst of darkness, God's favor shines through, ensuring that we are never alone nor abandoned. Therefore, let us stand firm in the faith, knowing that God's love for us is unchanging and everlasting.

3. "And finally he expresses his persuasion that no created thing shall ever separate us from that love, i.e. shall ever be able to pluck us out of the Fatherâ€™s hand."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is no ground of confidence to assert, or even to feel, that we will never forsake Christ; but it is the strongest ground of assurance to be convinced that His love will never change."
2. "None of these, nor all together, how terrible soever to the flesh, are tokens of God's wrath, or the least ground for doubt of His love."
3. "The apostle says not 'What,' but 'Who,' just as if all creatures and all afflictions were so many gladiators taking arms against the Christians."

### Albert Barnes:

1. "That whatever happens, we ought to stand firm in this faith, â€” that God, who once in his love embraced us, never ceases to care for us."
2. "For as clouds, though they obscure the clear brightness of the sun, do not yet wholly deprive us of its light; so God, in adversities, sends forth through the darkness the rays of his favor, lest temptations should overwhelm us with despair."
3. "In no adversities ought our confidence to be shaken as to this truth â€” that when God is propitious, nothing can be adverse to us."

2. "Nothing more effectually serves such purposes, than the love of Christ."
3. "This is the bond of union to Christ; and the union which is made by it is exceeding near and close; it is real; perfect, and indissoluble, nothing can separate from it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ â€” Toward us? Shall affliction or distress..."
