# Romans 8:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Romans 8, the apostle Paul addresses the question of who could ever separate us from the love of Christ. The answer, expressed in triumphant confidence, is that nothing can separate us from his love. No affliction, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, or sword can ever separate us from his constant protection and care. The love of Christ is unshakeable, no matter the trials we face. He will never cease loving us, and he will always be there for us, providing deliverance when needed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But the difficulty of it lies in consistently interpreting Romans 8:37, where not our endurance in love to Him, but our victory by means of His love to us, is alleged." 
2. "The second, as maintained by Beza, Grot., Est., al., Thol., Reiche, Meyer, De Wette, appears to me the only tenable sense of the words." 
3. "And finally he expresses his persuasion that no created thing shall ever separate us from that love, i.e. shall ever be able to pluck us out of the Father’s hand."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is no ground of confidence to assert, or even to feel, that we will never forsake Christ; but it is the strongest ground of assurance to be convinced that His love will never change."
2. "None of these, nor all together, how terrible soever to the flesh, are tokens of God's wrath, or the least ground for doubt of His love."
3. "The apostle says not 'What,' but 'Who,' just as if all creatures and all afflictions were so many gladiators taking arms against the Christians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason for so understanding the expression is, that it is not conceivable how afflictions, etc. should have any tendency to alienate Christ’s love 'from us;' but their supposed tendency to alienate 'our love' from him might be very strong."
2. "Indeed the whole of this passage proceeds, in its triumphing strain, on the ground of what God and Christ have done 'for us,' and not on the ground of anything belonging to us."
3. "The fact is, that the more painful the trials to which they are exposed on his account, the more strong and unwavering is their love to him, and their confidence in his ability to save."

### John Calvin:
1. "That whatever happens, we ought to stand firm in this faith, — that God, who once in his love embraced us, never ceases to care for us."
2. "For as clouds, though they obscure the clear brightness of the sun, do not yet wholly deprive us of its light; so God, in adversities, sends forth through the darkness the rays of his favor, lest temptations should overwhelm us with despair."
3. "The meaning is, — that in no adversities ought our confidence to be shaken as to this truth — that when God is propitious, nothing can be adverse to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ’s love to us, rather than our love to Him, or even our sense of His love to us."
2. "How then can any one, or anything, separate us from His love?"
3. "In our day the dangers are different, but none the less real and quite as often disturbing our sense of Christ’s love to us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Can any one put a distance between Christ's love and us?"
2. "Can any one lead Christ to cease loving us?"
3. "Paul here glories in tribulations as in Romans 5:3."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the love of Christ' is not meant the saints' love to Christ, but his love to them...this is never called the love of Christ."
2. "The separation here interrogated is not of Christ from us, but of us from him...nothing can separate from it."
3. "Not tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword...cannot separate from the love of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ...can any of these separate us from his protection in it?" 
2. "Shall affliction or distress - He proceeds in order, from less troubles to greater."
