# Romans 8:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the sake of God's true worship, believers throughout history have faced the same trials as the saints of old. The hatred and persecution directed towards God's people is not a new phenomenon. It is not uncommon for Christians to endure sufferings that can be likened to death itself. Often, our enemies see us as deserving of death and show no remorse in their treatment of us. We are constantly exposed to the cruelty of the wicked, just as the psalmist describes. This reality is repeatedly emphasized in the Scriptures, as seen in Psalm 44:22.
