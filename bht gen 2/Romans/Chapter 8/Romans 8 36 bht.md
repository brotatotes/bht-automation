# Romans 8:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's faithful people have always faced trials and sufferings at the hands of their enemies. From the ancient times to the present, the hatred of righteousness in the world has often led to the persecution of God's saints. It is no new experience for believers to be subjected to undeserved cruelty and even death. They are treated as sheep destined for slaughter, their lives hanging on the edge as if death were ever present. This enduring suffering has made them be accounted as nothing else, constantly exposed to persecution and death.
