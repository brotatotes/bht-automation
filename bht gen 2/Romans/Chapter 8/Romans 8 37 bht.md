# Romans 8:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of all the challenges and trials we face, we not only conquer, but we are victorious in a way that surpasses mere victory. These difficulties do not separate us from the love of God; rather, they serve to strengthen our faith and increase our joy. This triumph is not achieved through our own strength, but through the love of God that empowers us. It is a victory that brings us much gain and full assurance of hope.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But in all these things we are far the conquerors through Him who loved us...  very love has given us a glorious victory over them."
2. "The reading διὰ τὸν ἀγαπήσαντα ἡμᾶς would amount to the same in meaning: ‘  on account of Him who loved us’ implying, as in Romans 8:11; Romans 8:20, that He is the efficient cause of the result."
3. "It is doubted whether 'He who loved us' be the Father, or our Lord Jesus Christ. This is, I think, decided by τῷ ἀγαπῶντι ἡμᾶς καὶ λούσαντι ἡμᾶς... ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ, Revelation 1:5. The use of such an expression as a title of our Lord in a doxology makes it very probable that where unexplained, as here, it would also designate Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us." 
2. "We are so far from being conquered by them, that they do us much good." 
3. "And so far are they from 'separating us from Christ's love,' that it is just 'through Him that loved us' that we are victorious over them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In all these things - In the very midst of them; while we are enduring them we are able to triumph."
2. "We are more than conquerors - We gain the victory. That is, they have not power to subdue us; to alienate our love and confidence; to produce apostasy."
3. "Through him ... - Not by their own strength or power. It was by the might of the Saviour, and by his power pledged to them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A victory which is more than a victory."
2. "A holy arrogance of victory in the might of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "We do more than conquer... we always struggle and emerge."
2. "The faithful abundantly overcome, because they sustain no real loss, but like silver in the furnace, they lose only their dross; and not only so, but they also carry, as it were from the field of battle, chapter spoils — the fruits of holiness and righteousness."
3. "The victory will be this, — that Christ, who has loved them, will raise them from death and adorn them with that glory, with which all the evils of this life are not worthy to be compared."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are more than conquerors. A single word in the Greek: ‘over conquer;’ we are over-victorious."
2. "This tone of triumph is not selfish, for the abounding victory is through him who loved us."
3. "Since His love conquered death, even in death we cannot be separated from His love, but are more than conquerors."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "On the contrary, we shall not be separated."
2. "We are more than conquerors."
3. "We gain a surpassing victory through the one who loved us."

### John Gill:
1. "Nay, in all these things...we are more than conquerors." 
2. "They have above overcome, they have exceedingly the better of it; for they not only patiently bear afflictions and persecutions, but they glory in them; their experience, faith, and joy, are often increased by them." 
3. "This is not owing to themselves, or through their own strength, but through him that loved us."

### John Wesley:
1. "We more than conquer — We are not only no losers, but abundant gainers, by all these trials."
2. "This period seems to describe the full assurance of hope."
