# Romans 8:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of afflictions, distresses, persecutions, and other trials, we are not only conquerors but more than conquerors. We are not defeated or separated from the love of Christ, but rather gain victory and triumph through Him who loved us. Our assurance of hope is firm, and by His immense love and power, we are able to overcome and find joy even in the midst of these challenges.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in all these things we are far the conquerors through Him who loved us (i.e. so far from all these things separating us from His love, that very love has given us a glorious victory over them)."
2. "The reading διὰ τὸν ἀγαπήσαντα ἡμᾶς would amount to the same in meaning: 'on account of Him who loved us' implying, as in Romans 8:11; Romans 8:20, that He is the efficient cause of the result."
3. "It is doubted whether 'He who loved us' be the Father, or our Lord Jesus Christ. This is, I think, decided by τῷ ἀγαπῶντι ἡμᾶς καὶ λούσαντι ἡμᾶς...ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ, Revelation 1:5. The use of such an expression as a title of our Lord in a doxology makes it very probable that where unexplained, as here, it would also designate Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We are more than conquerors, through him that loved us"—not, 'We are so far from being conquered by them, that they do us much good'; for though this be true, the word means simply, 'We are pre-eminently conquerors.'"
2. "And so far are they from 'separating us from Christ's love,' that it is just 'through Him that loved us' that we are victorious over them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In all these things - In the very midst of them; while we are enduring them we are able to triumph; compare 1 Corinthians 15:57."
2. "We are more than conquerors - We gain the victory. That is, they have not power to subdue us; to alienate our love and confidence; to produce apostasy."
3. "Through him ... - Not by their own strength or power. It was by the might of the Saviour, and by his power pledged to them, and confirmed by the love evinced when he gave himself for them; compare Philippians 4:13, 'I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We are more than conquerors. A victory which is more than a victory."
2. "A holy arrogance of victory in the might of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "We always struggle and emerge... that they might at the same time remember whence this invincible power proceeds." 
2. "The assurance of which, being thoroughly fixed in our hearts, will always draw us from the gates of hell into the light of life, and will sufficiently avail for our support." 
3. "The victory will be this, — that Christ, who has loved them, will raise them from death and adorn them with that glory, with which all the evils of this life are not worthy to be compared."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are more than conquerors. A single word in the Greek: 'over conquer;' we are over-victorious. This tone of triumph is not selfish, for the abounding victory is through him who loved us."
2. "That the reference is to Christ, appears from the context Romans 8:35 (comp. Romans 8:39); from the tense used, which points to one crowning act of love (comp. chap. Romans 5:6; Galatians 2:20), His death on the cross."
3. "Since His love conquered death, even in death we cannot be separated from His love, but are more than conquerors."

### John Gill:
1. "Nay, in all these things" afflictions, distresses, persecutions, famine, nakedness, sword, or any other thing of the same kind: we are more than conquerors."
2. "they have above overcome, they have exceedingly the better of it; for they not only patiently bear afflictions and persecutions, but they glory in them; their experience, faith, and joy, are often increased by them."
3. "they have got the victory with ease, over Satan and his hellish emissaries, by the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their testimony: but this is not owing to themselves, or through their own strength, but through him that loved us."

### John Wesley:
1. "We more than conquer — We are not only no losers, but abundant gainers, by all these trials."
2. "This period seems to describe the full assurance of hope."
