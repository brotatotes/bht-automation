# Romans 8:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite the formidable challenges of death, life, angels, principalities, powers, and the trials of the present or the uncertainties of the future, nothing in all creation, whether visible or invisible, can sever us from the unfailing, unwavering love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. This assurance is not based on mere conjecture but the security of God's love and the certainty that it encompasses both the good and evil forces. Even in the midst of present desertions or the hidings of God's face, our relationship with Him remains intact, as His affection for us endures.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our victory is not only over these things, but I dare assert it over greater and more awful than these."
2. "Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing shall be able to sever us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers‚Äîwhether good or bad. But as the bad are not called 'angels,' or 'principalities,' or 'powers,' save with some addition to show that such are meant."
2. "nor things present, nor things to come‚Äîno condition of the present life and none of the unknown possibilities of the life to come."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For I am persuaded - I have a strong and unwavering confidence."
2. "Neither death - Neither the fear of death, nor all the pains and tortures of the dying scene, even in the most painful trials of persecution; death in no form."
3. "Nor life - Nor the hope of life; the love of life; the offer of life made to us by our persecutors, on condition of abjuring our Christian faith."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Powers [Œ±œÅœáŒ±Œπ] . Angelic, higher than mere angels."
2. "Things present [ŒµŒΩŒµœÉœÑœâœÑŒ±] . Only in Paul and Hebrews 9:9. The verb literally means to stand in sight. Hence to impend or threaten."
3. "48 Bengel says: 'Things past are not mentioned, not even sins, for they have passed away.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Whatever, he says, there is in life or in death, which seems capable of tearing us away from God, shall effect nothing; nay, the very angels, were they to attempt to overturn this foundation, shall do us no harm." 
2. "we ought not to fear, lest the continuance of evils, however long, should obliterate the faith of adoption." 
3. "we ontrary, ought to feel confident, that he who has begun in us a good work, will carry it on until the day of the Lord Jesus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The list here given exceeds the previous one; not only so, but to the great facts of God‚Äôs purpose, and the gracious facts of Christ‚Äôs work, there is added the subjective side, the personal confidence of the Apostle himself."
2. "Dying or living, we are the objects of this love. It is altogether incorrect to explain: ‚Äòneither anything dead nor anything living.'"
3. "But it is difficult to determine whether we should understand good angels, or bad, or both. To refer the one term to the former, and the other to the latter, is both abrupt and arbitrary; to leave the evil spirits unnoticed in such a catalogue would seem strange- Hence, we may refer both terms to both classes, in the wide hypothesis the Apostle here conceives."

### John Gill:
1. "This persuasion not only regards himself, but others; and is not conjectural, but certain; and which did not arise from any special and extraordinary revelation, but is founded upon the nature of the love of God itself, the security of it in Christ, and of the persons of God's elect in him."
2. "The things enumerated, which are not able to separate from the love of God, are as follow: death; nor life; nor angels; nor principalities; nor powers; nor things present; nor things to come."
3. "Present desertions, or the hidings of God's face, which often is the case of his dear children, can have no such effect; their relation to God still continues; they have great nearness unto him, are engraven on the palms of his hands, are set as a seal on his heart, and he bears a strong affection to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither death - Terrible as it is to natural men; a violent death in particular."
2. "Nor height, nor depth ‚Äî The former sentence respected the differences of times; this, the differences of places."
3. "Nor any creature ‚Äî Nothing beneath the Almighty; visible enemies he does not even deign to name."
