# Romans 8:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No problem, here is a revised response that meets all the requirements:

Paul firmly asserts that no circumstances, whether it be death or life, can separate us from the love of God. His conviction is not based on mere speculation, but on the unshakeable foundation of God's love and the redeeming work of Christ. Even the mighty angels and spiritual forces hold no power to sever our deep connection with God. In fact, Paul's persuasion extends beyond himself, assuring all believers that their victory over any adversities is secured by the unfailing love of God.

2. "The words evidently refer to times of persecution; and it was not uncommon for persecutors to offer life to Christians, on condition of their renouncing attachment to the Saviour." 
3. "To such a division there is probably reference here; and the meaning is, that no order of evil angels, however powerful, artful, or numerous, would be able to alienate the hearts of Christians from their Redeemer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Powers [Œ±œÅœáŒ±Œπ]. Angelic, higher than mere angels."
2. "Things present [ŒµŒΩŒµœÉœÑœâœÑŒ±]. Only in Paul and Hebrews 9:9. The verb literally means to stand in sight. Hence to impend or threaten. So 2 Thessalonians 2:2; 2 Timothy 3:1; 1 Corinthians 7:26."
3. "48 Bengel says: 'Things past are not mentioned, not even sins, for they have passed away.'"

1. "For I am persuaded...the great facts of God‚Äôs purpose, and the gracious facts of Christ‚Äôs work, there is added the subjective side, the personal confidence of the Apostle himself."
2. "Neither death, nor life...Dying or living, we are the objects of this love."
3. "Nor angels, nor principalities...The insertion at this point of the phrase ‚Äònor powers,‚Äô which should be placed at the close of the verse, shows that the early transcribers so understood the passage."

### John Gill:
1. "This persuasion not only regards himself, but others; and is not conjectural, but certain; and which did not arise from any special and extraordinary revelation, but is founded upon the nature of the love of God itself, the security of it in Christ, and of the persons of God's elect in him."
2. "the love of God is better than this life, and this itself is the effect of divine favour; wherefore this can never separate from the love of God, nor anything in it"
3. "the saints are upon God's heart, are in Christ's hands, and on him the rock; and the Spirit of God is in them, who is greater than he that is in the world."
