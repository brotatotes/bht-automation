# Romans 8:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul is confident and convinced that nothing, not even death or any present circumstance, can separate us from the love of God. This persuasion is not merely a personal belief, but truly founded on the unshakable nature of God's love and the security we have in Christ. Therefore, no matter what we may face or whoever may oppose us, our position in Christ remains secure, for the love of God is greater than anything in this world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The words evidently refer to times of persecution; and it was not uncommon for persecutors to offer life to Christians, on condition of their renouncing attachment to the Saviour." 
3. "To such a division there is probably reference here; and the meaning is, that no order of evil angels, however powerful, artful, or numerous, would be able to alienate the hearts of Christians from their Redeemer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Powers [αρχαι]. Angelic, higher than mere angels."
2. "Things present [ενεστωτα]. Only in Paul and Hebrews 9:9. The verb literally means to stand in sight. Hence to impend or threaten. So 2 Thessalonians 2:2; 2 Timothy 3:1; 1 Corinthians 7:26."
3. "48 Bengel says: 'Things past are not mentioned, not even sins, for they have passed away.'"

2. "The meaning then is, — that we ought not to fear, lest the continuance of evils, however long, should obliterate the faith of adoption."

1. "For I am persuaded...the great facts of God’s purpose, and the gracious facts of Christ’s work, there is added the subjective side, the personal confidence of the Apostle himself."
2. "Neither death, nor life...Dying or living, we are the objects of this love."
3. "Nor angels, nor principalities...The insertion at this point of the phrase ‘nor powers,’ which should be placed at the close of the verse, shows that the early transcribers so understood the passage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For I am persuaded (πεπεισμα γαρ). Perfect passive participle of πειθω, 'I stand convinced.'"
2. "The items mentioned are those that people dread (life, death, supernatural powers, above, below, any creature to cover any omissions)."

### John Gill:
1. "This persuasion not only regards himself, but others; and is not conjectural, but certain; and which did not arise from any special and extraordinary revelation, but is founded upon the nature of the love of God itself, the security of it in Christ, and of the persons of God's elect in him."
2. "the love of God is better than this life, and this itself is the effect of divine favour; wherefore this can never separate from the love of God, nor anything in it"
