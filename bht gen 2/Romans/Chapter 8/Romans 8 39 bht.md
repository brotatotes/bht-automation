The love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, is an inseparable bond that extends to every created being. It is a strong, unbreakable connection that nothing in the entire universe can sever us from. This love assures us of the unwavering kindness of God towards us, and it is through Christ that we are united to God.

It is a constant and eternal love that remains with us always, assuring us of our unbreakable union with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
