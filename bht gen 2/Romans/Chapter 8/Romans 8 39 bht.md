# Romans 8:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's love for His children is all-encompassing and unwavering, surpassing any potential opposition. The love of God is not merely the love that the saints have for Him, but rather the unshakeable connection they have with God. This unbreakable bond ensures that they will never be separated from His love. Paul's confidence in this truth is evident as he declares the inseparability of God's love for His people, extending beyond any creature or circumstance. This assurance of God's love brings hope and security to believers, reinforcing the unchanging nature of their relationship with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All the terms here are to be taken in their most general sense, and need no closer definition. The indefinite expressions are meant to denote all that can be thought of, and are only a rhetorical paraphrase of the conception of allness" [OLSHAUSEN].
2. "As there is a beautiful harmony and necessary connection between the several doctrines of grace, so must there be a like harmony in the character of the Christian. He cannot experience the joy and confidence flowing from his election without the humility which the consideration of its being gratuitous must produce nor can he have the peace of one who is justified without the holiness of one who is saved" [HODGE].
3. "The whole universe, with all that it contains, so far as it is good, is the friend and ally of the Christian; and, so far as it is evil, is more than a conquered foe" [HODGE].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No possible circumstances...could alienate them from the love of Christ."
2. "The love to Christ is stronger than any influence which they can exert on the mind."
3. "There is no true love of God which is not produced by the work of Christ."


### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased."
2. "If we are united to God through Christ, we can be assured of God's immutable and unfailing kindness towards us."
3. "The fountain of love is in the Father, and it flows to us from Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The attempt to bring the collective elements named in their consecutive order under definite logical categories leads to artificialities of exposition, which ought not to be applied to such enthusiastic outbursts of the moment"
2. "God is the original fountain, Christ the constant organ and mediating channel of one and the same love; so that in Christ is the love of God, and the love of God is the love of God in Christ"
3. "This completes the demonstration of the security of the believer. With this triumphant expression the Apostle closes his exposition of the main theme: the Gospel is to every one that believeth the power of God unto salvation: this it could not be if anything could separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God's love is victor over all possible foes."
2. "Paul has reached the mountain top."
3. "He has really completed his great argument concerning the God-kind of righteousness save for its bearing on some special problems."

### John Gill:
1. "This takes in the whole compass of created beings in heaven, earth, and sea; and most strongly expresses the inseparableness of the saints from the love of God, by anything or creature whatever."
2. "By 'the love of God', is not meant the saints' love to God... the apostle would not have expressed such a strong confidence and full persuasion about this... and not us from the love of God."
3. "They can never be separated from the love of God, so as that that union which is made by it between God and them can ever be dissolved, or they cease to have any share or interest in his love. This the apostle was persuaded could never be."
