# Romans 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The righteousness of the law, which refers to its requirements and ordinances, is fulfilled in us through God's grace. We are called to walk not according to the desires of the flesh, but guided by the Spirit. The Spirit reveals itself in various aspects of our lives, such as confession, the consciousness of sonship, the knowledge of God's love, and the experience of peace, joy, and hope. The righteousness of the law is fulfilled by Christ and imputed to us, enabling us to live in obedience. St. Paul primarily describes the state of believers, using the state of unbelievers as illustrations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The aim of God in giving the Law might be accomplished in us, in our sanctification, which is the ultimate end of our redemption."
2. "The work is not ours, but that of God by His grace."
3. "Who, notwithstanding that we are bound up with a σὰρξ ἁμαρτίας, do not walk in our daily life according to, or led by, the νόμος τῆς ἁμαρτίας ὁ ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ἡμῶν, but according to and led by the νόμος τοῦ πνεύματος τῆς ζωῆς, in Christ Jesus members of Him, and participating in that victory over sin which He obtained, by which the power of sin in our flesh is broken."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Spirit (πνεῦμα)... has independent activity in all circumstances of the perceptive and emotional life" (2).
2. "The divine power or influence belonging to God, and communicated in Christ to men, in virtue of which they become πνευματικοί spiritual - recipients and organs of the Spirit" (4).
3. "It [the Spirit] reveals itself in confession, in the consciousness of sonship, in the knowledge of the love of God, in the peace and joy of faith, in hope" (5).

### John Calvin:
1. "They who understand that the renewed, by the Spirit of Christ, fulfil the law, introduce a gloss wholly alien to the meaning of Paul."
2. "For when the obedience of Christ is accepted for us, the law is satisfied, so that we are counted just."
3. "The work of renewal is again mentioned, lest Christ should be thought to be the minister of sin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'righteousness' is that used in chap. Romans 5:16; Romans 5:18, in the sense of 'righteous verdict,' or, 'righteous act,' and in Luke 1:6; chaps. Romans 1:32, Romans 2:26, in the sense of 'ordinance,' i.e., righteous requirement."
2. "We explain it here as meaning 'that righteous act (viewing all the acts as forming a unity) which meets the requirements of the law.' Some would refer this to the imputation of Christ’s righteousness as the ground of our justification, but according to our view of the whole passage it means the actual holiness of the believer."
3. "In us; not, 'among us,' nor, 'through us,' nor yet, 'on us,' but, 'in us.' This points to actual holiness; most of the other interpretations grow out of the reference to justification. The ideal aim of the Christian life is set forth."

### John Gill:
1. "By Christ's obedience to it we are made righteous, and this gives the title to eternal life."
2. "This is not fulfilled by us in our own persons, nor can it be; could it, where would be the weakness of the law?"
3. "The righteousness of the law fulfilled by Christ, and imputed to us; Christ has fulfilled the whole righteousness of the law, all the requirements of it; this he has done in the room and stead of his people; and is imputed to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The righteousness of the law - the holiness it required - might be fulfilled in us"
2. "Who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit - who are guided by the Spirit of God in all our thoughts, words, and actions"
3. "St. Paul primarily describes the state of believers, and that of unbelievers only to illustrate this"
