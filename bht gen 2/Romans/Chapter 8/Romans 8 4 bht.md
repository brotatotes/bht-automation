# Romans 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of God in giving the Law was for it to be fulfilled in believers, who live in accordance with the guidance of the Spirit and not the desires of the flesh. This fulfillment of the righteous requirements of the law is not something we can achieve on our own, but rather it is accomplished through the work of God's grace. Those who walk in the Spirit, being led by Him, reflect the victory over sin that Christ obtained, breaking the power of sin in our lives.

1. "By the righteousness of the law, is not meant the righteousness of the ceremonial law, though that was fulfilled by Christ; but of the moral law, which requires holiness of nature, righteousness of life, and death in case of disobedience; active righteousness, or obedience to the precepts of the law, is designed here."

5. "But this is to be understood of the righteousness of the law fulfilled by Christ, and imputed to us; Christ has fulfilled the whole righteousness of the law, all the requirements of it; this he has done in the room and stead of his people; and is imputed to them, by virtue of a federal union between him and them."
