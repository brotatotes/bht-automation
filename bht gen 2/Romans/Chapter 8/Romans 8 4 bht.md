# Romans 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to fulfill the righteousness of the law through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, guiding them to walk in accordance with God's will. It is not by our own works, but by the grace of God, that we are able to comply with the demands of the law. As we are renewed and actuated by the Holy Spirit, we are led in obedience to the Spirit's law of life. This contrast between believers and unbelievers serves to illustrate the transformative power of the Spirit in the lives of those who have received Christ.
