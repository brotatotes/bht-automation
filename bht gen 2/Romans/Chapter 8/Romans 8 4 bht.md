# Romans 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit, so that the righteousness required by the law can be fulfilled in us. This fulfillment of righteousness is not achieved by our own efforts, but by the guiding influence of God's Spirit. The focus here is primarily on the state of believers, with the state of unbelievers being mentioned only to provide further understanding.
