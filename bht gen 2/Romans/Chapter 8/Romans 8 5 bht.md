# Romans 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are under the influence of their sinful nature have their minds occupied with satisfying their base desires, seeking after what pleases their corrupt nature. On the other hand, those who are led by the Holy Spirit focus their thoughts and affections on things that are spiritual and eternal. Their minds are captivated by the invisible truths revealed by the Spirit, and they eagerly pursue the promises and works of the Spirit in their lives.
