# Romans 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are under the control of their sinful nature focus on worldly desires and pleasures. Their thoughts and affections are consumed by the things that gratify their corrupt nature. On the other hand, those who are led by the Spirit have their minds set on the things that please God. They think about, love, and pursue the things that are spiritual and eternal, the things revealed by the Spirit.
