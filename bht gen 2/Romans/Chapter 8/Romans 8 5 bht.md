# Romans 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are under the influence of their corrupt nature, have their minds focused on indulging their fleshly desires. However, those who are under the influence of the Spirit, have their minds fixed on the things that please God, things that are invisible and eternal. The Spirit guides them to think about, appreciate, and love the things that the Spirit has revealed and promises to give.
