# Romans 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who live according to the flesh are supremely devoted to gratifying their corrupt desires. On the other hand, those who live according to the Spirit are under its influence and direct their minds towards the things of the Spirit. The aim of the spiritual life is to be wholly devoted to the service of God, with the same level of dedication that was given to sin. The contrast between those who are driven by the flesh and those led by the Spirit reveals the true nature of one's actions and character.
