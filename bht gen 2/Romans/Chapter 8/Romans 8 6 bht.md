# Romans 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be carnally minded is to follow the inclinations of the flesh, pursuing fleshly ends that lead to condemnation and death. Conversely, being spiritually minded involves seeking the things of the Spirit, which results in life and peace. The Holy Spirit produces this spiritual mindset, guiding us towards happiness and eternal life. The pursuit of the flesh brings forth death, while the pursuit of spiritual objects, the minding of the Spirit, leads to life and peace. The Spirit of God works within us, producing true felicity and transforming our thinking, desires, and actions.
