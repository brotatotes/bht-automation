# Romans 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be carnally minded is to be devoted to the corrupt passions of the flesh, resulting in condemnation and death. It involves following the inclinations and pursuits of the flesh, which ultimately leads to a state of spiritual death. In contrast, to be spiritually minded is to seek the things produced by the Holy Spirit. This pursuit brings life and peace, as it is characterized by the pursuit of spiritual objects and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The spiritual mind is marked by a discernment for spiritual matters and a longing for them. This mindset brings about a sense of peace, happiness, and fulfillment.
