# Romans 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mind of the flesh is death, not just physical, but in the largest sense, extending to eternity. Conversely, the mind of the Spirit is life and peace, seeking the feelings and views produced by the Holy Spirit. Possessing and cultivating the graces of the spirit is the design of our existence and the path to happiness. Being carnally minded involves fleshly thinking and striving, while being spiritually minded is the pursuit of spiritual objects, which brings life and peace. Carnally mindedness brings death upon the saints, but the spiritually minded are alive, lively in grace and duty, and characterized by peace.
