# Romans 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The desire and pursuit of carnal ends is a state of enmity to God, incompatible with true life and peace in the soul. This enmity involves a controversy with God and leads to death and suffering. The carnal mind, consumed by the things of the flesh, is in opposition to God's law. It cannot submit or subject itself to His authority. The mind of the flesh is in rebellion against God, disregarding His will and leading to a hatred of Him. It is an unyielding state of disobedience, incapable of true subjection to the divine law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mind of the flesh is enmity against God, it being assumed that God is the source of life, and that enmity against Him is the absence of all true peace." 
2. "For it does not submit itself to the law of God, for neither can it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "In such a state of mind there neither is nor can be the least subjection to the law of God."
3. "Many things may be done which the law requires, but nothing either is or can be done because God's law requires it, or purely to please God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The carnal mind - This is the same expression as occurs in Romans 8:6... it means that the minding of the things of the flesh, giving to them supreme attention, is hostility against God; and involves the sinner in a controversy with him, and hence, leads to death and woe."
2. "It does not mean that the soul itself is physically depraved, or opposed to God; but it means that the minding of the things of the flesh, giving to them supreme attention, is hostility against God... [it] leads to the hatred of God himself, because he is opposed to it, and has expressed his abhorrence of it."
3. "The apostle does not express any opinion about the metaphysical ability of man... The amount of his affirmation is simply, that the minding of the flesh, the supreme attention to its dictates and desires, is not and cannot be subject to the Law of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is not subject (ŒøœÖÃìœá œÖÃîœÄŒøœÑŒ±ÃÅœÉœÉŒµœÑŒ±Œπ). Originally to arrange under. Possibly with a shade of military meaning suggested by enmity. It is marshaled under a hostile banner."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing proceeds from the efforts of our flesh but death, because it contends as an enemy against the will of God."
2. "The will of man is in all things opposed to the divine will...to seek [the difference between right and wrong] in a deep labyrinth, what sottishness is it!"
3. "Paul affirms here...that it is impossible for us to render our powers subject to the law...the heart is full of hardness and indomitable contumacy...Let every one acknowledge himself to be the servant of sin...to glory in any other liberty is the highest folly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Proof that the mind of the flesh is death...in Romans 8:10-11, it is proved that the mind of the spirit is life and peace, though that is implied here."
2. "Enmity against God. This is equivalent to death."
3. "Paul declares that the cause of non-submission to the law of God, which is a proof of enmity to God, is the fact that the mind of the flesh has no ability to produce this submission, being essentially antagonism to God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Present tense here means continued insubordination."
2. "This helpless state of the unregenerate man Paul has shown above apart from Christ."
3. "Hope lies in Christ and the Spirit of life."

### John Gill:
1. "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God,...."
2. "The carnal mind, the wisdom of the flesh, is not only an enemy, but enmity itself against God."
3. "The carnal mind is so far from an obedient subjection to the law, that it is far off from the law, and the law from that; it hates and despises it, thwarts and contradicts it in every instance, and, as much as in it lies, makes it void."

### John Wesley:
