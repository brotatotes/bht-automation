# Romans 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mind of the flesh is marked by a deep-seated opposition to God and His ways. It rebels against His authority and refuses to submit to His law. This enmity is not simply a passive indifference, but an active hostility toward God's very being, His power, and His sovereign control over all things. It rejects His existence, questions His power, and resists His providential work in the world. Such a mindset is diametrically opposed to a life of true peace and ultimately leads to death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mind of the flesh is enmity against God, for it does not submit itself to the law of God, for neither can it." 
2. "The mind of the flesh is the absence of all true peace."
3. "The mind of the flesh is death."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The desire and pursuit of carnal ends is a state of enmity to God, wholly incompatible with true life and peace in the soul."
2. "In such a state of mind there neither is nor can be the least subjection to the law of God."
3. "Many things may be done which the law requires, but nothing either is or can be done because God's law requires it, or purely to please God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It does not mean the mind itself, the intellect, or the will; it does not suppose that the mind or soul is physically depraved, or opposed to God; but it means that the minding of the things of the flesh, giving to them supreme attention, is hostility against God..."
2. "The minding of the things of the flesh also leads to the hatred of God himself, because he is opposed to it, and has expressed his abhorrence of it."
3. "This passage should not be adduced to prove the doctrine of man‚Äôs inability to love God, for it does not refer to that, but it proves merely that a supreme regard to the things of the flesh is utterly inconsistent with the Law of God; can never be reconciled with it; and involves the sinner in hostility with his Creator."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is not subject (ŒøœÖÃìœá œÖÃîœÄŒøœÑŒ±ÃÅœÉœÉŒµœÑŒ±Œπ). Originally to arrange under." 
2. "Possibly with a shade of military meaning suggested by enmity." 
3. "It is marshaled under a hostile banner."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing proceeds from the efforts of our flesh but death, because it contends as an enemy against the will of God." 
2. "The will of God is the rule of righteousness; it hence follows, that whatever is unjust is contrary to it; and what is unjust at the same time brings death."
3. "The Lord has indeed, as I have said, his hidden counsel, by which he regulates all things as he pleases; but as it is incomprehensible to us, let us know that we are to refrain from too curious an investigation of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Proof that the mind of the flesh is death."
2. "Enmity against God. This is equivalent to death."
3. "Paul declares that the cause of non-submission to the law of God is the fact that the mind of the flesh has no ability to produce this submission, being essentially antagonism to God."

### John Gill:
1. "The carnal mind, the wisdom of the flesh, is not only an enemy, but enmity itself against God."
2. "It is at enmity against his perfections, finds fault with and abhors his decrees and purposes, quarrels with his providences, and is implacable against his word and Gospel."
3. "The carnal mind is so far from an obedient subjection to the law, that it is far off from the law, and the law from that; it hates and despises it, thwarts and contradicts it in every instance, and, as much as in it lies, makes it void; which fully proves the enmity of the carnal mind against God."

### John Wesley:
1. Enmity against God ‚Äî His existence, power, and providence.
