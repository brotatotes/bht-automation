# Romans 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They who are in the flesh, under the government of it, cannot please God. They are unable to obtain God's good will or make their peace with Him. This incapacity stems from their enmity against God and their lack of inclination and knowledge to seek reconciliation. In their natural state, they are without the Spirit, Christ, and faith, and their actions lack any regard for the glory of God.
