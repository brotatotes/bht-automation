# Romans 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are no longer controlled by our sinful nature but are under the influence and guidance of the Holy Spirit. This indwelling Spirit is the proof of our spiritual transformation and alignment with God's will. Without the Spirit of Christ within us, we cannot claim to truly belong to Him. It is not enough to intellectually affirm Christian beliefs; our hearts must be surrendered to the Spirit's workings, reflecting the character of Christ. Only then can we truly experience the newness of life and the freedom from the bondage of the flesh, which the Spirit brings.
