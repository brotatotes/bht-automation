# Romans 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To live under the government and guidance of the Holy Spirit is the exhortation given to believers. The presence of the Spirit within them is the proof of their relationship with God and their union with Christ. Without the Spirit of Christ dwelling and governing within them, they cannot be considered His own, for they do not truly belong to Him. Mere intellectual conviction or a general influence of the Christian spirit is not enough. One must have a personal and transformative encounter with the Spirit of Christ to be truly His.

### Henry Alford:
1. "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that, provided that, if at least."
2. "If any man has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not His, belongs not to Him, in the higher and blessed sense of being united to Him as a member of Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It thus appears that to be 'in the spirit' means here to be under the dominion of our own renewed mind because the indwelling of God's Spirit is given as the evidence that we are 'in the spirit'."
2. "Again, this does not mean 'the disposition or mind of Christ,' but the Holy Ghost; here called 'the Spirit of Christ', just as He is called 'the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus'."
3. "Now if any man's heart be void, not of such dispositions, but of the blessed Author of them, 'the Spirit of Christ', he is none of hisâ€”even though intellectually convinced of the truth of Christianity, and in a general sense influenced by its spirit. Sharp, solemn statement this!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not in the flesh - Not under the full influence of corrupt desires and passions."
2. "The Holy Spirit is often represented as dwelling in the hearts of Christians... and the meaning is not that there is a personal or physical indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but that he influences, directs, and guides Christians, producing meekness, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, etc."
3. "If a man is not influenced by the meek, pure, and holy spirit of the Lord Jesus, if he is not conformed to his image, if his life does not resemble that of the Saviour, he is a stranger to religion."

### John Calvin:
1. "He encourages them to strive after newness of life...when by the Spirit of God they are renewed unto purity and holiness."
2. "Those in whom the Spirit reigns not, belong not to Christ; then they are not Christians who serve the flesh."
3. "We must either deny Christ, or confess that we become Christians through his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle now turns to the other class, spoken of in Romans 8:5, gladly using direct address, for 'ye' is emphatic in the original."
2. "The Spirit of God dwell in you... â€˜In youâ€™ must not be weakened into â€˜among you.â€™"
