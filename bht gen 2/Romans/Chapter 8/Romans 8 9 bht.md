# Romans 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse emphasizes the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer. It reveals that those who are governed by the Spirit are not in a state of unregeneracy, but in a state of grace. The verse also highlights that true belonging to Christ is determined by the indwelling and governing of the Spirit. Therefore, anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ dwelling in them is not a member of Christ, not a Christian, and not in a state of salvation. This declaration is without exception and carries a solemn warning.
