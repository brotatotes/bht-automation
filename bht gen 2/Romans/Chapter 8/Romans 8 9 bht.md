# Romans 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You are not under the control of sinful desires, but under the influence of the renewed mind, which is evidence that you belong to the realm of the Spirit. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ dwelling and governing within them, they do not belong to Him; they are not part of His family and do not experience the transformation that comes from being united with Him.
