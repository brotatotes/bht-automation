# Romans 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The writer confidently declares the truth in Christ, emphasizing his genuine sincerity and born-again nature. By making this oath, he not only affirms the lawfulness of taking an oath, but also acknowledges the divinity of Christ, whom he invokes as the only one worthy of such an appeal. Furthermore, alongside the witness of Christ, the writer calls upon his conscience, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, to testify to the truth of his words. In doing so, he seeks to leave no doubt about the authenticity and veracity of his message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I say the truth in Christ—as if steeped in the spirit of Him who wept over impenitent and doomed Jerusalem."
2. "My conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost—my conscience as quickened, illuminated, and even now under the direct operation of the Holy Ghost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In Christ - Most interpreters regard this as a form of an oath, as equivalent to calling Christ to witness. It is certainly to be regarded, in its obvious sense, as an appeal to Christ as the searcher of the heart, and as the judge of falsehood."
2. "My conscience - Conscience is that act or judgment of the mind by which we decide on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of our actions, and by which we instantly approve or condemn them. It exists in every man, and is a strong witness to our integrity or to our guilt."
3. "In the Holy Ghost - He does not say that he speaks the truth by or in the Holy Spirit, as he had said of Christ; but that the conscience pronounced its concurring testimony by the Holy Spirit; that is, conscience as enlightened and influenced by the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In Christ. Not by Christ, as the formula of an oath, Christ being never used by the apostles in such a formula, but God."
2. "Conscience. See on 1 Peter 3:16. Bearing me witness. Rev., bearing witness with me."
3. "In the Holy Ghost. So Rev. The concurrent testimony of his declaration and of conscience was 'the echo of the voice of God's Holy Spirit' (Morison)."

### John Calvin:
1. "He so handles this subject, as to abstain from all bitterness against the Jews... yet he concedes to them their privileges in such a way, as not to detract anything from Christ." 
2. "He declares by an oath that he speaks the truth... By this example and the like, we ought to learn that oaths are lawful, that is, when they render that truth credible which is necessary to be known, and which would not be otherwise believed."
3. "The Jews had the impression that the Apostle, having become the follower of Christ, must have necessarily entertained hatred towards them, and must have therefore felt no concern for them... To obviate this impression seems to have been the object here."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The asseveration of the Apostle is threefold: and is introduced abruptly, without a conjunction, in accordance with the feeling which prompts it."
2. "In fellowship with Christ, the element in which he lives. Such fellowship with Him who is the Truth implies the sincerity of one who enjoys it."
3. "His conscience, which would convict him of falsehood, gives testimony to him in accordance with what he is about to state."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In Christ, Paul really takes a triple oath here so strongly is he stirred."
2. "He makes a positive affirmation in Christ, a negative one (not lying)."
3. "the appeal to his conscience as co-witness (συνμαρτυρουσης, genitive absolute as in Romans 2:15 which see) 'in the Holy Spirit'."

### John Gill:
1. "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not": ...as I am in Christ, a converted person, one born again, and renewed in the spirit of my mind, what I am about to speak is truth, and no lie.
2. "This both shows that the taking of an oath is lawful, and that Christ is truly God, by whom only persons ought to swear."
3. "The apostle, besides his appeal to Christ, calls his conscience to witness to the truth of his words; and this is as a thousand witnesses."

### John Wesley:
