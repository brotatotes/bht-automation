# Romans 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible shows us multiple instances where God's choice and favor are not based on natural lineage or personal merits. We see this in the contrasting destinies of Ishmael and Isaac, highlighting that not all of Abraham's children are children of God. Similarly, the case of Esau and Jacob demonstrates that the choice was made by God before either of them had the chance to do good or evil. These examples emphasize that God's blessing and acceptance do not depend on human efforts but solely on His purpose, which is fulfilled through His chosen ones.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It might be thought that there was a natural reason for preferring the child of Sarah, as being Abraham's true and first wife, both to the child of Hagar, Sarah's maid, and to the children of Keturah, his second wife."
2. "But there could be no such reason in the case of Rebecca, Isaac's only wife for the choice of her son Jacob was the choice of one of two sons by the same mother and of the younger in preference to the elder, and before either of them was born, and consequently before either had done good or evil to be a ground of preference."
3. "...the sole ground of distinction lay in the unconditional choice of God—"not of works, but of Him that calleth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not only is the principle of making a distinction among the natural descendants of Abraham thus settled by the promise..."
2. "He had shown that the principle of thus making a distinction among the posterity of Abraham was recognised in the original promise..."
3. "And in order to prove that this was done according to his own pleasure, he shows that the distinction was made before they were born..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not only have we an example of the election of a son of Abraham by one woman, and a rejection of his son by another..."
2. "By one. Though of one father, a different destiny was divinely appointed for each of the twins."
3. "Hence only the divine disposal constitutes the true and valid succession, and not the bodily descent."

### John Calvin:
1. "The difference as to the possession of the promise may not only be seen in the children of Abraham, but that there is a much more evident example in Jacob and Esau...yet one was rejected, and the other was chosen by the Lord." 
2. "God’s special election had not been revealed only to Abraham, but also to Rebecca, when she brought forth her twins." 
3. "And not only so, but Rebecca also received a message, when she conceived by the first, even our father Isaac...it was said to her, 'The elder shall serve the younger.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These words introduce a second proof from history, namely, the case of Rebecca and her two sons, one of whom was chosen."
2. "But Rebecca also... 'unto her.' Accepting the latter view, we place a dash at the end of this verse. In any case 'also' points to the previous case of Sarah."
3. "Having conceived by one, our father Isaac. In the previous instance the two children were of two mothers; here the children were twins, having the same father and mother, and yet of such a different destiny."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having conceived of one (εξ ενος κοιτην εχουσα)."
2. "By metonomy with cause for the effect we have this peculiar idiom (κοιτη being bed, marriage bed), 'having a marriage bed from one' husband."
3. "One father and twins."

### John Gill:
1. "This instance of Ishmael and Isaac...proving that Abraham's natural seed, the children of the flesh, are not all children, the children of God."
2. "The apostle was aware...seeing they not only had the same father, but the same mother, Isaac's lawful wife; they were conceived by Rebecca at once, were in the same womb together, were twins, and if any had the preference and advantage, Esau had it."
3. "Yet a difference was made between these two by God himself, and which was notified by him to the mother of them, before either were born."

### John Wesley:
1. "That God's blessing does not belong to all the descendants of Abraham, appears not only by this instance, but by that of Esau and Jacob, who was chosen to inherit the blessing, before either of them had done good or evil."
2. "The apostle mentions this to show, that neither were their ancestors accepted through any merit of their own."
3. "The purpose of God according to election might stand — Whose purpose was, to elect or choose the promised seed."
