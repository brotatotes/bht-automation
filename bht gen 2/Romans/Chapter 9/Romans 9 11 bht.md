# Romans 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's purpose of election is not based on the character or actions of individuals. The blessings and distinctions that come with God's election are solely determined by His choice. The language used here signifies that God's purpose is formed in a way that includes the act of choosing. This purpose is established prior to any works or deeds, emphasizing that our salvation is not acquired through our own merits or worthiness, but through the goodness and grace of God alone. God's election is personal and individual, not simply a matter of national or collective identity.

1. "As the blessing of the covenant separates the Israelitic nation from all other people, so the election of God makes a distinction between men in that nation, while he predestinates some to salvation, and others to eternal condemnation."
2. "Since the purpose of God according to election is established in this way, — that before the brothers were born, and had done either good or evil, one was rejected and the other chosen; it hence follows, that when any one ascribes the cause of the difference to their works, he thereby subverts the purpose of God."
3. "We have then the whole stability of our election inclosed in the purpose of God alone: here merits avail nothing, as they issue in nothing but death; no worthiness is regarded, for there is none; but the goodness of God reigns alone."
