# Romans 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy states that the elder, Esau, shall serve the younger, Jacob. This does not mean that Esau personally served Jacob, but rather that his descendants would serve Jacob's descendants. Historically, we see this fulfilled when the Israelites brought the Edomites into subjection. This prophecy reveals God's sovereign selection and how His plan unfolds through generations. Jacob's flight from his brother resulted in his spiritual growth as he sought God's mercy and acknowledged his dependence on Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The descendants of Esau, who were Edomites, should be inferior to, and subject to the descendants of Jacob."
2. "It settles 'the principle' that God might make a distinction among people, in the same nation, and the same family, without reference to their works or character."
3. "If this distinction may be made in regard to temporal things, why not in regard to spiritual things? The principle must still be the same."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "While in these cases 'greater' and 'smaller' are evidently used as older and younger, yet the radical meaning is greater and less, and the reference is not to age, but to their relative position in the theocratic plan."
2. "The reference, if to the persons of Jacob and Esau, is to them as representatives of the two nations."
3. "Historically the Edomites, represented by Esau, were for a time the greater, and surpassed the Israelites in national and military development."

### John Calvin:
1. "See how the Lord makes a difference between the sons of Isaac, while they were as yet in their mother’s womb; for this was the heavenly answer, by which it appeared that God designed to show to the younger peculiar favor, which he denied to the elder."
2. "Though this indeed had reference to the right of primogeniture, yet in this, as the symbol of something greater, was manifested the will of God."
3. "There was then something greater than the primogeniture promised in the answer given by the Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The elder shall serve the younger; lit., ‘the greater shall serve the less.’ As spoken to Rebecca, this language referred not only to the twin children, but to the nations springing from them respectively."
2. "Hence it seems best to accept here both the national and personal reference."
3. "Eternal results in the case of these persons are not involved in the original prophecy; and doubtless theocratic privileges and promises are more prominently in the mind of the Apostle in both these historical cases."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The source of the selection is God himself."
2. "Paul quotes Genesis 25:33 (LXX)."

### John Gill:
1. "Esau shall be a servant to Jacob... Esau's exclusion from the favour of God and blessings of grace, signified by his being rejected from inheriting the blessing, which was given to Jacob..."
2. "Esau was a servant of sin, under the dominion of it, and in bondage to it; whilst Jacob was the Lord's freeman... Esau was serviceable to Jacob, both in things temporal and spiritual..."
3. "Jacob's being obliged to flee from his brother... issued in his spiritual good; this sent him to the throne of grace, to humble himself before God, acknowledge his mercies, and his dependence on him..."

### John Wesley:
1. "The elder—Esau. Shall serve the younger." 
2. "Not in person, for he never did; but in his posterity." 
3. "Accordingly the Edomites were often brought into subjection by the Israelites."
