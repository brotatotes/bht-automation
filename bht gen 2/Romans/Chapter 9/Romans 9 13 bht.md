# Romans 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These words are an explanation of the previous statement and clarify that the love and hatred mentioned should be understood in a spiritual, rather than temporal, sense. The love that God has for Jacob, or the Israelites, is an everlasting and unchangeable love that leads to their selection for eternal salvation. In contrast, the 'hatred' towards Esau, or the Edomites, should be understood as a form of neglect or not giving them eternal life. This distinction between love and 'hatred' is evident throughout the Scriptures, as the words spoken in Genesis align with those in the book of Malachi.
