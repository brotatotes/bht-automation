# Romans 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Is it unjust for God to choose some and reject others? Absolutely not. God's choice is based on His own terms, which is well within His rights. Just as earthly rulers have the freedom to choose their own ministers and associates without doing any wrong, so does the Most High. He shows mercy and compassion to those who willingly accept His terms and submit to His will.
