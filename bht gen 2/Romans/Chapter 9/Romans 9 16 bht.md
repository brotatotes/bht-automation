# Romans 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Election, which is what is being discussed here, is not based on the desires or efforts of individuals, but solely on the free, sovereign will of God. God's mercy is the source of this election, given in His own way and according to His good pleasure. It is important to understand that salvation is not a result of human will or works, but stems from God's unfailing love, grace, and goodwill towards His chosen people. This truth applies not only to Abraham but to all those who are partakers of God's mercy throughout all time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But of God that hath mercy."
2. "I must also protest against all endeavours to make it appear, that no inference lies from this passage as to the salvation of individuals."
3. "It is in parts of Scripture like this, that we must be especially careful not to fall short of what is written: not to allow of any compromise of the plain and awful words of God’s Spirit, for the sake of a caution which He Himself does not teach us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So then it is not of him that willeth—hath the inward desire nor of him that runneth—maketh active effort... Both these are indispensable to salvation, yet salvation is owing to neither, but is purely 'of God that showeth mercy.'"
2. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God which, out of His own good pleasure, worketh in you both to will and to do."
- Philippians 3:14

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Eternal life is not bestowed because man had any original willingness or disposition to be saved; it is not because he commences the work, and is himself disposed to it; but it is because God inclines him to it, and disposes him to seek for mercy, and then confers it in his own way."
2. "The sinner, however anxious he may be, and however much or long he may strive, does not bring God under an obligation to pardon him any more than the condemned criminal, trembling with the fear of execution, and the consciousness of crime, lays the judge or the jury under an obligation to acquit him."
3. "Salvation in its beginning, its progress, and its close, is of him. He has a right, therefore, to bestow it when and where he pleases. All our mercies flow from his mere love and compassion, and not from our deserts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth."
2. "The metaphor from the foot-race is a favorite one with Paul."
3. "God is laid under no obligation by a human will or a human work."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our election is not to be ascribed to our diligence, nor to our striving, nor to our efforts, but…to the counsel of God."
2. "It is neither by our will nor efforts…but it wholly depends on the divine goodness."
3. "Let us then feel assured that the salvation of those whom God is pleased to save is thus ascribed to his mercy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In consequence of all this, it is proven that."
2. "The participation in any and all of the effects of God’s mercy and compassion, does not depend on human will, nor on human effort, but on the will of God."
3. "The reference of 'him that willeth' to Abraham’s wish respecting Ishmael, and of 'him that runneth' to Esau’s running home from hunting, is worth mentioning as a specimen of farfetched interpretation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mercy is not of."
2. "The articular participles can be understood as in the genitive with mercy understood or as the predicate ablative of source like 'epiluseos' in 2 Peter 1:20."
3. "Paul is fond of the metaphor of running."

### John Gill:
1. "Election, which is what he is discoursing of, is 'not of him that willeth,' nor of him that runneth: that is, is not owing to the will or works of men..."
2. "But of God that showeth mercy; in a free sovereign way and manner..."
3. "The true sense is, that as election... is not owing at all to the will of men, but to the good pleasure and will of God; and not at all to the works of men... but to the free love, grace, and good will of God..."
