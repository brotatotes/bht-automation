# Romans 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's mercy is bestowed upon those who believe, as He has the sovereign right to show mercy to whom He wills. This mercy is not extended to those who do not believe, as it is within His prerogative to harden their hearts and leave them to the consequences of their unbelief. In doing so, God demonstrates His justice, punishing the impiety of those who reject Him.

"That our mind may be satisfied with the difference which exists between the elect and the reprobate, and may not inquire for any cause higher than the divine will, his purpose was to convince us of this — that it seems good to God to illuminate some that they may be saved, and to blind others that they may perish."
