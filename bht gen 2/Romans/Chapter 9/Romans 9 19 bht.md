# Romans 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The objection against God's will exposes the enmity and insolence of a hardened sinner. The objector specifically references the case of Pharaoh, disregarding the fact that God had raised him up for the purpose of displaying His power and glory. This objection reveals a sour and murmuring disposition, reflecting contemptuous and defiant attitudes towards God. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that God's will, in terms of His unchanging purpose and decrees, cannot be opposed or made void. The objector's resistance does not diminish the sovereignty and authority of God.

### Henry Alford:
1. "For who resists (not, ‚Äò  hath resisted :‚Äù ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏Œ≠œÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ , like ·ºïœÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ , is  present , see Winer, edn. 6, ¬ß 40. 4. b, and compare ·ºêœÜŒ≠œÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ , 2Ti 4:6 )  His will (i.e. if it be His will to harden the sinner, and the sinner goes on in his sin, he does not resist but goes with the will of God)?"
2. "O man (perhaps without emphasis implying the contrast between man and God, for this is done by the emphatic œÉœç following, and we have ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒµ unemphatic in ch. Rom 2:1 ),  who art THOU  that repliest against (the ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒØ seems to imply contradiction, not merely dialogue: see besides reff., ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒ±œÄœåŒ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπŒΩ , Job 13:22 , BC [80] ) GOD?"
3. "Shall the thing formed (properly of a production of  plastic art, moulded of clay or wax)  say to him who formed it, ‚ÄúWhy madest thou me thus ?‚Äù"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This objection shows quite as conclusively as the former the real nature of the doctrine objected to‚Äîthat it is Election and Non-election to eternal salvation prior to any difference of personal character; this is the only doctrine that could suggest the objection here stated, and to this doctrine the objection is plausible."
2. "First: 'It is irreverence and presumption in the creature to arraign the Creator.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the position which he had been endeavoring to establish were true; if God had a purpose in all his dealings with people; if all the revolutions among people happened according to his decree, so that he was not disappointed, or his plan frustrated; and if his own glory was secured in all this, why could he blame people?"
2. "These objections are met by the apostle in the following argument. Who hath resisted his will? - That is, who has 'successfully opposed' his will, or frustrated his plan?"
3. "God had accomplished his purposes 'in spite of' their opposition. This was an established point in the sacred writings, and one of the admitted doctrines of the Jews."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A man may resist God's will, but cannot maintain his resistance."
2. "The idea is the result rather than the process of resistance."
3. "The question means, who can resist him?"

### John Calvin:
1. "The flesh especially storms, that is, when it hears that they who perish have been destined by the will of God to destruction."
2. "Being not content with defending themselves, they make God guilty instead of themselves; and then, after having devolved on him the blame of their own condemnation, they become indignant against his great power."
3. "They are indeed constrained to yield; but they storm, because they cannot resist; and ascribing dominion to him, they in a manner charge him with tyranny."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For it will arise, wherever there is any such notion of God, however derived, as admits the possibility of His being the author of evil in man, or what amounts to the same thing, denies His righteousness..."
2. "The difficulty is an ontological one: Given an infinite free will, how can there be other free wills."
3. "The question implies the helplessness of the objector, and acknowledges the Almightiness of God, but at the expense of His rectitude, since it virtually makes Him responsible for men's sins."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul's imaginary objector picks up the admission that God hardened Pharaoh's heart."
2. "'Still' (ŒµœÑ) argues for a change of condition since that is true."
3. "Many have attempted to resist God's will (Œ≤ŒøœÖŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±, deliberate purpose)."

### John Gill:
1. "It is an objection of a mere natural man, of one given up to a reprobate mind, of an insolent hardened sinner; it discovers the enmity of the carnal mind to God."
2. "The objector seems to have a particular regard to the case of Pharaoh, the apostle had instanced in, when after God had declared that he had raised him up for this very purpose, to make known his power, and show forth his glory in all the world, still finds fault with him."
3. "This is said in support of the former, and means not God's will of command, which is always resisted more or less, by wicked men and devils; but his will of purpose, his counsels and decrees, which stand firm and sure, and can never be resisted, so as to be frustrated and made void."

### John Wesley:
1. "The particle still is strongly expressive of the objector's sour, morose murmuring."
2. "For who hath resisted his will ‚Äî The word his likewise expresses his surliness and aversion to God, whom he does not even deign to name."
