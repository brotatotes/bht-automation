# Romans 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who are you, mere mortal, to question and argue with God? We, as created beings, cannot challenge or question the Creator's plan and purpose for our lives. Instead of questioning God's choice, we should humbly acknowledge our limited understanding and trust in His perfect wisdom. It is not our place to challenge God, but rather to seek His mercy and salvation by believing in Him. Let us remember that God's ways are higher than ours, and it is not for us to accuse Him of injustice, but rather to embrace His mercy and goodness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?" 
2. "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, 'Why hast thou made me thus?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To this objection the apostle replies in two ways; first, by asserting the sovereignty of God, and affirming that he had a right to do it... and secondly, by showing that he did it according to the principles of justice and mercy."
2. "The experience of every age has shown that this has been a prominent topic of objection against the government of God; and that there has been no point in the Christian theology to which the human heart has been so ready to make objections as to the doctrine of the sovereignty of God."
3. "God has his own plans of infinite wisdom, and it is not ours to reply against him, or to arraign him of injustice, when we cannot see the reason of his doings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Man as man, not Jew."
2. "To answer by contradicting."
3. "The word signifies to reply to an answer which God had already given, and implies... the spirit of contention."

### John Calvin:
1. "Who art thou who enterest into a dispute with God?" 
2. "He reminds man of what is especially meet for him to remember, that is, of his own condition; as though he had said, — 'Since thou art man, thou ownest thyself to be dust and ashes; why then doest thou contend with the Lord about that which thou art not able to understand?'" 
3. "He represses this arrogance of contending with God by a most apt similitude, in which he seems to have alluded to Isaiah 45:9, rather than to Jeremiah 18:6; for nothing else is taught us by Jeremiah, than that Israel was in the hand of the Lord, so that he could for his sins wholly break him in pieces, as a potter the earthen vessel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I do not examine the intrinsic verity of what you allege; but, be that as it may, this much is certain, that you are not in a position to dispute with God." 
2. "How great art thou?" 
3. "The word ‘make’ in accordance with what precedes; is to be referred to preparing, adjusting, etc., not to creating. The folly, rather than the error of the objector, is thus rebuked."

1. "O man, but surely thou who art thou?"
2. "The thing formed... the absolute power of God as Creator like the potter's use of clay"

### John Gill:
1. "Thou art but a man, who in his best estate was vanity, being mutable; thou art a fallen sinful creature, and obnoxious to the wrath and displeasure of God for thy sins, and darest thou to open thy mouth against him?"
2. "But for a man to answer again to God... is the highest instance of arrogance and impudence."
3. "Now as it would be a most absurd thing for the clay... so absurd and unreasonable is it, for any to say to God, why hast thou appointed me to such and such ends and purposes, and has brought me into being in such a manner, and under such circumstances?" (150 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus - Why hast thou made me capable of honour and immortality, only by believing?"
2. "Nay, but who art thou, O man — Little, impotent, ignorant man. That repliest against God."
3. "That accusest God of injustice, for himself fixing the terms on which he will show mercy?"
