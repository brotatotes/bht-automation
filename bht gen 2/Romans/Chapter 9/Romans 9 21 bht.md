# Romans 9:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, as the potter, has complete power over the clay, which represents his creatures. He has the authority to shape and mold them as he pleases, appointing vessels for honor and vessels for dishonor. His sovereignty in this matter is not unjust, as he bestows his mercy upon true believers and hardens those who reject it. We must recognize that God's ways are beyond our understanding, as he dispenses his gifts with perfect wisdom according to his own purposes. Trusting in his sovereignty, we can rest assured that his decisions are just and right.
