# Romans 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in His righteous character, willingly endures with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath, those who have fallen under His displeasure due to their own acts. These vessels, fittingly prepared, are ripe for destruction, showcasing both the severity of God's judgment and His power. Simultaneously, God displays His abundant mercy towards the elect, using them as vessels of mercy to manifest His goodness. In this way, God's predestination is revealed as just, as He shows both His wrath and His mercy for His own glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God, purposing to show forth His wrath, and to make known His power, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction."
2. "That He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He before prepared for glory."
3. "The argument is, ‘What if God, in the case of the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, has, in willing to manifest His power and wrath, also exhibited towards them long-suffering, and in having mercy on the vessels of mercy prepared for glory, has also made manifest the riches of His glory?’ Then in both these dispensations will appear, not the arbitrary power, but the rich goodness of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What if God, willing to show His holy displeasure against sin, and to make His power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath..."

### Marvin Vincent:

Not fitted by God for destruction, but in an adjectival sense, ready, ripe for destruction, the participle denoting a present state previously formed, but giving no hint of how it has been formed."

### John Calvin:
1. "He yet shows, that as far as God’s predestination manifests itself, it appears perfectly just."
2. "If the Lord bears patiently for a time with these, not destroying them at the first moment, but deferring the judgment prepared for them, and this in order to set forth the decisions of his severity, that others may be terrified by so dreadful examples, and also to make known his power, to exhibit which he makes them in various ways to serve; and, further, that the amplitude of his mercy towards the elect may hence be more fully known and more brightly shine forth."
3. "For the best reason then are we, the faithful, called the vessels of mercy, whom the Lord uses as instruments for the manifestation of his mercy; and the reprobate are the vessels of wrath, because they serve to show forth the judgments of God."

### Philip Schaff:
