# Romans 9:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vessels of mercy in this passage refer to those upon whom God's glorious riches are displayed. The chosen ones are not superior or more deserving, but God's infinite goodness fills them with redemption and eternal salvation. By bestowing mercy on the elect, God's grace and wisdom are abundantly manifested. The vessels of wrath demonstrate His longsuffering and serve as a contrast to highlight the greatness of His mercy. Thus, it is not unjust for God to display such mercy, for it is His prerogative to show mercy to whom He wills, regardless of their deserving.
