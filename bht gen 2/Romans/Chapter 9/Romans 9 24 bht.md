# Romans 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's calling is not limited to a certain group but extends to both Jews and Gentiles through His free and effective grace. The calling of God is not a call to a specific office, but a call brought about by His powerful and irresistible grace. This truth is evident in the Scriptures, as Paul discusses in Romans 9:25. The inclusiveness of God's grace is a prominent theme throughout the Epistle, inviting all to partake in the blessings of salvation.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To prove that the Gentiles might be called as well as the Jews, was a leading design of the Epistle."
2. "Two things are established here. (1) That the grace of God was not confined to the Jewish people, as they supposed, so that it could be conferred on no others. (2) That God was not bound to confer grace on all the descendants of Abraham, as he bestowed it on those selected from the mass, according to his own will, and not of necessity 'on the mass' itself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Called - of. Compare ch. 8 30. For of, read from [ŒµŒæ] , as Rev. From among.

### John Calvin:
1. "From the reasoning which he has been hitherto carrying on respecting the freedom of divine election, two things follow, ‚Äî that the grace of God is not so confined to the Jewish people that it does not also flow to other nations, and diffuse itself through the whole world..."
2. "He says then, that the vessels of God‚Äôs mercy, whom he selects for the glory of his name, are taken from every people, from the Gentiles no less than from the Jews."
3. "For if to be descended from the Gentiles was no hinderance that God should not call us, it is evident that the Gentiles are by no means to be excluded from the kingdom of God and the covenant of eternal salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even as, etc. Or, 'as such He also called us.' 'Also,' (translated 'even' in the E. V.) belongs to the word 'called,' besides preparing, He also called. 'As such' brings out the sense fully, but is a paraphrase rather than a translation." (Romans 9:24)
2. "The calling is that of individuals through the gospel." (Romans 9:24)
3. "The believing Jew is not called as such, because he is a Jew, but from among the Jews" (Bengel). There is no preference shown them.

3. "Now this calling is to be understood, not of a call to any office, as of Aaron to the priesthood, of Saul to the kingdom, of the disciples of Christ to apostleship, or of ministers to the work of the ministry; but of a call that is by the powerful, efficacious, and irresistible grace of God."
