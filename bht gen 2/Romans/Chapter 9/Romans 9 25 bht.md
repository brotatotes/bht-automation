# Romans 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God refers to his people who were previously not considered his people as beloved. The term beloved indicates an intimate and special relationship, resembling that of a spouse. This highlights that God's love for his chosen ones, both among the Jews and the Gentiles, is not based on conditions or election, but on his own grace and love. This concept is further connected to the prophecy in Hosea, which speaks of the final restoration of the Jews. The fulfillment of this prophecy through the inclusion of both Jews and Gentiles reflects God's comprehensive plan for redemption. (Hosea 2:23)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved." - quoted, though not quite to the letter, from Hosea.
2. "The apostle legitimately applies it to the heathen, as 'aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine was, (2)That he was bound by no promise and no principle of obligation to bestow salvation on all the Jews. (3)That, therefore, it was right for him to reject any or all of the Jews, if he chose, and cut them off from their privileges as a people and from salvation."
2. "Thus, he supports his main position that God would choose his people from among the Gentiles as well as the Jews, or would exercise toward both his right as a sovereign, bestowing or withholding his blessings as he pleases."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I will call the not-my-people my-people."
2. "The new people whom God will call my people will be made up from both Jews and Gentiles."
3. "The exiled Israelites being mingled with the Gentiles, and forming one homogeneous mass with them, cannot be brought to God separately from them."

### John Calvin:
1. "He proves now that the calling of the Gentiles ought not to have been deemed a new thing, as it had long before been testified by the prediction of the prophet."
2. "What may seem to be a hindrance to the Gentiles to become partakers of salvation did also exist as to the Jewish nation: as then God did formerly receive into favor the Jews, whom he had cast away and exterminated, so also now he exercises the same kindness towards the Gentiles."
3. "We hence see that the prophet’s prediction is fitly applied to the present subject; in which God declares, that after having equalized the Jews and the Gentiles, he would gather a Church for himself from aliens, so that they who were not a people would begin to be so."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What has just been said of the Gentiles accords with (‘as’) this prophecy; ‘also,’ probably, suggests that this is a secondary (or typical) application of the passage." 
2. "The prophecy lays down a general principle which is applicable to the calling of Gentiles." 
3. "The Apostle uses the LXX. equivalent of these names (‘not beloved’ for Lo-Ruhamah’), inverting the order, to emphasize the thought ‘not my people,’ which was prominent in his mind."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Ου with substantives obliterates the meaning of the substantive, an idiom seen in Thucydides and other Greek writers."
3. "The use of ουκ with the perfect passive participle is emphatic, since μη is the usual negative of the participle in the Koine."

### John Gill:
1. "His calling them his people is his acquainting them with their relation to him, which he had taken them in to himself, of his own grace."
2. "The apostle is to be justified in his version, by the Septuagint interpreters, who have rendered the passage in Hosea, 'I will love her that was not beloved.'"
3. "The sense is not, that God's chosen ones among the Gentiles were not the objects of his love before calling; for their very calling is the fruit, effect, and so the evidence of love before."

### John Wesley:
1. Beloved — As a spouse. Who once was not beloved - Consequently, not unconditionally elected. This relates directly to the final restoration of the Jews. Hosea 2:23
