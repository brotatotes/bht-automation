# Romans 9:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the very place where they were once told that they were not God's people, where idolatry ran rampant and their actions showed that they were not part of God's chosen ones, there in that very place they will now be called the children of the living God. This transformation is a testament to God's eternal plan of adoption, not only for Jews but also for Gentiles. It is by the power of the Holy Spirit in their hearts that they are assured of their identity as children of God, a privilege beyond measure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God." 
2. "The expression, 'in the place where... there,' seems designed only to give greater emphasis to the gracious change here announced, from divine exclusion to divine admission to the privileges of the people of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If God formerly purposed to recall to himself a people whom he had rejected; if he bestowed favors on his own people after they had forfeited his favor, and ceased to be entitled to the name of 'his people:' then the same thing was not to be regarded as absurd if he dealt in a similar manner with the Gentiles."
2. "The dealings of God toward the Jews in the time of Hosea settled 'a general principle of government.' His treatment of them in this manner was a part of his great plan of governing the world. On the same plan he now admitted the Gentiles to favor."
3. "No higher favor can be conferred on mortals than 'to be' the sons of the living God; members of his family; entitled to his protection; and secure of his watch and care."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though they indeed, whom God in his eternal counsel has destined as sons to himself, are perpetually his sons, yet Scripture in many parts counts none to be God’s children but those the election of whom has been proved by their calling."
2. "He teaches us not to judge, much less to decide, respecting God’s election, except as far as it manifests itself by its own evidences."
3. "The beginning of love, as the prophet teaches, is when God adopts those who had been for a time strangers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only variation from the LXX. is the strengthening of 'also' into 'there,' a word supplied in Italics in the E. V. of the prophecy."
2. "Some have thought that the prophet meant Palestine (Samaria), to which the ten tribes returned. This makes Paul's application of this part of the prophecy purely typical."
3. "Others explain the phrase as referring generally to the heathen world; some, as meaning the Christian Church, the ideal state, etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye are not my people." 
2. "Paul applies it to scattered Jews and Gentiles everywhere."

### John Gill:
1. "where it was said unto them, ye are not my people; where were nothing but idolatry and idolatrous worshippers, and whose worship, works, and actions, declared them not to be the people of God"
2. "The chosen of God among the Gentiles, were from all eternity predestinated to the adoption of children"
3. "because they were antecedently sons by adopting grace, therefore the Spirit of God in effectual calling is sent down into their hearts to bear witness to their spirits, that they are the children of the living God"

### John Wesley:
1. There shall they be called the sons of God — So that they need not leave their own country and come to Judea. Hosea 1:10
