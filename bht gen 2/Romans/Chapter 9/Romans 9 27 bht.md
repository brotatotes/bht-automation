# Romans 9:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Isaiah cries out, prophesying that only a remnant of Israel will be saved, according to divine predestination. This declaration is offensive to the Jews, who relied on their numbers for salvation. The prophecy originates from Isaiah's anguish over the fate of Israel, yet it also holds hope for the remnant who will return to the mighty God, the promised Messiah, and be saved eternally. This message is intended to caution the Jews against putting too much confidence in their lineage and to remind them that salvation extends to the Gentiles as well.
