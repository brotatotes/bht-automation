# Romans 9:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's faithfulness is evident in his preservation of a chosen remnant, as prophesied by Isaiah. Just as a farmer leaves a seed for future harvest, God has ensured the survival of a small group amidst judgment. This remnant is a testament to God's mercy and serves as a reminder that without his intervention, the people would have faced destruction like Sodom and Gomorrah. The election of this remnant is not a license for sin, but rather the source of true holiness in the world. God's sovereign choice guarantees the flourishing of his chosen people throughout history.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Another proof of a remnant to be saved, from a preceding part of the same prophecy."
2. "ὁμοιοῦσθαι ὡς is a construction in which two ideas, ‘to become as,’ and ‘to become like to,’ are mingled."
3. "The citation is verbatim from the LXX, who have put σπέρμα for the Heb. שָׂרִיד, ‘residuum,’ implying a remnant for a fresh planting."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Except the Lord of Sabaoth—that is, 'The Lord of Hosts': the word is Hebrew, but occurs so in the Epistle of James ( James 5:4), and has thence become naturalized in our Christian phraseology."
2. "had left us a seed—meaning a 'remnant'; small at first, but in due time to be a seed of plenty."
3. "But for this precious seed, the chosen people would have resembled the cities of the plain, both in degeneracy of character and in merited doom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'Sabaoth' is the Hebrew word rendered 'hosts' (armies). It properly denotes armies or military hosts organized for war."
2. "God is called the Lord of hosts, as being at the head of all these armies; their King and their Commander."
3. "The nation was so wicked, that unless God had preserved a small number who were pious from the general corruption of the people, they would have been swept off by judgment, like Sodom and Gomorrah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Said before [προειρηκεν]. Not in a previous passage, but by way of prediction."
2. "Seed. Following the Septuagint, which thus renders the Hebrew remnant."
3. "Like the remnant of corn which the farmer leaves for seed."

### John Calvin:
1. "The people of Israel had indeed no pre-eminence, except what they had derived from their ancestors; who had yet been in such a manner treated, that the Prophet complained that they had been so afflicted, that they were not far from having been destroyed, as Sodom and Gomorrah had been."
2. "For it behoved God to be ever mindful of his promise, so as to manifest his mercy in the midst of the severest judgments."
3. "Paul has given 'Sabaoth' from the Septuagint, which is the Hebrew untranslated. This word, in connection with God, is variously rendered by the Septuagint: for the most part in Isaiah, and in some other places, it is found untranslated as here; but in the Psalms and in other books, it is often rendered 'Jehovah or Lord 'of the powers,' and often 'omnipotent' and sometimes 'the holy one.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And, as Isaiah hath said before, or, ‘beforehand.’ The punctuation we adopt, involves this explanation of the passage: ‘And, even as Isaiah has predicted (so I repeat his words), Except’ etc."
2. "The rendering ‘beforehand’ indicates that this was said before the fulfilment."
3. "The Jewish Christians, who escaped the judgment which fell on their nation at the destruction of Jerusalem, constituted such a seed for the Christian Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stands on record in Isaiah 1:9."
2. "Condition of second class, determined as unfulfilled."
3. "A seed. The remnant."

### John Gill:
1. "The title and character the great God goes by here, is 'Lord of sabaoth', that is, 'of hosts', or 'armies'."
2. "The leaving of this small number designs God's gracious acts of reserving in the election of a people for himself."
3. "The decree of election is so far from being a door to licentiousness, that it is the true spring and source of all real holiness, that has been, or is in the world."

### John Wesley:
1. "Unless the Lord had left us a seed — Which denotes, 1. The present paucity: 2. The future abundance."
2. "We had been as Sodom — So that it is no unexampled thing for the main body of the Jewish nation to revolt from God, and perish in their sin."
