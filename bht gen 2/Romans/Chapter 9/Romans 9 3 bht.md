# Romans 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his heartfelt expression, the Apostle Paul reveals his deep love and concern for his fellow countrymen. He contemplates the idea of being separated from Christ and enduring destruction if it meant saving his people. Such was the magnitude of Paul's love that he was willing to sacrifice everything, even his own eternal glory, for the sake of his beloved nation. This profound expression of love and selflessness, although unattainable, serves as a testament to Paul's unwavering devotion to his people and his commitment to the glory of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For I could wish (the imperf. is not historical, alluding to his days of Pharisaism, as Pelag. and others, but quasi-optative, as in reff. ‚ÄòI was wishing,‚Äô had it been possible, that I myself were a curse..."
2. "‚Ä¶the act is unfinished, an obstacle intervening."
3. "The wish is evidently not to be pressed as entailing on the Apostle the charge of inconsistency in loving his nation more than his Saviour."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In proportion as he felt himself severed from his nation, he seems to have realized all the more vividly their natural relationship."
2. "To explain away the wish here expressed, as too strong for any Christian to utter or conceive, some have rendered the opening words, 'I did wish,' referring it to his former unenlightened state; a sense of the words too tame to be endured."
3. "But our version gives the true import of the original; and if it be understood as the language rather of 'strong and indistinct emotions than of definite ideas', expressing passionately how he felt his whole being swallowed up in the salvation of his people, the difficulty will vanish, and we shall be reminded of the similar idea so nobly expressed by Moses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not true that Paul ever did wish before his conversion to be accursed by Christ, that is, by the Messiah... Saul of Tarsus never doubted that he was the friend of the promised Messiah, and was advancing the true interests of his cause, and defending the hopes of his nation against an impostor." 
2. "The word rendered 'accursed' (anathema) properly means... a devotion of anything to destruction, or to complete ruin... 'I could be willing to be destroyed, or devoted, to death, for the sake of my countrymen.'"
3. "It evidently means that he was willing to be devoted by Christ; that is, to be regarded by him, and appointed by him, to suffering and death, if by that means he could save his countrymen."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul would wish to save his countrymen, even at such sacrifice, if it were morally possible."
2. "50 Accursed from Christ...Set apart to destruction and so separated from Christ."
3. "It is not easy to estimate the measure of love in a Moses and a Paul."

### John Calvin:
1. "He could not have expressed a greater ardour of love than by what he testifies here; for that is surely perfect love which refuses not to die for the salvation of a friend."
2. "It was a proof of the most ardent love, that Paul hesitated not to wish for himself that condemnation which he saw impending over the Jews, in order that he might deliver them."
3. "For though the Jews had disowned Paul, he yet concealed not the fact, that he had sprung from that nation, the election of whom was still strong in the root, though the branches had withered."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The subjective intensity of Paul's feeling, which thus seeks expression."
2. "Willing to surrender all things even, if it might be so, eternal glory itself if thereby he could obtain for his beloved people those blessings of the gospel which he now enjoyed, but from which they were excluded."
3. "Anathema, in entire congruity with the Old Testament cherem, is used of a person who is dedicated to God, subjected to the Divine curse for his death, not, however, to bodily death, but to spiritual and eternal death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I could wish (Œ∑œÖœáŒøŒºŒ∑ŒΩ). Idiomatic imperfect, 'I was on the point of wishing.' We can see that ŒµœÖœáŒøŒºŒ± (I do wish) would be wrong to say. ŒëŒΩ Œ∑œÖœáŒøŒºŒ∑ŒΩ would mean that he does not wish (conclusion of second class condition). ŒëŒΩ Œ∑œÖœáŒøŒºŒ∑ŒΩ would be conclusion of fourth class condition and too remote. He is shut up to the imperfect indicative (Robertson, Grammar, p. 886)."
2. "Anathema (Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒºŒ±). See for this word as distinct from Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒ± (offering) 1 Corinthians 12:3; Galatians 1:8."
3. "I myself (Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÇ ŒµŒ≥œâ). Nominative with the infinitive ŒµŒπŒΩŒ± and agreeing with the subject of Œ∑œÖœáŒøŒºŒ∑ŒΩ."
4. "According to the flesh (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫Œ±). As distinguished from Paul's Christian brethren."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle's meaning is, that he could wish to be excommunicated from Christ; that is, from the body of Christ, from the church of Christ, Christ mystical, as the word "Christ" is used, 1 Corinthians 12:12; to be deprived of the ordinance of Christ's house, to be degraded from his office in it, and not to be so much as a member in it."
2. "He saw that these branches, the people of the Jews, were going to be cut off, and no longer to be of the church of God; and such was his affection to them, that he could have wished rather to be cut off himself, that they might be spared; and this was an instance of great love to them, since, next to Christ, the church and the ordinances of it were exceeding dear unto, and highly valued by the apostle."

### John Wesley:
1. "Human words cannot fully describe the motions of souls that are full of God."
2. "Certainly he did not then consider himself at all, but only others and the glory of God."
3. "The thing could not be; yet the wish was pious and solid; though with a tacit condition, if it were right and possible."
