# Romans 9:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gentiles, who were once indifferent to acceptance with God, have now attained the righteousness of faith. They have not pursued their own self-justification, unlike the Jews who were preoccupied with the law but failed to attain righteousness through it. The righteousness that the Gentiles have apprehended is not based on their own works, but on the grace and mercy of God. This righteousness, which comes through faith, is the true righteousness that leads to salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What now is the result of the whole? The result is this—very different from what one would have expected."
2. "That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness of faith."
3. "The Gentiles, who while strangers to Christ were quite indifferent about acceptance with God, having embraced the Gospel as soon as it was preached to them, experienced the blessedness of a justified state."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To what results have we come by the passages adduced from the Old Testament? This question is asked preparatory to his summing up the argument; and he had so stated the argument that the conclusion which he was about to draw was inevitable."
2. "The Gentiles had not made it their main object to justify themselves; they were not filled with prejudice and pride as the Jews were, who supposed that they had complied with the Law, and who felt no need of any other justification."
3. "Though God dispenses his favors as a sovereign, and though all are opposed by nature to the gospel, yet it is always true that the gospel finds more obstacles among some people than among others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is substantially the same, only the imagery in the two words differs; the former being that of laying hold of a prize, and the latter of arriving at a goal." 
2. "The latter is appropriate to following after, and is carried out in stumbling (ver. 32)."
3. "Attained righteousness, that is not that arising from these works, but from faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as this is superior to all other causes, so the corruption and wickedness of the ungodly afford a reason and an occasion for the judgments of God."
2. "The righteousness which the Gentiles attained was by faith; and that it hence depends on the Lord’s mercy, and not on man’s own worthiness."
3. "He speaks expressly of righteousness, without which there can be no salvation: but by saying that the righteousness of the Gentiles proceeded from faith, he intimates, that it was based on a gratuitous reconciliation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What shall we say then? Precisely as in Romans 9:14, where, however, it introduces an objection. But when followed by an assertion, it further unfolds an argument from what precedes."
2. "While this word does not mean 'justification,' we need not give it here a purely ethical sense. For some of the Gentiles had a high ethical ideal which they pursued. But they did not follow this ethical aim with the thought of attaining a verdict of righteousness before God. Conformity to His law was not their ideal of virtue, nor was His judgment the ultimate ground of acceptance."
3. "The peculiar form of the original suggests that this is the true righteousness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Attained (κατελαβεν). Second aorist active indicative of καταλαμβανω, old verb, to grasp, to seize, to overtake (carrying out the figure in διωκω (to pursue). It was a curious paradox."
2. "Which is of faith (την εκ πιστεως). As Paul has repeatedly shown, the only way to get the God-kind of righteousness."

### John Gill:
1. "To God's calling of a large number of the Gentiles, and only a very few of the Jews, according to his eternal purposes and decrees; what can be objected to it? is he chargeable with any unrighteousness?"
2. "They did not pursue and improve the light of nature, about God and things of a moral kind, as they might have done; but held the light and truth they had in unrighteousness, and indeed were filled with nothing else: and yet these persons have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith."
3. "These Gentiles being called by grace, 'attained', 'comprehended', or 'apprehended' this righteousness; not by the light of nature, which makes no discovery, nor gives the least hint of it; but by the light of faith they apprehended it, as revealed in the Gospel; which faith they had not of themselves, but of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "What shall we say then — What is to be concluded from all that has been said but this...Have attained to righteousness — Or justification. Even the righteousness which is by faith."
2. "Although following after the law of righteousness - That law which, duly used, would have led them to faith, and thereby to righteousness."
3. "Have not attained to the law of righteousness — To that righteousness or justification which is one great end of the law."
