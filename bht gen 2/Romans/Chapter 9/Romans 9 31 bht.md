# Romans 9:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews were earnestly seeking righteousness through the observance of the law, which they believed to be a meritorious way of obtaining justification. However, their pursuit was misguided, for they did not truly understand the purpose and meaning of the law. Instead of attaining the righteousness they sought, they missed the mark. It is crucial to recognize that perfect obedience to the law was necessary for legal righteousness, which was an unattainable feat. Therefore, it is through faith, not our own efforts, that we can find justification and righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews followed after, aimed at the fulfilment of 'the law of righteousness,' thinking by the observance of that law to acquire righteousness."
2. "They stumbled at the stone of stumbling. Thus we have instances in the Greek chariot races, of competitors, by an error in judgment in driving, striking against the στήλη round which the chariots were to turn."
3. "There is a close analogy between our text and the exhortation in Hebrews 12:1 f. There, after the triumphs of faith have been related, we are exhorted to run with patience the race set before us, looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained unto the law of righteousness—The word "law" is used here, we think, in the same sense as in Romans 7:23, to denote "a principle of action"; that is, "Israel, though sincerely and steadily aiming at acceptance with God, nevertheless missed it."
2. "Israel, though sincerely and steadily aiming at acceptance with God, nevertheless missed it."
3. "Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained unto the law of righteousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews supposed that they rendered such obedience to that Law as to constitute 'a meritorious' ground of justification."
2. "They have not come to yield true obedience to the Law, even though imperfect; not such obedience as to give evidence that they have been justified."
3. "All this must be renounced; and man must come as a poor, lost, ruined sinner, and throw himself upon the mere mercy of God in Christ for justification and life."

### John Calvin:
1. "That Israel, depending on the righteousness of the law, even that which is prescribed in the law, did not understand the true method of justification."
2. "The Jews following this did not attain to a law of righteousness, such a law as secured righteousness."
3. "The Gentiles reached the goal, not by running, or by their own efforts, but by faith, and laid hold on the prize of righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Israel pursued this law in order that justification might ensue, but without any true sense of its contents, or real apprehension of its mission."
2. "They did not even arrive at the real inward character of that law, which they pursued as affording righteousness. They arrived at the letter, but not at the meaning of the Holy Spirit, for the law, rightly understood, would have led them to Christ."
3. "Because they sought it not by faith...they stumbled at the stone of stumbling; to which repeated reference is made in Scripture...That Christ Himself is meant is evident from the New Testament application of the phrase."

1. "The Israelites, the far greater part of the Jews, who were not called by the grace of God, were all very zealous of the law, called 'the law of righteousness'; because the matter of it was righteous, it was so in its own nature."
2. "They very violently and eagerly pursued after it, they tugged and toiled, and laboured with all their might, as persons in running a race, to get up to the law, and the righteousness of it."
3. "Some of them fancied they had, supposing an external conformity to it, to be all that it insisted upon; not knowing the spirituality of it, that it required truth and holiness in the inward parts."
