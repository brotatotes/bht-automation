# Romans 9:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They missed attaining righteousness because they relied on their own righteousness rather than placing their faith in God's mercy. The sacrifices in the Old Testament pointed to the principle of justification by faith, which had been exemplified by the saints of old. The obstacle that prevented their attainment of righteousness was the rejection and crucifixion of Christ, showing their unwillingness to be saved by Him. The Messiah they had long prayed for became the very stumbling block that caused their downfall.

### John Calvin:
1. "As false zeal seems commonly to be justly excused, Paul shows that they are deservedly rejected, who attempt to attain salvation by trusting in their own works… were they to gain their object, such a success would be the annihilation of true righteousness." 
2. "Nor does he understand by the works of the law, ceremonial observances… but the merits of those works to which faith is opposed, which looks... with both eyes on the mercy of God alone, without casting one glance on any worthiness of its own."
3. "[W]e must observe, that this stumbling does not properly belong to Christ viewed in himself; but, on the contrary, it is what happens through the wickedness of men... Error is a shield over the conscience and a bandage over the eyes."
