# Romans 9:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the church, there is a stone that serves as both a foundation and a stumbling block. This stone, Jesus Christ, has been prophesied about and is the cornerstone of God's eternal purpose. While he brings salvation and righteousness to those who believe, he also becomes a stumbling stone to those who persist in unbelief. This contradiction is foretold by the prophets, and though it may seem perplexing, it signifies the sovereignty and wisdom of God in his dealings with mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ‘stone of stumbling and rock of offence,’ mentioned Isaiah 8:14, is substituted for the ‘corner-stone elect, precious,’ of ch. Isaiah 28:16."
2. "What was there then to prevent the Apostle from giving to this Stone, plainly foretold as to be laid in Zion, that designation which prophecy also justifies, and which bears immediately on the matter here in hand?"
3. "οὐ καταισχυνθήσεται, LXX (Isa 28:16), οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ, gives a secondary meaning of the Heb. לֹא יָחִישׁ, ‘shall not make haste.’ i.e. shall not fly in terror, shall not be confounded."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Grace does not destroy, but only intensify and elevate, the feelings of nature; and Christians should study to show this."
2. "To belong to the visible Church of God, and enjoy its high and holy distinctions, is of the sovereign mercy of God, and should be regarded with devout thankfulness."
3. "On all subjects which from their very nature lie beyond human comprehension, it will be our wisdom to set down what God says in His word, and has actually done in His procedure towards men, as indisputable, even though it contradict the results at which in the best exercise of our limited judgment we may have arrived."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is called rock of stumbling, not because it was the design of sending him that people should fall, but because such would be the result."
2. "The meaning here is, that the man who believes shall not be agitated, or thrown into commotion, by fear of want or success: shall not be disappointed in his hopes; and, of course, he shall never be ashamed that he became a Christian."
3. "The fact that the gospel has been extended to all nations, is proof that it is from heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Offense [σκανδαλου] . See on Matthew 5:29; Matthew 16:9 Matthew 16:3. Shall not be ashamed [ου καταισχυνθησεται] . The Hebrew in Isaiah 28:16 is, shall not make haste, or flee hastily. The quotation combines Isaiah 8:4 and Isaiah 28:16. 

### John Calvin:
1. "Because Christ is called the stone of stumbling, there is no reason that we should dread him, or entertain fear instead of confidence; for he is appointed for ruin to the unbelieving, but for life and resurrection to the godly."
2. "By putting shall not be ashamed instead of shall not hasten or fall, he has followed the Greek Translator. It is indeed certain that the Lord in that passage intended to strengthen the hope of His people: and when the Lord bids us to entertain good hope, it hence follows that we cannot be ashamed."
3. "The first part, 'Behold I lay in Zion,' is taken from Isaiah 28:16; what follows, 'a stone of stumbling and rock of offense,' is taken from Isaiah 8:14; and then the last words, 'and whosoever believes in him shall not be ashamed,' are given from the preceding passage in Isaiah 28:16."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stone of stumbling, etc. In Isaiah 8:14, God Himself is represented as being ‘for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence’ to His enemies."
2. "This combination is both justifiable and natural. In both cases the supreme revelation of Jehovah in the Messiah is referred to; in one passage as a sanctuary for His people, but for a stone of stumbling, etc., to His enemies; in the other as a corner-stone laid in Zion, for a secure foundation."
3. "Shall not be put to shame. The Hebrew is: ‘shall not make haste,’ or, ‘flee hastily,’ with a primary reference to escaping from danger, but the LXX., from which Paul varies very slightly, gives the meaning with substantial correctness (comp. ‘confounded’ in the margin of the E. V.)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul repeats the phrase just used in the whole quotation from Isaiah 8:14 with the same idea in 'a rock of offence' (πετραν σκανδαλου, 'a rock of snare,' a rock which the Jews made a cause of stumbling)."
2. "The rest of the verse is quoted from Isaiah 28:16. However, the Hebrew means 'shall not make haste' rather than 'shall not be put to shame.'"
3. "In 1 Peter 2:8 we have the same use of these Scriptures about Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The stone" said to be laid in Zion, is truly applied by the apostle to Jesus Christ... the foundation stone, in his eternal purposes and decrees, in his counsels and covenant, in promise and in prophecy, in the mission of him into this world, and in the preaching of the everlasting Gospel."
2. "Though, through the sin and unbelief of others, he proves to be a stumbling stone, and rock of offense."
3. "Whoever believes in Christ unto righteousness... he shall neither be ashamed here nor hereafter: he shall not be ashamed of his faith and hope in Christ; nor of Christ, as the Lord his righteousness; nor shall he be ashamed or confounded at his appearing, but shall be justified before men and angels, and be received into his kingdom and glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "I exhibit in my church, what, though it is in truth the only sure foundation of happiness, yet will be in fact a stumblingstone and rock of offence."
2. "An occasion of ruin to many, through their obstinate unbelief."
3. "Foretold by their own prophet."
