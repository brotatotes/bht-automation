# Romans 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The distinguished lineage of the great patriarchs and the Messiah himself is a significant honor for the Israelites, as they were intimately connected with God. Christ, who descended from the Jews according to his human nature, is none other than the supreme God, blessed for all eternity. This remarkable declaration emphasizes his divine nature and his authority over both Jews and Gentiles alike.
