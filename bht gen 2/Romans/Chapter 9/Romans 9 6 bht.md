# Romans 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise of God remains unshaken, even though some may question its validity due to the disbelief of certain individuals. It is important to understand that not all of Israel, in the literal sense, can be considered part of the spiritual Israel. The distinction lies in the fact that true Israelites are those who have a genuine faith in God. This aligns with God's original intention to include only those who believe. The rejection of some Jews and the conversion of Gentiles are part of the fulfillment of God's plan, as revealed in the Scriptures.

"But when he says, that all who are of Israel are not Israelites, and that all who are of the seed of Abraham are not children, it is a kind of change in the meaning of words; for in the first clause he includes the whole race, in the second he refers only to true sons, who were not become degenerated."
