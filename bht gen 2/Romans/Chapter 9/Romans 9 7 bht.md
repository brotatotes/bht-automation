# Romans 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not all who are descended from Abraham are true children of God. The promise was made to Isaac, not to Ishmael or any other descendant. The true children of Abraham are those who are called according to God's election, not merely those who are physically descended from him. This distinction between fleshly descent and true spiritual inheritance is important because it shows that God's choice and election determine who truly belongs to the covenant of promise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
"In Isaac shall thy seed he called" - those only shall be called truly and properly, for the purposes of the covenant, thy seed, who are descended from Isaac, not those from Ishmael or any other son.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not in the line of mere fleshly descent from Abraham does the election run; else Ishmael, Hagar's child, and even Keturah's children, would be included, which they were not."
2. "The true election are such of Abraham's seed as God unconditionally chooses, as exemplified in that promise."
3. "In Isaac shall thy seed be called" (Genesis 21:12).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Are they all children - Adopted into the true family of God."
2. "But in Isaac - This was the promise; Genesis 21:12."
3. "Shall thy seed ... - Thy true people. This implied a selection, or choice; and therefore the doctrine of election was illustrated in the very commencement of the history of the nation; and as God had then made such a distinction, he might still do it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The general principle asserted is that the true sonship of Abraham does not rest on bodily descent."
2. "In the person of Isaac, the descendant of Abraham will be represented and recognized."
3. "The promise was made after Isaac was born."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul mentions this, to show that the hidden election of God overrules the outward calling, and that it is yet by no means inconsistent with it."
2. "For if there ought to have been any natural progeny, which fell not away from the covenant; this ought to have been especially the case with those who obtained the privilege at first."
3. "It hence follows, that some men are by special privilege elected out of the chosen people, in whom the common adoption becomes efficacious and valid."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In Isaac shall thy seed be called. Spoken to Abraham (Genesis 21:12), at the time when Hagar and Ishmael were sent away. Explanations: 1. In the person of Isaac shall thy seed be named."
2. "Through Isaac shall the race be born which shall be truly and properly called thy seed."
3. "Paul finds in this divine declaration the idea enunciated (Romans 9:8), that not on bodily descent (which was also the case with Ishmael), but on divine promise (which was the case with Isaac, Romans 9:9), the true sonship of Abraham is founded."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews highly valued themselves, upon being the natural seed of Abraham; and fancied, upon this account, that they were children, which the apostle here denies: neither are they all children..."
2. "Being Abraham's seed, they were his natural children, and the children of God by national adoption; but, they were not all the spiritual children of Abraham, nor the children of God by the special grace of adoption..."
3. "The meaning of which is, either that the progeny of Abraham in the line of Isaac should only be called, accounted, and esteemed, in an eminent sense, the seed of Abraham, and not his posterity in the line of Ishmael..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither because they are lineally the seed of Abraham, will it follow that they are all children of God - This did not hold even in Abraham's own family; and much less in his remote descendants."
2. "But God then said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called - That is, Isaac, not Ishmael, shall be called thy seed; that seed to which the promise is made."
