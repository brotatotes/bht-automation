# Romans 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In all succeeding generations, believers, the children of the promise, are the true children of God, not merely those who are lineal descendants of Abraham. This distinction demonstrates that being a child of God is not based on physical descent, but on receiving and believing in the promise. Isaac and Ishmael serve as a clear type of this truth, showing that it is the children of the promise who are truly the children of God.
