# Romans 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise referred to here is powerful and supernatural, the very source of Isaac's conception. It is not dependent on natural means, but on God's divine intervention. The phrase 'at this time' signifies a specific and appointed moment, chosen by God Himself. This divine timing assures that Sarah, against all odds, will indeed have a son who will inherit the promised blessing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For this word was (one) of promise, the children of promise are reckoned for seed: for this word, in fulfilment of which Isaac was born, was a word of promise."
2. "According to this time, 'when the time (shall be) reviviscent,' as De W., Thol., al.: i.e. next year at this time."
3. "I will come, and Sarah shall have a son."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is the promise made to Abraham."
2. "He shows that it had not reference to Ishmael, but to Isaac."
3. "Probably it means at the exact time promised; I will fulfil the prediction at the very time."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is no article, and the emphasis is on promise."
2. "The reference is to Genesis 18:14, where the Hebrew is when the season is renewed or revives; i.e., next year at this time."
3. "The season is represented as reviving periodically."

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds another divine testimony; and we see, by the application made of it, with what care and skill he explains Scripture. When he says, the Lord said that he would come, and that a son would be born to Abraham of Sarah, he intimated that his blessing was not yet conferred, but that it was as yet suspended."
2. "We may also observe, by the way, the great caution with which he proceeds here, lest he should exasperate the Jews. The cause being passed over, he first simply states the fact; he will hereafter open the fountain."
3. "It appears that the Apostle here took this expression, 'at this time,' from Genesis 17:21, while he mainly followed the text in Genesis 18:10."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That ‘the children of the promise are reckoned as seed’ is proven, for the word, in accordance with which the birth of Isaac took place, this passage now cited, is a word of promise."
2. "The Hebrew phrase rendered: ‘at this season,’ means when the time (shall be) reviving,’ i.e., at this season of the next year: so the LXX. substantially."
3. "From Genesis 18:14, substituted for a similar clause in Romans 9:10, because of the emphasis it gives (in the original) to the word ‘Sarah,’ who is the principal person."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  A word of promise  (επαγγελιας ο λογος ουτος). Literally, "this word is one of promise." Paul combines Genesis 18:10; Genesis 18:14 from the LXX. 

### John Gill:
1. "The promise is, at this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son."
2. "The phrase 'the time of life' signifies the present time, the 'nunc stans'; so R. Levi ben Gerson f, understands this phrase, 'according to this time which is now standing and abiding' and adds, rightly is this said, because neither time past nor to come are to be found, only the present time, the 'nunc stans'."
3. "Besides, in Genesis 17:21 it is said, 'at this set time', and in Genesis 18:14, 'at the appointed time'; all which support the apostle in his version."

### John Wesley:
1. "For this is the word of the promise - By the power of which Isaac was conceived, and not by the power of nature."
2. "Not, Whosoever is born of thee shall be blessed, but, At this time - Which I now appoint."
3. "I will come, and Sarah shall have a son - And he shall inherit the blessing."
