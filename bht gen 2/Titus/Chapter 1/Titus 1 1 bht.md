## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The occurrence of Œ¥Œø·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶, not elsewhere found in the superscriptions of St. Paul‚Äôs Epistles, is a mark of genuineness: a forger would have been sure to suit every expression of this kind to the well-known habits of the Apostle."
2. "The best sense seems to be that which he gives, that of reference, ‚Äòwith regard to,‚Äô i.e. to bring about, cherish, and perfect: nearly in the same sense as Œµ·º∞œÇ ·ΩëœÄŒ±Œ∫Œø·Ω¥ŒΩ œÄŒØœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ, Romans 1:5."
3. "Paul, a servant of God, but an Apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of the elect of God and the thorough knowledge of the truth which is according to piety."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The peculiar form here would never have proceeded from a forger."
2. "This election has its ground, not in anything belonging to those thus distinguished, but in the purpose and will of God from everlasting."
3. "Godliness," or "piety," is a term peculiar to the Pastoral Epistles: a fact explained by the apostle having in them to combat doctrine tending to 'ungodliness'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning of the word rendered here, ‚Äòaccording to‚Äô - Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ÃÅ kata - is, probably, with reference to; that is, he was appointed to be an apostle with respect to the faith of those whom God had chosen."
2. "God had chosen them to salvation, but he intended that it should be in connection with their believing...he sends his ministers that they may become such."
3. "The object of the apostleship, as it is of the ministry in general, is to secure the proper acknowledgment of the truth among men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The norm of the apostolate in each of the three Epistles is unique, and not Pauline."
2. "The writer is an apostle according to the faith of God's elect, and according to the truth which is contained in the faith, as that truth is intelligently apprehended and held."
3. "This addition describes the peculiar and essential character of the truth which is held and known by God's elect, namely, that it is concerned with the fear and obedience of God - all that constitutes true piety."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is a mutual agreement between my apostleship and the faith of the elect of God; and, therefore, it will not be rejected by any man who is not a reprobate and opposed to the true faith."
2. "Faith is not satisfied with probable arguments, but holds what is true...that truth is the right and sincere knowledge of God, which frees us from all error and falsehood."
3. "The only lawful commendation of doctrine is this, that it instructs us to fear God and to bow before him with reverence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The title servant of God, occurring in James 1:1, but nowhere else in Paul‚Äôs inscriptions, is a peculiarity which tells against suspicion of forgery." 
2. "According to (better, ‚Äòwith a view to‚Äô), introduces the double design of his apostle-ship, viz: (1) the production of faith in God‚Äôs chosen ones (or of that genuine faith which only the chosen have) (cf. Romans 1:5); and (2) the production in believers of a full knowledge (not ‚Äòacknowledging‚Äô) of the truth, or entire Gospel revelation."
3. "A dual design: faith and knowledge. Against certain errorists, this truth tends to godliness, a Pauline word frequent in Pastoral Epistles, denoting that religious fear of God in the heart which penetrates and rules the whole conduct."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "According to the faith of God's elect" - Here Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± expresses the aim of Paul's apostleship, not the standard by which he was chosen as in Philippians 3:14; a classic idiom, repeated here with ŒµœÄŒπŒ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒπŒΩ, ŒµœÖœÉŒµŒ≤ŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ, ŒµœÄŒπœÑŒ±Œ≥Œ∑ŒΩ, "with a view to" in each case.
2. "The knowledge (ŒµœÄŒπŒ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒπŒΩ). 'Full knowledge,' one of Paul's favourite words." - For the phrase see 1 Timothy 2:4.
3. "Which is according to godliness" - "The (truth) with a view to godliness." The combination of faith and full knowledge of the truth is to bring godliness on the basis of the hope of life eternal.

### John Gill:
1. "Paul, before his conversion, was a servant of sin, of divers lusts and pleasures...but being called by grace, he became free from the vassalage of sin, and became a servant of God, and of righteousness."
2. "And according to the faith of God's elect...the apostle, and other Old Testament saints, laid no other foundation of salvation than faith and directed souls to the righteousness, sacrifice, and blood of Christ, to which the faith of Old Testament saints looked."
3. "There are some persons who are styled the elect of God...chosen in Christ from eternity, and are the peculiar objects of the affection and care of God...and there is a special 'faith' that belongs to these; which is a spiritual looking to Christ, a going to him, a laying hold and leaning on him, and trusting in him for salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Titles suitable to the person of Paul, and the office he was assigning to Titus." 
2. "We serve God according to the measure of our faith: we fulfil our public office according to the measure of our knowledge."
