# Titus 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inhabitants of Crete were notorious for their dishonesty and savage behavior, earning them the reputation of being perpetual liars and evil wild beasts. Epimenides, a well-known figure in Cretan history, was considered a prophet by the Cretans themselves. Though the Cretans were characterized by their vices, such as gluttony and slothfulness, it is important to recognize that these traits are not exclusive to any particular nation or people. This serves as a reminder to exercise discernment and not to discount the truth that all individuals have the potential for both good and evil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."
2. "EPIMENIDES was a native of Ph√¶stus in Crete and lived about 600 B.C."
3. "The appellation 'prophet' seems to have belonged to him in its literal sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To Cretanize was proverbial for to lie: as to Corinthianize was for to be dissolute." 
2. "Not merely at times, as every natural man is. Contrast 1 Corinthians 15:33, 'God that cannot lie.'" 
3. "Crete was a country without wild beasts. Epimenides' sarcasm was that its human inhabitants supplied the place of wild beasts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They all had well-known traits of character, which made it proper that no one should be introduced into the ministry without extreme caution."
2. "The Cretians are always liars - This character of the Cretans is abundantly sustained by the examples adduced by Wetstein."
3. "They were false to a proverb, which was, indeed, consistent enough with their being ferocious - though ferocious and wild nations are sometimes faithful to their word; but they were at the same time ferocious and lazy, fierce and gluttonous - qualities which are not often found together."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He is said to have lived to the age of 157 years, and divine honors were paid him by the Cretans after his death." 
2. "The Cretan habit of lying passed into a verb, krhtizein to speak like a Cretan = to lie : also into a noun, krhtismov Cretan behavior = lying."
3. "They are so given to gluttony that they are mere bellies."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as poets are sometimes called by the Greeks (œÄœÅŒøœÜ·Ω¢œÑŒ±Œπ) 'prophets,' and as the Latin authors call them Vates, I consider it to denote simply a teacher."
2. "From this passage we may infer that those persons are superstitious, who do not venture to borrow anything from heathen authors. All truth is from God; and consequently, if wicked men have said anything that is true and just, we ought not to reject it; for it has come from God."
3. "Besides, all things are of God; and, therefore, why should it not be lawful to dedicate to his glory everything that can properly be employed for such a purpose?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Themselves, i.e. Cretans. The hexameter verse quoted is from a lost poem by Epimenides, a Cretan sage of the sixth century B.C., who is well called ‚Äòa prophet of their own,' for he is described by classic writers as a philosophic seer and priest, venerated for his predictions, around whose memory popular legends gathered, and to whom almost sacred honors came to be paid." (Titus 1:12)
2. "Impossible to infer that Paul ascribed an inspired character to heathen sages. The vices here ascribed to the national character (falsehood, violence, and gluttony) find confirmation from other authors." (Titus 1:12)
3. "Slow bellies, 'do-nothing gluttons' (Ellicott)." (Titus 1:12)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A prophet of their own (ŒπŒ¥ŒπŒøœÇ Œ±œÖœÑœâŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ). 'Their own prophet.' Self-styled 'prophet' (or poet), and so accepted by the Cretans and by Cicero and Apuleius, that is Epimenides who was born in Crete at Cnossos."
2. "Liars (œàŒµœÖœÉœÑŒ±). See 1 Timothy 1:10 for the word. The Cretans had a bad reputation on this line, partly due to their claim to having the tomb of Zeus."
3. "Idle gluttons (Œ≥Œ±œÉœÑŒµœÅŒµœÇ Œ±œÅŒ≥Œ±). 'Idle bellies.' Blunt and forceful. See Philippians 3:19 'whose god is the belly' (Œ∑ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒªŒπŒ±). Both words give the picture of the sensual gormandizer."

### John Gill:
1. "The Cretians are always liars: living is a sin common to human nature, and appears in men as early, or earlier than any other; and all men are guilty of it, at one time or another; but all are not habitually liars, as it seems these Cretians were."
2. "Some countries are distinguished by their vices; some for pride; some for levity, vanity, and inconstancy; some for boasting and bragging some for covetousness; some for idleness; some for effeminacy; some for hypocrisy and deceit; and others, as the Cretians, it seems, for lying; this was their national sin."
3. "And the Cretians are called, by the poet, slow bellies partly for their intemperance, their gluttony and drunkenness: which suited with the false teachers, whose god was their belly, and which they served, and not the Lord Jesus; and partly for their sloth and idleness, eating the bread of others without working."

### John Wesley:
1. "A prophet ‚Äî So all poets were anciently called; but, besides, Diogenes Laertius says that Epimenides, the Cretan poet, foretold many things."
2. "Evil wild beasts ‚Äî Fierce and savage."
