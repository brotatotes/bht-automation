# Titus 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage cautions against being swayed by Jewish fables and commandments of men that turn away from the truth. These fables served as a transitional stage to subsequent Gnosticism, lacking in godliness and opposing the faith. The commandments centered on ascetic abstinence from certain foods and practices. By not heeding these myths and precepts, we can maintain the purity of our faith. Instead, we should diligently guard against the influence of such teachings, seeking to uphold the truth and the soundness of our beliefs in line with the Gospel message.
