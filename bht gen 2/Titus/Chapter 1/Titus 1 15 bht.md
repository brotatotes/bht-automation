# Titus 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have a pure and genuine faith are able to understand and accept that all things are pure and can be used for their benefit. The old distinctions of clean and unclean meats no longer apply. However, for those who are defiled in their hearts and lack faith, everything remains impure. It is important to acknowledge that purity is not determined by external factors, but by a sincere and unwavering faith in God.
