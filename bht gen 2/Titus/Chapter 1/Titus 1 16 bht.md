# Titus 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They outwardly profess that they know God, but their actions contradict their confession. Despite boasting about their knowledge of God, their lives and behavior reveal that they do not truly know Him. Their works are devoid of any goodness, lacking both the knowledge and the desire to do what is right. Their hypocritical conduct reflects a mere theoretical understanding of God rather than a genuine relationship with Him.
