# Titus 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The goal of every apostle and servant of God is to promote faith and knowledge of the truth in the hope of eternal life, a promise made by God before the world began. This promise is not just a general one, but it becomes personal to us as individuals when we repent and believe in the gospel. The certainty of this promise lies in the unchanging truth of God, who cannot lie, and the assurance that our hope of salvation rests on His eternal purpose.

1. "that the elect of God may believe and thoroughly know the truth which is according to piety, in hope of eternal life" 
2. "God who cannot lie"

2. "The fact that God cannot lie; that it is his nature always to speak the truth; and that no circumstances can ever occur in which He will depart from it, is the foundation of all our hopes of salvation."
3. "That promise is not made to us as individuals, or by name, but it becomes ours: (1) Because He has made a general promise that they who repent and believe shall be saved; and, (2) Because we may have evidence that we have repented, and do believe the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "True religion and the practice of godliness — begin with meditation on the heavenly life."
