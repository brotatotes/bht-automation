# Titus 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Titus, my true child, was converted under my ministry and shares the same genuine faith as me and all other believers.

As a spiritual father, I am grateful for the grace, mercy, and peace that come from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Savior. Their love and blessing extend to each one of us, their children in the faith.
