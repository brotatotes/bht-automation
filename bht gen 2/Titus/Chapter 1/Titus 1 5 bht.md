# Titus 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For this reason, Paul left Titus in Crete to address and correct the incomplete or lacking aspects in the church. This involved appointing elders in each city to oversee and maintain order within the congregations. The role of these elders was not a separate office but rather a responsibility of faithful individuals to assist in the governance and spiritual guidance of the church. By leaving Titus behind, Paul entrusted him with the task of organizing and establishing proper leadership to ensure the sound faith and conduct of the believers in Crete.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For this reason I left thee behind in Crete that thou mightest carry forward the correction of those things which are defective." 
2. "Mightest appoint city by city elders." 
3. "As I prescribed to thee."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I left thee behind" [ALFORD] when I left the island: not implying permanence of commission (compare 1 Timothy 1:3).
2. Christianity, doubtless, had long existed in Crete: there were some Cretans among those who heard Peter's preaching on Pentecost (1 Timothy 1:3-:).
3. From the unsound state of the Cretan Christians described here, we see the danger of the want of Church government. The appointment of presbyters was designed to check idle talk and speculation, by setting forth the "faithful word."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting - Margin, "left undone." The Greek is: "the things that are left;" that is, those which were left unfinished; referring, doubtless, to arrangements which had been commenced, but which for some cause had been left incomplete."
2. "The word rendered 'set in order', ŒµÃìœÄŒπŒ¥ŒπŒøœÅŒ∏œâÃÅœÉŒ∑ÕÖ epidiorthoÃÑseÃÑ, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, 'to make straight upon, and then to put further to rights, to arrange further.'"
3. "Whether this had occurred because he had been driven away by persecution, or called away by important duties demanding his attention elsewhere, cannot now be determined. Titus was to appoint or set them [elders] over the churches, though with what ceremony is now unknown."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning of the injunction is, that Titus should appoint, out of the number of elderly men of approved Christian reputation, certain ones to be overseers [ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒøŒπ] of the churches in the several cities." 
2. "The eldership was not a distinct church office."
3. "Paul went away, and left Titus to organize the churches founded by himself."

### John Calvin:
1. "The building of the Church is not a work so easy that it can be brought all at once to perfection."
2. "Such ought to be the dispositions of godly teachers; not that every one should labor to make everything bend to his own ambitious views, but that they should strive to assist each other."
3. "In the spiritual building this nearly comes next to doctrine, that pastors be ordained, to take charge of governing the Church; and therefore Paul mentions it here in preference to everything else."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Note the importance of organization to preserve pure doctrine in the Church."
2. "It was part of the apostolic function to institute Church officers."
3. "But the word 'ordain' tells nothing of how the elders were selected or appointed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For this cause...Paul may be supplementing oral instruction as in Timothy's case and may even be replying to a letter from Titus (Zahn)." 
2. "That thou shouldest set in order...to set straight (ŒøœÅŒ∏Œøœâ) thoroughly (Œ¥ŒπŒ±) in addition (ŒµœÄ), a clean job of it." 
3. "And appoint...does not preclude the choice by the churches (in every city, Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÄŒøŒªŒπŒΩ, distributive use of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±)."

### John Gill:
1. "that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting; that is, form the young converts into Gospel order, into a regular Gospel church state; settle a proper discipline among them; instruct them more largely into the doctrines of the Gospel; and correct their manners, and direct them in everything, both with respect to faith and practice"
2. "and ordain elders in every city: for this island, though it was not above fifty miles in breadth, and two hundred and seventy in length, yet had an hundred cities in it; and it seems as if the Gospel had been preached in most, if not all of them, and churches were formed"
3. "What Titus was to do in this affair, was to put the churches upon looking out, and choosing from among themselves proper persons for such service, and to direct, assist, and preside at the elections and ordinations of them"

### John Wesley:
1. "The things which are wanting ‚Äî Which I had not time to settle myself."
2. "Ordain elders ‚Äî Appoint the most faithful, zealous men to watch over the rest."
3. "These were the elders, or bishops, that Paul approved of;-men that had living faith, a pure conscience, a blameless life."
