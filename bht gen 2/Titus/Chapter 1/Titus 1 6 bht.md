### Albert Barnes:
1. "Having faithful children - That is, having a family well-governed, and well-trained in religion."
2. "If a man’s family were not of his character - if his children were insubordinate, and opposed to religion - if they were decided infidels or scoffers, it would show that there was such a deficiency in the head of the family that he could not be safely entrusted with the government of the church."

### John Calvin:
