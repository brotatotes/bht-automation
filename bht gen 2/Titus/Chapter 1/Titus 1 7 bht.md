# Titus 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A bishop should be blameless and serve as a responsible steward in the house of God. He should not be self-willed, easily provoked, a quarreler, or greedy of gain. He must constantly hold fast to the truth and not use the Gospel for personal gain. A bishop must be above reproach, not self-complacent, and fit for the ministry. The qualifications of an elder also apply to a bishop, as they both oversee God's household. A bishop's role is to ensure that everyone receives spiritual nourishment at the right time. He should follow God's will, be free from greed, and govern his own spirit with gentleness and compassion.
