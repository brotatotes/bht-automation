# Titus 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A bishop should be a lover of hospitality, eagerly welcoming and assisting fellow Christians on their journeys. Additionally, they must be a lover of good, appreciating and supporting virtuous individuals and causes. This entails being sober-minded, exercising self-control in thoughts and actions, and maintaining a righteous and reverent attitude towards God. Temperance is also essential, encompassing not only the mastery over one's own desires and appetites but also the willingness to abstain from certain actions for the greater good.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A lover of good men - ... there is no more essential qualification of a bishop than this."
2. "A man who sustains the office of a minister of the gospel, should love every good object, and be ever ready to promote it; and he should love every good man, no matter in what denomination or country he may be found - no matter what his complexion, and no matter what his rank in life."
3. "Temperate - ... It implies control over all our passions and appetites."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "A lover of good."
3. "Temperate, originally, having power over, possessed of, hence, controlling, keeping in hand."

### John Calvin:
1. "With this vice he contrasts, first, docility, and next, gentleness and modesty towards all; for a bishop will never teach well, who is not also ready to learn."
2. "If they refuse to be admonished, if they reject good advices, they will immediately fall headlong to the grievous injury of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "(6) hospitable, having then frequent occasion to entertain brethren on their travels"
2. "(8) sober: this word, which with its derivatives occurs so often in Pastoral Epistles, denotes ‘the well-balanced state of mind resulting from habitual self-restraint’ (Ellicott).

3. "(11) temperate, as to one’s own appetites and passions self-restrained."

### John Gill:
1. "Or 'of good men'; for such an elder or bishop has chiefly to do and converse with; and if he is not a lover of them, their company will be disagreeable to him, and he will be of no advantage to them."
2. "Sober: in body, using moderation in diet and dress; and in mind, being prudent, modest, and humble, and thinking soberly of himself, and others, as he ought."
3. "Temperate; in eating and drinking; continent from the lusts of the flesh; and even abstaining from those things which might be lawfully used, though inexpedient, for the sake of the weak, the peace of the church, and the glory of God."
