# Titus 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The elder must hold firmly to the faithful word, which is the reliable and trustworthy teachings of the apostles, as it has been taught to him. This doctrine of the Gospel, known as the sincere milk of the word, should be retained and adhered to, for it has never deceived anyone. By holding to this sound doctrine, the elder is equipped to exhort in the teachings that are in accordance with the Scriptures, and to refute those who oppose the truth.

1. "The faithful word" is the appellation which he gives to that doctrine which is pure, and which has proceeded from the mouth of God. He wishes that a bishop should hold it fast, so as not only to be well instructed in it, but to be constant in maintaining it.
2. In a pastor there is demanded not only learning, but such zeal for pure doctrine as never to depart from it.
3. The pastor ought to have two voices: one, for gathering the sheep; and another, for warding off and driving away wolves and thieves. The Scripture supplies him with the means of doing both; for he who is deeply skilled in it will be able both to govern those who are teachable, and to refute the enemies of the truth.
