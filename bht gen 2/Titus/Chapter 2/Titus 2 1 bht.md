# Titus 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle urges his readers to cultivate a healthy teaching, one that reflects a good life and conversation, and addresses the various duties of believers according to their different station, age, and sex. He emphasizes that sound doctrine should not be shyly hidden, but rather boldly spoken out openly and publicly, with great clarity and evidence, so that it may be understood and known by all. The duty of teaching sound doctrine is to restore and preserve spiritual health, and it should be fervently and zealously urged upon believers.
