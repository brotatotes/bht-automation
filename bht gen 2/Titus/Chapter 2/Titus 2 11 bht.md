The grace of God, which is the source of salvation, has been revealed to all people, regardless of their status or position.

It is a powerful and transformative message that calls us to embrace piety, obedience, and righteousness in our daily lives. This grace has dawned upon the world like a radiant light, illuminating the darkness and offering salvation to all who are willing to receive it.
