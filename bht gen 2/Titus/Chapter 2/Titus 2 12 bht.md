# Titus 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The grace of God educates and disciplines Christians, teaching us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts. This discipline leads us to live a holy and righteous life, showing self-restraint in relation to ourselves, justice towards our neighbors, and piety towards God. It requires abstaining from and detesting sinful behaviors while cultivating a sober and godly mindset. The Gospel of grace is not a license for licentiousness; it promotes godliness and virtuous living. This transformative power of grace enables us to live a life pleasing to God, reflecting the values and character of Christ.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The education which the Christian receives from 'the grace' of God is a discipline often trying to flesh and blood: just as children need disciplining."
2. "The discipline which it exercises teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world."
3. "'Soberly,' that is, with self-restraint, in relation to one's self: 'righteously' or justly, in relation to our neighbor; 'godly' or piously, in relation to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That by denying ourselves of these, or refusing to practice them, we should lead a holy life."
2. "It means that we should exercise a due restraint on our passions and propensities."
3. "This refers to the proper performance of our duties to our fellow-men; and it means that religion teaches us to perform those duties with fidelity, according to all our relations in life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The saving economy of God is educative."
2. "Ungodliness: The contrary of eujsebeia."
3. "Worldly lusts: On the ethical sense in kosmov the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "Meditation on the heavenly life begins with regeneration. Before we have been regenerated, our desires lean towards the world, and rest on the world." 
2. "He who is endowed with both piety and righteousness lacks nothing for perfect virtue; and, indeed, in the law of God there is absolute perfection, to which nothing whatever can be added." 
3. "The fruit of good actions is not yet visible, yet the hope should be sufficient for stimulating us to doing well."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The design of the Gospel epiphany of grace was to tutor or discipline men into virtue."
2. "The end or design of such discipline is given negatively and positively: (1) â€˜Having deniedâ€™ the old unconverted life... we should (2) live with due control over ourselves... with due regard for othersâ€™ rights... with due piety or devotedness to the Divine honour."

### John Gill:
1. "The persons effectually taught by the Gospel are the 'us', to whom it was come, not in word only, but in power."
2. "To 'deny' these, is to abhor and detest them, and to abstain from them, and have nothing to do with them."
3. "The Gospel then is no licentious doctrine; it is according to godliness, and teaches and promotes it; it is a vile slander to charge it with leading to looseness of life and conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sobriety, in the scripture sense, is rather the whole temper of a man, than a single virtue in him. It comprehends all that is opposite to the drowsiness of sin, the folly of ignorance, the unholiness of disorderly passions."
2. "Sobriety is no less than all the powers of the soul being consistently and constantly awake, duly governed by heavenly prudence, and entirely conformable to holy affections."
3. "And godly â€” As those who are consecrated to God both in heart and life."
