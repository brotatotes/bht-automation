# Titus 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are encouraged to eagerly anticipate the glorious appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, which is the object of our hope. In this anticipation, we fix our hearts and affections on the fulfillment of eternal glory and happiness, patiently waiting in faith for its realization. Furthermore, the declaration of Jesus as the great God and Savior affirms the divinity of Christ and refutes any notion of a hierarchy in His nature.

3. "The fair construction of the Greek here, according to the application of the most rigid rules, abundantly sustains the interpretation which the plain reader of the New Testament would affix to it. The names above referred to are abundant proof that no violation is done to the rules of the Greek language by this interpretation, but rather that the fair construction of the original demands it. If this be so, then this furnishes an important proof of the divinity of Christ."

3. "There is a grammatical presumption in favour of referring â€˜Godâ€™ to our Lord in this passage; yet not such as can be much depended on, seeing the usage of the writer tells the other way."
