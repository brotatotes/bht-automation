## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let no man despise thee (addressed to Titus, not to the people, as Calv. (‘populum ipsum magis quam Titum hic compellat’): ‘so conduct thyself in thine exhortations, with such gravity, and such consistency, and such impartiality, that every word of thine may carry weight, and none may be able to cast slight on thee for flaws in any of these points’)."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let no man despise thee—Speak with such vigor as to command respect."
2. "Warn them with such authority that no one may think himself above the need of admonition."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'authority' here means command - ἐπιταγὴ epitagē; 1Co 7:6, 1 Corinthians 7:25; 2Co 8:8; 1 Timothy 1:1; Titus 1:3. The sense here is, he was to do it decidedly, without ambiguity, without compromise, and without keeping anything back."
2. "He was to state these things not as being advice or counsel, but as the requirement of God."
3. "That is, conduct yourself, as you may easily do, so as to command universal respect as a minister of God; see the notes at 1 Timothy 4:12."

### John Calvin:
1. "He likewise bids him add the spurs of 'exhortations and reproofs;' for men are not sufficiently admonished as to their duty, if they be not also vehemently urged to the performance of it."
2. "In order that Titus may meet this disdain, he is enjoined to add the weight of his authority to his doctrine."
3. "He beats down the haughtiness of such men, and strictly charges them to desist from despising, in any way, sound and useful doctrine."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With all authority. Assertion of authority is sometimes necessary." 
2. "Let no man despise thee. Literally, 'let no man think around thee' (and so despise thee). The best way for the modern minister to command respect for his 'authority' is to do thinking that will deserve it."

### John Gill:
1. "And the things which become sound doctrine; the duties of religion suitable to every age and sex, a denying of ungodliness and worldly lusts, a sober, righteous, and godly life and conversation, exhort unto; and encourage the saints to be zealous of good works." 
2. "And rebuke with all authority; such as imbibe errors and heresies, or indulge to vice and wickedness, with the authority both of Christ and his church, in the name of the one, and by the order and vote of the other, that the reproof may come with the greater weight."
3. "Let no man despise thee; as negligent in the discharge of his office, or as doing it in a pusillanimous manner, or as behaving in his life and conversation unworthy of the character he bore."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let none have any just cause to despise thee."
2. "Men who know not God will despise a true minister of his word."
