# Titus 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Aged men should be sober, grave, and temperate, demonstrating well-regulated morals and displaying a gravity that inspires respect. They should also exercise faith, love, and patience, enduring trials with resignation. Sound in mind and body, aged disciples are called to exhibit a moral sanity and holiness that are characterized by wise self-control and a brave endurance under trial, which is the fruit of hope. As aged ambassadors of Christ, they should be vigilant, patient, and serious, not given to frivolity or inappropriately diverting themselves on the brink of eternity.
