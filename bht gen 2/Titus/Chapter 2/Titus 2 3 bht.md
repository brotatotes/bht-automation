# Titus 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Aged women are called to conduct themselves with reverence and propriety, reflecting the holiness and godliness expected of them as women consecrated to God. They should avoid spreading false accusations and refrain from becoming enslaved to excessive drinking. Instead, they are encouraged to be teachers of what is good, setting an example for younger women to follow. By exhibiting behavior that reflects their calling, these women can honor God and prevent the word of God from being spoken ill of.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The aged women likewise in deportment, reverend, not slanderers, nor yet enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good." 
2. "The young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children, discreet, chaste, workers at home, good." 
3. "In subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not ill-spoken of."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "as becometh women consecrated to God" [WAHL]: being by our Christian calling priestesses unto God.
2. "Observant of sacred decorum" [BENGEL]: not false accusers, not slanderers.
3. "enslaved to much wine." Addiction to wine is slavery: teachers in private, influencing for good the younger women by precept and example.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their conduct should be such as the gospel requires."
2. "Not false accusers."
3. "Teachers of good things - That is instructing the younger."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Behavior means, primarily, condition or state...Hence the state in which one habitually bears himself - his deportment or demeanor."
2. "It means beseeming a sacred place, person, or matter...The meaning here is becoming those who are engaged in sacred service."
3. "Given to much wine. More correctly, enslaved to much wine."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul wished to guard against both extremes, by enjoining them to follow a course that is agreeable both to outward propriety and to religion; or, if you choose to express it in simpler language, to give evidence, by their very dress, that they are holy and godly women."
2. "Talkativeness is a disease of women, and it is increased by old age. To this is added, that women never think that they are eloquent enough, if they are not given to prattling and to slander â€” if they do not attack the characters of all. The consequence is, that old women, by their slanderous talkativeness, as by a lighted torch, frequently set on fire may houses."
3. "Many are also given to drinking, so that, forgetting modesty and gravity, they indulge in an unbecoming wantonness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behaviour, or deportment, a wide term, covering â€˜walk, gesture, countenance, speech, silenceâ€™ (Jerome)." 
2. "Becometh holiness (cf. 1 Timothy 2:10; Ephesians 5:3), befitting the solemnity of a consecrated person. Women too are spiritual priests in Christ."
3. "False accusers; frequent failing of this class; the word is literally â€˜devils.â€™ It is the diabolic characteristic to slander the good."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Aged women... reverent... in demeanour." 
2. "Not slanderers, nor enslaved to much wine."
3. "Teachers of that which is good."

### John Gill:
1. "These aged women design not persons in office, who were ancient widows, and had some care of the poor; or presbyteresses, as some call them, the wives of presbyters or elders, as being distinct from deaconesses; but godly women in years, who are to be instructed and exhorted." 
2. "Such [holy women] ought to be in their clothing, and in their speech, and in the whole of their conduct and conversation, as become the character which they bear, and the profession they make." 
3. "These should be teachers, not of old wives' fables, of superstitious customs, rites, and ceremonies, of the intrigues of love, and of things filthy and obscene, which are too often handed down to posterity by such persons; but of things that are solid and substantial, useful and improving, honest and honourable, chaste and pure."

### John Wesley:
1. "Observing a holy decorum."
2. "Not given to much wine - If they use a little for their often infirmities."
3. "Let them teach good only."
