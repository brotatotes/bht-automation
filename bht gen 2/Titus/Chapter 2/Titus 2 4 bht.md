# Titus 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be wise, moderate, and self-controlled in their behavior and to manage their household affairs diligently is what the elder women are to teach the younger women. They are to cultivate a deep and genuine love for their husbands by supporting and honoring them, seeking their well-being and unity. Likewise, they must exhibit a loving, disciplined, and responsible care for their children, seeking their spiritual welfare and providing proper nurture. These instructions may prove challenging, but they are essential for a harmonious and godly family life.
