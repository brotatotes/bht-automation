# Titus 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Women who are workers at home are expected to be discreet and wise in their conduct, especially in their love for their children. They are also called to be chaste in their love for their husbands. While they should be diligent keepers at home, they should also engage in necessary works of piety and mercy when called upon. By fulfilling these duties, they contribute to the wellbeing of their families and honor the gospel, preventing any reproach or blasphemy from being directed at it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Workers at home": active in household duties.
2. "Good": kind, beneficent. Not churlish and niggardly, but thrifty as housewives.
3. "Submissive": marking the duty of subjection which they owe them, as being their own husbands. That no reproach may be cast on the Gospel, through the inconsistencies of its professors.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Religion is the patron of the domestic virtues, and regards the appropriate duties in a family as those most intimately connected with its own progress in the world."
2. "Our first duty is at home, and all other duties will be well performed just in proportion as that is."
3. "That the word of God may not be blasphemed - That the gospel may not be injuriously spoken of, on account of the inconsistent lives of those who profess to be influenced by it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mistress of the house is to add to her thrift, energy, and strict discipline, benign, gracious, heartily kind demeanor." 
2. "Obedient [υποτασσομενας] . Better, subject or in subjection. Frequent in Paul, but not often in the active voice."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is supposed that this relates strictly to women who were married to unbelieving husbands, who might judge of the gospel from the wicked conduct of their wives."
2. "He demands such strictness of life as not to bring the gospel into the contempt of the public by their vices."
3. "As to the other parts of the verse, the reader will find them explained in the Commentary on the First Epistle to Timothy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Keepers at home" are usually "workers at home." (οικουργους)
2. "Kind" (αγαθας). (See Romans 5:7. See Colossians 3:18; Ephesians 5:22 for the same use of υποτασσομα, to be in subjection.)
3. Note ιδιοις (their own). See 1 Timothy 6:1 for the same negative purpose clause (ινα μη βλασφημητα).

### John Gill:
1. "To be discreet...or to be sober both in body and mind; or to be wise and prudent in the whole of their conduct." 
2. "Keepers at home: minding their own family affairs, not gadding abroad; and inspecting into, and busying themselves about other people's matters."
3. "The tortoise, which carries its house upon its back, and very rarely shows its head, or looks out of it, was, with the ancients, an emblem of a good housewife."

### John Wesley:
1. "Discreet — Particularly in the love of their children."
2. "Chaste — Particularly in the love of their husbands."
3. "Keepers at home — Whenever they are not called out by works of necessity, piety, and mercy."
