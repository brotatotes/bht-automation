# Titus 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In everything you do, be an example for others to follow. Just as a basin cannot overflow unless it is filled, teaching is meaningless unless the teacher's actions confirm their words. The Christian minister should strive for integrity, ensuring that their teaching remains pure and uncorrupt. Not only should they teach the truth, but they should also exhibit dignified seriousness in their delivery. This way, their message will command respect and have a profound impact on the lives of those who hear it.
