# Titus 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The importance of using wholesome speech is emphasized, not only in public ministry, but also in private conversation. The words chosen should be plain and convey accurate ideas that align with the Scriptures and the principles of faith. By doing so, those who oppose the Gospel will be put to shame and confounded by the moral and doctrinal purity exhibited by faithful ministers of the Word.
