# Titus 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Servants are encouraged to please their masters in all righteous matters, avoiding any sin or wrongdoing. They are to refrain from answering back, even when unjustly accused, and resist the temptation to steal or take things without permission. By doing so, servants can maintain good relationships with their masters and avoid behaviors that could provoke or damage trust.
