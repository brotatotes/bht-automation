# Titus 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we must not forget our responsibility to submit and be obedient to those in authority. This includes those in power, whether they are supreme or subordinate leaders. The apostle Paul encourages Titus to remind the Cretan Christians of this important principle, especially in light of false teachers who undermine authority. Our obedience to magistrates extends to matters that align with God's laws and the common good of society, always considering our conscience and faith. Let us remember the call to be subject and obedient, actively fulfilling every good work that is in line with God's will.
