# Titus 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
An heretic, according to the generally received sense of the churches of Christ, is one who chooses an opinion contrary to the fundamental doctrines of Christianity. Such an individual causes divisions and disputes in the church, which are to be avoided and rejected. Scripture instructs us to have no fellowship with such a person, not allowing them to participate in private conversations or remain in church communion, after they have been publicly admonished twice. The term heretic, as used here, refers to someone who persistently engages in contentious and divisive behavior, rather than simply one who holds different opinions.
