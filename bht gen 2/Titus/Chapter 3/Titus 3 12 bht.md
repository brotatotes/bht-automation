# Titus 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Titus, who was an evangelist, had the responsibility of overseeing various churches and assisting the apostles wherever he went. It is uncertain who Artemas was, with some speculating that he may have been one of the seventy disciples or the bishop of Lystra. The apostle Paul wanted Titus to join him in Nicopolis, though not the one in Macedonia, but a different one in Epirus. This indicates that Titus had not arrived yet, suggesting that the letter wasn't written from Nicopolis.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Whenever I shall have sent Artemas to thee, hasten to come to me to Nicopolis."
2. "Forward on their journey with zeal Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, that nothing may be wanting to them."
3. "Zenas the lawyer... had been converted, and to whom the name of his former occupation still adhered."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Artemas is said to have been subsequently bishop of Lystra. Tychicus was sent twice by Paul from Rome to Lesser Asia in his first imprisonment (which shows how well qualified he was to become Titus' successor in Crete)."
2. "Tradition makes him [Tychicus] subsequently bishop of Chalcedon, in Bithynia."
3. "This Epistle was probably written from Corinth in the autumn. Paul purposed a journey through Ætolia and Acarnania, into Epirus, and there 'to winter'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When I shall send Artemas unto thee - This person is not elsewhere mentioned in the New Testament, and nothing more is known of him."
2. "For I have determined there to winter - Why Paul designed to spend the winter there, or what he purposed to do there, are questions on which no light can now be thrown."
3. "His requesting Titus to leave his important post and to come to him, looks as if his aid were needed in the work of the ministry there, and as if Paul supposed there was a promising field of labor there."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To winter [παραχειμασαι]. Comp. Acts 27:12; Acts 28:11; 1 Corinthians 16:6." (Commentary)
2. "The phrase N.T. o. With reference to whatever occasion may demand them." (Commentary)
3. "Not only in supplying the needs, but in cultivating Christian graces in themselves by acts of Christian service." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Titus was soon to be replaced that he might rejoin the apostle."
2. "Artemas is unknown; by tradition, Bishop of Lystra."
3. "Tychicus, of the province of Asia (Acts 20:4), who carried from Rome the letters to Colosse (Colossians 4:7-8), and to Ephesus (so called; see Ephesians 6:21-22)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When I shall send..." (οταν πεμψω). Indefinite temporal clause with οταν and the first aorist active subjunctive (or future indicative) of πεμπω (same form).
2. "Artemas (Αρτεμαν). Perhaps abbreviation of Artemidorus. Nothing more is known of him."
3. "Or Tychicus (η Τυχικον). Paul's well-known disciple (Colossians 4:7; Ephesians 6:21; 2 Timothy 4:12)."

### John Gill:
1. "These were both of them ministers of the Gospel; there is no mention of Artemas anywhere else; some say he was one of the seventy disciples, and that he was afterwards bishop of Lystra; but these are uncertain things." 
2. "Hither the apostle would have Titus come to him, after one or other of the above ministers were come to Crete; for as the apostle had the care of all the churches upon him, he would not remove a minister from one place to another, without making a provision in their room." 
3. "His reasons for having Titus come to him might be either to know the state of the churches in Crete; or because he stood in need of his assistance; or to send him elsewhere."

### John Wesley:
1. "Titus was properly an evangelist, who, according to the nature of that office, had no fixed residence; but presided over other elders, wherever he travelled from place to place, assisting each of the apostles according to the measure of his abilities." 
2. "Very probably not the Nicopolis in Macedonia, as the vulgar subscription asserts: (indeed, none of those subscriptions at the end of St. Paul's epistles are of any authority:) rather it was a town of the same name which lay upon the sea-coast of Epirus."
3. "Hence it appears, he was not there yet; if so, he would have said, to winter here. Consequently, this letter was not written from thence."
