# Titus 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hospitality was highly valued in the early Christian community, especially towards travelers like Zenas, who was referred to as a lawyer, possibly an expert in Roman or Jewish law. Paul encouraged Titus to send him and Apollos on their journey, making sure that they lacked nothing they needed. It is evident that Zenas and Apollos were both active preachers or teachers of the Gospel, and their journey was an important opportunity for them to share their faith and receive support from other believers.
