# Titus 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All of Paul's fellow laborers and fellow believers, as well as the members of the church where he was, sent their greetings to Titus, acknowledging his high regard among them. The use of the concluding salutation grace be with you all, Amen in this epistle indicates that it was not only intended for Titus but also for the saints at Crete. However, it is worth noting that the subscription designating Titus as the first bishop of the church in Crete is not reliable and is unlikely to be accurate.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This form of salutation, so different from any occurring in St. Paul’s other Epistles, is again a strong corroboration of genuineness."
2. "An apocryphal imitator would not have missed the Apostle’s regular formulæ of salutation."
3. "God’s grace be with all of you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Greet them that love us in the faith."
2. "A salutation peculiar to this Epistle, such as no forger would have used."
3. "Grace... with you all."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul, at the close of his epistles, usually mentions the names of those who sent affectionate salutations."
2. "Greet them that love us in the faith - In the faith of the gospel, or as Christians."
3. "These subscriptions are so utterly destitute of authority, and are so full of mistakes, that it is high time they were omitted in the editions of the Bible."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Them that love us in the faith [τους φιλουντας ημας εν πιστει] . Better, in faith." 
2. "The phrase N. T. o. Filein to love, only here in Pastorals, and in Paul, only 1 Corinthians 16:22."
3. "Const. in faith with that love us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Titus 3:15. Them that love, etc.,  i.e.  Cretan Christians who had come to know Paul during his stay in the island.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  That love us  (τους φιλουντας ημας). Paul craved the love of his friends as opposed to Titus 2:8. 

### John Gill:
1. "All that are with me salute thee,.... All the apostles, fellow labourers, and the ministers of the Gospel that were with him; and all the members of the church where he was, sent their Christian salutation to Titus; he being a person greatly esteemed, and whose praise was in all the churches"
2. "grace be with you all, Amen; which is the common concluding salutation in all Paul's epistles. This shows that this epistle was not designed for Titus only, but for the saints at Crete."
3. "It was written to Titus the first bishop of the church of the Cretians. But this subscription, as many others, is not to be depended upon; it is not very likely that Titus was bishop of this church at all."
