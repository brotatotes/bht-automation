# Titus 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As followers of Christ, we are called to refrain from slandering or defaming others, treating all with kindness and gentleness. We should not engage in quarrels or contentions, but rather be yielding and considerate, even when we are attacked. It is important for us to show meekness, choosing to respond with humility and grace, and remembering that we too were once in need of God's mercy and forgiveness.
