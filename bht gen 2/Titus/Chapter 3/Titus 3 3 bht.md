# Titus 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Reflecting on our own former wickedness and folly serves as a powerful reminder of the need for repentance and compassion towards others. Much like how God treated us in our ignorance, we should extend grace to our neighbors. Our past experiences of being deceived and disobedient should shape our understanding and guide us in treating others with kindness. By remembering our own past, we can avoid harshness and instead approach others with the empathy and understanding that we ourselves once needed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "we (Christians) also (as well as they) were once without understanding, disobedient, led astray, slaves to divers lusts and pleasures, passing our lives in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another."
2. "It was our natural hatefulness which begot mutual hatred."
3. "Or perhaps the two particulars may be taken separately, as distinct items in our catalogue of depravities."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Despise none, for such wast thou also."
2. "As God treated us, we ought to treat our neighbor."
3. "Grace is the sole remedy for foolishness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He will exhort the wicked to repentance most effectually who remembers that his own former life was wicked; he will evince most of the proper spirit in doing it who has the deepest sense of the errors and folly of his own past ways."
2. "Every one who is converted feels, and is ready to confess, that before conversion he was deceived as to the comparative value of things, as to the enjoyment which he expected to find in scenes of pleasure and riot, and often in what seemed to him well-formed plans."
3. "Let us remember what we were, and we shall not be disposed to treat others harshly. When a Christian is tempted to unkind thoughts or words towards others, nothing is more appropriate for him than to reflect on his own past life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Malice [κακια] . Only here in Pastorals. See on James 1:21. In N. T. kakia is a special form of vice, not viciousness in general, as Cicero, Tusc. 4 15, who explains by 'vitiositas, a viciousness which includes all vices.'"
2. "Calvin, on Ephesians 4:32, defines as 'a viciousness of mind opposed to humanity and fairness, and commonly styled malignity.'"
3. "The homily ascribed to Clement of Rome, describes kakia as the forerunner [προοδοιπορον] of our sins (x). Malice is a correct translation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing is better adapted to subdue our pride, and at the same time to moderate our severity, than when it is shown that everything that we turn against others may fall back on our own head; for he forgives easily who is compelled to sue for pardon in return."
2. "They who have a true zeal for God, are, indeed, severe against those who sin; but, because they begin with themselves, their severity is always attended by compassion."
3. "In order that believers, therefore, may not haughtily and cruelly mock at others, who are still held in ignorance and blindness, Paul brings back to their remembrance what sort of persons they formerly were; as if he had said, 'If such fierce treatment is done to those on whom God has not yet bestowed the light of the gospel, with equally good reason might you have been at one time harshly treated.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such conduct becomes people who were once like the heathen, but who have been changed through Divine grace and no merit of their own." 
2. "Their past is described in seven particulars. Foolish, i.e. without just ideas through the darkening effect of sin. Deceived, or deluded, includes practical as well as intellectual errors. 'Enslaved to desires and various pleasures' describes the self-indulgent, as the next words describe the malignant character of heathendom."
3. "The whole [description of their past] is a frightful picture of unregenerate unchristian society."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Foolish, disobedient, deceived." (ανοητο, απειθεις, πλανωμενο)
2. "Divers lusts." (ηδοναις ποικιλαις)
3. "Hating one another." (μισουντες αλληλους)

### John Gill:
1. "Nothing has a greater tendency to promote humility, and check pride in the saints, than to reflect upon their past state and condition, what they themselves once were."
2. "The same grace that had made a difference in them, could make one in these also, and which might be made in God's own time."
3. "They should consider that they also had been 'foolish', and without understanding of things, divine and spiritual, and neither knew their own state and condition, nor the way of salvation by Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "And as God hath dealt with us, so ought we to deal with our neighbour."
2. "Were without understanding - Wholly ignorant of God."
3. "And disobedient - When he was declared to us."
