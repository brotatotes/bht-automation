# Titus 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is not achieved through human effort or righteousness, but purely by the grace and love of God. It is His mercy that saves us and justifies us, not our own deserving. Through His regenerating and renewing power, God reveals His love to us and offers us the hope of eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We neither did works of righteousness, nor were saved in consequence of them but His goodness did the whole." - Theophylact
2. "The apostles are wont to draw an argument from the sacraments to prove the thing therein signified, because it ought to be a recognized principle among the godly, that God does not mark us with empty signs, but by His power inwardly makes good what He demonstrates by the outward sign." - Calvin
3. "Adult candidates for baptism are presupposed to have had repentance and faith...in which case baptism would be the visible 'laver or regeneration' to them, 'faith being thereby confirmed and grace increased, by virtue of prayer to God'." - Article XXVII, Church of England

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The plan was not based on our own good works, nor are our own good works now the cause of our salvation."
2. "Whatever we have done or can do, when we come to receive salvation from the hand of God, there is no other element which enters into it but mercy."
3. "This is an important clause, added by Paul apparently to save from the possibility of falling into error. If the former expression, 'the washing of regeneration,' had been left to stand by itself, it might have been supposed possibly that all the regeneration which would be needed would be that which would accompany baptism."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not by works of righteousness which we have done... The thought is entirely Pauline... We did." 
2. "According to his mercy... By the washing of regeneration... The phrase laver of regeneration distinctly refers to baptism, in connection with which and through which as a medium regeneration is conceived as taking place."
3. "The renewing of the Holy Spirit is not bestowed if faith be wanting... The phrase renewing of the Holy Spirit only here."

### John Calvin:
1. "We therefore conclude from his words, that we bring nothing to God, but that he goes before us by his pure grace, without any regard to works."
2. "That we, rather than others, have been admitted to enjoy the salvation of Christ, is altogether ascribed by Paul to the mercy of God, because there were no works of righteousness in us."
3. "This argument would have no weight, if he did not take for granted, that everything that we attempt to do before we believe, is unrighteous and hateful to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not in consequence of works," "which we (emphatic) did." The undeserved sovereignty of grace frequent in Paul.
2. "The means by which individuals realize the salvation which was once for all effected in Christ’s cross is regeneration expressed and sealed by baptism."
3. "Renewing is added to further define ‘regeneration.’ It describes the moral change which passes on a man when he becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Done (not in the Greek, only the article των), 'not as a result of works those in righteousness which we did.' Same idea as in Romans 3:20."
2. "According to his mercy he saved us (κατα το αυτου ελεος εσωσεν). See Psalms 109:26; 1 Peter 1:3; Ephesians 2:4."
3. "Probably in both cases there is a reference to baptism, but, as in Romans 6:3-6, the immersion is the picture or the symbol of the new birth, not the means of securing it."

### John Gill:
1. "Salvation...is not brought about by any works, even the best works of men."
2. "Salvation is owing to the tender mercy of God...and even eternal life is the effect of it."
3. "God saves his people...by regenerating and renewing them; in this is the first appearance and discovery of the love of God to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The cause of it; not our works or righteousness, but 'the kindness and love of God our Savior.'"
2. "Justification; 'being justified,' pardoned and accepted through the alone merits of Christ, not from any desert in us, but according to his own mercy, 'by his grace,' his free, unmerited goodness."
3. "The consummation of all; - that we might become heirs of eternal life, and live now in the joyful hope of it."
