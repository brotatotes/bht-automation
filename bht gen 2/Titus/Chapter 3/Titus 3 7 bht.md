# Titus 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Regeneration does not justify individuals but reveals and declares their justification. Through the grace of God, believers are justified and made heirs of eternal life. This inheritance is not earned or purchased, but freely given by God to His children. Regeneration shows believers as adopted children and justifies them, giving them the right to this inheritance, in a way that aligns with the justice and holiness of God.
