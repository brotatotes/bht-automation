# Titus 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Avoid getting caught up in foolish debates, meaningless discussions, and pointless arguments about the law. These types of controversies are unproductive and serve no beneficial purpose. Instead, focus on the sound and certain doctrine that leads to godliness. Steer clear of disputing over genealogies or getting entangled in irrelevant details which only serve to distract from the true essence of faith. Remember that our pursuit of knowledge should always be directed towards what is useful and edifying, leaving no room for empty and futile pursuits.

### John Calvin:
1. "He contrasts 'questions' with sound and certain doctrine."
