## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The process itself of baptism is regarded as the burial of the former life: originally, perhaps, owing to the practice of immersion, which would most naturally give rise to the idea."
2. "The things represented by both figures belong to the essentials of the Christian life: the minor details of the sacrament which corresponded to them, may in different ages or climates be varied; but the spiritual figures remain."
3. "The power of God in raising the dead to life is one and the same in our Lord and in usâ€”the physical power exerted in Him is not only a pledge of the same physical power to be exerted in us, but a condition and assurance of a spiritual power already exerted in us, whereby we are in spirit risen with Christ, the physical resurrection being included and taken for granted in that other and greater one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Baptism is regarded as the burial of the old carnal life, to which the act of immersion symbolically corresponds; and in warm climates where immersion is safe, it is the mode most accordant with the significance of the ordinance."
2. "Faith in God's mighty operation in raising again Jesus, is saving faith; and it is wrought in the soul by His same 'mighty working' whereby He 'raised Jesus from the dead.'"
3. "His literal resurrection is the ground of the power put forth in our spiritual resurrection now, so it is a pledge of our literal resurrection hereafter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Buried with him in baptism."
2. "Ye are risen with him from the death of sin to the life of religion."
3. "The resurrection of Christ is often represented as the foundation of all our hopes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The raising is not the resurrection to eternal life at Christ's second coming, but the moral resurrection to a new life."
2. "This corresponds with the drift of the entire passage, with the figurative sense of buried."
3. "Not the faith which God works, but your faith in God's working: faith in God's energy as displayed in Christ's resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "He expressly declares that we obtain this by means of baptism, that it may be the more clearly apparent that there is no advantage from circumcision under the reign of Christ."
2. "By baptism, therefore, we are buried with Christ, because Christ does at the same time accomplish efficaciously that mortification, which he there represents, that the reality may be conjoined with the sign."
3. "He takes this, however, for granted, that, inasmuch as it is impossible that believers should be severed from their head, the same power of God, which shewed itself in Christ, is diffused among them all in common."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fellowship with Christ finds its sign and seal in the rite of baptism, which, as then administered, had its external resemblance to the burial and resurrection of Christ." 
2. "The baptism signified and sealed a fellowship with the resurrection of Christ."
3. "Only through faith in such a God as able and willing to raise us up spiritually can we partake in this new life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For all who in the rite of baptism are plunged under the water, thereby declare that they put faith in the expiatory death of Christ for the pardon of their past sins." 
2. "In the symbol of baptism the resurrection to new life in Christ is pictured with an allusion to Christ's own resurrection and to our final resurrection."
3. "God had power to raise Christ from the dead and he has power (energy) to give us new life in Christ by faith."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ having died for their sins, was laid in the grave, where he continued for a while, and then rose again; and as they were crucified with him, they were also buried with him, as their head and representative; and all their sins too, which he left behind him in the grave, signified by his grave clothes there."
2. "This shows now, that baptism was performed by dipping, or covering the whole body in water, for no other form of administration of baptism, as sprinkling, or pouring water on the face, can represent a burial, or be called one."
3. "That in baptism saints are risen with Christ, as well as in it buried with him: and this through the faith of the operation of God; that is, it is through faith that saints see themselves buried and risen with Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "The ancient manner of baptizing by immersion is as manifestly alluded to here, as the other manner of baptizing by sprinkling or pouring of water is." 
2. "But no stress is laid on the age of the baptized, or the manner of performing it, in one or the other; but only on our being risen with Christ, through the powerful operation of God in the soul."
3. "It does not appear, that in all this St. Paul speaks of justification at all, but of sanctification altogether."
