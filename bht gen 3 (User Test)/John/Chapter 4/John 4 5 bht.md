# John 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, weary from his travels, encountered the town of Sychar, also known as Shechem in the Old Testament. Sychar, situated between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, was possibly given this name as a derogatory term by the Jews. Instead of entering the city, Jesus stayed at a distance. Sychar, later called Nablous, was around thirty-four miles from Jerusalem. The word then indicates a logical connection, not a specific timeframe, and the term city here doesn't imply great significance or size. The name Sychar suggests a town associated with drunkenness or dishonesty.
