# Luke 17:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This story highlights Jesus' omniscience as He knew that all ten were cleansed. However, only one showed gratitude, revealing a lack of personal appreciation and love. Although they were physically healed, it remains uncertain if they received spiritual transformation. This emphasizes the prevalence of those who claim to be cleansed by Christ, yet the rarity of those who truly honor and glorify Him. Ingratitude is an all-too-common offense, while the acknowledgment of Christ's cleansing grace is scarce.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17, 18. Were there not ten
	cleansedâ€”rather, were not the ten cleansed? that is, the
	whole of themâ€”an example (by the way) of Christ's omniscience
	[BENGEL].


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The incident is prophetic of the reception accorded to Christ by the Jews and heathen respectively."
2. "Some gratitude they had, but the personal gratitude which takes the form of love they lacked."
3. "They had enough of faith to receive bodily healing, but it is left uncertain whether they received any spiritual benefit."

### John Gill:
1. "They are many, that are cleansed by the blood of Christ; his blood was shed for many, for the remission of sins; and by his righteousness, he justifies many; at least there are many who profess themselves to be cleansed by him, and yet there are but few that glorify him..."
2. "Christ's flock, which is separated from the world, and walks in Gospel order, within the inclosures of it, is but a little flock; they are but a few names in Sardis, who have not defiled themselves, with corruptions in doctrine and discipline..."
3. "Ingratitude is a crime many are guilty of, and it is highly resented by Christ; instances of gratitude are few, but as one in ten; now and then a single Samaritan, a stranger, one that has been a vile sinner, comes and acknowledges the grace of Christ in cleansing him..."

This serves as an example of Christ's omniscience in knowing who received healing. The incident also foreshadows the reception Christ would receive from the Jews and the Gentiles, with the Gentiles showing more gratitude. While the ten had enough faith to receive physical healing, it is uncertain if they received spiritual benefit.
