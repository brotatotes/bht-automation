1. "The voice is that of God the Father, as at Christ's baptism and transfiguration, so here in presenting Christ as our High Priest."
2. "The several churches are mutually independent as to external ceremonies and government (provided all things are done to edification, and schisms or needless separations are avoided), yet one in the unity of the Spirit and the Headship of Christ."
3. "The candlestick is not light, but the bearer of light, holding it forth to give light around. The light is the Lord's, not the Church's; from Him she receives it. She is to be a light-bearer to His glory."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To see the 'voice' here means to see the 'person' who spake."

2. "this light is put into the churches by Christ, whose the Gospel is, and who is himself come a light into the world"
3. "they are compared to 'golden' candlesticks, because of their excellency, preciousness, and value, in the esteem of Christ; and for their brightness and purity in doctrine, discipline, and life"
