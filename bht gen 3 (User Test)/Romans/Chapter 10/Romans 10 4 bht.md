- Attempt 1 BHT: Christ is the ultimate goal and fulfillment of the law. He encompasses everything that the law demands for the justification of both Jews and Gentiles. The law, represented by Christ, brings an end to itself, no longer holding legislative authority over believers. By holding onto the system of law, the Jews fail to attain the righteousness that comes by faith in Christ. Christ put an end to the law as a means of salvation, providing salvation for everyone who believes, regardless of their background. Through Christ, believers are justified and receive the forgiveness and eternal life that the law could not provide.
