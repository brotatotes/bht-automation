Paul's mention of their family implies that he had received this information not from direct communication with the Corinthians, but rather from his trusted sources. By referring to Chloe's family, Paul establishes that his allegation carries authority, while also avoiding naming specific individuals to prevent the stirring of unnecessary controversy. Paul's goal was to make it clear that such information should have come directly from the Corinthian leaders, who had previously consulted him on lesser matters. The Greek word used here means to make manifest, further underscoring the importance of bringing clarity to these contentions that were troubling the church. The name Chloe, meaning tender verdure, was associated with Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and rural life. It is evident that Paul had received reliable and comprehensive evidence from Chloe's family, proving that there were indeed contentions and divisions within the church, threatening to fracture their unity.",
