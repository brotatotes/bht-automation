This challenges the notion of the absolute omniscience of the inspired writers.

Stephanas' household is noted for being among the first converted in the area of Achaia, and it seems that his family justified Paul's personal attention regarding baptism. Paul's inclusion of this exceptional case does not diminish the significance of baptism but emphasizes that it is not essential for the remission of sin or forgiveness. While it is uncertain if Stephana's household included infants, their conversion, dedication to ministry, and adult status indicate the importance of their baptism.",
