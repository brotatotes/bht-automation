To the Jews, the cross was a stumbling block, seen as the death of a slave and not fitting the image of a temporal Messiah. However, for those with open minds, Christ is understood as the power and wisdom of God. Christians are united in their view of Christ as the power of God and should consider themselves part of the same family. The gospel is God's plan to put forth power and save individuals, and it effectively appeals to different elements of human nature. The stumbling block that hindered some from receiving Christ was not due to any fault on His part or the disposition of mankind, but rather the depravity of those not enlightened by God. However, to the elect from all nations, Christ is the power and wisdom of God, overcoming stumbling blocks and offering sure salvation.",
