            "Paul appears to recall a rabbinic tradition that there was a well formed out of the spring in Horeb, which gathered itself up into a rock like a swarm of bees, and followed the people for forty years; sometimes rolling itself, sometimes carried by Miriam, and always addressed by the elders, when they encamped, with the words, 'Spring up, O well!' Numbers 21:17.",

            "This 'meat' and 'drink' are called 'spiritual,' perhaps primarily, as having been supplied supernaturally, but mainly because under this merely outward and visible sustenance, by which the chosen people were enabled to pursue their way to the Promised Land, is couched the higher nutriment of God\u2019s true people which certainly is 'Christ' in their progress towards the 'better country.'\" ",
            "The question is as Neander pertinently asks whether the tradition is not itself of later date than our Epistle, and was not suggested by it. As to the actual matter of fact, all we know for certain is, that they had two miraculous supplies of water one, near the outset of their wilderness journey, at Horeb; the other, at Meribah Kadesh, near its close; and since without a supply of water all through they could not have subsisted for a week, and yet no such fatal want overtook them, one may well say that they had an unfailing supply, or that 'the Rock followed them.'",
            "The reader should observe how, five times in the course of these four opening verses, the word 'all' is ominously repeated, the more emphatically to make the sad contrast between the commencement and the close of the journey how all had a common start, and, almost to the end, all made common progress, and yet, as is now to be added, in the case of most of them, far from a common end."

            "He definitely states here in symbolic form the preexistence of Christ. But surely 'we must not disgrace Paul by making him say that the pre-incarnate Christ followed the march of Israel in the shape of a lump of rock.'"

            "And as those waters continued through the wilderness as a constant supply for them, so the grace of Christ is always sufficient for his people; a continual supply is afforded them; goodness and mercy follow them all the days of their lives.",
            "And the rock was Christ: that is, it signified Christ, it was a type of him. Christ may be compared to the rock for his outward meanness in his parentage and education, in his ministry and audience, in his life and death; and for his height also, being made higher than the kings of the earth, than the angels in heaven, and than the heavens themselves."
