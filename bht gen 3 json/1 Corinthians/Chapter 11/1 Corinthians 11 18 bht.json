These divisions are not just differences of opinion, but manifest in outward acts. This abuse of spiritual gifts and disorderliness in their assemblies has created schisms or factions within the church. The word church in this context does not refer to a physical building, but to a Christian assembly. The apostle partly believes the reports of these divisions, and he reproves the Corinthians for their animosities and factions, emphasizing the importance of unity and caring for one another. This reproof is not meant to accuse them all, but to address a specific behavior during the Lord's Supper. These divisions and factions are not isolated separations from the church, but rather uncharitable divisions within it. It is important for believers to have a tender care for one another and avoid any behavior that goes against this unity.",
