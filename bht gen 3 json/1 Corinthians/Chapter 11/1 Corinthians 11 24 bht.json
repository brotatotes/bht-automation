The term Eucharist refers to the Lord's Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for God's gifts, particularly the gift of Jesus Christ. The act of breaking the bread emphasizes distribution and refutes the Corinthian plan of each person having their own supper. Remembrance implies the future bodily absence of Christ and the opportunity for believers to reflect gratefully on His sacrificial love. The giving of thanks during the Eucharist echoes Christ's gratitude to the Father for the immeasurable mercy and redemption given to humanity. The bread being broken does not signify the breaking of Jesus' body, but rather the distribution of the elements. Ultimately, the Lord's Supper is a profound act of remembrance, where believers express gratitude for Christ's death and resurrection, and partake in communion with His body and the blessings it represents.",
