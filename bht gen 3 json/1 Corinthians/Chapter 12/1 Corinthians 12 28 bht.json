He mentions the first apostles, not limited to the Twelve, but including others who bore the same name and held equal power. The prophets were those gifted with the ability to expound and apply doctrine. The gift of divers kinds of tongues is placed last, denoting its lesser importance. Paul emphasizes that government and external affairs, though giving outward status, are ranked by the Spirit as lower functions. This list of gifts does not aim for completeness or systematic arrangement but acknowledges the diverse needs of the Church. The commentators also note that the list in this verse differs from the previous one, showing that supernatural gifts find their ordinary counterparts in the work of the Church. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize and embrace the variety of roles, gifts, and ministries within the Body of Christ for its effective functioning.\n",
