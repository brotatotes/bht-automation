The poverty in Jerusalem, intensified by the troubles they faced, required the assistance of the daughter churches, which was a remarkable display of love and care. Paul, who had previously persecuted many Christians, now took the lead in efforts to provide relief for their needs. By using the term saints instead of the poor, Paul emphasizes the importance of giving to fellow believers and sets an example for the Corinthians to follow. The collection was not imposed but rather voluntary and carried out cheerfully in all the churches. The word used for collection is derived from a verb that signifies collection for a god or temple. In prescribing this method of relief, Paul aims to remove any obstacles in carrying out this act of compassion. The Corinthians are called to join other churches in their obligation to assist the needy in Jerusalem, thus embodying the self-denial and liberality that were distinguishing virtues of early Christians.",
