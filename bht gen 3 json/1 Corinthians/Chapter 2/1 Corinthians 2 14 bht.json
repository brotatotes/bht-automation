            "He cannot know them (viz. the things of the Spirit, the matter of our spiritual teaching, itself furnished by the Spirit), because they are spiritually (by the spirit of a man exalted by the Spirit of God into its proper paramount office of judging and ruling, and inspired and enabled for that office) discerned."

            "Perhaps, also, the word 'know' here implies also the idea of 'loving,' or 'approving' of them, as it often does in the Scripture. Thus, to know the Lord often means to love him, to have a full, practical acquaintance with him.",
            "The passage here proves that while a man is thus sensual, the things of the Spirit will appear to him to be folly; it proves nothing about his ability, or his natural faculty, to see the excellency of these things, and to turn from his sin. It is the affirmation of a simple fact everywhere discernible, that the natural man does not perceive the beauty of these things; that while he remains in that state he cannot; and that if he is ever brought to perceive their beauty, it will be by the influence of the Holy Spirit."

            "There must be a natural visive discerning faculty, suited to the object; as there must be a natural visive faculty to see and discern natural things, so there must be a spiritual one, to see, discern, judge, and approve of spiritual things; and which only a spiritual, and not a natural man has."
