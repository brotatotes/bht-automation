This concept can be seen in Philippians 2:12-13, where believers are encouraged to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling because it is God who works in them. Paul's weakness encompasses not only physical limitations but also the infirmities resulting from persecution and personal anxieties. In Corinth, Paul intentionally avoided using clever and grandiose words, instead embracing a posture of diffidence and nervous self-effacement. This state of weakness and fear was a common feeling among effective preachers, as it demonstrates a genuine reliance on God and a deep concern for fulfilling their duty. Paul's trembling anxiety was not rooted in personal fear, but rather a conscientious desire to perform his calling with utmost care. This description of Paul's emotional state at Corinth is echoed in other passages like 2 Corinthians 7:15, Philippians 2:12, and Ephesians 6:5.",
