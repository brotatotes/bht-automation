They were treated as the refuse of the whole earth, compared to offal or refuse that is removed by thorough purification. In their ministry, they were defamed, slandered, and reviled. Yet, despite these harsh circumstances, Paul and the apostles did not respond with hostility. Rather, they entreated God on behalf of their defamers, seeking their repentance and forgiveness. This tremendous display of humility and grace speaks to the strength of their faith. Their experiences mirrored those who were treated as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, carrying the weight of curses, affronts, and injuries. The irony and severity of their suffering justified the allusions made to their vehemence.
