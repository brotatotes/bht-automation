Some speculate that the offense may have been one of a peculiarly heinous nature or that it was simply that the manner in which it was done was scandalous. Regardless, Paul, although physically absent, felt compelled to make a judgment in this matter and has already decided on the appropriate course of action. His decision, in the name of the Lord, is corrective rather than destructive, aimed at saving the soul of the offender. It is crucial to note that this discipline should be performed only in the name of the unseen yet ever-present Lord of the Church, Jesus Christ. This stands in stark contrast to the harsh excommunication practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Paul's desire is for the Corinthians to be mindful of the mode of excommunication and to cast out the incestuous individual in order to remove the stain from the community of believers.",
