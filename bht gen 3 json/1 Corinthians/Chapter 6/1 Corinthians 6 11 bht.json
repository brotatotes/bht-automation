They have undergone a spiritual washing in baptism, the sanctification of God's children, and the justification that comes through the name of the Lord Jesus and the working of the Spirit.

The order of these three varies, emphasizing the actual moral renewal that accompanies justification. This showcases the work of the Spirit, who is not merely concerned with forensic justification. It is crucial to acknowledge the magnitude of God's grace in rescuing us from such sins and to understand that all blessings flow from Christ through the Spirit.
