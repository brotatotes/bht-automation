The faith of even one Christian parent establishes a connection that allows the children to be affiliated with the Christian community. This understanding is further supported by the parallel between infant baptism and the supersession of infant circumcision. It is important to note that the verse does not imply moral holiness, but rather a connection to the Christian community. Therefore, if either the husband or wife is a believer and the other agrees to remain, the marriage is considered holy and divorce is not necessary. Ultimately, the sanctity of the parents extends to their children, ensuring that their birth is not deemed illegitimate.",
