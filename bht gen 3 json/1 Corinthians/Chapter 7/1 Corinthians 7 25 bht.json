It was quite possible for Paul to know this command of Jesus as he did other sayings of Jesus (Acts 20:35) even if he had as yet no access to a written gospel or had received no direct revelation on the subject from Jesus (1 Corinthians 11:23). Sayings of Jesus were passed on among the believers.\" ",

About mixed marriages (1 Corinthians 7:12-16) Paul had the command of Jesus concerning divorce to guide him. Here he has nothing from Jesus at all.
