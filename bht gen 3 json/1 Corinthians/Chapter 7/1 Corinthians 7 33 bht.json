            "Many a husband has thus been injured by a frivilous, thoughtless, and imprudent wife; and though that wife may be a Christian, yet her course may be such as shall greatly retard his growth in grace, and mar the beauty of his piety."

            "They have one eye directed to the Lord, but in such a way as to have the other directed to their wife; for marriage is like a burden, by which the mind of a pious man is weighed down, so that he does not move God-ward with so much alacrity.",
            "Let us always, however, bear in mind, that these evils do not belong to marriage, but proceed from the depravity of men.",
            "And the Apostle did not intend merely to condemn here those vices by which we contract guilt in the sight of God, but he desires in a general way, that we may be freed from all impediments, so as to be wholly at leisure for the service of God."

            "Generally speaking, persons in such a state are greatly involved in worldly cares, and have not that leisure, and those opportunities, that single persons have to attend religious exercises; wherefore the single state, on this account, is, in the apostle's opinion, the more preferable."

            "bht": "A married man, though he may have one eye directed towards the Lord, will inevitably have the other turned towards his wife because marriage burdens the mind of a pious man and hinders his eagerness to pursue God. This burden often leads to obstacles in their spiritual growth or the beauty of their piety. Yet, it is important to remember that these challenges do not arise from marriage itself but from the fallen nature of humanity. The apostle's intention here is to encourage believers to be free from all impediments, including the entanglements of marital obligations, in order to fully dedicate themselves to the service of God. Nonetheless, it should be noted that not every married person necessarily struggles with this, as there are those who diligently care for and provide for their families, pleasing both their spouse and God. However, in general, being married tends to involve more worldly cares and less leisure and opportunity for religious devotion than being single, hence why the apostle views singleness as preferable in this regard.",
