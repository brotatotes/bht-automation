            "bht": "The verse speaks of the division between married women and virgins, not just in their external circumstances, but also in their interests and concerns. The apostle Paul advises the Corinthians to be undistracted and fully devoted to the Lord, emphasizing that the unmarried woman and the virgin can give their undivided attention to the things of God, while the married woman is preoccupied with worldly matters and pleasing her husband. Unfortunately, in Paul's time and even today, there are unmarried women who are entangled in worldly pursuits. It is important to recognize that choosing a life of singleness can provide greater advantages for attending to matters of religion. This distinction is made to highlight the significance of a woman's change of condition when she enters into marriage. The married woman is more disposed to care for worldly concerns, whereas the unmarried woman has the opportunity to direct her cares and affections solely towards God. It is a reminder that true chastity extends beyond physical purity to encompass purity of mind and devotion to the Lord. Overall, the passage encourages us to carefully consider our worldly relations and strive to be undistracted in our pursuit of holiness.",
