The use of antithetical language underscores the contrast between the intangible treasures of the Spirit and the tangible nourishment of the flesh. The first-tier commentary suggests that the Corinthians owe a debt of gratitude to Paul, as he sowed precious spiritual gifts among them and has a legitimate claim to their material support. The second-tier commentary expands on this idea, highlighting the importance of allowing ministers to focus on their sacred duties and noting the societal benefits of supporting the gospel ministry. Through these insights, the verse underscores the significance of reciprocating material support for those who labor in the spiritual realm.",
