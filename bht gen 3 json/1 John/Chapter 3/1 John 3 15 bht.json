He emphasizes that whoever harbors hate in their heart toward their brother is akin to a murderer, for hatred wishes for the demise of the one hated. Thus, the Apostle asserts that whoever lacks love and harbors hate cannot have eternal life abiding within them. The contrast is striking between the sentiment expressed by the Apostle and the views held by the pagans of antiquity, who often regarded murder as either an unfortunate event or a mere prudential error. However, God sees beyond the external act and looks into the inward disposition, judging a person based on the condition of their heart.
