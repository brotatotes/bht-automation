The commentary emphasizes how Christ, despite being fully human, remained pure and unaffected by sin, making Him the perfect atoning Redeemer. In the same way that the blood of the paschal lamb brought redemption for Israel, it was through the blood of Christ that we are redeemed from sin. The preciousness of Christ's blood far surpasses any earthly value, emphasizing its immeasurable worth. The use of without blemish signifies the absence of physical defect, while without spot denotes moral purity. Through the blood of Christ, we have the full realization of what had been symbolized in the Old Testament sacrifices.",
