            "Their election is in virtue of this, in pursuance of this, or has this for its norm. The term foreknowledge is distinct at once from allied terms expressing the idea of predestinating or fore-ordaining, and from those expressing the purpose, good pleasure, or counsel of God. It is more, however, than mere foresight. It is not the Divine prescience of the reception to be given to the decree of salvation, as distinguished from that decree itself... It is a recognition which, resting eternally on its objects, embraces them as its own and cares for them as such.",
            "This points to the means by which, or rather to the sphere within which, the election is made good... [It] expresses neither the act nor the process of sanctifying, nor yet the ethical quality of holiness, but that state of separation or consecration into which God\u2019s Spirit brings God\u2019s elect.",
            "It will then have not the more limited sense of faith, but the larger sense in which the idea occurs again at 1 Peter 1:14, in which Paul also uses it in Romans 6:16, and which is expressed more specifically in such phrases as obedience to the faith, the obedience of faith, the obedience of Christ, obeying the truth."

            "which makes it more express, and the sense more clear: he means an enlarged view of interest in the love of God, an increase of grace out of the fulness of it in Christ, and of Gospel light, and of the several gifts of the Spirit"
