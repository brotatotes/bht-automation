            "This verse does not impose an obligation to bring forward a learned proof and logical defense of revelation. But as believers deny themselves, crucify the world, and brave persecution, they must be buoyed up by some strong 'hope'; men of the world, having no such hope themselves, are moved by curiosity to ask the secret of this hope; the believer must be ready to give an experimental account 'how this hope arose in him, what it contains, and on what it rests' [STEIGER].",
            "Be ready, but with 'meekness.' Not pertly and arrogantly. Fear\u2014due respect towards man, and reverence towards God, remembering His cause does not need man's hot temper to uphold it."

What it implies is neither on the one hand the reticence which fear or indifference may prompt, nor on the other the propensity to dispute about our hope, but a readiness to give an account of it, wherever it may be necessary or helpful to do so.",
