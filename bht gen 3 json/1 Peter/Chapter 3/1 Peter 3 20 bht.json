This trial might have shaken the confidence of those who were shut up, as it were, under the sentence of death.

It reminds readers that, despite the multitude of unbelievers, the godly should not be shaken in their faith. They should be diligent, like Noah, who built the ark in fear of God's judgment, and they should be patient, just as God's longsuffering waited for 120 years before the flood.
