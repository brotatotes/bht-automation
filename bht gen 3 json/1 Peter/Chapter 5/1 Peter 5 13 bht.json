Some commentators propose that the mention refers to a believing sister, possibly St. Peter's wife, who he led about as he spread the gospel. Others suggest that it may be a reference to the church residing in Babylon, which was seen as the center from which the dispersed Jewish-Christian community originated. The word Babylon can also be understood literally as the city or mystically as Rome, the figurative Babylon mentioned in the book of Revelation. The usage of the term in the Apocalypse, however, does not necessarily require a mystical interpretation here. This debate involves considerations of Peter's residence in Rome around 65 AD and the tradition of his martyrdom there. Ultimately, the translator's addition of church that is is not found in the original text, which allows for the possibility that Peter's greetings were intended on a personal level, potentially referring to Peter's wife or the evangelist Mark. Nevertheless, what is evident is Peter's desire for unity within the Church, reflected in his mention of Mark and Silas as well. In this, we are reminded of the importance of healing wounds, resolving differences, and embracing Christian charity for the glory of God.",
