Being before a blasphemer, and persecutor, and insulter... I had mercy shown me, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief, the apostle Paul writes gratefully, reflecting on his transformative journey from persecutor to minister. This passage reminds us to extend charity and understanding even to those who oppose or misunderstand us, for Paul's own conversion was a testament to God's grace and mercy. Paul recognizes that the merit of his faithfulness is solely due to God's grace, as he recounts how Christ counted him faithful and entrusted him with the important task of ministering to others. It is through God's power that true conversion and calling confer strength and enable faithful service in the ministry.",
