This order is not simply because of Adam's priority of existence but is supported by the circumstances of creation detailed in the book of Genesis. It is clear that the woman was created for the sake of the man and designed to occupy a subordinate role. The second-tier commentary underscores the importance of recognizing this order and not attempting to set it aside. The third-tier commentary further explains that the subjection of women to men is in line with the laws of nature and creation, existing even before the fall of humanity. Ultimately, it is evident that woman was originally created as the inferior to man.",
