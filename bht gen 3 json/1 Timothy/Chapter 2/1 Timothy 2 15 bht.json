            "What then is here promised her? Not only exemption from that curse in its worst and heaviest effects: not merely that she shall safely bear children: but the Apostle uses the words 'shall be saved' purposely for their higher meaning.",
            "Just as that man should be saved through, as passing through, fire which is his trial, his hindrance in his way, in spite of which he escapes,\u2014so she shall be saved, through, as passing through, her childbearing, which is her trial, her curse, her (not means of salvation, but) hindrance in the way of it."

            "This may be an ulterior reference of the Holy Spirit in this verse; but the primary reference required by the context is the one above given. 'She shall be saved ([though] with childbearing),' that is, though suffering her part of the primeval curse in childbearing; just as a man shall be saved, though having to bear his part, namely, the sweat of the brow."

            "It was necessary for him to state, and for her to know, that her place was secondary and subordinate, and he wished this truth ever to be kept in memory among Christians.",
            "Paul, then, would speak to her the language of consolation, and while he would have her occupy her proper place, he would have her feel that 'God was her Friend.'",
            "The object of the apostle seems to be to guard against a possible construction which might be put on his words, that he did not regard the woman as in circumstances as favorable for salvation as those of man, or as if he thought that salvation for her was more difficult, or perhaps that she could not be saved at all."

            "It is proper to observe that the good effect of this consolation is twofold. First, by the hope of salvation held out to them, they are prevented from falling into despair through alarm at the mention of their guilt. Secondly, they become accustomed to endure calmly and patiently the necessity of servitude, so as to submit willingly to their husbands, when they are informed that this kind of obedience is both profitable to themselves and acceptable to God.",
            "Even 'child-bearing' is obedience acceptable to God, only so far as it proceeds from faith and love. To these two he adds sanctification, which includes all the purity of life which becomes Christian women. Lastly follows sobriety, which he formerly mentioned, while he was speaking about dress; but now he extends it more widely to the other parts of life."

            "The meaning of the words is, that there is salvation through the incarnate Messiah, for all sorts of persons; for all men and women who believe in him, with that faith which works by love, and shows itself in holiness and sobriety; provided that they continue herein."
