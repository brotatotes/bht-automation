        "bht": "Paul endured immense suffering for his faith, facing beatings, stoning, and shipwrecks. These trials were not merely mentioned in passing, but they were experiences that deeply impacted him. The beatings with rods were a cruel and barbaric form of punishment, while the stoning he endured left him supposed to be dead. Despite facing multiple shipwrecks, including a treacherous night and day spent in the deep, Paul's steadfastness and resilience remained unwavering. His sufferings went beyond what was recorded in Luke's account, highlighting the extent of his hardships and the depth of his commitment to spreading the gospel.",
