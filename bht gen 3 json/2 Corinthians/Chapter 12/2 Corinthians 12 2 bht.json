He was not, therefore, a materialist, and he did not believe that the existence and consciousness of the soul was dependent on the body.",

He says that he knew a man in Christ who was caught up to the third heaven, whether in the body or out of the body, he was uncertain. The exact nature of this experience is difficult to comprehend, and Paul himself does not provide many details. What is clear, however, is that this vision was beyond anything he had ever experienced before. It was a moment of celestial exaltation, where Paul was granted a glimpse of the highest heaven, where God dwells. Despite the extraordinary nature of this encounter, Paul remains humble and unwilling to boast about it. He emphasizes that the glory and the weakness he experienced were not truly his own but bestowed upon him by God. Ultimately, this passage reminds us that our spiritual selves are our highest and truest selves, while our physical bodies are only temporary vessels.",
