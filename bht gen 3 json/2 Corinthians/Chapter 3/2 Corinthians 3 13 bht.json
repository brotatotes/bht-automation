The opposition is twofold: (1) between the vailed and the unvailed ministry, as regards the mere fact of concealment in the one case, and openness in the other: (2) between the ministry which was suspended by the vailing, that its end might not be seen, and that which proceeds from glory to glory, having no termination.",
