This treasure, referred to as the gospel, is a valuable and abundant source of rich truths. The vessel mentioned here is the human body, the outer shell that houses the soul. Despite its seeming insignificance, this vessel becomes the means through which God's power is magnified. Through the ministry of apostles and other humble servants, the brilliance of the treasure is revealed. It is in the very breaking of these vessels that the light of the gospel shines forth. This is a testament to the limitless power of God, who purposefully employs imperfect and ordinary individuals to carry His message. Such vessels may lack the appearance of excellence, but it is precisely because of their weakness that God's power becomes all the more evident. So, let us recognize that it is not our own abilities, but the divine treasure within us that brings forth the true power and glory of God.",
