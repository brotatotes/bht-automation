He emphasizes that our knowledge of others should not be based on their outward appearance or worldly distinctions, but rather on a spiritual understanding. Paul himself had once known Christ according to the flesh, relying on hearsay and external reports, but after his conversion, he no longer viewed Christ in the same way.
