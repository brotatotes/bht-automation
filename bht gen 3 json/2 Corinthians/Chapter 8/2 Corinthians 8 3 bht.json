They willingly gave of themselves, choosing to provide for others even though they themselves were in need. Their giving was not only according to their ability, but even beyond it. It is truly admirable how they strived to give so much, even when their means were limited. This level of selflessness and generosity reveals a heart that is larger than one's own possessions, a willingness to give unasked and demonstrate a truly generous disposition.",
