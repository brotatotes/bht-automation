He emphasizes their knowledge and diligence in all that is good, while commendably expressing his appreciation for their love and support towards the apostles and ministers. Paul encourages them to go beyond the Macedonians in their generosity and to let their exceptional faith, speech, and love lead to acts of benevolence. In doing so, he reminds them that their spiritual endowments should motivate them to surpass others in their selfless giving.",
