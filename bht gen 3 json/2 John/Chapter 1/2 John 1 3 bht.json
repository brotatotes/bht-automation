            "This phrase [in truth and love] is not to be connected with the expression 'the Son of the Father,' as if it meant that he was his Son 'in truth and love,' but is rather to be connected with the 'grace, mercy, and peace' referred to, as a prayer that they might be manifested to this family in promoting truth and love."

            "In the Divine mind, and in the order of our salvation as conceived therein, the mercy precedes the grace...Yet the righteousness of God, which it is quite as necessary should be maintained as His love, demands that the guilt should be done away before the misery can be assuaged; only the forgiven may be blessed."
