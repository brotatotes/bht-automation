These individuals have only barely escaped their previous filth and folly before becoming entangled in it again. In fact, they go so far as to seduce others who have also managed to escape from the error they once lived in. This proverb reveals the unchanging nature of these dogs and swine; they were dogs and swine before, and they will remain so. This passage reminds us that external reforms do not guarantee internal transformation, just as washing a swine does not prevent it from returning to its muddy state. However, we should not be discouraged because the foundation of God remains steadfast, and these examples do not prove that true Christians will fall away and perish.",
