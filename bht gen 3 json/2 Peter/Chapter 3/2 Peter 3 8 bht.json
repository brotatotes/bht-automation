His eternity exceeds all measures of time, and his patience excludes the impatience and haste that we feel. The day of judgment is at hand, but to God, a thousand years may be as a single day. We must not let this concept escape us. God's clock does not run by our timepieces, and the scoffers who mock His timing do so out of ignorance. Time may seem long to us, but it is a brief period for God, who has abundant time to accomplish His purposes. In His infinite duration, it makes no difference to God whether His plans are accomplished in one day or extended to one thousand years. Just as one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day, we must remember that waiting seems long because we fix our eyes on the brevity of this present life. However, when we meditate on the eternity of God's kingdom, many ages vanish away like moments. So, let us ascend in our minds to heaven, and time will no longer be a concept of long or short. Through all the postponements and delays of our hope, we can maintain our faith in God and His promises because His ways are superior to human reckonings of time.",
