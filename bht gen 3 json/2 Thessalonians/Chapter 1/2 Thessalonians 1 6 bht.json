It emphasizes that it is God's might, not that of the angels, that delivers this liberation. Just as the sun is reflected in a mirror, God's glory is reflected in those who believe in Him. God's judgment upon persecutors is confirmed as a recognized fact, and it is a righteous principle to recompense affliction to those who afflict others. The verse underscores the certainty of this principle, even though it is stated conditionally. It affirms the need for a future judgment to punish the wicked, as it is just and proper to do so. The concept of the law of retaliation is highlighted, indicating that the final judgment will be characterized by exactness in retribution. Resting in the expectation of a coming judgment, believers should not envy the temporary happiness of the wicked, for their destruction will be dreadful. This judgment is not a philosophical concept for the writer, but a belief rooted in personal experience. Ultimately, it is a righteous thing in the sight of God to transfer the tribulation from the troubled believers to those who trouble them.",
