The vengeance spoken of here is not personal vindictiveness, but the full application of divine justice. The ones who will face this judgment are not just those who are ignorantly unaware of God, but also those who have chosen to disregard Him, like Pharaoh who proudly proclaimed, I know not the Lord. This judgment extends to both the unbelieving Jews and all who do not obey the gospel. To know God is to know Him as the one true God, to understand His will, His holiness, His hatred of sin, and His desire to save humanity. The gospel calls us to obey its message, to accept its light, and to live in accordance with its teachings. So let us take heed and not be among those who remain in willful ignorance and rebellion, but rather embrace the truth of the gospel and walk in obedience to our Lord Jesus.",
