The change in tone may be due to the need for Timothy to stir up his faith and grace once again. Paul affectionately addresses Timothy as his genuine son, emphasizing the strong bond between them. This affectionate relationship is further confirmed by Paul's use of the term beloved, reflecting the same warmth and love found in their previous correspondence. Through this appellation, Paul not only expresses his love for Timothy but also garners respect and submission to him. Additionally, Paul's use of beloved signifies that he had regenerated Timothy in Christ, attributing this honor to ministers who are agents of God's regenerating work. Ultimately, Paul's love for Timothy is rooted in God's mercy, compassion, and the remarkable qualities Timothy possesses.",
