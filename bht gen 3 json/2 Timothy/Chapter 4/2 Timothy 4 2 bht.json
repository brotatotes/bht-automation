For fountains flow, even if no one draw from them: and rivers run, though no one drinks. So too the preacher ought, even if no one attend to him, to fulfil all his own duty...",
            "For there shall be a time when they (men, i.e. professing Christians, as the context shews) will not endure the healthy doctrine (viz. of the Gospel); but according to their own desires will heap up teachers, having itching ears; and shall avert their ears from the truth, and be turned aside to fables."
