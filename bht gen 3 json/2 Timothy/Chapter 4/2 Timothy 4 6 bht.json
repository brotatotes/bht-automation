The figure used by Paul in this verse is that of a sacrifice, with the pouring out of his life as a libation. This sacrificial language suggests that Paul's impending death is a culmination, the end that crowns his work. His departure, the dissolution of his life, is imminent, and it brings to mind the unloosening of a ship from its moorings or the breaking of camp. Yet, instead of fear, Paul views death as the freeing of the soul, the setting sail on an eternal voyage. In this view, death becomes a departure, a separation of the soul from the body, and a testimony to the immortality of the soul.
