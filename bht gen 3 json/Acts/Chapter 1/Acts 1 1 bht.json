            "Whatever latitude may be given to the word all, it must at all events serve to refute the notion that St. Luke had at this time seen the Gospels of Matthew or Mark, in which many things which Jesus did and taught are contained, which he had not related in his former treatise.\" ",
            "That meaning here seems to be, that the Gospel contained the beginnings, the outset, of all the doings and teachings of our Lord, as distinguished from this second treatise, which was to relate their sequel and results.",

            "To do - This refers to his miracles and his acts of benevolence, including all that he did for man\u2019s salvation. It probably includes, therefore, his sufferings, death, and resurrection, as a part of what he has done to save people."

            "The history of the Church was under the immediate control of the exalted Redeemer, and may justly be considered as the continuation in heaven of the work which he had begun on earth.",
            "Thus the history which follows is linked to, or (may I not rather say) welded with, the past; and the founding of the Church in the earth is presented as one continuous work, begun by the Lord in person, and perfected by the same Lord through the ministry of men."

            "The first words of the Acts give us the key to the understanding of the object and purpose for which this book was written... The writer of these Acts commences his memoirs of the early Christian Church by sharply distinguishing between the work of Jesus among men when He was in the form of a man upon earth, and the work of the same Jesus from His glory throne in heaven after He has been taken up.",
            "These opening words with which St. Luke commences the \u2018Acts\u2019 throw light upon the whole book. They at once remove the first impression which leads men to view the Acts of the Apostles as detached memoirs, or a recital deeply interesting containing inspired utterances, but on the whole as disconnected, without any set defined purpose."

It distinguishes between the work of Jesus during his earthly ministry and his work from heaven after his ascension.

This narrative serves as a model for future ministers and the church, and its preservation was deemed crucial for the proof and understanding of the Christian faith. Ultimately, Acts is not just about the acts of the apostles, but also about the ongoing acts of Jesus himself through their ministry.",
