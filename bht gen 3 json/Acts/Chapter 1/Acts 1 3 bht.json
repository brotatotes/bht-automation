These appearances were not solely to demonstrate his humanity by eating and drinking with them, but also to emphasize the continuation of his divine purpose and work on earth. Through these encounters, Jesus spoke about the kingdom of God, a concept that initially perplexed his disciples, who still held onto their notions of a political Messianic kingdom. Nevertheless, the disciples, including Paul, were convinced of the Resurrection after personally experiencing these infallible proofs presented by Jesus. It is crucial for us to grasp the significance of Christ's resurrection, as it forms the foundation of our faith, attests to his role as the Son of God, and brings to light essential teachings about the state of humanity, sin, salvation, righteousness, and eternal life.",
