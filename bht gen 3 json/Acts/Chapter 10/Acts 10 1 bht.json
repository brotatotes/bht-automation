Caesarea, a Roman city named after Caesar Augustus, was a predominantly Gentile city, although it also had a significant Jewish population. Cornelius was a centurion of the Italian band, a cohort of Italian soldiers stationed in Caesarea, possibly serving as a bodyguard to the Roman procurator. It is worth noting that these Roman centurions often appeared in a favorable light in the New Testament. Despite being a Gentile and a soldier, Cornelius demonstrated remarkable devotion to God, personal integrity, and kindness towards others. His virtues are even more commendable considering the corrupt nature of the soldier's life at that time. Cornelius's story in Caesarea anticipates the later association of the apostle Paul with the Roman army and highlights the providential plan to reveal the mystery of the reception and inclusion of the Gentiles on equal terms with the Jews.",
