These individuals were likely jealous of the acceptance and embrace of the apostles, which indicated that Peter, as the leader of the apostles, was not viewed as a pope or overlord with supreme authority. This incident highlights that the early Christians did not recognize Peter's supposed superiority and did not submit to his decisions as the Roman Catholics claim. The journey mentioned in the verse was significant and debated, implying that if Peter truly had infallible authority, such a controversy would not have arisen. The issue stemmed from these zealous circumcision advocates who not only made circumcision a condition for church fellowship but also for normal social interactions. Their stubbornness indicates the common association of error with obstinacy.",
