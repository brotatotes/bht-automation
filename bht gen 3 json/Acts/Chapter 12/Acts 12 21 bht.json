Despite the impious flattery from the people who exclaimed that his voice was that of a god, Herod did not reject or rebuke them. However, shortly after, he noticed an owl over his head, which he interpreted as a presage of mischief. The first-tier commentary highlights that Herod was dressed in royal apparel, specifically a robe made entirely of silver. He was seated in an elevated seat in the theater, where he addressed the crowd. The second-tier commentary reinforces the description of his attire and the adoration of the people who thought he was divine. It concludes with the angel of the Lord smiting Herod for not giving God the glory.",
