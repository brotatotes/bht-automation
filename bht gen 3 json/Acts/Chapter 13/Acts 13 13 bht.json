The reason for John's departure is not explicitly given, but it is suggested that his withdrawal could be attributed to weariness or fear of the dangers they were facing. This departure caused a rift between Paul and Barnabas, with Paul refusing to have John accompany them again. Nevertheless, Paul and Barnabas remained steadfast in their commitment to the work. In this situation, Barnabas exemplified his greatness by accepting a secondary position to Paul. The significance of the cities mentioned, Paphos and Perga, in this verse provides geographical context to the narrative. Overall, this verse showcases the challenges and complexities encountered in the early spread of the Gospel.",
