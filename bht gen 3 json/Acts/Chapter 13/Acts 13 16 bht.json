Firstly, Paul recapitulates the ancient deliverances of God's people and His mercies towards them, emphasizing the ultimate mercy of sending the promised Son of David. Secondly, Paul seizes the opportunity to reach out to the Gentiles present, highlighting the key points of his theology and the growth of his Christology. He strategically begins by demonstrating his firm belief in the Scriptures and gradually leads the Jews and proselytes to acknowledge Christ as the Captain and Governor of their faith. The term men of Israel refers to the Jews and proselytes worshiping together, while those that fear God refers to Gentile natives and converts. Paul meticulously addresses both groups to distinguish true children of Abraham from those who boast falsely, urging everyone, whether Jews or proselytes, to listen attentively to his words.",
