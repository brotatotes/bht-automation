However, their admiration quickly turned into intense rage. The arrival of enemies from other cities seeking to thwart Paul's success only fueled the fire. It is intriguing how swiftly popular favor can change, especially when it comes to matters of faith. The stoning of Paul was not an isolated event, but rather a result of the instigation by the Jews and the fickle multitudes who were easily convinced to turn against him. This incident brings to mind the scars mentioned in Galatians 6:17, which might have been inflicted during such trials and sufferings. Ultimately, it is a reminder of the profound opposition faced by those who seek to spread the gospel, as wicked people often show more fervor in opposing it than professed Christians do in advancing it.",
