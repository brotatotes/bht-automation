            "It shows great resolution, courage, and strength of mind, to go into the same city again, where he had been so ill used; though he did not choose to continue there, nor were the inhabitants worthy of such a favor."

        "John Wesley": [
            "That he should be able to do this, just after he had been left for dead, was a miracle little less than a resurrection from the dead.",

            "The witnesses first threw as large a stone as they could lift, with all possible violence upon his head, which alone was sufficient to dash the skull in pieces. All the people then joined, as long as any motion or token of life remained."
