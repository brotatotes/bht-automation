That blood was thus drank by the pagans, particularly by the Sabians, in their sacrifices, is fully proved by Spencer, De Leg., p. 377-380 But the prohibition specifies a higher reason, that the life is in the blood, and that therefore it should not be eaten."

This refers to the things that have been offered to idols, which caused much controversy in the early church. There are different interpretations of what this entails: some suggest it refers to eating food offered to idols, while others believe it involves the participation in immoral acts at idol temples. Regardless, the moral abomination of such practices is not up for debate, as it is clearly condemned in other parts of the Bible. The reason for this command is to prevent Gentile converts from appearing partially attached to idolatry in the eyes of the Jews. It is important to note that idolatry, fornication, and murder were the prominent sins of paganism at that time. The prohibition against consuming blood is also mentioned, emphasizing that blood is the carrier of infections and toxins. It is interesting to consider how this directive might relate to certain tribes in Africa, who consume blood in their pagan culture and suffer from its harmful effects. Ultimately, the restrictions mentioned by James pertain to the moral code that applies universally to all believers.",
