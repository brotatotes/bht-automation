Philippi was a Roman colony, established by Augustus to commemorate his victory over Brutus and Cassius. As a colony, it functioned as a portion of Rome itself in the provinces, with its own senate and magistrates. Only the descendants of the original colonists by Roman wives or women with Roman citizenship held Roman citizenship. Philippi was strategically located on the Egnatian Way, a major Roman road linking the east and west. It was a leading city in the region of Macedonia and known for its historical significance, including the battle between Augustus and Antony against Brutus and Cassius. By understanding these details, we gain a deeper appreciation of how the Apostle Paul's visit to Philippi was situated within the larger historical and political landscape of the time.",
