Paul's grief stemmed from seeing the woman's distressing condition and being thoroughly disturbed by the evil spirit's continued manifestations. He wanted no testimony from such a source, just as he rejected the adoration of the people in Lystra. Similar to Jesus, Paul made a clear distinction between the demon and the individual.
