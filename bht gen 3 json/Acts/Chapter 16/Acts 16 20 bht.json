Knowing that the Romans held favor towards their name, the accusers cleverly presented the Christians as a threat to Roman interests. The Romans had little affinity for the Jews, viewing them with disdain and suspicion. However, there was some truth in the accusations as the Gospel, with its principle of Godly fear as the driving force behind human action, challenged the godless and revolutionary nature of the world. The response of the magistrates in Philippi, who called themselves strathgoi to appear more honorable, reveals their lack of distinction between Christians and Jews. This lack of recognition contributed to the contemptuous treatment of the Christians, who were seen as troublemakers by the Philippians. Overall, the accusation against the Christians not only aimed to injure their reputation but also showcased the extent of resistance that the Gospel faced in its revolutionary mission.",
