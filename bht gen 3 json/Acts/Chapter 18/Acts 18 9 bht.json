This assurance comes from a divine vision in which the Lord reassures him that no harm will come his way. It seems that Paul's success in his ministry was stirring up the hatred of the unbelieving Jews, and he was well aware of the potentially severe consequences. Yet, every pastor can relate to moments of fear and doubt. In particular, Paul may have felt intimidated by the sophisticated and influential Corinthians he was called to address. However, God met him in his fears and reminded him of the certainty of His presence. The vision that Paul experienced, similar to previous encounters, served as a powerful reminder that the Spirit's miraculous power was working in him. In a time when Paul's life was in danger, he could have contemplated leaving or hiding, but instead, he was encouraged to openly and fearlessly preach the Gospel. This exhortation reminds us all not to let the fear of men hinder us in faithfully proclaiming God's truth for the edification and growth of His Church.",
