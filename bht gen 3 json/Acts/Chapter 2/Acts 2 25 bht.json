For although I do not stand nor contend about the words, yet must we respect the etymology. Therefore, forasmuch as the grave is called \u05e9\u05d7\u05ea, (shachat) because it doth corrupt man\u2019s body with rottenness, it is not to be doubted but that David meant to note that quality. Therefore, the place is not so much expressed by this word, as the condition of rotting.",
