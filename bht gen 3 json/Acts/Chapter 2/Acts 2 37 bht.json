            "The word translated were 'pricked,' katenugesan, is not used elsewhere in the New Testament. It properly denotes 'to pierce or penetrate with a needle, lancet, or sharp instrument'; and then 'to pierce with grief, or acute pain of any kind.' It corresponds precisely to our word 'compunction.' It implies also the idea of sudden as well as acute grief. In this case it means that they were suddenly and deeply affected with anguish and alarm at what Peter had said.",
            "The views which sinners have of Christians and Christian ministers are greatly changed when they are under conviction for sin. Before that they may deride and oppose them; then, they are glad to be taught by the obscurest Christian, and even cling to a minister of the gospel as if he could save them by his own power.",
            "Never was a more important question asked than this. It is the question which all convicted sinners ask. It implies an apprehension of danger, a sense of guilt, and a readiness to 'yield the will' to the claims of God... The state of mind in this case - the case of a convicted sinner - consists in: (3) An earnest wish, amounting sometimes to agony, to be delivered from this sense of condemnation and this apprehension of the future. (4) A readiness to sacrifice all to the will of God; to surrender the governing purpose of the mind, and to do what he requires. In this state the soul is prepared to receive the offers of eternal life; and when the sinner comes to this, the offers of mercy meet his case, and he yields himself to the Lord Jesus, and finds peace."
