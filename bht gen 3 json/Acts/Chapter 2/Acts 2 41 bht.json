The 3,000 who responded were likely a mix of sincere converts and pilgrims, whose understanding of the faith may have varied. The baptism itself was likely done through sprinkling or pouring, as immersion may not have been practical for such a large group. In this initial effusion of the Holy Spirit, the focus was not on dogmas or doctrines, but rather on the disposition and willingness to obey. The message of repentance, baptism, remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Spirit was received with great joy and gladness. We see here the power of the gospel to rapidly transform hearts and the importance of embracing the doctrine of salvation through Christ.
