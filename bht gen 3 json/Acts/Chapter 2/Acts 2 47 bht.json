However, it is clear that those who became members of the church were sincere Christians and continued to adorn their profession, earning the respect of the world. The Lord kept adding to the church daily, not just those who joined, but those who were being saved from time to time, indicating a continuous revival. The Greek word for saved in this context refers to those who were escaping the evil of the world and seeking refuge in the Church.
