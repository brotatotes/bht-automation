The early interpretation of the term elders as synonymous with bishops can be seen as a way for interested parties to cloud the scriptural understanding of church leadership. The identity of presbyters and bishops in the New Testament is beyond dispute, and Paul's address to the elders in Ephesus reveals his intimate connection with them, akin to Jesus' farewell discourse to his disciples. The distance between Paul and the Ephesian church, about thirty miles, adds a sense of finality to his heartfelt message. The distinction between apostles, elders, and deacons is evident, as elders are referred to as bishops elsewhere in Scripture. Understanding the historical context and the development of the early church helps to shed light on the significance of this passage.",
