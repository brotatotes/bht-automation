With the expectation of never seeing them again, Paul likely based this on his plan to journey to the west after visiting Rome, where he may face imprisonment and other dangers. While this is not a definite prediction, it is what Paul anticipated under his unique circumstances. The emphasis on I signifies his personal knowledge, possibly through special revelations. This parting with the elders is a tender and affecting separation for both minister and people. Though apostles did not always possess Divine and unerring knowledge, in this instance, it seems Paul may have been mistaken in his expectation.
