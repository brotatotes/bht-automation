Their tears were a testament to their sincere love for this holy man, who had been adorned with numerous gifts from the Lord. The chief cause of their weeping was the realization that they would no longer see him, understanding the immense loss they and all the churches in Asia had suffered. In their tears, the Spirit commended their genuine devotion, rebuking those who demanded unyielding constancy from the faithful. This emotional farewell highlights the fact that Christianity does not wipe away natural affections, but rather guides and governs them. Kissing as a sign of affection and parting was a common custom among Eastern nations. The deep affection displayed by the believers towards Paul is reminiscent of the embrace between Esau and Jacob, Joseph and his family, and the many examples of tears shed by both righteous and worldly individuals throughout history.",
