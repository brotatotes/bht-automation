This act was not for the sake of appeasing his opponents or the Judaizers, but rather to demonstrate his adherence to the customs and authority of the Jewish-Christian mother Church. Paul's actions were not driven by a belief that he was bound by the law, but rather to satisfy weak minds and remove their prejudices, ultimately aiming to gain their favor and be of service to them. It is important to note that Paul's obedience to the law does not undermine his teachings against legalistic practices and his opposition to using the law as a means of salvation. By humbling himself and honoring the customs of the fathers, Paul depicted the early Church as it was, faults and all, providing a realistic portrayal of the believers of that time.",
