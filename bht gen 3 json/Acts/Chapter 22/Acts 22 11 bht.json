The first-tier commentary draws our attention to the parallel with Acts 9:8, where Paul mentions his inability to see. Furthermore, the commentary notes that the cause of his blindness is not explicitly stated in Acts 9, but here in Acts 22, Paul explains that it was for the glory of that light. This second-tier commentary emphasizes Paul's perspective as one who was both present and the chief actor in the event, providing a reason for his blindness. The third-tier commentary vividly describes the overpowering brightness of the light, which left Paul unable to see. Through this encounter, Paul was humbled and ultimately transformed, leading him to seek guidance on how to serve Christ.",
