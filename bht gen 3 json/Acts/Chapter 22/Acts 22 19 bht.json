Paul pleads with God to allow him to work in Jerusalem among his own people, appealing to the fact that his former staunchness as a Pharisee should make the Jews more receptive to his message.

This exchange exposes the stubbornness and pride of the Jews and highlights the difficulty of breaking through their unbelief. It becomes clear that Paul's expectation of their acceptance, based on his own conversion, is futile in the face of their hardened hearts.",
