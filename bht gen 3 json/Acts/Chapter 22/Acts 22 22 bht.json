The Jews, proud of their identity and standing, could not fathom the possibility that the long-awaited Messiah would command someone to leave their own people and devote themselves solely to the uncircumcised Gentiles. The mention of this word was like a spark in a powder magazine, setting off an explosion of pent-up indignation. The Jews deemed Paul unworthy to live for daring to say such things, for these words shook the foundation of their world.",
