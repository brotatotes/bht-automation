His accusers, the Asiatic Jews, were absent during the alleged offense, making their accusations unreliable. It is clear that their absence indicates their lack of willingness to undergo a strict examination. Paul argues that the proper witnesses, who were present in the temple, should have been there to testify. These witnesses, who could have shed light on the matter, were likely foreign pilgrims from Ephesus. Their absence weakens the accusations brought against Paul. This passage not only demonstrates Paul's ability to counter unfounded allegations but also exposes the world's tendency to persecute the children of God without just cause.",
