Despite the terror he felt, Felix did not allow himself to be transformed by the righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come that Paul spoke of. Paul did not shy away from expounding the faith in Christ Jesus and appealing to Felix's conscience. He seized every opportunity to defend the truth and save souls, even when faced with princes, governors, kings, or common people. Paul's words were not merely about doctrine, but about life and the need for righteousness. He preached the necessity of a righteousness that could justify before God, emphasizing that human works alone are insufficient. This encounter serves as a warning against rejecting the offers of mercy and resisting the Spirit of God, as well as a reminder to seize the moment to respond to the gospel message.",
