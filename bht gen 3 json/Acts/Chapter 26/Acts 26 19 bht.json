This proclamation serves to conclude his narration of the numerous persecutions and deliverances he has experienced. Through his testimony, Paul not only affirms his unwavering trust in the commands and communications he received from Christ but also highlights the elevated realm of thoughts and emotions he entered while recounting these divine encounters. It is noteworthy that Paul's obedience was not hesitant or unbelieving; rather, he willingly and promptly surrendered to the heavenly vision, recognizing the clarity and authority of this supernatural encounter. As we reflect on Paul's resolute obedience, we are reminded of the importance of recognizing and embracing the promptings of the Spirit, for divine grace is never irresistible, and it is possible for us to quench the last promptings of the Lord.",
