He describes how he went from being a persecutor of Christians to a faithful messenger of the crucified Christ, fervently delivering His message to both Jews and Gentiles. The gravity of Paul's testimony is reflected in his choice of words, particularly when he mentions how the Jews caught him in the temple and tried to kill him. This intense opposition underscores the importance of the message Paul was proclaiming, as it revealed that in the kingdom of Christ, there would be no distinction between Jews and Gentiles. The profound significance of Jesus' death and resurrection, which brings righteousness and life to all, is a central theme in Paul's discourse. Despite the dangers and hardships he faced, Paul remained steadfast in his mission, knowing that it was God who had helped him and guided him on this transformative journey.",
