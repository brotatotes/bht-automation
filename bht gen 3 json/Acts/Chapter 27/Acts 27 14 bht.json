This tempestuous wind, resembling a whirlwind or hurricane, caused the sea to be ploughed and the waves to be lifted. The ship was driven away from the island of Crete, and the force of the wind dashed the ship against the waves, resulting in chaos and danger. This sudden and violent storm serves as a reminder of how quickly circumstances can change and the need to be prepared for unexpected challenges.",
