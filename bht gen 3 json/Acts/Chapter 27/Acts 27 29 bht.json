Uncertain of their ship's stability and fearing they may crash against rocky shores, they cast four anchors from the stern, an unusual but necessary action to secure the vessel. As they anxiously wished for daybreak, they not only longed for daylight to assess their situation accurately but also to escape the desperate attempts of some crew members to save their own lives by taking to the boat. The use of anchors, typically cast from the bow, highlights the gravity of the storm, and the fervent prayers for daybreak reveal their deep longing for rescue before the anchors broke or started to drag under the strain of the raging tempest. This episode serves as a vivid reminder of the imminent danger they faced and their unwavering trust in God's deliverance.",
