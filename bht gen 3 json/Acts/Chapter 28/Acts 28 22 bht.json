The purpose of the Acts is not to chronicle Paul's work among established churches, but to emphasize his fulfillment of the command to preach the Gospel first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles. Therefore, it is only natural for him to assemble and speak to the Jews upon his arrival in Rome. The Jews in Rome express a seemingly unbiased desire to hear Paul's thoughts, perhaps out of a prudent wish to prevent the conflicts that led to the expulsion of Jews under Claudius. This demonstrates that the line between Jew and Christian was now clearly drawn everywhere, but the Jews still considered it fair to hear Paul's side of the story. The Christian religion has faced opposition from both Jews and Gentiles, with rumors and false accusations spread against its followers throughout the Roman Empire. Despite such opposition, the Gospel is not a human invention or heresy, but a divine revelation that establishes and upholds the fundamental articles of true religion. The fact that Christianity is widely spoken against is not evidence of a bad cause, but rather a likely indication of a good one.",
