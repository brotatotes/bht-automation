As they watched him without any harm befalling him, their opinion of him changed drastically. Initially, their fear turned to awe, believing that Paul was a god. This startling transformation in their perception highlights the power and impact of the Gospel, particularly on the unrefined and uneducated. The medical language used by Luke, such as swollen and looked, emphasizes the seriousness and expectation of a fatal outcome by the onlookers. However, despite their prolonged wait for Paul's condition to worsen, he remained unharmed, leading them to reconsider their assumption that he was a deity. This incident reminds us of the tendency for people to fall into superstitions and idolatry when they are ungrateful towards God and fail to acknowledge His works.",
