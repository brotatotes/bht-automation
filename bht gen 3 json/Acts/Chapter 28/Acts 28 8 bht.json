The healing of the sick, particularly Publius who suffered from fever and dysentery, is highlighted as an action of Paul's faith, not a charm of his own. This miracle served as a fitting response to Publius's hospitality and an opportunity for Paul to show gratitude by bringing healing to the people of Malta. As Luke mentions, the laying of hands on the sick and their recovery is a remarkable occurrence shortly after Paul's encounter with the venomous snake. This demonstrates how the apostles, like Peter in Acts 9:40, exercised their miraculous power in conjunction with prayer and faith. Ultimately, this event serves as a reminder for all to give thanks to the ministers of God's grace while keeping the glory for God alone.",
