The title Prince of life may allude to the miraculous healing this man experienced, which caused their rulers to become hostile towards Jesus. The power of miracles demonstrates the limited abilities of man and highlights Jesus as the true source of healing and life. It is emphasized that the believers were merely agents of Jesus, and the credit for the man's healing belonged solely to Him. Furthermore, the phrase desired to be granted refers to the favor and grace that the people sought for Barabbas, contrasting with the malicious rejection of Jesus. The denial of the Holy and Just One, even after confirming His innocence, compounded their guilt. This verse ultimately reveals the purity and innocence of Christ in contrast to the wickedness of those who rejected Him.",
