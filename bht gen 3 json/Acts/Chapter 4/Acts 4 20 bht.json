Their defiance, justified by the interference of the temple authorities between conscience and God, shows a courage that resonates with martyrs throughout history. The early martyrs defended the principle that individuals have a direct responsibility to God for their religious opinions, free from the control of others. The spread of the Bible, with its precepts favorable to freedom, is seen as the best way to promote universal liberty. The disciples' insistence on speaking about what they have seen and heard is not only an act of fidelity and integrity, but also a recognition of the divine command to preach the gospel. Their unwavering commitment stems from a moral impossibility to remain silent, regardless of the potential consequences.",
