They observe the alarming unity of Herod, Pilate, the Gentiles, and the people of Israel against the Messiah. This confederacy, described by David's spirit, causes astonishment as he questions the motives behind their deadly combination. The psalm refers to the city where they gather, which likely corresponds to the holy hill of Zion. The disciples understand that the opposition Jesus faced was part of God's plan, foreseen and foretold. They seek God's protection, knowing that He is on their side as they continue to fight under the kingdom of Christ.
