This significant growth in believers serves as a powerful testament to the work of the Holy Spirit and the truth of the gospel. Furthermore, despite the present danger and discouragement, the faithful are not swayed but continue to boldly embrace the cross of Christ. The wicked may rage against God's children, but they cannot prevail, as God continues to advance His kingdom.
