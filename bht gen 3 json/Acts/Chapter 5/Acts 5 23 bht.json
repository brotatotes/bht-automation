The miraculous escape of the prisoners is an opposite outcome to the usual circumstances, analogous to the miraculous draughts of fishes. Similar to John 21:11, where the nets were filled with an abundance of fish, this event serves as clear evidence of divine intervention and protection, as the prison was securely locked when the guards arrived, but the prisoners were gone upon entering. Overall, this verse portrays a powerful demonstration of God's ability to defy earthly restraints.",
