Those poor who could attend for themselves and represent their case, were served: but the widows, who required more searching out at their own houses, were overlooked.",

The Jews of Palestine would pride themselves much on the fact that they dwelt in the land of the patriarchs and the land of promise... On the other hand, the Jews from other parts of the world would be suspicious, jealous, and envious of their brethren.",

The Hellenists were Greek-speaking Jews who came from different regions, while the Hebrews were Jews born in Palestine who held their native language in high regard. This division caused murmuring and complaints, particularly because the widows of the Hellenists were being overlooked in the daily distribution of resources. The underlying issue stemmed from the longstanding tension between the Jews who adhered more strictly to Hebrew customs and those who had adopted broader Greek views. However, it is important to note that this disturbance did not undermine the unity and love that characterized the early Church as a whole. Rather, it served as an opportunity for the apostles to address and rectify an oversight, ultimately leading to the appointment of deacons to ensure that all the widows, both Hebrew and Hellenist, would be cared for equally. This incident serves as a reminder that even in the early stages of the Church, there were challenges to be faced and improvements to be made, but through the guidance of the apostles and the wisdom of God, unity and justice were restored.",
