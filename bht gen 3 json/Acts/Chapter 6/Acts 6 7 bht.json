In response, the apostles decided to appoint new office-bearers to help with the growing needs of the Church. The apostles implemented a simple yet effective solution, which involved choosing the new leaders from among the minority who were complaining. This decision demonstrated the apostles' wisdom and reason, highlighting that they didn't immediately establish a formal organizational structure for the Church. Instead, they relied on the Spirit's guidance and responded to the needs as they arose. The appointment of new leaders allowed the apostles to focus on their primary role of preaching and teaching the gospel, resulting in the continued growth of the Church. The community of believers, including a significant number of priests who were once enemies of the gospel, obediently embraced the faith, further expanding the impact of the Word of God.
