However, the first-tier commentators suggest that this may have been a mistake on Stephen's part, as Jacob was actually buried in the cave of Macpelah. Another possibility is that Stephen only meant to refer to our fathers without including Jacob. Nevertheless, the presence of Jacob in this context can be reconciled by substituting Jacob for Abraham, which clarifies the matter. Regardless, it is clear that the bones of Joseph and the other patriarchs who died in Egypt were indeed taken and buried in Shechem.
