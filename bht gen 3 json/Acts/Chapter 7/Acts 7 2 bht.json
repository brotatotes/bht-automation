It is important to recognize that this divine call is not explicitly mentioned in Genesis, but it is implied in other biblical passages and is acknowledged by Jewish writers. This call demonstrates the magnificent and fundamental nature of God's manifestations, characterized by the glory of absolutely free grace.

By using the term the God of glory, Stephen honors God and defends against accusations of blasphemy, emphasizing that this is the God whose visible symbol was known by every child of Israel.
