This act of defending the oppressed and avenging the wrong is commendable. Moses, in the heat of his anger, went beyond what he had initially intended, symbolizing the heroism and courage bestowed upon him by the Holy Spirit. It is worth noting that this incident was well-known and widely recognized. Moses' action of burying the Egyptian in the sand, though understood metaphorically by some as hiding him among the vast number of the Israelite people, can also be seen as a physical act to conceal the body. Ultimately, Moses' act of defending the oppressed foreshadows his future role as the deliverer of the Israelites.",
