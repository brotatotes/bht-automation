Stephen skillfully uses this reference to argue that Moses predicted the coming of the Messiah, and by rejecting Jesus, the Pharisees were opposing Moses himself. The mention of a prophet like Moses serves to remind the audience of the promise of the Messiah, their obligation to hear and obey Him, and their rejection of their own Lawgiver. Stephen's words reflect his faith in the fulfillment of the promise and his unwavering reverence for Moses.
