This example teaches us to be careful to follow God's rule and to seek His guidance, for when we turn aside even a little from His path, we can easily be led into error and trapped in various superstitions. Idolatry is a fertile ground for errors to multiply, and when God's face is turned away from us, we run into grave mistakes.
