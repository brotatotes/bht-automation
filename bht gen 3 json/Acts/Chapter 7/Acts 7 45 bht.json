However, it is important to note that even the magnificent temple in Jerusalem was not the ultimate dwelling place of God on earth, as some believed. Joshua, whose name means Savior, played a significant role in this process, taking over from Moses and pushing out the Jebusites. While Stephen tactfully refers to Joshua as Jesus to allude to the One who would truly save, he wisely avoids mentioning Jesus of Nazareth explicitly to prevent the immediate backlash from his audience. Stephen's silence spoke volumes, conveying the divine eloquence that he possessed. This account underscores God's faithfulness in dwelling among the Israelites, despite their distance and expulsion from the land He had given them. The stability of God's kingdom is exemplified by the resting of the ark, an event that deeply resonated with David and led him to actively seek a place for the Lord. Joshua, a type of Jesus Christ, brought the Israelites to victory by relying on God's power. Overall, this passage illuminates the intricate historical and spiritual connections between the people of Israel, the land of Canaan, and the presence of God.",
