Stephen stressed the continual resistance of the Holy Ghost that permeated Israel's story, ultimately leading to the betrayal and murder of the Just One, Jesus himself. His words revealed the deep-rooted spiritual deafness and grossness of heart displayed by the Jews, challenging them to repentance.",
