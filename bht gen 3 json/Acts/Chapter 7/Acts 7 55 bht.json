            "Stephen, under accusation of blaspheming the earthly temple, is granted a sight of the heavenly temple; being cited before the Sadducee High Priest, who believed neither angel nor spirit, he is vouchsafed a vision of the heavenly HIGH PRIEST, standing and ministering at the Throne, amidst the angels and just men made perfect."

            "As the sight was witnessed by Stephen alone, the opened heavens are to be viewed as revealed to his bright beaming spirit.",
            "Clearly, to express the eager interest with which He watched from the skies the scene in that council chamber, and the full tide of His Spirit which He was at that moment engaged in pouring into the heart of His heroical witness, till it beamed in radiance from his very countenance."

            "It was such an elevation of view - such a representation of truth and of the glory of God, as to be denoted by the word 'see'; though it is not to be maintained that Stephen really saw the Saviour with the bodily eye."

            "Whence we must gather a general comfort, that God will be no less present with us, if, forsaking the world, all our senses strive to come to him; not that he appeareth unto us by any external vision, as he did to Stephen, but he will so reveal himself unto us within, that we may indeed feel his presence."
