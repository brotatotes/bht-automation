The expression in the name signifies that this act was done with full recognition and submission to the authority and presence of the Lord Jesus. The laying on of hands by the apostles was a special privilege and responsibility, as it was connected to the impartation of the Holy Spirit. This passage shows that the apostles were uniquely empowered to administer this gift, while the bishops inherited the responsibility of laying hands on the baptized. It is through the Holy Spirit that baptism carries its true efficacy and washing power, as it symbolizes the blood of Christ and is performed in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
