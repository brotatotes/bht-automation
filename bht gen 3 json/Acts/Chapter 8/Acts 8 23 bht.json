Their condition is both awful and captive, as they are held in the bond of iniquity. This bitterness is compared to the poison of serpents, highlighting its ruinous and poisonous nature. The sin that they are in is not only unpleasant but also represents bondage and captivity. Peter perceives the state of this person and doubts the possibility of forgiveness, not because he doubts God's willingness to pardon penitent sinners, but because the person has not yet shown true sorrow and heaviness for their sin. Ultimately, this verse highlights the importance of recognizing the depth of our sin and turning wholeheartedly to God for forgiveness.",
