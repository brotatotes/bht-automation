Despite not needing to learn from them, Saul's time with the disciples served as a period of regaining strength and forming relationships within the fellowship of believers. Once strengthened, Saul was ready to embark on his mission, which would include preaching and teaching in various places. It is worth noting that after these initial days in Damascus, Saul would later spend time in Arabia before returning to Damascus and eventually heading to Jerusalem. This period of solitude and meditation was perhaps a necessary step for Saul, allowing him to reflect on his conversion and prepare himself for the significant task ahead.",
