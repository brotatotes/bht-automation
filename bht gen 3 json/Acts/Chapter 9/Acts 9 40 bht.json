It is, indeed, a specially interesting episode this visit of Peter to Joppa, for it is the first and earliest mention of the noble work left by the Redeemer to be done by Christian women."

Like Jesus, Peter puts everyone out of the room before approaching the lifeless body of Tabitha. His act of kneeling down and praying demonstrates both humility and fervent faith. Just as Jesus spoke to the dead, Peter speaks to the lifeless body, showing the boldness that the Spirit of God prompted in him. With astonishing faith, Tabitha is raised back to life, causing great surprise and rejoicing, especially among the women who had been influenced by her and who quietly exercised their roles as fellow-workers for Jesus.
