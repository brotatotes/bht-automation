'Beside the ages of the world, the generations of men living in them are brought into special prominence, and thus the concealment from the beginning of human history is marked' (Braune).",
            "But now it hath been made manifest. 'Now,' in this present dispensation, it was made manifest. The tense points to the single past act, but our English idiom requires 'hath been.' In Ephesians 3:5 the contrast is one of degree; here it is absolute. Moreover the change of construction (not indicated in the E. V.) sharpens the contrast. Since 'made manifest' is more general than 'revealed,' or, 'made known,' it is properly referred to the entire historical manifestation, which took place in different ways, partly by revelation, partly by preaching and exposition, and partly by all combined (Meyer). This is favored by the mention of Paul\u2019s preaching (Colossians 1:28)."
