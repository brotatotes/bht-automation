He emphasizes that they were once dead in their sinful nature, separated from God. However, through Christ, they have been spiritually revived and forgiven of all their transgressions. The act of being forgiven is simultaneous with the process of being quickened, or made alive, spiritually. This forgiveness is not a piecemeal process, but a complete and universal act that covers all sins, past, present, and future. Their original sinful nature, represented by the uncircumcision of their flesh, has been transformed through Christ's work.
