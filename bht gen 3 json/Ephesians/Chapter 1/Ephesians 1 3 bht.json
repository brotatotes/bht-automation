            "They who perceive in themselves discoveries of the Divine goodness, so full and absolutely perfect, and who make them the subject of earnest meditation, will never embrace new doctrines, by which the very grace which they feel so powerfully in themselves is thrown into the shade.",
            "The design of the apostle, therefore, in asserting the riches of divine grace toward the Ephesians, was to protect them against having their faith shaken by the false apostles, as if their calling were doubtful, or salvation were to be sought in some other way.",
            "The word bless is here used in more than one sense, as referring to God, and as referring to men... Paul therefore blesses God, because he hath blessed us, that is, hath enriched us with all blessing and grace."
