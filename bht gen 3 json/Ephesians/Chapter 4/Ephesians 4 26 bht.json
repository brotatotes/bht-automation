            "He speaks of anger which is an infirmity, but by being cherished, may become a sin.",
            "Let the sun not set upon your irritation... set to your wrath with a brother a speedy limit, and indeed that one which nature prescribes\u2014the solemn season when you part from that brother, to meet again perhaps in eternity."

        "Albert Barnes": [
            "Anger is a passion too common to need any description. It is an excitement or agitation of mind, of more or less violence, produced by the reception of a real or supposed injury, and attended commonly with a desire or purpose of revenge.",
            "Anger may be excited against a 'thing' as well as a 'person;' as well against an act as a 'man.' We are suddenly excited by a wrong 'thing,' without any malignancy against the 'man;' we may wish to rebuke or chide 'that,' without injuring 'him.'",
            "Do not let it overleap its proper bounds; do not cherish it; do not let it remain in your bosom even to the setting of the sun. Though the sun be sinking in the west, let not the passion linger in the bosom, but let his last rays find you always peaceful and calm."

        "Philip Schaff": [
            "Be angry and sin not... Wrath, for this is the proper force, is not only allowable, but in certain cases commanded, yet in no case should sin be joined with it.",
            "There is no necessity for supposing that all wrath is sinful. Sinless wrath is like the wrath of God, and needs no excuse; but our wrath is rarely like God\u2019s.",
