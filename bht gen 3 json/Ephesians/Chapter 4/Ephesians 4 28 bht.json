They must actively pursue a life that is completely opposite to it. For instance, if someone was known for stealing, they should not only refrain from stealing, but they should strive to become hardworking individuals and contribute to society in a positive way. Christians, in particular, should use their honest labor to not only provide for themselves but to also help those in need. This verse teaches us that stealing is never acceptable, even if someone is facing unemployment. Instead, individuals should focus on honest industry and acquiring the means to be of greater usefulness to others. Laziness is considered a form of dishonesty, and manual labor is honorable and dignified. By diligently working and generating income, individuals can support their own lives and, at the same time, be able to give generously to those who are in need.",
