Fornication, impurity, and covetousness are mentioned as sins that should not even be named or talked about within the community of saints.

They emphasize that these sins are debasing and unbecoming of those who are set apart for God. The severity of these sins is highlighted by the comparison of the covetous man to idolaters and the warning that the public estimation of covetousness may come to match that of other gross vices. Overall, the verse calls believers to distance themselves from any hint of immorality and to uphold a standard of holiness that reflects their identity as saints.",
