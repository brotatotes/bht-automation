            "The \"girdle, or sash,\" was always with the ancients an important part of their dress, in war as well as in peace... The \"girdle\" seems sometimes to have been a cincture of iron or steel, and designed to keep every part of the armor in its place, and to gird the soldier on every side.",
            "Truth preserves a man from those lax views of morals, of duty and of religion, which leave him exposed to every assault. It makes the soul sincere, firm, constant, and always on its guard.",
            "The breast-plate defended the vital parts of the body; and the idea here may be that the integrity of life, and righteousness of character, is as necessary to defend us from the assaults of Satan, as the coat of mail was to preserve the heart from the arrows of an enemy."

It refers to the state of heart answering to God\u2019s truth, the agreement of our convictions with what God has revealed.",

But righteousness from Him is both imputed and inwrought; He both justifies and sanctifies His people."
