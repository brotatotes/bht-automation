The first-tier commentary brings out the severity of the author's actions, stating that they were not merely attempting to destroy the church, but were actually succeeding in laying it waste. This extreme enmity towards Christianity is presented as evidence of the divine intervention that led to their conversion. The commentary also highlights the contrast between their former manner of life and the teachings of the Gospel. The second-tier commentary reinforces the idea that no human teaching or instruction could have produced such a transformation, emphasizing the need for divine intervention. Overall, this verse and its commentary showcase the remarkable change that occurred in the author's life through their encounter with Christianity.",
