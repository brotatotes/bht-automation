However, Paul's transformation came when he encountered the Christian tradition and began teaching it to others. Paul's zeal for the Jewish religion was admirable, but it was not based on true knowledge. It is important to note that Jesus himself opposed the Jewish traditions, emphasizing the significance of relying on the Bible rather than ecclesiastical traditions.",
