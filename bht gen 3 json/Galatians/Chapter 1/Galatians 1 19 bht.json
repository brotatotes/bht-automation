James, the Lord's brother, is referred to as an apostle in this verse, signaling his prominence and authority within the early church. Some argue that this James was not one of the twelve apostles, but rather an apostle in a wider sense, similar to Barnabas. The term brother could mean a near kinsman, like a cousin or kinsman. However, it is more likely that brother refers to a son of Joseph and Mary, making James the younger step-brother of Jesus. This understanding opposes the Roman church's belief in the perpetual virginity of Mary and Joseph.
