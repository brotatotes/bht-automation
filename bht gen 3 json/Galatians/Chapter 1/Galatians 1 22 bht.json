He was still unknown during his time in Syria and Cilicia and even in the province of Judea, aside from Jerusalem where he had previously persecuted the church. This lack of familiarity extended to his face, as he had once scattered the church in that region before revisiting them. He had not received instruction from the apostles nor was he indebted to the Christians in Judea for his knowledge of the Christian faith. The churches in Judea had only heard about him, yet they glorified God for the transformative change in Paul. This highlights the discrepancy between their response of praise and the skepticism of those who had witnessed the remarkable fruits of Paul's labor.",
