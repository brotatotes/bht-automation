            "In seeking for a reference for this expression, y e would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me, the right course will be, not at once to adopt the conclusion, that they point to ocular weakness on the part of the Apostle,\u2014nor, because they form a trite proverb (signifying any great extent of self-sacrifice for another) in many languages, therefore to set down at once that no such allusion to a personal infirmity can have been intended, but to judge from the words themselves, and our information from other sources, whether such an allusion is likely.",
            "The inference then of any ocular disease from these words themselves seems to me precarious. Certainly Acts xxiii. 1 ff. receives light from such a supposition: but with our very small knowledge on the subject, many conjectures may be hazarded with some show of support from Scripture, while none of them has enough foundation to mike it probable on the whole."
