We must approach them with humility, recognizing our own vulnerabilities to temptation, and should seek to bring them back on track in a kind and compassionate manner. Like setting a dislocated bone, the process of restoring a fallen brother or sister requires a gentle touch and a heart filled with love and understanding.",

            "Meekness\" is that temper of spirit towards God whereby we accept His dealings without disputing; then, towards men, whereby we endure meekly their provocations, and do not withdraw ourselves from the burdens which their sins impose upon us."

That design will never be accomplished by violence, or by a disposition to accuse, or by fierceness of manner or language; and consequently, we must display a gentle and meek spirit, if we intend to heal our brother.\" ",
            "Another argument for gentleness in correcting brethren is contained in the expression, \u201cif a man be overtaken. \u201d If he has been carried away through want of consideration, or through the cunning arts of a deceiver, it would be cruel to treat such a man with harshness.",
