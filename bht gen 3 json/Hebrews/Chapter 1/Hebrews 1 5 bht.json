            "The triumph of David over Hadadezer and neighboring kings is a type of God's ultimately subduing all enemies under His Son, whom He sets on His 'holy hill of Zion,' as King of the Jews and of the whole earth.",

            "He is treated and addressed as a Son. In his original existence this was so. In his incarnation this was so. When on earth this was so; and in his resurrection, ascension, and session at the right hand of God, he was treated in all respects 'as a Son' - as superior to all servants, and to all ministering spirits.",
            "The promise, therefore, which is here made is, that God would be to him, in a special sense, a Father, and he should be a Son. It does not, as I suppose, pertain originally exclusively to the Messiah, but included him as a descendant of David. To him it would be applicable in an eminent sense.",
            "That in this series of promises the 'Messiah' was included as a descendant of David, was the common opinion of the Jews, of the early Christians, and has been of the great body of interpreters."

            "The sacraments, though in themselves lifeless, are yet honored with titles which angels cannot claim without being guilty of sacrilege. It is hence evident that the argument derived from the term Son, is well grounded.",
            "Christ doubtless is the eternal Son of God, for he is wisdom, born before time; but this has no connection with this passage, in which respect is had to men, by whom Christ was acknowledged to be the Son of God after the Father had manifested him."

            "The fact is, the word Son describes His relation to the Father, both personal and official; and \u2018I have begotten thee\u2019 applies to every state to which the word \u2018Son\u2019 applies His original nature, His incarnation, and His kingship."
