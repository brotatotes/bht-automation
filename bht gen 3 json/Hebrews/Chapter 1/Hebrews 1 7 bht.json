            "Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: and the rod (i. e. sceptre: see especially Esth. iv. 11; Amos i. 5, where the same Hebrew word occurs) of thy kingdom is the rod of straightness (i. e. righteousness, justice).",
            "Thou lovedst (the Writer refers the words to the whole life of our Lord on earth, as a past period) righteousness, and hatedst iniquity; for this cause (because of His love of righteousness and hatred of iniquity, shewn by his blameless life and perfect obedience on earth) God (some render this first, 'O God,' but apparently without necessity), thy God, anointed thee (how? and when? We must distinguish this anointing from what is said in Acts x. 38, 'God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit, and with power,' and the anointing of Isa. lxi. 1. For it is a consequent upon the righteous course of the Son of God in his Humanity, and therefore belongs to his triumph, in which He is exalted above his fellows [see below]. Again, the 'oil of gladness' below seems rather to point to a festive and triumphant, than to an inaugurative unction. We should therefore rather take the allusion to be, as in Ps. xxiii. 5; xcii. 10, to the custom of anointing guests at feasts: so that, as the King in the Psalm is anointed with the oil of rejoicing above his fellows, because of his having loved righteousness and hated iniquity, so Christ, in the jubilant celebration of His finished course at his exaltation in heaven, is anointed with the festive oil above His fellows [see below]."
