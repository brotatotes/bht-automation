This quotation serves as evidence that no further sacrifices for sins are necessary. The repetition of this testimony by multiple sources only strengthens the argument. The verse also highlights the difference between the new covenant and the old, ultimately rendering the old covenant obsolete. The testimonies presented provide divine confirmation of the authority and origination of the Old Testament scriptures. This passage underscores the uniqueness and efficacy of Christ's sacrifice, rendering all other expiatory sacrifices unnecessary.
