The language used portrays a raging anger marked by fire, symbolizing the imminent punishment that awaits them. These adversaries, who are in direct opposition to God and rejected their place among the faithful, are considered enemies of Christ. This expectation of judgment is not just a mental state, but a certain reception of the already reserved and terrifying punishment. The wicked dread this future judgment, experiencing the torment of an evil conscience and the intolerable nature of their impending penalty.",
