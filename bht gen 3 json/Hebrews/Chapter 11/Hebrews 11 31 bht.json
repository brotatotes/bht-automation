            "Rahab showed her 'faith' in her confession, Joshua 2:9; Joshua 2:11, 'I know that Jehovah hath given you the land; Jehovah your God, is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.'\" ",
            "Her former life adds to the marvel of her repentance, faith, and preservation.\" ",
            "Thus Paul, quoting the same examples...for the power of faith, as James does for justification by works evidentially, shows that in maintaining justification by faith alone, he means not a dead faith, but 'faith which worketh by love'."

        "Albert Barnes": [
            "The usual and the fair meaning of the word is what is given in our translation, and there is no good reason why that signification should not be retained here... It is not implied by the use of the word here, however, that Rahab was an harlot at the time to which the apostle refers; but the meaning is, that this had been her character, so that it was proper to designate her by this appellation.",
            "This case - supposing that she had been a woman of bad character, but now was truly converted - does not stand alone. Other females of a similar character have been converted, and have subsequently led lives of piety... This record, therefore, is one of encouragement for the most abandoned sinners; and one too which shows that strangers, even in a public house, may do good to those who have wandered far from God and virtue, and that we should never despair of saving the most abandoned of our race.",
            "That she was not perfect is true. That she did some things which cannot be vindicated is true also - and who does not? But admitting all that may be said about any imperfection in her character, (compare Joshua 2:4), it was still true that she had strong faith - and that is all that the apostle commends."

            "He has hitherto shown that the Patriarchs, whom the Jews most honored and venerated, did nothing worthy of praise except through faith; and that all the benefits conferred on us by God, even the most remarkable, have been the fruits of the same faith: but he now teaches us, that an alien woman, not only of a humble condition among her own people, but also a harlot, had been adopted into the body of the Church through faith.",
            "It hence follows, that those who are most exalted, are of no account before God, unless they have faith; and that, on the other hand, those who are hardly allowed a place among the profane and the reprobate, are by faith introduced into the company of angels.",
