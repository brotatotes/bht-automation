Not one of them ever expressed regret that he had given up the world; or that he had obeyed the Lord too early, too faithfully, or too long.",

Whatever pleasure, gain, or splendid prospects we gave up in order to become Christians, we shall feel that it was the way of wisdom, and shall rejoice that we were able to do it."
