            "This verse is altogether made up of words derived from the games... And this being so, who can help referring this cloud of witnesses which surrounds us to the scene in the games which is depicted, and regarding them as lookers on while our race is run?",
            "The best note on the whole idea and imagery is that of Schlichting: 'He introduces us as it were into an immense theatre, where a vast crowd of spectators has assembled... Now as of old such a multitude of spectators added courage to the combatants, and was a great stimulus to use every effort for victory: so to us also, so many witnesses, who also themselves have toiled in the same conflict, ought to add alacrity, and cause us to run with all our force the race which we have begun.'",
            "And he calls them witnesses, not only in a figure, allusive to the spectators of a contest... but, and much more, because they witness concerning God and His goodness and justice, and all as with one mouth declare that God is, and is a rewarder of those who seek Him: that with Him, as the Chief Lord of the games, there is laid up a prize for earnest contenders: that He is true in His promises; that even after death He can render those happy who for His sake have given their lives."

It cannot be fairly inferred from this that he means to say that all those ancient worthies were actually looking at the conduct of Christians, and saw their conflicts. It is a figurative representation, such as is common, and means that we ought to act as if they were in sight, and cheered us on.",

'The easily besetting sin.' There are a dozen possible renderings of this double compound verbal from \u03b5\u03c5, well, and \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc, to place around or to stand around (intransitive). Probably this is the true idea here, 'the easily encompassing (or surrounding) sin.' In this case apostasy from Christ was that sin. In our cases it may be some other sin."
