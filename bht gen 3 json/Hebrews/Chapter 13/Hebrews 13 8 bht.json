            "He who yesterday (proverbial for the past time) suffered and died, is to-day in glory. As night comes between yesterday and to-day, and yet night itself is swallowed up by yesterday and to-day, so the 'suffering' did not so interrupt the glory of Jesus Christ which was of yesterday, and that which is to-day, as not to continue to be the same.",
