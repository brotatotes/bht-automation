In fact, this ceremonial system failed to yield any lasting benefit and it is sheer folly to abandon Christ for Pharisaism or Moses. Instead, the heart should be firmly established with the grace of Christ, which is the true spiritual sustenance and the means of all grace. Only in the atmosphere of God's grace can the heart find stability and a true experience of salvation. As second-tier commentators explain, it is better to have the heart established in the grace of God than to be preoccupied with unimportant religious matters. The simplicity of Gospel truths and their alignment with Gospel rites are essential for holiness and spiritual growth. Therefore, it is important to steer clear of any strange doctrines and constantly pursue the one true faith in Christ to have a stable and established heart.",
