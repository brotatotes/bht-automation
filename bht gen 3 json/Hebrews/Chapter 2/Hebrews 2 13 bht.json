Both had delivered a solemn message to people; both had come to exhort them to turn to God, and to put their trust in him and both with the same result.",

            "He treats the two parts of the passage separately, emphasizing in the first part Messiah's trust in God in common with his human brethren, and inserting ejgw I into the LXX text in order to call special attention to the speaker as Messiah.",

Nay, there is no danger that our trust should be useless when we have it in common with Christ; who, we know, cannot be mistaken.",
            "See then how this passage may be fitly applied to Christ: the Apostle concludes, that we are one with him, because he unites us to himself, when he presents himself and us together to God the Father: for they form but one body who obey God under the same rule of faith.",
            "Let not therefore the impiety of almost all ranks, ages, and nations, disturb us, provided Christ gathers together his own, who have been committed to his protection. If the reprobate rush headlong to death by their impiety, in this way the plants which God has not planted are rooted up. Let us at the same time know that his own are known to him, and that the salvation of them all is sealed by him, so that not one of them shall be lost. Let us be satisfied with this seal."

            "And this is a citation pertinent to the purpose, showing that Christ and his people are one, and that they are brethren; for he must be man, since, as God, he could not be said to trust; and he must be a man of sorrows and distress, to stand in need of trusting in God.\" ",
