This exaltation of humanity can be seen in the fact that God appointed man as His vicegerent over the works of His hands, allowing him to exercise dominion over the earth. The Psalmist marvels at this, recognizing the immense privilege and dignity bestowed upon mankind. The fulfillment of this divine purpose is ultimately realized in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who, through His incarnation, became a little lower than the angels, sharing in our humanity. Through His suffering, death, and resurrection, Jesus triumphed over the angels, now ruling over them. Hence, the Psalmist's words not only celebrate the exaltation of humanity but also foreshadow the supreme glorification of Christ.",
