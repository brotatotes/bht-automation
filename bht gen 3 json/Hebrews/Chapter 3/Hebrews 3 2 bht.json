            "The likeness of Moses to Messiah was foretold by Moses himself (Deuteronomy 18:15). Other prophets only explained Moses, who was in this respect superior to them; but Christ was like Moses, yet superior."

            "For we say of Christ, that as he is clothed with our flesh, he is the Father\u2019s minister to execute his commands.",
