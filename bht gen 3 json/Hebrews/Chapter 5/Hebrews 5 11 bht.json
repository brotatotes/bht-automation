The discussion of Christ being a priest after the order of Melchizedek, while of great importance, does not resonate with them as it should. The writer acknowledges the abundance of discourse that they have to share, but their message is hindered by the spiritual dullness of the audience. The listeners have become sluggish, slow in comprehension, and inattentive. This dulness of hearing may stem from various reasons such as afflictions, attachment to the law of Moses, indocility, lack of industry, pride, prejudice, irreverence towards the word of God, or preoccupation with material possessions and worldly cares. Despite these challenges, it is important to delve into the abstruse and difficult aspects of Scripture to deepen our understanding and increase our knowledge. The writer desires to communicate the profound truths of Christ, but the audience's slothfulness and dulness hinder their ability to grasp these truths.",
