            "Christ was a Son: as a Son, He was ever obedient, and ever in union with His Father\u2019s will: but His special obedience, that course of submission by which He became perfected as our High Priest, was gone through in Time, and matter of acquirement for Him, and practice, by suffering.",
            "In the words, all them that obey Him, there is probably an allusion to 'His obedience' above. As he obeyed the Father, so must we obey Him, if we would be brought to that 'eternal salvation' into which he has led the way."

            "His tears are also once named at least (Luke 19:41), and seem implied in such passages as Matthew 26:38; Matthew 27:46. The very agony of the final struggle has its prelude at an earlier stage (John 12:27), and was not without its parallel even in the wilderness.",
            "And God heard Him, not by delivering Him from the necessity of dying, not even by raising Him from the dead, but by strengthening Him to bear all (Luke 22:43), and by making the pangs of death the birth-throes of an endless life for him, and for all who were to believe."
