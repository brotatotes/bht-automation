There is, however, no reason that we should be here overcurious, so as to seek in every nail and minute things some sublime mystery...",
            "Secondly, we are here taught that all those modes of worship are false and spurious, which men allow themselves by their own wit to invent, and beyond God's command... Thirdly, let us hence learn that there are no true symbols of religion but those which conform to what Christ requires."
