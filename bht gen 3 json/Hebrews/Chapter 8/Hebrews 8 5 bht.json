The earthly tabernacle, meticulously constructed to reflect the heavenly model shown to Moses, symbolized the spiritual, heavenly sanctuary. This earthly tabernacle served as a vague representation, a sketch or outline, devoid of the splendid colors and living graces found in the true worship of God. Therefore, true worship should conform to what Christ requires and should be in accordance with a divine rule.
