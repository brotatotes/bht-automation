The first-tier commentaries explain that the old covenant was broken by the Israelites who did not abide in it, and therefore, God disregarded them. It is noted that the law served as a picture of the Gospel and had a delegated virtue from it. The commentaries also highlight that God took the Israelites by the hand to support and guide them, but they did not continue in the covenant, resulting in its annulment. God's disregard for them signifies that their adoption as His people was of no value unless He provided a new remedy. Through these insights, we see the contrast between the old and new covenants and the importance of obedience and faithfulness.",
