But He from eternity, with His divine and everlasting Spirit, concurred with the Father's will of redemption by Him.",
            "The eternity and infinitude of His divine Spirit gives eternal and infinite merit to His offering, so that not even the infinite justice of God has any exception to take against it.",
            "The unrenewed cannot serve God in spiritual communion. Man's works before justification, however lifelike they look, are dead, and cannot therefore be accepted before the living God."

            "If the blood of an animal had any efficacy at all, even in removing ceremonial pollutions, how much more is it reasonable to suppose may be effected by the blood of the Son of God!",
            "The only thing, therefore, which ever disturbs the conscience, and makes death dreadful, and God an object of aversion, and eternity awful, is guilt.",

            "This is Christ's own declaration, John 12:32. 'I will draw all men unto me.' Therein consists its potency for men: not in Christ's satisfaction of justice by suffering a legal penalty, but in that the cross is the supreme expression of a divine spirit of love, truth, mercy, brotherhood, faith, ministry, unselfishness, holiness.",
            "The effect of Christ's sacrifice upon the conscience transmits itself to the works, and fills them with the living energy of the eternal spirit. It changes the character of works by purging them of the element of death."

            "Christ is a priest, and the sacrifice he has offend up is 'himself'; not his divine nature, but his human nature, soul and body, as in union with his divine person; which gives his sacrifice the preference to all others.",
            "The end and use of such purgation is, 'to serve the living God'; so called to distinguish him from the idols of the Gentiles, and in opposition to dead works; and because he has life in himself, essentially and independently, and is the author and giver of life to others."
