The commentators discussed the multiple meanings of the word diathek\u00e9, which can refer to a testament, will, or covenant. They emphasized that, in this context, the focus was on a testament in which the death of the testator is necessary for fulfillment. Christ, as the institutor of the testament, needed to die representatively. However, it is important to note that this requirement does not apply to God's relation to Christ. The inheritance received through Christ's death and resurrection is eternal and enduring, making His people heirs as well.
