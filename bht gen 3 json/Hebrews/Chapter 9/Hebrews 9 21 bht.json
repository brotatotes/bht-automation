While Exodus only mentions Moses anointing the tabernacle and its contents, inspiration adds the sprinkling of blood to this account. This act of sprinkling with blood was also mentioned in Leviticus, pointing to the annual cleansing rites on the day of atonement. The tabernacle and its contents were in need of purification, which is done in a similar manner with blood. This emphasizes the significance of blood for cleansing, as seen in Leviticus 17:11. Ultimately, this highlights the typological connection between the tabernacle and the church, which is purified and cleansed by the blood of Christ. Without this blood, there is no access to the presence of God.",
