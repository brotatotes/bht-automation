This cleansing is accomplished through the sprinkling of blood, which brings about remission and purification. The heavenly sanctuary, just like the earthly tabernacle, was in need of purification, and the atoning blood of Christ achieved this. His atonement not only purified the heavenly sanctuary, but also cast Satan out of heaven and reconciled God's wrath against man into a smile of reconciliation. In comparing Christ's one sacrifice with the Levitical many sacrifices, Paul highlights the matchless excellency and manifold effects of Christ's atonement. The heavenly sanctuary required a better purification than the Levitical, as it had been defiled by the sins of men. By shedding His blood, Christ purified the heavenly things, removing the element of disorder and allowing us to attain perfect fellowship with God. The copies of the earthly tabernacle are purified in the same way as the heavenly realities. Christ's sacrifice, through its infinite value, made the heavenly things accessible to the guiltiest. The death of the testator was necessary for this purification, as it required a blood that corresponded with the excellency of the heavenly pattern. Ultimately, the verse emphasizes the need for better sacrifices, such as the sacrifice made by the offering of Jesus on the cross, which surpasses all other offerings and brings forgiveness and freedom to the guiltiest.",
