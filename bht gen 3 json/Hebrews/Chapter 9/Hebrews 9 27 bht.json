This verse highlights the correlation between the experiences of humanity and the role of Christ as the representative man. It signifies the parallel between Christ's first coming to die for us and His second coming to fulfill our salvation. The immediate state after death is depicted as a time of expectant waiting for judgment, leading to either joy or woe. This appointment of death for men is a definitive occurrence, with no concept of reincarnation. Beyond death, there is the certainty of judgment, both individually and universally, with the final destiny of each person being determined at that moment. The judgment is a righteous act of God, a solemn event that will occur in the future, known as the eternal judgment. Ultimately, this verse emphasizes the significance of Christ's second coming and the need to patiently await His return, giving Him the honor He deserves.",
