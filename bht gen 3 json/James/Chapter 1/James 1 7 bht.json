It is important to put our confidence in God and have a true belief in His existence, perfections, and promises. God sees the heart, and if He discerns a lack of trust and reliance, it is not reasonable for Him to grant our requests. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that we will receive any favor without genuine faith. The Lord mentioned in this verse refers to God [Jehovah], not Christ. Faith is the grace that allows us to receive the Lord Jesus Christ Himself and all other grace from Him. Without faith, like the wavering man described, we cannot receive anything.",
