This destructive state of unrest and disorder is in stark contrast to the peace and composure that true wisdom brings.

This unhealthy pursuit of comparison and competition leads to a breakdown in trust, unity, and cooperation, resulting in the derailment of any collective goal. In such an atmosphere, love, harmony, and progress become impossible, giving way to a multitude of wicked passions.
