It emphasizes that no one can truly control the tongue, as it bursts forth to assail and ruin others. The tongue is portrayed as unruly and unsettled, incapable of being held back or restrained. It is compared to the death-bringing tongue of a serpent, ready to strike. It is an evil that, when set ablaze by the forces of hell, becomes particularly dangerous. Ultimately, no person, not even oneself, can tame the tongue without the assistance of the Holy Spirit and the grace of God.",
