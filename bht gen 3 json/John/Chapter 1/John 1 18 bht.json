            "No one hath seen God at any time... The words describe God in His nature as God; He dwelleth in light that is inaccessible. The soul longs to see Him, but this cannot be. Is then its longing vain, its cry unheard? The Evangelist answers, No. One has \u2018declared\u2019 Him, has, as the Word, unfolded and explained Him.",

The words thus include more than \u2018with God\u2019 in John 1:1, more than the Divine self communion, the communion of God with God. The fatherly element, the element of love, is here."
