He emphasized that he himself was not even worthy to perform the lowest task for the Messiah, such as unfastening the latchet of his sandal. John recognized the exalted rank and dignity of the Messiah, even stating that the Messiah would baptize with the Holy Spirit. This shows us that we should be willing to humble ourselves and recognize our unworthiness in the presence of Christ, offering everything we have at his feet. Christ is not only before us in time but far ahead of us in rank and dignity, being preferred above all others by the Father.",
