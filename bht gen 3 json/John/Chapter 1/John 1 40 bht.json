This encounter, described in great detail, shows the writer's deep sensitivity and remembrance of even the smallest details. The purposeful omission of personal conversations and the focus on spreading the light of faith is noteworthy. It is significant that Peter, who would become prominent, was introduced as well-known to the readers, emphasizing the importance attached to him. This passage highlights the nature of faith, which should not hide or extinguish the light of Christ, but rather share it with others. It also showcases God's plan, using Andrew to bring Peter to Jesus, teaching us to be humble and willing to learn from even those who may be considered inferior.",
