Even in the Old Testament and in historical documents like Josephus, Nazareth is not mentioned, which perhaps led to Nathanael's skepticism. Philip, however, wisely invites Nathanael to come and see for himself, offering a noble solution to his preconceived opinions. The character of Nazareth was considered bad, leading many to judge without proper examination. Nathanael's mind was filled with the prophetic hope associated with Bethlehem or Jerusalem, so a place like Nazareth seemed incapable of bringing any good. Yet, it is important for us to guard against prejudice and be open to inquiry, just as Philip did with Nathanael. Through our submission and obedience, Christ himself can remove doubts and fulfill our earnest search for truth.",
