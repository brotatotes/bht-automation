Jesus posed the question of whether a demon could actually open the eyes of the blind, suggesting a negative answer was expected. It was an unanswerable question because demons are more likely to harm rather than help. The preaching of Jesus always produced a strong effect, either making enemies or gaining staunch supporters, and this is true for all faithful preaching. Despite divisions caused by unbelief and human passions, the truth of the gospel is powerful enough to maintain itself. No matter how wicked people may be, they will never be able to hinder the power and wisdom of God. It is important to note that the term devil encompasses actions as well, and a madman possessed by a devil could never speak in such divine and truthful manner, let alone perform miraculous actions like curing a man born blind.",
