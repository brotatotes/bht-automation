This profound affection has captivated the admiration of the Christian Church throughout history, proving skeptics wrong who discredit the Gospel for supposedly lacking in private friendships. The Evangelist uses the word loved to highlight Jesus' continued love for this remarkable family and their expectation that he would swiftly heal Lazarus. Moreover, this love connects to Jesus' supreme regard for the glory of God and emphasizes the exalted nature of His relation to His disciples. While we sometimes encounter delays in God's response to our prayers, it is crucial not to judge His love based on our temporary circumstances. Instead, we should persist in prayer, cultivating patience and obedience, for God never forgets or forsakes His beloved people.",
