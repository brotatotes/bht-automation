His presence in the incident unfolds the Jews' growing hatred towards Jesus, which ultimately leads to His death. The mention of Lazarus escalates from a mere connection to becoming the cause of the Jews flocking to Bethany. Both Martha and Mary honor Jesus, with Martha serving and Mary anointing Jesus' feet with her hair. This scene beautifully confirms the truth of the narratives about these two women. Sitting between the raised Lazarus and the healed leper, Jesus is like a trophy of His own glory. It is worth noting that this is the last mention of Jesus in Bethany, possibly mentioned proleptically. The guests at the feast include Jesus, His twelve apostles, and Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. While different conclusions may arise about the location of the feast, the most natural interpretation suggests that it was not held in Lazarus' house. The only question that remains is the timing of this event.",
