            "Invocation of the saints has been rashly fabricated by the Papists out of their own brain; and now, in order to shelter themselves under a false pretense borrowed from the word of God, they corrupt the Scripture, and tear it to pieces, and do not scruple to expose it to shameful taunts."

However, their approach was not only respectful but also sincere and affectionate. The reverence they show by requesting access through Philip reflects their strong desire to have a spiritual sight of Christ and experience communion with Him. It is important to note that their intention was not to ask Jesus to focus on the Gentiles or come to them, but rather to nourish their own personal faith. The passage serves as a reminder that seeking and taking the proper means to find the Savior can lead to transformative encounters, just as Christ responded to Zacchaeus' curiosity. Overall, this account demonstrates the earnestness and yearning of believers to have a deeper understanding of and connection with Christ.",
