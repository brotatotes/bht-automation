This is a fulfillment of prophecy, as described in Isaiah 6:10, and is a repeated theme in the New Testament regarding the state of the Jewish people. It is a judgment of God, where He overwhelms individuals with the light of doctrine, depriving them of understanding. This blindness and hardness of heart is a result of rejecting the grace of God, and requires the work and grace of God to counteract. We are reminded that prophets should continue faithfully in their work, even if they do not always see immediate success, and it is only by the grace of God that anyone can be formed to obedience. This judgment is not God actively causing blindness and hardness, but rather His withdrawal of grace, allowing individuals to remain in their stubbornness.",
