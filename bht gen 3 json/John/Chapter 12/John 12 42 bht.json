Their lack of boldness serves as a stark reminder for those today who hesitate to step out for Christ when under conviction. Though their belief was remarkable considering the hostility of the Sanhedrin, it is clear that true faith necessitates public confession, and the absence of such confession reveals a mere historical faith in Jesus. This dynamic illustrates the universal struggle between godliness and ungodliness, where faith seeks refuge in a hostile world. It is a lesson for all who, fearing the hatred of men, conceal or dissemble their faith, for there is no excuse for this cowardice.",
