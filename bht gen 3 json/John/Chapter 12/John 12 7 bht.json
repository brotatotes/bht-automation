            "I understand the words, which, like all our Lord\u2019s anticipatory expressions, have something enigmatical in them, of her whole act, regarded as a thing past, but spoken of in the abstract, as to be allowed or disallowed: Let her keep it for the day of my burial."

He rather excuses Mary on the ground of her having rendered to him an extraordinary service, which ought not to be regarded as a perpetual rule for the worship of God.\" ",
            "As it was the will of God that the childhood of his ancient people should be guided by such exercises, so, in the present day, it would be foolish to attempt the same thing; nor could it be done without offering an insult to Christ, who has driven away such shadows by the brightness of his coming."
