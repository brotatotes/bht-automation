The first-tier commentary reflects on the distinction between the full cleansing of the bath, which represents spiritual regeneration, and the continual cleansing of the feet, symbolizing the need for ongoing purity in one's Christian walk. This distinction is important because the bath cleanses completely, while the feet need refreshing due to contact with the earth. The second-tier commentary emphasizes that Christ's act of foot-washing serves as an example for his disciples to follow, reminding them of the greatness of what He did for them and the importance of love and self-denial. Overall, this verse encourages believers to seek spiritual cleansing and to continually turn to Christ for forgiveness, elevation of earthly aims, and the spiritualizing of earthly thoughts.",
