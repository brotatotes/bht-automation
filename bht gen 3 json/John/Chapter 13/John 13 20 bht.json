Despite the upcoming betrayal by Judas, Jesus affirms that receiving those whom He sends is equivalent to receiving Him and the Father. By emphasizing the significance of their office, Jesus assures the disciples that their work is divinely appointed and worthy of honor. This parallels the idea that dishonoring the ministers of God also dishonors God Himself, as they are representatives of Him in the world.
