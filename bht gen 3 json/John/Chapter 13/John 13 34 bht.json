However, it is new in its form as the commandment of the new covenant. The newness lies in the fact that Christ's love for His people, demonstrated in giving His life as a ransom, became a model for their love towards one another. It is a call to imitate His love and to let His love be the measure of our love for one another.",

Rather, it is new in its simplicity and unicity, embodying the essential principle of the whole law. This new commandment of love is based on Christ's love for us, which was altogether new in the way He gave His life as a ransom. It is a love that goes beyond the boundaries of the old commandment to love our neighbor as ourselves. Jesus sets Himself as the model and standard for our love towards one another, and He desires us to imitate His love. In a world that is often hostile to our faith, this love for one another is meant to be a source of strength and comfort. It is not just a command, but a sphere of life in which we are to walk, united as a community born again into His love. As we aim for the same end of love, may we love one another as brethren in the same family, children of the same Father, and fellow disciples. Just as Christ loves us without distinction, in word and in deed, so should we love one another, regardless of our differences, with a pure heart fervently.",
