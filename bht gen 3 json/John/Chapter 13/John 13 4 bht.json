In this act, He demonstrated a profound display of amazing patience and humility, symbolically laying aside His glory and appearing in the form of a servant. This scene is all the more striking when considering the previous strife among the disciples over greatness. Jesus' example teaches us to gird ourselves with humility, just as Peter exhorted, and reminds us that the Son of Man came to serve rather than to be served.",
