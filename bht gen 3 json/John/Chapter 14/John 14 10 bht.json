He declares that His words and works are not His own, but are a revelation and reflection of the Father. By seeing Jesus and his actions, we are able to see and understand the Father as well. This profound connection between Jesus and the Father is demonstrated through the Father's abiding presence in Him and the works that He does. Jesus had already established this oneness with the Father through His teachings and miracles. It is through this unity that Jesus expects a greater faith from His disciples. This passage highlights the essential nature of Jesus as the Son of God, carrying out the works and speaking the words of the Father, revealing their sameness in nature and essence.",
