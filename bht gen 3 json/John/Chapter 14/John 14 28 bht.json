            "That there is a sense in which the Father is greater than even the glorified Son, is beyond doubt, but as on the one hand that concession is no concession to Arianism, because it is not in the essential being of the Son, but in His Mediatorial office, that this His inferiority consists."

            "Does not this strange speech from Christ's lips, then, presuppose such teaching on His part as would make it extremely difficult for them to think He could gain anything by departing to the Father, and make it necessary for Him to say expressly that there was a sense in which He could do so?",
            "Thus, this startling explanation seems plainly intended to correct such misapprehensions as might arise from the emphatic and reiterated teaching of His proper equality with the Father\u2014as if so Exalted a Person were incapable of any accession by transition from this dismal scene to a cloudless heaven and the very bosom of the Father\u2014and by assuring them that this was not the case, to make them forget their own sorrow in His approaching joy."

Second aorist passive indicative of \u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03c9 with \u03b1\u03bd, conclusion of second-class condition referring to past time, 'Ye would already have rejoiced before this' at Christ's going to the Father (verse John 14:12).",

Not a distinction in nature or essence (cf. John 10:30), but in rank in the Trinity. No Arianism or Unitarianism here. The very explanation here is proof of the deity of the Son (Dods)."
