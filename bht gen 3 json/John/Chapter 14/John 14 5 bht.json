            "If he were willing to receive the plain and unequivocal doctrines of the Bible, there would be no difficulty; but his mind is full of opposite opinions and plans, occupied with errors and vanities, and these are the reasons, and the only reasons, why he is not a Christian."

His materialistic conception blinded him to the spiritual truth. The disciples, still clinging to the idea of an earthly kingdom, struggled to comprehend Jesus' teachings. Their minds were filled with prejudice and contrary opinions. Yet, Thomas, who once doubted the resurrection, now voiced his uncertainty about their destination and the path to get there. However, the disciples' confusion stemmed from a lack of understanding rather than the lack of an explanation. It is important to note that the knowledge possessed by the saints is sometimes vague due to their inability to comprehend certain aspects of faith. Similarly, Thomas, willing to accept only the plain and unequivocal, struggled to grasp the spiritual significance of Jesus' words.",
