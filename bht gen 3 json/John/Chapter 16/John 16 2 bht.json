This persecution will not only involve being excommunicated, but it will also escalate to the point where their lives will be taken by those who believe they are doing God's service. The hour of persecution is ordained, representing a divine purpose fulfilled through religious zealots and bigots who view their actions as sacrifices to God. This is a bitter form of persecution, as the perpetrators consider themselves righteous and the killing of the disciples as an acceptable and pleasing sacrifice to God. In the face of such perverse judgment, believers should remain steadfast, enduring the reproach of the cross and finding solace in the approval of God.
