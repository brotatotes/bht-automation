This is a new declaration that Jesus is making in reference to his imminent departure, because he was with them before. He wants them to be prepared for the difficulties that will come their way, as being forewarned will help them be forearmed. Though he had spoken about these things early on, he reminds them again to drive the point home. He wants them to remember and lay up in their minds what they have heard, as they will be required to put them into practice. He wants them to be prepared for the conflicts that they will face and also to bear their sufferings with patience, as they were appointed by God and foretold by him. Jesus did not fully reveal the circumstances and the object of his death and ascension to heaven earlier, as his presence with them was like the presence of the Holy Spirit that would be with them after his departure. He wants them to know that they will be taking his place and that his trials were their trials, which he had not explicitly told them before. So, he is now repeating these things to them so that they can have a fresh insight into the mystery of the Cross and be fully prepared for what lies ahead.",
