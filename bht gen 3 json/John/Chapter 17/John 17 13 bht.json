He knows that the world will hate them because they are opposed to its ways. Yet, despite the impending conflict, Jesus speaks these words of intercession to share his joy with his disciples. He prays that they may experience his joy fulfilled in themselves - a joy that comes from their unity with the Father and that will be independent of his physical presence. This joy is not merely a fleeting emotion, but a deep and lasting satisfaction that stems from their faithfulness and belief in Christ. It is a joy that can be realized in the present and will ultimately be fulfilled in glory.",
