The things Christ seeks for them are applicable only to those who do not adopt the spirit, standards, and message of the world, as this would hinder their effectiveness in bringing the world to Christ. Unfortunately, many times the world fails to see the difference or the gain by the change, leading to the persecution of believers. Nevertheless, Jesus has given His followers the Father's word, making them indistinguishably linked to Him and His work. This dependence on God's protection is vital in the face of opposition from the world, as it is God who defends those who labor for the Gospel, ensuring that they will never be forsaken.",
