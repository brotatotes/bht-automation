It is the glory of an accepted state, a holy character, and every grace. This glory is not the glory of the Eternal Word, but rather the glory of the Incarnate Word, which Christ desires to give to His followers. The unity that Christ prays for in this verse repeats the unity mentioned earlier, as believers are to be one just as Christ and the Father are one. This unity is not in nature or existence, but in feeling, principle, and purpose. It is the model Christians should follow, seeking the same object as the Father and the Son have sought throughout creation and redemption. The glory mentioned here is not worldly honor or station, but the ability to love and sacrifice ourselves for the good of the world. Ultimately, the happiness of believers lies in having the image of God restored in them, by being shaped according to the likeness of Christ and having the glory of God impressed upon them. The glory Christ gives to His followers includes the Gospel and all the grace and truth that comes with it, contributing to the unity of the saints. Truly, the majesty of Christians is seen in the glory they share with Christ.",
