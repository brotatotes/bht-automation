            "It was rather an inability than an unwillingness to find the truth.",
            "His conduct presents a pitiable specimen of the moral weakness of that spirit of worldly power, which reached its culminating point in the Roman empire."

            "All might find truth if they would seek it; none ever will find it if they do not apply for it to the great source of light the God of truth, and seek it patiently in the way in which he has chosen to communicate it to mankind."

            "Pilate's exclamation is neither the expression of an ardent thirst for truth, nor that of the despair of a soul which has long sought it in vain; it is the profession of a frivolous skepticism, such as is frequently met with in the man of the world, and especially in the statesman.",
            "Fault [\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd]. Properly, cause of accusation. Rev., crime."
