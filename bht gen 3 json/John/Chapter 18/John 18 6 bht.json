Falling to the ground, they recoiled in astonishment and were struck down by a supernatural force that showcased the glory, grace, and truth that radiated from Him. This event, recounted not as a mere astounding fact but as a significant revelation, led His enemies to stumble and question whether it was a result of His claims to be equal with God or a display of His supernatural power. Jesus' divine majesty and innocence produced an effect that confounded, intimidated, and awed His adversaries, yet they persisted in their assault. It is remarkable to see how they could overlook such a tangible experience of His power and mercy, likely convincing themselves that it was the work of Beelzebub and not realizing it was through God's providence that they received no further harm.",
