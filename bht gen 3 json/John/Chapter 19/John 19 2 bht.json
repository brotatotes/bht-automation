They braided a crown of thorns and placed it on His head, in a mockery of a regal crown, and they draped Him in a purple robe, reminiscent of imperial royalty. Holding a reed in His right hand, they derisively imitated a regal scepter. Their actions were not simply a result of insolence, but rather, by the authority of Pilate, they sought to mark the Son of God with infamy. The thorns used for Christ's crown remain undefined, as attempts to identify their botanical character are mere guesses. However, artists have depicted an awe-inspiring crown composed of unbending, knotted boughs with tremendous spikes, symbolizing the weight and pain Jesus bore for humanity's sins. Through this malicious display, orchestrated by God, the world is reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, demonstrating that Jesus was surrounded by wicked men, comparable to thorns, a reminder of the curse upon the earth. His crown of thorns serves as an emblem of His comprehensive covering of our sins, clothed in our scarlet and purple transgressions.",
