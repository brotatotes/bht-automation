The fulfillment of this prediction is seen as remarkable, particularly because it was carried out by heathen soldiers without any interference. The chief priests, scribes, and elders unintentionally provide a triple testimony to Jesus -- acknowledging His trust in God, associating Him with the sufferer in Psalm 22, and confirming the title Son of God as a claim of oneness of nature with God. While the ecclesiastics mocked Him as the King of the Jews, the soldiers ridiculed Him as a pretender to royalty. The term vesture refers to Jesus' clothing, which they did not tear apart to preserve its value. The soldiers casting lots for His vesture, or garments, is a unique event. The commentators highlight the fulfillment of Scripture in these events, emphasizing the presence of God or the intense interest in the details. Overall, this scene serves as a testament to the prophecy being fulfilled and the divinity of Jesus.",
