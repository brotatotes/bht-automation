            "But just as even His own dying saints, particularly the martyrs of Jesus, have sometimes had such gleams of coming glory immediately before breathing their last, as to impart to them a strength to utter their feelings which has amazed the by-standers, so this mighty voice of the expiring Redeemer was nothing else but the exultant spirit of the Dying Victor, receiving the fruit of His travail just about to be embraced, and nerving the organs of utterance to an ecstatic expression of its sublime feelings.",

His soul has emerged from its mysterious horrors; 'My God' is heard no more, but in unclouded light He yields sublime into His Father's hands the infinitely precious spirit\u2014using here also the words of those matchless Psalms which were ever on His lips."
