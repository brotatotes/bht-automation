The sheer amount of spices used symbolizes the greatness of their love and their desire to fully honor Jesus in His burial. This act of devotion not only signified the disciples' remarkable change and transformation, but also foreshadowed the future effect of Jesus' death. The intentional use of aromatic substances was likely to prevent the body from decomposing and to give it a pleasant scent, reflecting their reverence and sorrow. In bringing such an abundant offering to Jesus, Nicodemus exhibited his newfound boldness and public declaration of faith. This act also aligns with the use of sweet-smelling spices in burial customs and the anointing of holy figures. It is a reminder of the contrast between Jesus' first coming and His second coming and serves as a solemn reminder that His death demanded unwavering love and devotion.",
