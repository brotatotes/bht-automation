This zeal, symbolized by the eating up mentioned in the Psalm, was a glorious aspect of the Messiah's predicted character. Jesus' zeal for His Father's house inspired Him to confront traders in the temple, and this act both helped the disciples and angered those who were profiting from their trade. In Psalm 69:9, it is written, The zeal of Thine house consumed me, illustrating how dishonor to God was felt as a personal wrong.
