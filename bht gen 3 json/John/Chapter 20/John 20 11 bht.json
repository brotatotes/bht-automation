She wept loudly, with no thought of resurrection in her mind. How natural it was for her to desire to be near the place where Jesus had been. But despite her sorrow and confusion, Mary stood there with constancy, gazing into the empty tomb. The absence of Christ had caused her great distress and sorrow, for nothing could compare to the excellence of his person and the near and dear relationship she had with him. And so, with unwavering commitment, she sought after him, even when she had lost sight of him.",
