In her grief-stricken state, her focus was on her loss rather than expecting His presence. It was as if her tears prevented her from perceiving the reality in front of her. Yet, when Jesus called her by name, she turned and saw Him, experiencing a deep, spiritual recognition. This encounter teaches us that we must remain open to the unexpected ways in which Christ reveals Himself, for His spiritual presence may not always align with our assumptions or expectations.",

Her tears obscured her vision, preventing her from seeing the one she sought. It was as if a veil had been woven by her sorrow, blinding her to the truth. In her desperation, she assumed the man before her was the gardener, unaware of the miraculous resurrection that had taken place. But as she turned back and gazed at Him, she felt an instinctive awareness of another presence. It was only when Jesus, with compassion and familiarity, spoke her name that she truly saw Him. This encounter serves as a reminder that Christ's spiritual presence is not always recognized or understood by His people, often appearing differently from what we expect or imagine.",
