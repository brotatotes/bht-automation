The narrator emphasizes the meticulous counting that occurred after this extraordinary event. The multitude and size of the fish symbolically foreshadowed the tremendous success that awaited the disciples' ministry. Despite the net being on the verge of breaking, this difficulty alluded to the challenges they would face in retaining those they would catch for Christ. However, it is not solely the disciples' efforts that bring people to Christ; Jesus Himself invisibly gathers individuals who will later be recognized by the apostles. The mention of great fishes underscores the plentiful fish in the Lake of Galilee, and the significance of Bethsaida as the House of the Fisheries. Peter's action of hauling in the net demonstrates his leadership and obedience in fulfilling what others had failed to do. This meaningful event of an abundant catch will remain vividly engrained in John's memory, for it was a remarkable occurrence that exemplified the power and triumph of the glorified Lord.",
