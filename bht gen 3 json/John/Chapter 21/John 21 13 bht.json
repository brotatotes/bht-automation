It is worth noting that while Jesus provided the bread and fish, there is no mention of him partaking in the meal himself. By acting as the host, Jesus reaffirmed his presence and continued relationship with his faithful followers. This interaction served as a confirmation of his resurrection, effectively convincing them of his true identity. Though the mention of the fish alone may seem peculiar, it underscores the importance the evangelist places on it. Ultimately, this meal symbolizes Christ's provision for his people, spiritually nourishing them with the hidden manna and living waters that he abundantly supplies.",
