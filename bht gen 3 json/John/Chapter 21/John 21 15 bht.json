            "Perhaps there is also a slight reference to his present just-shewn zeal, in leaping from the ship first to meet the Lord. 'Has thy past conduct to Me truly borne out thy former and present warmth of love to Me above these thy fellows?'",
            "Our Lord\u2019s three injunctions differ in their mode of expression. The first is, Feed my lambs. \u2018The second, Keep, tend, or shepherd (the same word is used in Acts xx. 28: 1 Pet. v. 2) my sheep. The third, Feed my sheep, but with this difference, that the word sheep is the diminutive, expressive of affection."

            "It is surely wrong to view this term as a mere diminutive of affection, and as meaning the same thing as 'the sheep.' It is much more according to usage to understand by the 'lambs,' young and tender disciples, whether in age or Christian standing, and by the 'sheep' the more mature."
