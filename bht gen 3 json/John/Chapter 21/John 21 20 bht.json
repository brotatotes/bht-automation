One commentator finds it unnatural for Jesus to move away and summon Peter in private after uttering these words. Another commentator argues that the mention of the disciple whom Jesus loved is John's way of justifying his presence in the narrative. However, despite the ambiguity, Peter immediately followed Jesus as directed. It is clear that the disciple whom Jesus loved had a unique familiarity with Him, as shown by his leaning back and whispering to Jesus during a supper. This disciple's proximity and liberty with Jesus granted him the privilege of asking about the identity of the betrayer. It is apparent that this disciple is none other than John, the author of this chapter, and Jesus orders Peter to follow him as a sign of his willingness to be crucified for Christ's cause. Ultimately, this verse cautions against the curiosity that leads us astray from our own duties while distracting us with idle excuses about others.",
