Just as the serpent on a pole brought healing to the Israelites bitten by fiery serpents, Jesus, when lifted up on the cross, brings healing to all who believe in him. The parallel between Moses lifting up the serpent and Jesus being lifted up on the cross highlights the necessity and efficacy of faith in Christ for the salvation of the perishing soul. This divine necessity is characteristic of God's eternal plan, and the act of Jesus being lifted up on the cross signifies both his passion and glory. The uplifting on the cross signifies Jesus' exaltation and serves as a testimony for all to see and believe. Just as the serpent on the pole was plainly exhibited, Christ is clearly presented to us in the Gospel that no one may complain of obscurity. Despite the meanness and seeming improbability of the cross, it is through this means that sinners are saved. Therefore, Jesus reveals this great truth and fact to Nicodemus as the foundation of God's kingdom work, complementing his standing and intelligence as 'the teacher of Israel.'",
