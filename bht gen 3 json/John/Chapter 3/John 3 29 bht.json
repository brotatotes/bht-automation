This friend finds immense joy in hearing the voice of the bridegroom, as it assures him of the successful completion of his mission and signifies the sweetness and beauty of salvation. In the context of the Old Testament prophecies, this friendship symbolizes the relationship between Jehovah and His people. While this role of the friend of the bridegroom is more common in Judaea, John takes on a similar position in bringing together the groom and the bride, Jesus and His church. As such, John's joy overflows like a cup filled to the brim, mirroring the rejoicing of the bridegroom. Through this metaphor, we come to understand the deep love and honor that the church, the bride, holds for the Messiah, the bridegroom, and the joyous fulfillment that arises from their union.",
