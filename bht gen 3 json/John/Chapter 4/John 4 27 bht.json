They were surprised not because he was talking with that particular woman, but rather because he was conversing with any woman in public. The disciples held Jesus in such high regard, believing him to be a rabbi, and they felt that his actions were beneath his dignity. The Jews had a precept that forbid talking with women in public, even one's own wife. Nevertheless, Jesus defied societal norms and engaged in conversation with this woman, demonstrating his deep understanding and disregard for cultural restrictions. In their astonishment, the disciples missed the profound spiritual instruction taking place before their eyes.
