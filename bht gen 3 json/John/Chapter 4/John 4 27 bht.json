Their surprise stemmed from the fact that they held Jesus in high regard and couldn't fathom why he would engage in conversation with her. They didn't question him out of reverence and awe, but instead stood in wonder, silently contemplating the scene before them. They were probably unaware of the prejudice ingrained in their society, which considered women to be incapable of deep spiritual understanding. Little did they know that their teacher's actions were motivated by a higher purpose. Jesus saw beyond societal expectations and recognized the woman's thirst for spiritual truth. He revealed himself as the Messiah to her, showing that he came to break down barriers and extend grace to all. Just as the disciples were surprised then, may we also be reminded not to judge based on appearances but to embrace God's inclusive love for all people.",
