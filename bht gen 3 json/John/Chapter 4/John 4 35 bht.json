            "The fields were whitening for it; these Samaritans and the multitudes in Galilee, were all nearly ready.",
            "In the discourse as far as ver. 38, He is the sower, the disciples were the reapers:\u2014He was the one who had laboured, they were the persons who had entered into his labours."

            "The simple beauty of this language is only surpassed by the glow of holy emotion in the Redeemer's own soul which it expresses.",
            "Oh, could we but so, 'lift up our eyes and look' upon many fields abroad and at home, which to dull sense appear unpromising...what movements...and accessions to Christ, as yet seemingly far distant, might we not discern as quite near at hand, and thus...be cheered...with 'songs in the night!'"

            "The husbandman, when he sows his seed, is compelled to wait a considerable period before it produces a crop. He is encouraged in sowing it; he expects fruit; his labor is lightened by that expectation; but it is not 'immediate' - it is remote. But it is not so with my preaching. The seed has already sprung up.\" ",
            "There is as much encouragement to attempt to save souls as the farmer has to raise a crop.",
            "We are to expect revivals of religion. Here was one instance of it under the Saviour\u2019s own preaching. Multitudes were excited, moved, and came to learn the way of life."

            "When the corn is ripe, the harvest cannot bear delay, for otherwise the grain would fall to the ground and be lost; and, in like manner, the spiritual corn being now ripe, he declares that there must be no delay, because delay is injurious.",
            "By this expression, 'Do you not say?' he intended indirectly to point out how much more attentive the minds of men are to earthly than to heavenly things; for they burn with so intense a desire of harvest that they carefully reckon up months and days, but it is astonishing how drowsy and indolent they are in gathering the heavenly wheat.",
            "And daily experience proves that this wickedness not only is natural to us, but can scarcely be torn from our hearts; for while all provide for the earthly life to a distant period, how indolent are we in thinking about heavenly things?"
