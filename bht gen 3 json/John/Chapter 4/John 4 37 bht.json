The saying one soweth, and another reapeth is completely fulfilled here as Jesus refers to the relationship between the sower and reaper. It is sad when the sower misses the joy of reaping and has only the sowing in tears. The proverb reminds us that sometimes one reaps where he has not sown. It is important for us to understand that while one person may sow the seeds of the gospel with seemingly little effect, another may come after and experience great success. This truth applies not only to the physical realm but also in the spiritual field. We should work together and throw our labors into a common stock, avoiding wicked envy and rejoicing in the success of others. Ultimately, the sower and reaper are both important in the growth of God's kingdom.",
