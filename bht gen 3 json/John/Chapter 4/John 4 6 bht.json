            "Jacob\u2019s well - This is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was called 'Jacob\u2019s well,' probably, either because it was handed down by tradition that he dug it, or because it was near to the land which he gave to Joseph.\" ",

'At the mouth of the valley of Schechem two slight breaks are visible in the midst of the vast plain of corn - one a white Mussulman chapel; the other a few fragments of stone. The first of these covers the alleged tomb of Joseph,... the second marks the undisputed site of the well, now neglected and choked up by the ruins which have fallen into it; but still with every claim to be considered the original well.'",

Mr. Calhoun, in 1838, found nearly the same depth of water. Dr. Wilson, in 1841, found the depth only seventy-five feet, which is confirmed by the later measurements of Captain Anderson in 1866, and of Lieutenant Conder in 1875.",

It was an unusual sight to see a woman coming to draw water at mid-day, but her presence indicated that it was not the common time. We are brought near to Jesus, overhearing this exquisite narrative, witnessing both his human emotions and the manifestation of his divine nature. As we listen to his words, Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest, we cannot help but be moved by the grace, pity, patience, and majesty in his voice. The well, now neglected and choked up, still stands as a reminder of this encounter. Though the depth of the well has been measured differently over the years, it serves as a symbol of the depth of Jesus' love and the spiritual satisfaction he offers. The time of day, whether it was mid-day or about six in the evening, highlights the weariness of Jesus and the usual time for drawing water. Through this passage, we gain a deeper understanding of the compassion and exhaustion that Jesus experienced during his earthly ministry.",
