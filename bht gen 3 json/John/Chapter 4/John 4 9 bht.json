This interaction between Jews and Samaritans is deeply complex, marked by national antipathy and religious differences. The Jews treated the Samaritans with contempt, having no familiar or friendly dealings with them. The Samaritans, being a mixture of Jews and other colonists, were subject to this prejudice due to their half-Jewish heritage. The woman's astonishment is tinged with irony, highlighting the deep-rooted race antipathy between these two groups. Yet, in Jesus' ministry, we see a different example, such as in the parable of the good Samaritan or the gratitude of the Samaritan leper. Through this encounter, we witness the open simplicity of the woman and the unexpected way in which Jesus breaks down the barriers between these two people groups.",
