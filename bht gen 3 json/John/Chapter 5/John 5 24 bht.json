This belief is not simply an outward act, but a true reception and acceptance of Jesus' teachings, resulting in a transformation from spiritual death to spiritual life. It is important to note the immediate nature of this transformation, as believers pass out of death into life upon their faith. This passage emphasizes the inseparable connection between hearing and believing, as well as the transition from a state of spiritual death to a state of eternal life. Those who possess this spiritual life have passed into a realm where judgment does not apply. It is not enough to simply profess Christianity, but one must obey the Gospel and have an internal, experiential knowledge of Christ's teachings. This belief in Jesus also extends to belief in God the Father, highlighting the equality in nature between them.",
