The man was among the impotent who gathered at the pool, hoping for a miraculous healing when the waters were stirred. The commentators suggest that the reference to the moving of the water was likely a later addition, as there is no evidence to support the belief that cures were actually performed. The pool itself was likely a natural intermittent spring, and its phenomena, along with the faith and eagerness of the sick, find parallels in historical cases. The presence of such miracles during this time of deprivation served to show the people that God had not completely abandoned them. This account highlights the power of God to correct the defects of nature and to alleviate the sufferings of humanity. It also serves as a metaphor for spiritual conditions, as it describes individuals who are enfeebled by sin, blind to spiritual matters, and lacking in the grace of God.",
