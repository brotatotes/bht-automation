By quoting Deuteronomy 18:18, Jesus reveals that Moses was prophesying about the coming of Christ. The purpose of Moses' writings was to prepare the way for the true Prophet, Priest, and King of Israel. Therefore, the books written by Moses contain references to Christ, such as the promise of a seed that would crush the serpent's head and the blessing of all nations through the seed of Abraham.
