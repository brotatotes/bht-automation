The boat, powered by the secret might of the Lord of Nature, smoothly sailed through the now tranquil waters. As they marveled at this miraculous turn of events, they found themselves unexpectedly at their desired destination. Their willingness to receive Jesus was continuous, a continuous state of feeling rather than a mere fleeting desire. It is not explicitly stated whether Jesus entered the boat or not, but it can be inferred that He did based on Matthew and Mark's accounts. The disciples, in awe of the immediate and miraculous arrival at the shore, were consistently going towards their intended land. The use of the verb \u03c5\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9 conveys the sense of retiring from something. Hence, this verse showcases the disciples' journey from initial fear to subsequent wonder, as well as their recognition of Jesus' ability to help them in times of distress.",
