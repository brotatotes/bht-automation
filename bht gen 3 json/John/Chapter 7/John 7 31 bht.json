This growing division among the people shows that while some were drawn to Jesus as the light, others rejected him and remained in darkness. However, the preaching of the Gospel, even amidst differences and opposition, will ultimately bear fruit. It is encouraging to know that even the smallest spark of faith is acceptable to God, as the Holy Spirit recognizes and nurtures such good disposition. Furthermore, true religion and faith in Christ often flourish most among the ordinary, humble people. Ultimately, the miracles performed by Jesus served as a testament to his righteousness and drew people from all nations to serve and make peace with him.",
