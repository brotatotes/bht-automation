He does not pronounce immediate pardon or mention her innocence, but rather leaves the matter open. When He says, Go and sin no more, there is likely an implied message that goes beyond what is expressed. As Jesus writes in the ground, one by one, the accusers slip away, and no one dares to condemn the woman according to Christ's terms. Jesus then asks the woman, Where are they? Did no man condemn thee? Here, the emphasis is on the lack of condemnation, as Jesus wonders why no one took it upon themselves to carry out the sentence of which they spoke.",
