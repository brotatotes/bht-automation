Jesus uses the phrase go my way to convey His departure from them, highlighting the relational aspect of their separation. The singular form of sin expresses their entire state of estrangement from God. They will seek Him but in despair, tragically realizing their rejection when it is too late. Their fate is sealed, and they will die unpardoned. The main purpose of these words is to communicate judgment, and Jesus does not dwell on His own departure, but rather on the fate awaiting them.
