His statement, He that is without sin, let him cast the first stone, serves as a reminder that Jesus is not merely a judge of individual cases, but the ultimate Ruler and Judge of all. By convicting them all of sin before Him, Jesus reveals their hypocrisy and convicts their consciences. Though they were determined to extort an answer from Him, they are silenced by their own guilt and unable to carry out the punishment they sought. Jesus, in his wisdom, both exposes their sin and demonstrates mercy towards the woman caught in the act of adultery.
