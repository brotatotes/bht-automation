            "I should rather regard the healing virtue imparted to the water to be denoted, as symbolical of Him who was sent, and whose mission it was to give the healing water of life.",

            "As the prescribed action was purely symbolical in its design...",
            "the Evangelist notices the symbolical name of the pool as in this case bearing testimony to him who was sent to do what it only symbolized.",
            "the pool is used figuratively to denote \"the streams that make glad the city of God,\" and which, humble though they be, betoken a present God of Israel."

        "Albert Barnes": [
            "An instance somewhat similar occurs in the case of Naaman, the Syrian leper, 2 Kings 5:10. The proud Syrian despised the direction; the tremble blind man obeyed and was healed. This case shows us that we should obey the commands of God, however unmeaning or mysterious they may appear.",
            "God has always a reason for all that he directs us to do, and our faith and willingness to obey him are often tried when we can see little of the reason of his requirements.",
            "This was incorrect: and there is no evidence that John in this passage had reference to that prophecy, or that this fountain was emblematic of the Messiah."

            "The water flows into it through a subterraneous conduit from the Fountain of the Virgin, and the waters are marked by an ebb and flow.\" ",
            "The Hebrew word means outflow (of waters); missio, probably with reference to the fact that the temple - mount sends forth its spring - waters.",
            "In this, even more distinctly than in the other particulars that we have noted, Jesus, in sending the man away from Him, is keeping Himself before him in everything connected with his cure."

        "John Calvin": [
            "Christ freely made use of those outward symbols, on various occasions, for adorning his miracles, either to accustom believers to the use of signs, or to show that all things were at his disposal, or to testify that every one of the creatures has as much power as he chooses to give them.",
            "But some inquire what is meant by the clay composed of dust and spittle, and they explain it to have been a figure of Christ, because the dust denotes the earthly nature of the flesh, and the spittle, which came from his mouth, denotes the Divine essence of the Word. For my part, I lay aside this allegory as being more ingenious than solid.",
            "The Evangelist, therefore, magnifies the grace of Christ, because he alone enlightens our darkness, and restores sight to the blind. For the condition of our nature is delineated in the person of one man, that we are all destitute of light and understanding from the womb, and that we ought to seek the cure of this evil from Christ alone."

        "Archibald T. Robertson": [

        "John Gill": [
            "This blind man was sent, not to wash himself all over, but only his face or eyes; and so the Arabic and Persic versions read, 'wash thy face'; the clay from it: this may be emblematical of the grace of the Spirit, sometimes signified by water and washing, which accompanying the word, makes it effectual to the salvation of souls.\" ",
            "He did as he was commanded; he was obedient to the directions and orders of Christ, though they seemed so unlikely to answer the end; and yet that was brought about through the divine power of Christ, which appeared the more in making use of such unlikely means.\" ",
            "But the words seem not to be the words of Christ, but of the evangelist, who interprets this word; wherefore they are left out in the Syriac and Persic versions, where such an interpretation was needless."
