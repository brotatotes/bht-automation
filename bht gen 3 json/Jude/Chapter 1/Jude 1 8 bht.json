            "Their speaking evil of dignities is because they are dreaming, and know not what they are speaking evil of.",
            "As a man dreaming seems to himself to be seeing and nearing many things, so the natural man's lusts are agitated by joy, distress, fear, and the other passions. But he is a stranger to self-command."
