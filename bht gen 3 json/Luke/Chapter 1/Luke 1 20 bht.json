While it is difficult to determine the extent of Zacharias' unbelief and whether he deserved such punishment, it is clear that his request for a sign was fulfilled through his temporary silence. This silence was not just a repetition, but rather an explanation of the reason behind his inability to speak.

Despite the opposition of unbelievers, the Lord still bestows and fulfills his promises.
