            "bht": "Mary's lack of astonishment at the announcement that her son would be the Son of the Most High is telling, as she did not consider Joseph to be the destined father. This confirms that Mary herself was of the house of David. The language used in this verse echoes the prophecies in 2 Samuel 7:13, Psalm 89:3-4, Isaiah 9:7, and Jeremiah 33:15. While some debate the deity of Jesus in this context, the reference to the Most High clearly points to God. Jesus being called great signifies his distinction, power, wisdom, and dominion on earth and in heaven. This announcement fulfills the promise to David that there would always be a descendant sitting on his throne, which is perpetually fulfilled by Jesus as the Prince, Savior, and eternal King. Mary's limited understanding of her son's divine nature allows her to fulfill the role of raising the child, while the recognition of Jesus as the Messiah becomes clear. The verse also indicates a physical descent from David. Jesus is not to be confounded with angels or men; rather, he is uniquely the Son of God. As the eternal Son of God, Jesus brings the sonship of mankind. The fulfillment of the prophecy in Amos, of raising up the fallen tabernacle of David, further solidifies Jesus' role. He is great in his offices as a prophet, priest, and king. He is called the Son of the Highest in a more eminent sense than any other, and he is given the throne of his father David, which refers to his spiritual kingdom in the church and in the hearts of his people.",
