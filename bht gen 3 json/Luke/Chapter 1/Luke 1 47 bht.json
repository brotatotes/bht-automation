Just as God is called Savior in Deuteronomy and the Psalms, Mary recognizes that her own need for a Savior is met by God Himself. In rejoicing for this mercy and for the privilege of being the mother of the Messiah, Mary's words oppose the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. Thus, her exultation in spirit emphasizes the inner spiritual nature that enables us to apprehend the incomprehensible, invisible, eternal things of God.
