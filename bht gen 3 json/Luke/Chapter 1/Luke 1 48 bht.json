This emphasizes that it was not Mary's humility, but her humble position, that made her worthy of this honor. The commentary suggests that even before the Incarnation, Mary's spirit may have been aligned with the ideas and tone of the hymn she sings. Both Hannah and Mary, as sacred women, were chosen to usher in great events, while the proud and mighty were overlooked. The strain of the hymns both end with a focus on Christ. This verse also clarifies that Mary being called blessed does not imply worship, as Abraham, Paul, and Peter were also blessed but not worshipped. Ultimately, Mary rejoices in God her Savior, recognizing that her blessedness is a gift of His grace.",
