The fact that God chose to raise up someone of lowly status to bring forth the Messiah is not a mere happenstance, but a significant aspect of God's kingdom\u2014where the mighty are humbled and the lowly are exalted. The verse also highlights the connection between the songs of Hannah and the Virgin Mary, both praising God for his faithfulness to his promises and ultimately leading to Christ. Mary's response to being called blessed is not an invitation for worship, but an acknowledgement of the favor bestowed upon her by God. Therefore, it is important to recognize that Mary's blessedness is purely a result of God's grace and power, rather than an elevation of her own status.",
