His ability to speak again was a remarkable instance of God's goodness, as his tongue became the organ of divine inspiration. Through the Spirit's movement, Zacharias uttered prophetic words about the coming of the Messiah and the role his son would play.",

            "This was a remarkable instance of the goodness of God, that not only did Zacharias recover the power of speech, which he had not enjoyed for nine months, but his tongue became the organ of the Holy Spirit."

            "Without inspiration the pious priest would doubtless have adopted the same tone, the same Old Testament phraseology, but his words could not have been prophetic of the coming of the Messiah nor of the part to be taken by his own son.",
            "The hymn may be divided into five stanzas (of three lines each, though some make more). As is natural, the song of Zacharias is more national in its character, the song of Mary more individual. The Benedictus is more priestly, the Magnificat more royal."
