Unlike the concept of God's visitation mainly for judgment in the Old Testament, this verse portrays His visitation in the New Testament as an act of mercy. The Greek word used for visited carries the meaning of looking into a situation with the intention to provide help. Redemption, originally referring to political liberation, now encompasses moral and spiritual deliverance. This visitation by God is the very source of redemption, exhibiting its power and efficacy throughout history. Through this divine act, God not only looks upon His people with love, but also chooses them for salvation, establishes a covenant of grace, and provides a Saviour for them. The ultimate result of this redemption is a profound deliverance from sin, the law, and every enemy. Let us bless and praise God for His eternal redemption and for the perfections of His nature and works.",
