Referring to God's visitation as an act of mercy, rather than judgment as seen in the Old Testament, this verse highlights the spiritual significance of Christ's redemption. The enemies that the Messiah came to save us from are our own sins, carnal propensities, lusts, and the schemes of Satan. Salvation from these enemies is not merely a means to political liberation, but rather a means to the reformation of Divine worship. Ultimately, Christ's deliverance ensures that nothing, whether machinations, power, or attacks, can prevent us from being saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation, freeing us from sin, Satan, the world, the law, and death.",
