The Church now stands in a position of greater understanding and revelation compared to the days of old. The verse emphasizes the fulfillment of prophecy through Christ, evidenced in his teachings and miracles. The hunger and patient faith of the saints of old are to be admired, as they eagerly awaited the arrival of the promised Messiah and the redemption he would bring.
