It's important to note that these events took place during Jesus' last journey from Galilee to Jerusalem. Martha, the mistress of the house and likely the older sister, received Him under her roof with hospitality and love. Jesus, who had a deep affection for Martha and her siblings, came to her home and was received kindly. This act of hospitality demonstrates both Martha's character and her devotion to fulfilling her household duties. It reminds us that Christ's purpose was always to do good and fulfill His Father's calling, regardless of His own comfort.
