This is likened to the Jewish nation during the time of Christ's death and the destruction of Jerusalem, who showed an external religious zeal but harbored anger and opposition towards Christ and his Gospel. Despite their efforts to appear righteous, they were actually prepared to be a dwelling place for Satan. So, this verse serves as a cautionary reminder that true goodness comes from within, not just from outward appearances.",
