He regarded a life of secure and abundant earthly enjoyment as the epitome of human happiness and assumed he would continue to revel in it. Little did he know that life is fleeting and riches cannot prolong it. This parable admonishes us to seek our daily sustenance from the Lord and rely on His providence, irrespective of our material wealth.",
