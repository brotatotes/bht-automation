            "bht": "In Luke 12:45, the servant embodies a dangerous attitude of arrogance and complacency, assuming that his master's return will be delayed and abusing his position of authority. The servant maltreats those who remain faithful and plans to deceive his master upon his return. This parable highlights the danger of adopting a mindset that excuses unfaithfulness and disregards the imminence of the master's return. The delay of the master's arrival becomes the servant's justification for his actions, but in reality, it only reveals his true character. The emphasis on delay reflects the servant's misguided perception and his intention to resume his facade of loyalty later. Ultimately, this passage reminds us that mere profession of faith without corresponding actions is inadequate and that those who abandon their faith can become fierce persecutors of the faithful.",
