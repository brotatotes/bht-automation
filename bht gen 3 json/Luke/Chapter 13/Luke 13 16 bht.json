The woman's suffering had lasted for eighteen years, a significant duration compared to a few hours without water. The commentator emphasizes that there is no necessity for a spiritual daughtership to be implied; instead, the focus is on the long duration of her suffering and her dignity as an heir of the promise. The application of the term daughter of Abraham highlights her identity as a Jewess. The necessity for Jesus to heal her, even on the Sabbath, is emphasized, along with the statement that her disease was due to Satan. Ultimately, the commentators bring attention to the hypocrisy of those who denied the healing on the Sabbath, despite recognizing the necessity of watering animals.",
