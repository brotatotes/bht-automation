            "He declares that those men were not more wicked than others, but that their death was held out to all as a ground of alarm; for if in them God gave a display of his judgment, no more would others, though they might be spared for a time, escape his hand."

The term sinners above all means that they were placed beside all other sinners, but not necessarily above them in their level of wickedness. Jesus challenges the common habit of labeling every calamity as a judgment from God, as this often stems from a lack of charity and a tendency to harshly judge others. It is crucial to remember that God's judgments are beyond our understanding, and his providence encompasses both punishment and mercy. Whether someone experiences immediate consequences or is spared for a time does not determine their righteousness or wickedness. Thus, we should avoid being overly severe in our judgments and instead humbly acknowledge the mystery of God's ways.",
