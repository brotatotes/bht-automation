This reversal of positions is a warning to the Jews, who had placed their confidence in their chosen status. It signifies that the Gentiles, who were called last, will be first and will sit among the patriarchs and prophets, sharing in the same glory and happiness. On the other hand, the Jews, who were first called and expected to enjoy the kingdom of heaven, may end up being last, rejected and despised.
