This parable illustrates the permissibility of free will and the impatience of man to be independent from God. By requesting his portion, the son symbolizes man's desire to be his own master and to seek fulfillment elsewhere, separated from the divine yoke. However, this departure from God results not in freedom, but in the exchange of a light yoke for a heavy one. The father, according to Jewish law, could distribute his property as he wished, and the younger son's entitlement to his share illustrates the ambition of youth. Ultimately, this parable depicts both the restless spirit of youth and the boundless goodness and forbearance of God, reflected in this father's responses.",
