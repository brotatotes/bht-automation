This famine serves as a symbolic representation of his soul's emptiness and the consequences of his sinful lifestyle. It is through this famine that he begins to feel the effects of his choices and the evil of his environment in the far country. The famine acts as a catalyst for change, leading the prodigal son to a crucial turning point where he must choose despair or repentance. The external circumstances of the famine hasten the consequences of his sin and serve as a means for God to bring him to a place of repentance.
