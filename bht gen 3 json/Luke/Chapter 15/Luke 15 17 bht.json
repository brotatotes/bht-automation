But now, in a moment of clarity, he sees his state of rebellion against God as a kind of madness. He realizes the emptiness of his current life and longs for the warmth and reality of home. This awakening of repentance is like the return of a sound consciousness, a recognition of the many ills that have disfigured the soul. Just as one who has been deranged comes to himself, so this person begins to see things as they truly are. The phrase I perish reflects the irrationality of a life of sin and the missed opportunities for provision and happiness. Ultimately, this parable teaches us that afflictions can be a wake-up call from God, inviting us to repentance and a recognition of His mercy.",
