            "As this father, therefore, is not merely pacified by the entreaties of his son, but meets him when he is coming, and before he has heard a word, embraces him, filthy and ugly as he is, so God does not wait for a long prayer, but of his own free will meets the sinner as soon as he proposes to confess his fault.",
            "It is wretched sophistry to infer from this, that the grace of God is not exhibited to sinners until they anticipate it by their repentance. It is, no doubt, true that, in order to his obtaining pardon, the sinner is required to have grief of conscience, and to be dissatisfied with himself; but it is wrong to infer from this, that repentance, which is the gift of God, is yielded by men from their own movement of their heart."

Though unsure if his father would accept him, the son slowly made his way back, where his father eagerly awaited him, recognizing his child from afar and bounding towards him. This display of unconditional love and longing is seen in both the father's immediate action and the emphasis on his own father. The father's hasty response is a beautiful symbol of God's grace, exemplifying His willingness to meet us, His children, in our brokenness. The parable's profound teaching has the power to transform lives, a testament to the portrait of our Heavenly Father that it portrays.",
