            "The New Testament loses no opportunity for prophesying the ultimate salvation of Israel, and such a prediction would least of all fail in a parable where love and forbearance alone are depicted.",
            "All of us, in whom sin remains, are represented by one or the other of those two sons. Both were offenders, yet the Father calls both sons, and would save both lasses of sinners here depicted."

            "Our Lord in this whole parable shows, not only that the Jews had no cause to murmur at the reception of the Gentiles, but that if the Pharisees were indeed as good as they fancied themselves to be, still they had no reason to murmur at the kind treatment of any sincere penitent.",
            "Let no elder brother murmur at this indulgence, but rather welcome the prodigal back into the family. And let those who have been thus received, wander no more, but emulate the strictest piety of those who for many years have served their heavenly Father, and not transgressed his commandments."
