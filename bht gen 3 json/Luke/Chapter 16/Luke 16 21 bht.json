Despite having an abundance of luxuries, the rich man ignored Lazarus, leaving him vulnerable to the wild dogs that would lick his sores. This display of cruelty is emphasized by the fact that even the dogs showed more pity than the rich man. The dogs' actions served as a testimony to the rich man's callousness. It is a stark reminder that when we fail to help those in need, even strangers and animals become witnesses to our negligence.
