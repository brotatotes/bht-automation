This shows the depth of his delusion and highlights his refusal to acknowledge the consequences of his actions. The division in Jewish society at the time between priests, Levites, and Israelites, as well as the sects of Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, reminds us of the context in which Christ spoke these words. He aimed to testify to the Jewish people about their sins and righteousness, revealing their hypocrisy and the insufficiency of their self-righteousness. The Rich Man fears that his brothers, like him, will be condemned to this place of torment and adds to his own suffering by anticipating their reproaches.",
