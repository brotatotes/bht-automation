Although he contemplates digging and begging, these actions are not meant to be taken literally, but rather serve as an introduction to the scheme that follows. The servant, being accustomed to a life of indulgence, is ashamed of hard labor and begging, yet his guilt and fear of destitution push him to devise a plan to secure his future. Ultimately, this verse illustrates the servant's misguided priorities and lack of integrity, highlighting the dangers of materialistic tendencies and the need for humility and honest living.",
