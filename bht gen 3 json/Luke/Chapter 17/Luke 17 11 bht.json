It is worth noting that Samaria was mentioned first, as it was nearest to Jerusalem. These men, upon seeing Jesus, cried out to him for mercy. They were not just seeking physical healing, but also hoped to be freed from the societal stigma associated with their condition. Jesus, in his compassion, instructed them to go and show themselves to the priests. As they obeyed, they were miraculously cleansed of their disease. However, out of the ten men who had been healed, only one, a Samaritan, returned to express his gratitude towards Jesus.
