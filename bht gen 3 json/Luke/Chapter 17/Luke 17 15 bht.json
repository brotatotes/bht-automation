The healing described here took place on their journey to the priests, and the gratitude and praise for God's work were closely intertwined. Some speculate that the man may have returned to give thanks after hearing the decision of the priests, while others suggest that his gratitude may have driven him to immediately go back and thank the one who had healed him. Jesus takes this opportunity to hold up the gratitude of the one stranger against the ingratitude of the many Jews, emphasizing the rarity of true gratitude. This passage reminds us that true healing begins with recognizing our own brokenness and seeking the proper means of healing. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of expressing gratitude not only in words but also through deeds, both in our bodies and in our spirits.",
