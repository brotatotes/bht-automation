Those who exalt themselves will fail to obtain justification, while those who humble themselves, as illustrated by the publican, will be exalted and receive the answer to their prayers. Humility and a recognition of one's need for God's grace are fundamental for receiving the grace which bringeth salvation. This humble posture leads to mourning for one's sin and a deep hunger and thirst for righteousness, which are rewarded by the fullness of God's justification. Only those who embrace this self-emptying and humble disposition are the justified ones. The publican in the story is contrasted with the Pharisee, who relied on his self-righteousness. Though the Pharisee was more moral, he failed to be justified because of his self-righteousness. On the other hand, despite being a worse man, the publican was justified because of his humble repentance. Ultimately, righteousness consists in the forgiveness of sins, and God is pleased by humble demeanor while abhorring pride and self-trust.",
