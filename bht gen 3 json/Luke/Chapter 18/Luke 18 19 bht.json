Our Lord did not wish to be grouped together with other good masters, but desired to be acknowledged as the one and only truly good. Though not overtly stated, this background knowledge is crucial to truly grasp the significance of His words. Therefore, the teachings of Socinianism are ultimately confounded by this verse. Jesus questions the youth's declaration of Him as good because it was uncommon to address men with such a title, reserving it instead for God alone.",
