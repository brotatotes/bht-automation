The parable describes a common occurrence and the grouping of the characters represents different classes of people. The application of the parable to prayer in general is obvious and precious, but the historical interpretation is also significant. The question is whether, before the Son of man comes to redress the wrongs of His Church, there will be a persistence of faith like that of the widow. The danger lies in the faith and confidence of God's afflicted people diminishing in the face of trials, leading to despair and discouragement. However, God will surely vindicate them, possibly at an unexpected time, and the day of the Lord will come quickly. The question posed in the verse implies that the Church's faith and patience will face great trials during the Lord's delay, making it uncertain whether such fervent faith in His return will be common.",
