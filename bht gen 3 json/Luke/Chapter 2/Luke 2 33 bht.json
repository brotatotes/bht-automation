Luke makes it clear that they were not doubting the truth of Simeon's prophecy or questioning the miraculous nature of Jesus' birth, but rather marveling at the significance of these events. The use of the term his father does not imply any denial of the Virgin Birth, but rather reflects the common language used at the time. In fact, it is commendable for others to recognize the fullness of what is obvious to the parents. Their astonishment demonstrates their deep reverence and heartfelt admiration for all that had been revealed about Jesus.
