It highlights the anguish she would endure as a result of Christ's ministry and the rejection he would face. This piercing of sorrow would lay bare the thoughts and attitudes of those encountering Jesus. The imagery of a Thracian sword emphasizes the profound division and anguish that Mary would undergo, particularly when standing at the foot of the cross. Through Christ's rejection, hidden thoughts and purposes would be revealed, forcing individuals to take a definitive position in regard to Him.",
