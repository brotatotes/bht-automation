It is important to note that Jesus was not acting as a master, but rather engaging in the Jewish custom of questioning. His questions were not only thought-provoking, but also the beginning of the profound and pregnant questions that would silence His adversaries in later years. Although only twelve years old, Jesus displayed intellectual grasp and power beyond His age. As the child Jesus sat among the doctors and scholars in the temple, His presence was recognized by those around Him, who allowed Him to sit with them. Mary, His mother, kept this experience in her heart to share it as a treasured memory for the use of all the godly. Thus, this passage shows the early signs of Jesus' divine brightness and the unique depth of His thinking even at a young age.",
