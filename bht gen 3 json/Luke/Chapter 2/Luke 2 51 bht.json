He most likely even worked alongside Joseph in his trade. The fact that Mary, the mother of Jesus, could provide such intricate details of these events suggests that this narrative may have been derived from her testimony. Jesus, the Son of God, voluntarily subjected Himself to human parents, bestowing an honor upon them that not even the angels have. His continuous subjection to them demonstrated a habitual obedience and faithful keeping, despite His deep wisdom and knowledge. As Jesus waited in Nazareth for the Father's call to His Messianic task, one can only imagine the wistful days and the fullness of Mary's heart, knowing that destiny would eventually take Jesus beyond her reach. In imitating the obedience of Jesus to His parents, all children are called to honor their own parents. Jesus' humble obedience also brings honor to virtuous industry, showing that no one should be ashamed of their humble origins.",
