This declaration emphasized the separation between the traitor and the rest of the disciples, highlighting the individual who was about to commit this treacherous act. Interestingly, Luke recounts the institution of the Lord's Supper prior to exposing Judas as the betrayer, while Mark and Matthew present this sequence in reverse. It is worth noting that the hand of Judas was resting on the table at the moment, which further accentuated the gravity of his impending betrayal. The phrase with me is omitted in some versions, leaving no doubt that Judas was not only present at the Passover but also at the Lord's Supper when Jesus made this profound statement. This indicates that Christ spoke these words before the institution of the Lord's Supper, which adds depth to the significance of the act.",
