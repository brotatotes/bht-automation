            "This bloody sweat did not arise from a cachexy, or ill state of body, which has sometimes been the cause of it, as Aristotle observes, who says that the blood sometimes becomes sanious, and so serous, insomuch that some have been covered with a 'bloody sweat' [...] Christ's walk from Jerusalem to the garden was but a short one; and it was in the night when he had this sweat, and a cold night too.\" ",

The mention of an agony accompanied by a bloody sweat is not unprecedented, as medical writers like Aristotle have also mentioned it. The sweating of blood was a result of the deep struggle and sorrow that Jesus was facing, as well as the pressing attacks of Satan. The drops of blood were not a mere metaphor, but rather a tangible manifestation of the profound anguish Jesus endured for the sake of humanity. This remarkable event speaks to the gravity of the conflict Jesus faced and the victory He ultimately achieved.",
