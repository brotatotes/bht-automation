This unexpected reconciliation highlights the manner in which wicked individuals can join forces to oppose and mock Christ and His followers. Furthermore, it is fascinating to consider how the indecisiveness of Pilate and the indifference of Herod ultimately played a role in Jesus being crucified. This narrative also raises questions about the consistency of the Gospel accounts and how this event is omitted in the Gospel of John.
