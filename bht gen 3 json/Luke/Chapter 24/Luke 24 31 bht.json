Suddenly, He vanished from their sight, not just becoming invisible but supernaturally removing Himself from them. This disappearance served as a profound teaching moment, reminding them that Christ's resurrection meant a departure from the earthly realm and a completion of the new life in His ascension to heaven. By suddenly departing, Jesus prevented them from clinging to an earthly existence and instead directed their gaze towards the heavenly. Upon realizing who Jesus was, their doubts were dispelled, and they knew Him as their Lord and Savior. His agility, a quality of His risen body, allowed Him to swiftly withdraw Himself from them, confirming the reality of His resurrection.",
