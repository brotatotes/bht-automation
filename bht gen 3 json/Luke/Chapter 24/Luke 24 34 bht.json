It demonstrated Jesus' readiness to pardon and bring comfort to the penitent. This appearance not only strengthened Peter but also served as good tidings to encourage the other disciples. Jesus chose to reveal himself to Peter first, despite Peter's shameful denial, as an early means of relieving his distress and fears. This confirmed the truth that the Lord had truly risen.",
