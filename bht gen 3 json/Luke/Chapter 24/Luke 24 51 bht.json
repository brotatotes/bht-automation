The brightness of the Father's glory, enshrined in our nature, hath won it well for He poured out His soul unto death, and led captivity captive, receiving gifts for men, yea for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them. Thou art the King of glory, O Christ."

This act of ascending continued even as he blessed his disciples, and it is in perfect harmony with the subsequent worship and praise. The significance of this departure is profound, for the incarnate, crucified, and risen Love was now on a journey to heaven, where he would bestow his blessings in a higher form until his glorious return. This majestic homecoming, conducted by angels, highlights his rightful place as the King of glory, the one who triumphed over death and captivity. Though some manuscripts omit the mention of him being carried into heaven, we know from Acts 1:9 that Jesus ascended on a cloud. Even as he departed, his heart remained united with his disciples, and this physical separation was temporary, for the promise of his second coming from heaven ensures that they will meet again and be forever reunited.",
