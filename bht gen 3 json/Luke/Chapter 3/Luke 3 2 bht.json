This suggests a peculiar state of affairs, as there should only be one high priest. However, the presence of a deputy high priest, like Caiaphas, was not uncommon and allowed individuals like Annas to retain power and evade Roman appointments. John the Baptist, who arose in this significant period, is described as the son of Zacharias, emphasizing his connection to the priestly lineage. His ministry began in the wilderness, highlighting his solitary life and divine calling. The fact that the word of God came to him reflects the formula for prophetic inspiration in the Old Testament.
