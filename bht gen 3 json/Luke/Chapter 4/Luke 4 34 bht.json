The demon cries out, What have we to do with thee?, a phrase that expresses a sense of fear and indignation. The demon recognizes Jesus as the Holy One of God, yet interestingly, this confession seems to be made either out of terror or an attempt to cast doubt on Christ's character. Ultimately, the demon acknowledges that Jesus' business is with humanity, not with the forces of darkness. This exchange reveals the power and authority of Jesus, as even the demons recognize Him as God.",
