This overwhelming response can be attributed to the effect that the healing had on the popular mind. Despite the attempts of some to hinder him, Jesus continued to minister to and heal the multitudes. His mission required him to keep moving and proclaim the good news to all who would hear. Mark's account emphasizes the persistence of the people in their search for Jesus, as they did not discontinue their search until they found him. In contrast to the Gadarenes, who asked Jesus to leave their region, these people sought after him fervently. Jesus, knowing the purpose of his departure, willingly met their needs before moving on to the next place. (70 words)",
