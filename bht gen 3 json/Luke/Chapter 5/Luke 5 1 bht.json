The location, referred to as the lake of Gennesaret, is an illustration of Luke's accurate and classical style. Luke deviates from the chronological order in Mark's account and specifically refers to the body of water as a lake, while the other Gospel writers call it a sea. This small and secluded lake became the backdrop for some of Jesus' earliest miracles and the calling of his disciples, laying the foundation for a religion that would spread throughout the world. The multitude around Jesus was growing, and the fishermen, who had toiled all night in vain, recognized that the large catch of fish was not a coincidence but a divine intervention. The enthusiasm of the crowd was so overwhelming that they pressed upon Jesus, eager to see and hear him.",
