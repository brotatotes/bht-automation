Commentators note that Jesus' response was a direct challenge to these legalistic leaders, leaving them speechless and infuriated. It is also mentioned that Codex D adds another incident after verse 6:5, where Jesus confronts a person working on the Sabbath and warns them about the consequences of breaking the law. This further emphasizes Jesus' authority as the Son of Man who is above the Sabbath.",
