The exact details of this encounter are unclear, but it is evident that the Pharisee extended an invitation to Jesus, possibly out of genuine curiosity. Nonetheless, the Pharisee had an immediate negative reaction upon seeing Jesus show compassion to the sinful woman. He failed to recognize that Jesus came to save those who were lost, disregarding the fact that Christ had accepted the invitation without hesitation. In this situation, Jesus demonstrated both wisdom and grace, accepting the invitation while being aware of the Pharisee's intentions.
