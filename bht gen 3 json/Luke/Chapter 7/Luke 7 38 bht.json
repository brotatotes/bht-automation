It was the tears, implied in the word weeping,\u2014the tears which she shed,\u2014not \u2018her tears,\u2019 which would be otherwise expressed.",

            "The word signifies 'to kiss fondly, to caress,' or to 'kiss again and again,' which shows is meant here. What prompted this? Much love, springing from a sense of much forgiveness.",

            "There could be few expressions of penitence more deep and tender than were these. A sense of all her sins rushed over her mind; her heart burst at the remembrance of them, and at the presence of the pure Redeemer; with deep sorrow she humbled herself and sought forgiveness.",
            "In this way we should all come, embracing him as the loved Redeemer, humbled at his feet, and offering all we have - all that we have gained in lives of sin, in our professions, by merchandise and toil, while we were sinners - offering 'all' to his service."
