Simon, as the host, had failed to extend the customary acts of hospitality and love towards Jesus. He neglected to provide water for Jesus to wash his feet, a common courtesy in that culture. In stark contrast, the woman, with tears streaming down her face, washed Jesus' feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. She went above and beyond, showing extravagant love and gratitude towards Jesus. This woman's actions demonstrate her acknowledgment of her immense need for forgiveness and her deep gratitude for the forgiveness she had received. While not all of her actions can be taken as a direct command for us to follow, her overall attitude of humility, gratitude, and extravagant love are traits that we should seek to emulate in our own lives.",
