However, as time goes on and they face trials and temptations, their faith becomes shallow and easily swayed. They fail to truly receive the word into their hearts and instead have a mere intellectual understanding of it. Their faith is temporary and fleeting, easily forgotten or discarded when faced with doubts or negative influences. It is crucial to recognize that the time of temptation mentioned is not a specific intense test but rather a general period of affliction and persecution. Without a deep-rooted faith, these individuals fall away and need constant guidance and reminders to stay within the fold of believers.",
