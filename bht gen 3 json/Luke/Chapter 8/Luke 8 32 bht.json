The word herd is a rare term used only in the New Testament and is reminiscent of Homer's writings. The swine are feeding on a mountain, and the evil spirits possessing the man beseeched Jesus to allow them to enter the swine. However, it is noted that entering the swine did not provide any relief for the spirits, as they ultimately destroyed the entire herd. This passage highlights the power of Jesus over evil spirits and shows that their ultimate destruction was inevitable, regardless of their presence in the swine.",
