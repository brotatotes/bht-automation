The verb used here is the same one used to describe Jesus and Paul being taken by fear in Luke 12:50 and Philippians 1:23. It seems that these people were not willing to let go of their fear and choose Christ, as they preferred to keep the demons among them rather than have Jesus continue with them. It's notable that Jesus didn't stay long in this place, perhaps because of the people's refusal to accept him, as seen in Matthew 9:1 and Mark 5:18.",
