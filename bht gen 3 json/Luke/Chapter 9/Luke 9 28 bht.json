This moment was not a random occurrence, but rather a deliberate and purposeful event in the journey of Jesus. It served as a visual representation of His impending death and resurrection, a reminder that His suffering would lead to glorious redemption. And in the midst of His transfiguration, Jesus prayed fervently, pouring out His heart to the Father. As His face radiated like the sun and His garments became white and radiant, Peter, James, and John witnessed firsthand the majesty and power of their Lord. On that sacred mountain, they beheld the fulfillment of ancient prophecies, the center of the Promised Land from which the springs of Jordan descended. The stones that had been raised against Jesus in rejection now lay beneath their feet, as they glimpsed His true splendor.",
