This paradox is also emphasized in Matthew 19:30, where the concept of the first and the last is explored further in the parable of the laborers in the vineyard. It is a reminder that those who may consider themselves first in terms of status or position in this world may actually find themselves last in the kingdom of God, while those who are considered last may be exalted to a higher position. The teaching challenges our human understanding of success and reminds us of the upside-down values of God's kingdom.",
