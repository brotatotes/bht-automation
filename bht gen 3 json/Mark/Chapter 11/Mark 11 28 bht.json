The fact that the question is posed by the leaders themselves reveals its legitimacy. Jesus' authority to do the things he does, including the acts of cleansing the temple, is emphasized through Mark's repetition of the phrase to do these things. This challenges the religious leaders further, emphasizing the definitiveness of their challenge.
