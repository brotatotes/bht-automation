Their question is rooted in the law Moses wrote in Deuteronomy 25:5 about a brother marrying his deceased sibling's widow. The first-tier commentary emphasizes that Moses wrote this law, and the second-tier commentary adds that the Pharisees acknowledged and adhered to the literal sense of Moses' writings. This background helps us understand why the Pharisees bring up this case to Jesus, highlighting their desire to test Him with a complex and contentious legal question.",
