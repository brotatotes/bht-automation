The language used in this verse is not uncommon in the Old Testament when describing immense calamities. It is evident that during the Jewish war, an unprecedented amount of suffering and complexity of events took place. The intensity of this suffering can be seen through the close siege of the Romans, the fury of the zealots, and the internal strife among the Jewish people. This period was marked by ravages of the sword, plagues, and famines, which are unparalleled in history. It is important to recognize that this affliction, though partially fulfilled, may not be fully accomplished yet. We must consider if there is still more suffering to come in the future.",
