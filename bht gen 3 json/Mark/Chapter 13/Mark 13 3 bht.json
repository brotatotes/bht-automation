They found themselves on the Mount of Olives, which provided a panoramic view of Jerusalem and the temple. Mark vividly portrays this setting, emphasizing the names of the four disciples and their secluded conversation with Jesus. The particularity of detail in Mark's account adds to its vividness, and it is worth comparing this discourse with the one in Matthew. The Mount of Olives, situated east of Jerusalem, offered a direct view of the temple. This specific location was significant, allowing Jesus to see the temple in all its grandeur and evoking a sense of anticipation for what He was about to reveal.",
