The mention of giving to the poor being Judas's responsibility adds to the context of the verse. The statement For ye have the poor with you always...and whensoever ye will ye may do them good can be seen as a gentle hint of Jesus' imminent departure, emphasizing the value of His presence. Mark's amplification of this statement further highlights the importance of helping the poor. These words convey the idea that while the opportunity to do good unto the poor is always present, the presence of Jesus is not. Hence, it is crucial to make the most of His time among them.",
