The disciples, however, struggled with doubt despite Jesus appearing to them repeatedly. It is important to note that doubt is not a sign of superior intellect and one must avoid both extreme skepticism and blind acceptance. In fact, many prominent scientists today are devout believers in the resurrected Christ. The disciples' disbelief was not due to deception or ignorance, but rather because they were hesitant to accept the miraculous reality of Jesus' resurrection. Their unbelief stemmed from a combination of intellectual and moral stagnation. Jesus rebuked them for their hardness of heart, as their unbelief was marked by obstinacy and a deliberate suppression of the evident truth. Ultimately, their doubts were overcome only when they could no longer deny the overwhelming evidence.",
