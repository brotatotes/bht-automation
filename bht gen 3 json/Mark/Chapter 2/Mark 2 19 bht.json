He identifies himself as the bridegroom, symbolizing his covenant relationship with Israel and emphasizing the spiritual over the ritualistic. The repetition in the report highlights its primary authority and the care with which it was recorded. Jesus's question about fasting during a wedding feast challenges the ecclesiastical norms, as mourning does not suit such a celebration. He affirms that while the bridegroom is present, fasting is neither suitable nor reasonable. Through this metaphor, Jesus calls for a shift in focus towards the joy and abundance of the spiritual life.",
