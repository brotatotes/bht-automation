The theory of the 'inter-dependence' of the Evangelists is challenged by the unique way in which Mark presents the events. Jesus, while speaking the word, found Himself in a crowded house with no room for anyone, not even near the door. The house door opened directly into the street, making it even more difficult for people to approach Jesus. The preaching of Jesus, though serious in nature, was as powerful as the prattling of children or the chatter of birds. The immense crowd forced the people to gather in the courtyard and overflow into the porch, as others had already been healed by Jesus prior to this incident.",
