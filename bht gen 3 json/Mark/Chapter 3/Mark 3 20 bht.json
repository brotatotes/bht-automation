The pressing throng was so overwhelming that they could not find rest or nourishment, and even Jesus was unable to teach. The popularity of Jesus was at its peak, and people flocked to see him, hear his teachings, and witness his miracles. The opposition against Jesus also began to take a definite form, as the relatives of Christ, instead of supporting him, displayed great wickedness and formed perverse judgments about the glory of God.

However, it also serves as a cautionary reminder that religion should not be used as an excuse to neglect our worldly responsibilities.",
