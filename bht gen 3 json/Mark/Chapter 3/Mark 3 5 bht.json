The commentators emphasize that Jesus felt genuine sympathy and grief for their spiritually hardened state. He looked upon them with a compassionate yet stern gaze, conveying his anger at their sinfulness without desiring revenge. This combination of anger and grief exemplifies the true moderation of zeal. The anger Jesus displayed was not sinful, but rather a sign of his moral health and his righteous response to the wrong being committed. Despite their murderous intentions, Jesus still loved and pitied them, refusing to be intimidated or deterred from doing good.
