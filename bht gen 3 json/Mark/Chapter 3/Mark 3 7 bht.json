The first-tier commentary points out that Mark specifically mentions eleven occasions where Jesus took a step back to either elude his enemies, pray privately, or confer with his disciples. In this particular instance, a large crowd from Galilee followed him, which is further emphasized in verse 8. However, Jesus sought refuge by the open beach, accompanied by his disciples, not out of fear, but because it wasn't yet time for him to reveal himself fully. This passage also highlights the expansive reach of Jesus' ministry, as people from different parts of Galilee and Judea gathered to be with him.",
