            "So religion in the heart is not by the power of man. It grows he cannot tell how, and of course he cannot without divine aid, control it. It is by the power of God.",
            "Both [religion and harvest] are connected with his effort; both are to be measured commonly by his effort...both grow he cannot tell how; both increase when the proper means are used, and both depend on God for increase.",
            "By this is denoted, undoubtedly, that grace or religion in the heart is of gradual growth. It is at first tender, feeble, perhaps almost imperceptible, like the first shootings of the grain in the earth...it needs care, kindness, and culture."

        "Philip Schaff": [
            "The growth of the kingdom of God, in general and in individuals, is according to a development which is natural, i.e., in accordance with certain laws in the realm of grace, which are analogous to what are called natural laws, and like them acting with a certain spontaneousness.",
            "The mistakes opposed by this truth are: first, expecting growth without any seed; secondly, taking up the seed to see how it grows, i.e., perpetually exacting a certain kind of experience, and testing discipleship by unwise and premature measures; thirdly and chiefly, trying to make the growth according to our notions, instead of according to God\u2019s law of development, and thinking our care and anxiety can accomplish this.",
            "The lesson is therefore one of patience. While we are not to press a particular meaning upon these three stages, the parable plainly implies that we must be careful not to mistake the blade from the seed of grace for ordinary grass, still less to think the immature ear will never be ripe grain."

            "Not only as at first up to the ankles, but to the knees and loins; when at length they are a broad river to swim in, and which cannot be passed over."
