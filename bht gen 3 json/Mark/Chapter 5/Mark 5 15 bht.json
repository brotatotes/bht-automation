Notably, St. Matthew does not include this account, but thanks to the other Gospel writers, we are given a detailed and fascinating description. This Undesigned Coincidence highlights how one Gospel assumes familiarity with a particular detail that is only revealed through the others. The man, who was previously tormented and naked, is now clothed and sitting calmly in his right mind. His healing is no ordinary sight; he looks intensely and purposefully at Jesus, recognizing the cause of his transformation. However, those who witnessed this miraculous event became afraid. They saw the same man who was previously possessed and feared his eerie powers, yet now he was transformed and seated at Jesus' feet. The remarkable change instilled both awe and fear in the onlookers. This story serves as a reminder that not all who witness God's power are willing to surrender themselves to Him. Some prefer to distance themselves from Him, even at the expense of missing out on His salvation.",
