This plea must have confused those present, as they witnessed Jesus commanding the demons to come out of the man. However, the delay in the demon's obedience served a purpose, allowing Jesus to display His power and accomplish His purposes. Through the imperfect form of the verb, the simultaneousness of Christ's exorcism, the outbreak of demoniac malice, and the cry of the tormented man is emphasized. The demons, reluctant to return to their true home of torment, resisted Jesus' command. Yet, Jesus would not permit them to dwell where Satan does, for He binds the strong man armed and dispossesses him with His mighty power. It is by His grace and Spirit that Jesus sanctifies the heart and makes it a proper dwelling place for Himself through faith.",
