Mark's account of this event, which includes the unique details of the dividing of the fishes and the taking up of fragments, shows that he had a distinct perspective not found in other gospels. Jesus' question, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, was not a literal demand, but rather a test of the disciples' faith and an opportunity for the forthcoming miracle to occur. It is worth noting that the mention of two hundred pennyworth of bread may carry symbolic significance, representing the high cost required to satisfy the hunger of the crowd.",
