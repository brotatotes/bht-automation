            "The unbelief of Nazareth did not stop our Lord's activity. This circuit was closely connected with the sending forth of the Twelve (Mark 6:7); hence it seems to be identical with that mentioned in Matthew 9:35, if we refer the latter to a distinct journey.",

As a human, it was not surprising that he would feel astonishment at their unbelief, especially considering his divine knowledge and accurate insight into the human heart. Interestingly, he had previously marveled at the great faith of a Roman centurion, showing the stark contrast between expected and unexpected belief. It is worth noting that while Mary, the mother of Jesus, could be excused for her momentary unbelief, there is no evidence that she ever lost faith in her wonderful Son.
