In fact, they were to rely on the hospitality of others, rather than providing for themselves. This directive was not only a practical instruction, but also a reminder for the disciples to maintain a mindset of faith and trust in God throughout their ministry. Jesus wanted them to be unencumbered by worldly concerns and to have their minds set solely on their mission.
