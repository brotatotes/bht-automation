This word symbolized a gift to God, but in this context, it permitted individuals to withhold resources from their parents. This was a deceptive tactic that the Pharisees justified, claiming that the person's possessions were now dedicated to God and therefore couldn't be used for the support of their parents. Jesus rebukes this practice, pointing out that it disregards the commandment to honor one's parents and undermines the intention of providing for family members in need.",
