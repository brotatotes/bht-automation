The act of setting aside traditions does not simply dismiss or disregard them, but rather carries a weight that invalidates the word of God. This understanding sheds light on the gravity of the situation, emphasizing the importance of remaining steadfast to the truth of God's commandments rather than being bound by human traditions and vows which may lead to transgressions.",
