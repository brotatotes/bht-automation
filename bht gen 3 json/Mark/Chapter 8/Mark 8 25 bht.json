The fact that the man with restored sight sought out Jesus highlights the importance of actively seeking Him. The gradual nature of the cure emphasizes the involvement of other agencies and removes the notion of magical influence. The significance of the man's restored sight lies not just in his ability to see clearly, but in the continuous and complete restoration of his vision. The term distant radiance emphasizes that he was able to see the farthest things clearly.
