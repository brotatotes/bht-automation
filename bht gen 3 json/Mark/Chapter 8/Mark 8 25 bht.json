            "bht": "In Mark 8:25, we see a unique example of a progressive cure, illustrating similar methods in the spiritual kingdom. Like the other recorded cases of sight being restored, the patient came to Jesus seeking healing. However, it is also noteworthy that sometimes Christ is found by those who do not actively seek Him. In this particular case, the man fixed his eyes on definite objects, seeing thoroughly and clearly, even far-off things. The use of the different tenses and forms of the Greek verbs emphasize the completeness and continuing action of the restoration. Some manuscripts even suggest that the man saw things plainly and radiantly. This gradual process of healing serves to dispel any notion of magical influence and reminds us that the work of grace often involves other agencies and is not always manifested in the same way for everyone. Ultimately, through the work of the Holy Spirit, sinners are opened to the light, enabling them to see the Scriptures, the Savior, and the beauty of creation in a new and transformative way. As we seek the Father in prayer, study the Word, and participate in the ordinances of faith, our doubts and uncertainties will be dispelled, and we will see all things clearly in the flood of light that fills the universe.",
