The voice from heaven called Jesus the beloved Son, emphasizing how dear and precious He was, and commanded the disciples to listen to Him. This event was a pivotal moment, with Mark's account capturing the vividness and intensity of the occasion. In this remarkable display, a radiant cloud cast its shadow upon them, evoking images of the glory that had accompanied the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness. It is significant that this cloud departed at the death of Moses, highlighting the supremacy and authority of Jesus. Ultimately, this revelation served as a profound lesson, urging the disciples and us today to give heed to the words of Jesus above all else, even surpassing the significance of the great prophets Moses and Elijah.",
