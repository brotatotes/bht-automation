The denouncement of Jechoniah being childless in Jeremiah 22:30 is not to be taken literally, but rather refers to the fact that no one from his descendants would prosper as a king in Judah. The mention of Zerubbabel in Matthew 1:12 is intriguing, as 1 Chronicles 3:19 states that Zerubbabel is the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel. It is possible that this is a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may have raised up seed for his brother according to the law. Despite the confusion, it is important to understand that God's grace continued to shine on the nation of Judah, even in their dispersion.",
