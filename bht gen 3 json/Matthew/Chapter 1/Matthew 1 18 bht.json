During this time, the betrothed woman would remain in her father's house until the bridegroom came to fetch her. Chrysostom suggests that the conception was purposely kept private to protect Mary from slanderous suspicion. It is important to note that the words of (by) the Holy Ghost were added by the Evangelist to emphasize the fact of the matter. The Holy Ghost's role in the conception of Jesus highlights the reality of the Holy Ghost as a living and conscious Person. The fact that Mary was betrothed to Joseph means that she was already considered as legally married, and breach of faithfulness during this period was deemed as adultery. The supernatural birth of Jesus, begotten by the Holy Spirit, becomes more understandable when one accepts the reality of Christ's pre-existence and incarnation. Ultimately, believing in the love and power of Almighty God is crucial in accepting the wonderful narratives of Jesus' birth.",
