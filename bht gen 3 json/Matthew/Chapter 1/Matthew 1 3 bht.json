These women, who are of Gentile origin or dubious character, may serve as types of the mother of Jesus and they introduce the calling of Gentiles and sinners by our Lord. Through this genealogy, Matthew emphasizes the unsearchable riches of God's grace, as exemplified by Jesus' ability to reach out to even the publicans and harlots and bring them into the lineage of David. By including these women and David's emphatic title as David the king, Matthew establishes the connection between Jesus and the Messianic throne. Although there may be omissions in the genealogy, the correctness of the list is proven by the mention of Tamar, who played a significant role in the line of the Messiah. This highlights the astonishing goodness of God, as He chose to pass His inheritance through those who had stains in their genealogy. Ultimately, this genealogy showcases God's purpose to save Gentiles as well as Jews through the Messiah.",
