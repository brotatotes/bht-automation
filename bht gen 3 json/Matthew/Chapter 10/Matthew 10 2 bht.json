Although the other Gospel writers focus on the appointment of the apostles, Matthew highlights their mission and gives their names here. The term apostles is used for the first time in this passage, signifying those who are sent forth. It is interesting to note that Peter, who later became the foremost among the apostles, is listed first, while Judas Iscariot, the betrayer, is listed last. Yet, it must be acknowledged that Peter's primacy is one of honor and influence, not of jurisdiction. The Church of Rome's claim of the primacy based on this verse is flawed, as they fail to prove that wicked apostles can succeed Peter. Overall, this passage introduces the names of the twelve apostles and characterizes their first preaching and healing tour without Jesus.",
