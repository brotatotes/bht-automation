            "From the days of John the Baptist un!now (i. e. inclusively, from the beginning of his preaching), the kingdom of heaven is pressed into, and violent persons\u2014eager, ardent multitudes\u2014seize on it.",
            "But our Lord does not mention this so much to commend the violent persons, as to shew the undoubted fact that He that should come was come.",
            "Thus this verse connects with ver. 28, 'Come unto Me all,' and with Luke xvi. 16, 'every man presseth into it.'"
        ],
        "Albert Barnes": [
            "There was a great rush or a crowd pressing to hear John.",
            "Since 'the kingdom of heaven,' or 'the gospel,' has been preached, there has been a 'rush' to it.",
            "People have been 'earnest' about it; they have come 'pressing' to obtain the blessing, as if they would take it by violence."

        "Marvin Vincent": [
            "Christ speaks of believers. They seize upon the kingdom and make it their own.",

            "It appears, therefore, that the Gospel, which comes forward in a manner so sudden and extraordinary, and awakens powerful emotions, must have proceeded from God.\" ",
            "A vast assembly of men is now collected, as if men were rushing violently forward to seize the kingdom of God; for, aroused by the voice of one man, they come together in crowds, and receive, not only with eagerness, but with vehement impetuosity, the grace which is offered to them.\" ",
            "Let us also learn from these words, what is the true nature and operation of faith. It leads men not only to give, cold and indifferent assent when God speaks, but to cherish warm affection towards Him, and to rush forward as it were with a violent struggle."

        "Philip Schaff": [
            "The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, or \u2018is assaulted by storm\u2019... and the violent (those making the effort) take it by force (actually succeed in entering in).\" ",
            "Although John belonged to the old economy, the new (\u2018the kingdom of heaven\u2019) was already on earth, and the first evidence of its coming was the preaching of John and the excited interest it had aroused.",

            "and which was further seen, in the manner it did all this; suddenly, secretly, powerfully, and effectually, and yet not against the wills of men; and by such instruments as the apostles were, poor, sinful, mortal men; despised by the world, and attended with opposition and persecution.",
