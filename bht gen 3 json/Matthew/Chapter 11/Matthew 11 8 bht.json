            "He meant to say that John was a man of a different stamp - coarse in his exterior, hardy in his character, firm in his virtue, suited to endure trials and privations, and thus qualified to be the forerunner of the toiling and suffering Messiah."

John was not a flatterer nor had he drawn back from his testimony to Jesus to escape from prison or from any selfish motive. Thus our Lord defends His forerunner from the suspicion of the multitude."

            "No, behold they that wear soft clothing, or, as Luke says, are 'gorgeously apparelled'; to which he adds, and live delicately, are in kings' houses, or 'courts'; not in a desert, where John came preaching, nor in a prison, where he now was.",
            "He was no light, inconstant, flattering person, as generally courtiers are; had he, he would not have been in a prison; it was for his uprightness and faithfulness, in reproving Herod the king, that he was in such a place and condition.",
