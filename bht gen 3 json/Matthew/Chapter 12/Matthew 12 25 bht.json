            "Just as a nation or kingdom may embrace within itself infinite parties, divisions, discords, jealousies, and heartburnings: yet, if it is to subsist as a nation at all, it must not, as regards other nations, have lost its sense of unity; when it does so, of necessity it falls to pieces and perishes.",

The kingdoms are so set parallel with one another, that the denial of the reality of the one with its chief, or the supposing it founded merely in assent on the part of our Lord to Jewish notions, inevitably brings with it the same conclusions with regard to the other."
