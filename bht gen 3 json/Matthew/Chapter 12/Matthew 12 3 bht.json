Jesus pointed out that David's hunger and need justified his disobedience of the law, and therefore the disciples were also justified in satisfying their hunger on the Sabbath. By referring to this well-known biblical example, Jesus not only defended his disciples but also challenged the Pharisees' knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures, suggesting that they should have been familiar with this incident. Furthermore, Jesus highlighted the principle that acts of necessity do not violate the ceremonial laws when they do not infringe upon godliness. Thus, Jesus skillfully used David's actions to both defend his disciples and expose the Pharisees' legalistic mindset.",
