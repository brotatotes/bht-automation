Despite its unlawfulness, the high priest himself assented to David's request. This situation is brought up to support the argument that it could not be considered criminal for Jesus' disciples to pluck and eat a few ears of corn on the Sabbath, an action that was lawful for any man to do. The showbread, consisting of twelve loaves that represented the twelve tribes of Israel, was placed on a table in the holy place as a symbol of the communion between God and men. It is important to note that these actions of David and Jesus' disciples were done out of necessity and while in distress. The showbread was only to be eaten by the priests, but in these instances, it was permitted due to the extenuating circumstances.",
