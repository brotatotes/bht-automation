            "However, be it what it will, Jonas was three days and three nights in the belly of it; which agrees with the account in the above mentioned place, and is the sign Christ speaks of in the foregoing verse; and a very great sign and miracle it was, that being swallowed down by such a fish, he should remain in the belly of it three days and three nights, as one dead; for, without a miracle, he could not have lived an hour.",
            "To solve this difficulty, and set the matter in a clear light, let it be observed, that the three days and three nights, mean three natural days, consisting of day and night, or twenty four hours, and are what the Greeks call \u03bd\u03c5\u03c7\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1, 'night days'; but the Jews have no other way of expressing them, but as here; and with them it is a well known rule, and used on all occasions, as in the computation of their feasts and times of mourning, in the observance of the passover, circumcision, and divers purifications, that \u05de\u05e7\u05e6\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05db\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05d5, 'a part of a day is as the whole'.",
            "Christ was laid in the grave towards the close of the sixth day, a little before sun setting, and this being a part of the night day preceding, is reckoned as the whole; he continued there the whole night day following, being the seventh day; and rose again early on the first day, which being after sun setting, though it might be even before sun rising, yet being a part of the night day following, is to be esteemed as the whole; and thus the son of man was to be, and was three days and three nights in the grave."

This verse refers to the time that Jonah spent in the belly of the whale, which was a miraculous sign and a foreshadowing of Christ's own death and resurrection. The phrase in the heart of the earth simply means the grave, emphasizing the complete entombment of Jesus. The expression of three days and three nights is typically understood as three natural days, which the Jews considered as a whole. It is important to note that the Jewish method of reckoning time allowed for any part of the day and night to be counted as a whole, which helps to account for the seemingly different ways of counting the time period. The main focus is on the fulfillment of the sign and the powerful parallel between Jonah's experience and Christ's mission.",
