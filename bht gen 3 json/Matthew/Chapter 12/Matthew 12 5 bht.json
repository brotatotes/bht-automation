Jesus asks the Pharisees if they have not read in the law how the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and yet are blameless. The double offerings and the preparation of the showbread required a significant amount of work on the Sabbath for the priests. Even circumcision, which is a religious duty, had to be performed on the Sabbath when the eighth day of a child fell on that day. It is clear that the duties of piety are not inconsistent with each other. The holiness of the spiritual temple exempts its worshippers from blame while they perform the duties of godliness.
