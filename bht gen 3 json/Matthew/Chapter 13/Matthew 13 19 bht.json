The sower, representing Christ and His servants, scatters the seed indiscriminately in various places. However, as the seed is being sown, the evil one, symbolized by the birds, snatches away the word from the hearts of those who hear it. These passing thoughts and desires are the work of Satan, who relentlessly strives to prevent the word from taking root. This parable highlights the responsibility of the individual in receiving and nurturing the seed within their heart. It calls for active, personal engagement in understanding and internalizing the word, guarding against the distractions and temptations that seek to hinder its growth. Ultimately, the seed's effectiveness in producing fruit relies not on its inherent nature but on the willingness and readiness of the individual to receive it.",
