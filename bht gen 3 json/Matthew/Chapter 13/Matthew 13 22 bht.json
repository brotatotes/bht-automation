These thorns represent the pleasures, desires, anxieties, and cares of the flesh that distract and corrupt individuals. The pursuit or possession of wealth, in particular, can deceive and lead people away from the word of God, leaving them unfruitful. It is essential for each person to recognize and uproot these thorns from their hearts in order to prevent the choking of God's word and to maintain a fruitful and thriving spiritual life. Riches, in their false promises and inability to satisfy, often act as thorns that afflict and divert individuals from the straight and narrow path. Ultimately, the parable highlights the importance of diligently guarding against the harmful influences that threaten to choke our spiritual growth.",
