This serves as a reminder that evil exists in the world and that the presence of false believers within the church is not surprising. The response of the servants, who offer to gather up the weeds, shows their concern for the true members of the church, wanting to protect them from the harmful influence of the false believers. However, it also highlights the danger of acting out of zealousness and carnal heat. The presence of weeds in the church, identified as those who have the form of godliness but lack the power, calls for discernment and wisdom in distinguishing between true believers and those who are merely pretenders.",
