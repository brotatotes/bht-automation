This fortress where John was held captive was perched on a high hill, offering a commanding view of the Dead Sea, the Jordan River, and Jerusalem. Even though Herodias was the niece and sister-in-law of Herod Antipas, John boldly censures their incestuous relationship, demonstrating the unwavering fortitude that servants of God should possess in the face of corrupt rulers. Despite the disagreeable nature of his counsel, John fulfills his duty as a prophet, unafraid of incurring the tyrant's displeasure. The imprisonment of John, as if he were a criminal, serves as a testament to the audacity of Herod's actions. Ultimately, we are reminded of the moral courage and faithful witness that followers of God should display in all circumstances.",
