Even though he had the ability to swim, his fear overwhelmed him, leading him to cry out to Jesus for salvation. This cry was urgent and filled with faith, as Peter recognized that only the Lord could save him from his sinking state. It is noteworthy that Peter's sinking was a result of him shifting his focus from Jesus to the storm around him. While being physically near Jesus is not enough, being near Him by faith is crucial. Ultimately, Peter's experience reminds us that even in our moments of doubt and weakness, we can still call out to Jesus in faith, knowing that He is able to save us in our most desperate moments.",
