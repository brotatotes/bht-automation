First, Philip, Herodias's former husband, was still living. Second, Herod's former wife was also alive and had fled upon hearing of his intention to marry Herodias. Third, Antipas and Herodias were already related within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity. Although John the Baptist's bold condemnation of this marriage ultimately cost him his life, it is commendable that he fearlessly stood for righteousness and spoke the truth. While Herod's fear of the people kept him from retaliating against John, we see that deep down, he was aware of the prophet's significance and the gravity of his words.",
