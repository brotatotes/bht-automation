While some scholars question the idea of two similar miracles, it is plausible that Jesus could perform such miracles in different places.

The disciples focused on the lack of bread needed and the fact that they were in a deserted place. However, given the previous miracle, they should have remembered that Jesus is capable of providing abundantly.
