It conveys the threats and promises that are applicable to all times of the Church. By equating the commandments of men with God's requirements, the religious leaders rendered their worship empty and revealed the superficiality of their countless observances. This exemplified their disregard for the divine law and their self-seeking nature. It is clear that true worship requires a heart that is close to God and not solely focused on outward rituals. Isaiah aptly describes this when he says, Their heart they have removed far from me.",
