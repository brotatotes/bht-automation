The passage from Isaiah speaks not only to the immediate context of Jesus' time but also to the timeless nature of the Church. It exposes the shallow nature of their rituals and the insincerity of their worship, which lacks love, faith, and genuine devotion to God. Their external displays of piety are empty when their hearts are far from Him. This serves as a reminder that true worship requires an intimate relationship with God, rather than mere adherence to outward rituals.",
