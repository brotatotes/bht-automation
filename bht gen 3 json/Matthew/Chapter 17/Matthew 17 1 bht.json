These disciples, specifically Peter, James, and John, formed an inner group who displayed a deeper understanding of Jesus. This intimate group foreshadows their later presence with Jesus during the agonizing moments in the Garden of Gethsemane. The transfiguration itself held great significance, showing that Jesus willingly offered Himself for death, rather than being unwillingly dragged into it. The choice of three witnesses aligns with the requirement set by the Law, emphasizing the truth of what they witnessed.
