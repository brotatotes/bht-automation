            "This was the voice of God... This was spoken to confirm the disciples; to make known to them that it was their duty to hear Christ rather than any other... and to strengthen their faith in him when they should go forth to preach the gospel after he was shamefully put to death.",

            "A luminous cloud, not dark like that on Sinai. It was analogous to the pillar of cloud by day and fire by night in the wilderness and to the Shekinah of the Old Testament; a symbol of the glory resting on the New Testament Church, separating between the holy and the unholy, and a type of the splendor of the New Jerusalem.",
            "A bright cloud could render them invisible as readily as a dark one.",
            "Obey Him, as well as listen to Him. Hear Him, more than law or prophecy (Moses and Elijah). Their remaining carnal Messianic hopes were thus opposed."

            "This cloud, which is said to be a 'bright' one, was a symbol of the divine presence, and a token of the love, grace, and favour of God; and expressive of the brightness and clearness of the Gospel dispensation, in distinction from the obscurity of the legal one.",
            "He was his beloved Son, when he was made flesh and dwelt among men, while submitting to ordinances, as to baptism, and obeying his Father's will, when covered with reproach, and full of sorrows; when he hung upon the cross, and laid down his life for his people; which he showed, by concealing nothing from him; by putting all things into his hands, and by appointing him the head of the church, the Saviour of the body, and the judge of quick and dead.",
            "This divine testimony, first his sonship is bore witness to, and then his several offices; which his sonship is the foundation of, and qualifies him to bear and execute. So that these words, 'hear ye him', most clearly point to Christ, as being this prophet, who is to be heard, and he only."
