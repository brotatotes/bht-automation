It seems that the words spoken by Jesus to Peter on Mount Hermon had inflated his sense of leadership, leading him to even rebuke Jesus. Furthermore, the tax-collectors had singled out Peter as representing the group, indicating that the primacy of Peter was not yet acknowledged by the others. This conversation about rank and status reflects their misunderstanding of the Kingdom of God as a temporal one instead of a spiritual one.
