This illustration teaches us that when a sheep goes astray, the Shepherd is reluctant to lose it and will actively seek it out. Just as a wandering star is called a planet, the wandering sheep represents those who have strayed from the path of duty. As disciples, we should learn from this parable and fulfill our duty to gather those who have gone astray back onto the right path. This parable also prompts us to reflect on the Son of man coming into the world to seek and save the lost. Ultimately, we are encouraged to rejoice when lost ones return, just as a man rejoices when he recovers something he thought was lost forever.",
