While the customary practice may have been far from this standard, Jesus calls us to transcend the limited mindset and embrace forgiveness as a qualitative and boundless act. Whether the idiom seventy times seven denotes 490 or 77, the message remains the same - forgiveness should have no limits. Love is not to be confined by numbers or calculations; instead, it should flow freely and generously. Thus, we are to continually forgive others as long as there is a need and an acknowledgment of fault. May we extend forgiveness without restriction, for no fixed number of times can set bounds on the grace and mercy we are called to demonstrate.",
