That he may appear at his own time as the Savior of Judea, he is compelled to flee from it, and is nourished by Egypt, from which nothing but what was destructive to the Church of God had ever proceeded. Who would not have regarded with amazement such an unexpected work of God?",
            "Joseph needed to be thus strengthened, so as to conclude with certainty, that God would not only conduct him in the journey, but that, during his banishment, God would be his constant protector... [so] he enjoyed serenity of mind during his sojourn in Egypt."

It is remarkable how the very land that was once a place of bondage for the Jews has now become their land of safety. This unexpected work of God, in which the Savior of Judea is compelled to flee from it, surpasses all worldly wisdom. Joseph's faith in God's constant protection allowed him to remain calm during his time in Egypt, knowing that God was his guardian. This demonstrates that sometimes God preserves His people in ways we cannot anticipate or understand. Moreover, the emphasis on the child's preservation highlights the divine nature and purpose of Jesus, who was not yet ready to fulfill his ultimate mission.
