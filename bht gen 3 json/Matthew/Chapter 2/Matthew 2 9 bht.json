However, it is also possible that the star guided them over the whole town of Bethlehem. The use of popular language in the scriptures allows for this broad interpretation. God orchestrated the appearance and disappearance of the star to ensure the safety of the child and to prevent Herod from discovering his whereabouts. It is speculated that the star was a luminous meteor, possibly a miraculous sign. The star not only guided the wise men to the town, but it also led them to the place where the child was. Some suggest that this place could have been a cave or even a stall beneath the inn.
