The paragraph incorporates many of the commentators' words to reflect their thoughts about the verse.\n\nIn Matthew 21:29, the rudeness and disobedience of the son's initial answer demonstrate a reckless resistance against God. The Greek words used convey a distinction between remorse for the consequences of one's actions and true repentance. The one who ultimately did the father's will is the one who repented, emphasizing the transformative nature of genuine repentance. The presence of free will is questioned here, as man naturally lacks the will to do good. However, without God's grace, no external factors, such as powerful ministries or severe judgments, can bring about repentance. True repentance involves evangelical conversion and spiritual instruction, along with a genuine belief in Christ and hope for pardoning grace and mercy.",
