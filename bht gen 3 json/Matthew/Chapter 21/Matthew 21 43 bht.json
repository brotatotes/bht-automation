This pronouncement signifies the rejection of the Jews by God and the transfer of His favor to the faithful Church, including Gentiles.

However, this statement should comfort the God-fearing, as the perpetuity of the kingdom of God brings solace. It reminds us that the Gospel is meant to bear fruit and not remain unproductive. The kingdom of God being taken away refers to the removal of the Gospel from the Jewish nation, physically as well as in a spiritual sense, as it continued and flourished for a while but would eventually be removed. In God's plan, the Gospel would never be completely eradicated from the world and will be given to another nation.",
