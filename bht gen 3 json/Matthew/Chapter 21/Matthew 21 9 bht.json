            "Hosanna in the highest - This may mean either 'Hosanna in the highest, loftiest strains,' or it may be for a prayer to God 'Save now, O thou that dwellest in the highest heaven, or among the highest angels.'",
            "Perhaps the whole song of hosanna may be a prayer to the Supreme God, as well as a note of triumphant acclamation: 'Save now, O thou supremely great and glorious God; save by the Messiah that comes in thy name.'",
            "The word 'peace' is used here as significant of joy, triumph, exultation at this event. There will be increased peace and rejoicing in heaven from the accession of the redeemed: there will be augmented glory - new songs of praise 'among the highest angels.'"

            "Now as it was mean and uneducated men by whom the kingdom of Christ was called the kingdom of David, let us hence learn that this doctrine was at that time well known, which in the present day appears to many to be forced and harsh, because they are not well acquainted with Scripture."

            "Hosanna in the highest, i.e., May our Hosanna be ratified in heaven... The crowd with enthusiasm thus nail Him as the Messiah, probably cherishing political hopes."

            "Hosanna \u2014 (Lord save us) was a solemn word in frequent use among the Jews. The meaning is, 'We sing hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is he, the Messiah, of the Lord. Save. Thou that art in the highest heavens.'",
            "Our Lord restrained all public tokens of honour from the people till now, lest the envy of his enemies should interrupt his preaching before the time."
