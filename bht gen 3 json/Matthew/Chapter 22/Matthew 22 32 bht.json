            "Says R. Simai, from whence is the resurrection of the dead to be proved out of the law? From Exodus 6:4 as it is said, 'I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan: to you' it is not said, but 'to them'; from hence then, the resurrection of the dead may be proved out of the law.",
            "Thus our Lord having to do with the same sort of persons, fetches his proof of the doctrine of the resurrection out of the law, and from a passage which respects the covenant relation God stands in to his people, particularly Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and which respects not their souls only, but their bodies also, even their whole persons, body and soul."
