In response, the king sends his armies, which refers to the Roman armies, to destroy their city. The city in question is Jerusalem, which had previously been known as the city of the Great King. However, now it is referred to as their city, signaling the loss of its special status. This destruction is seen as God's judgment and vengeance against those who had rejected the king's invitation and harmed his prophets.
