The picture painted here is one of spiritual energy being blighted or chilled by a malignant or poisonous wind, resulting in the love of the brotherhood giving way to mutual hatred and suspicion. This chilling effect on love and trust is attributed to the cruelty of persecutions, the betrayals by fellow Christians, the influence of false teachers, and the prevailing immorality of the times. While this prophecy may not have been literally fulfilled in the first century, it is believed that it will find complete fulfillment in the future during the great Apostasy. The principle we can draw from this is that wickedness and immorality have the power to destroy love and eat away at the heart of Christianity. However, amidst the abounding iniquity, there will always be some whose love for Christ and for his Gospel remains steadfast.",
