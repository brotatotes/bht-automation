On that day the gates of the cities were usually closed (Nehemiah 13:19-22), besides travelling on that day would expose them still more to Jewish fanaticism. The Jewish Christians, up to the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, observed the Jewish Sabbath, and might scruple to travel more than the Sabbath day\u2019s journey (about an English mile). Our Lord\u2019s anxiety is not for the observance of the Jewish Sabbath, but for His people."

However, it is important to note that Jesus did not mention the Sabbath to endorse its observance, but rather to address the practical difficulties and scruples that might arise for his disciples. Furthermore, the reference to the destruction of Jerusalem as an intermediate fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy highlights the impending calamities that the disciples would face. Jesus encourages them to pray that their flight does not occur in winter, which would make it more arduous and potentially hinder their escape from danger. Additionally, the mention of the Sabbath reflects the potential hesitations and constraints that some disciples may have had in making a journey on that day. Nonetheless, our Lord's concern lies not in upholding the Jewish Sabbath, but in ensuring the safety of his people during the impending chaos.",
