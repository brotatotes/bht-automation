            "If it be objected, that such reasoning would overthrow and set aside the miracles by which both the Law and the Gospel were ratified, I reply, that the Spirit engraved on them an undoubted mark, which removed from believers all doubt and fear of being mistaken."

In the context of the Jews expecting the Messiah to deliver them from Roman oppression, it is important for believers to discern the true Christ from those claiming to be the Messiah. The disciples initially believed that the second Advent would immediately follow, but this verse does not negate the idea of Christ's visible personal coming. We must not be deceived by falsehoods disguised in the name of God, for they lead to despair and madness. The presence of miracles does not guarantee truth, as the Spirit distinctly marked the miracles by which the Law and the Gospel were authenticated. Just as during the time of the siege, false Messiahs sprung up and incited people to stay rather than flee or surrender. Even after the city was destroyed, others continued to claim to be the Messiah. Therefore, when someone declares, Lo! here is Christ, or there, we must not believe it.",
