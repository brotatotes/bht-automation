The verse urges servants to do their duty at the appointed time and not delay, reminding them that their higher rank comes with a heavier burden and a stronger obligation to strive with utmost zeal and industry. The servant is called a steward, which is very fitting for Apostles and ministers of the Word. They are called to be wise and well-instructed in divine things, making Christ the main subject of their ministry and rightly dividing and giving everyone their proper portion of the Word of God.
