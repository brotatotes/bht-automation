The believers were destined to suffer for their faith, and this was evident in the martyrdom of James, the brother of John, as well as the execution of Peter, Paul, and James the Lord's brother. Christians were even despised by the Roman emperor Nero for the crimes they were falsely accused of. This hatred was not a one-time event but continuous, as highlighted by the phrase ye shall be hated to emphasize the ongoing process. The oppression and pressure on the early Christians were the tribulations they faced. It is disheartening that the most glorious name in the world would soon become a byword of shame. The disciples would be betrayed and brought before synagogues, prisons, rulers, and kings, just as Jesus foretold. In fact, most apostles died due to persecution, bearing witness to the fulfillment of these prophecies. The hatred of all nations towards Christians was palpable, and Tacitus, the Roman historian, even referred to them as a detested race. This universal abhorrence has not ceased and may reemerge in a striking manner.",
