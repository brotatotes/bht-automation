The virgins in this parable represent faithful souls who have come out from the world and are waiting for the coming of the Lord. They bear lamps, filled with the oil of God's Spirit, nourishing their inner spiritual life. This parable emphasizes that it is not about having a dead faith or merely a lamp without light. Rather, it speaks to the need for believers to remain faithful and watchful, eagerly awaiting the Lord's Second Coming. The ten virgins carrying the lamps with wooden stems and dishes on top represent believers who are both the Bride and the Bridal Attendants, symbolizing their intimate union with Christ. While the number ten may hold no particular significance, it is likely that there were ten virgins because this was the number commonly seen in wedding processions. Overall, this parable highlights the importance of being prepared and watchful for the suddenness of Christ's return, as believers should not be caught off guard but should eagerly anticipate His coming.",
