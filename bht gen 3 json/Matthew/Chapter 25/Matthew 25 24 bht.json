However, this excuse is false at heart because God provides the grace needed to follow His commands. Some see a connection between this parable and the first one in Matthew, emphasizing that God expects fruit where He has sown. However, this expectation is not beyond the capability of those enabled by God. The servant, in his belief that his master is a hard and harsh man, reflects the secret thoughts of men who view God as a difficult Master and place blame on Him for their own fruitlessness. It is important to note that the word used to describe the master as hard carries a stronger negative connotation than the word used in Luke 19:21. In reality, God is not a hard and exacting Master but rather one who graciously gives His gifts and empowers His servants.",
