Though the verse does not specifically mention healing or release, it emphasizes the value of visitation, which can provide comfort and support to those facing trials. This act of visiting the sick was highly regarded by the Jews, who believed it to be a virtuous action that would be greatly rewarded in the future. Just as the Rabbis expressed, visiting the sick is seen as preserving life and avoiding damnation. Thus, Jesus underscores the importance of compassionately caring for those who are suffering by visiting them and offering support in their time of need.",
