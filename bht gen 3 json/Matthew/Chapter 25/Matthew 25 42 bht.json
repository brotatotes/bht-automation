Not providing food to the hungry represents a failure to show compassion and care. The repetition of the negative emphasizes the severity of this neglect, as if it were the final nails on a coffin. What is most striking is the surprise shown by both the sheep and the goats. Some sheep may doubt their own identity, thinking they are goats, while some goats may believe they are sheep. This suggests that outward appearances can be deceiving, and even those who profess to follow Christ may fail to display genuine love and faith. Those who neglect the needs of others, despite claiming the Christian name, are ultimately revealed to have no true faith or love for Christ. As a result, they are justly condemned, for their lack of grace and compassion reveals their unworthiness of the kingdom of heaven.",
