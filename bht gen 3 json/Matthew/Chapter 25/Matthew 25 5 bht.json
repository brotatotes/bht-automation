            "Some understand this verse of sleep in death. But, not to mention that this will not fit the machinery of the parable (see below on ver. 8), it would assume (they all) that none of the faithful would be living on earth when the Lord comes."

            "But I take it more simply as denoting earthly occupations, in which believers must be engaged, so long as they dwell in the body;",

While the servant believed there was plenty of time and the Lord would procrastinate, the virgins thought the Bridegroom would arrive soon and saw no need for extra oil. This parable highlights the spiritual slumber that can affect even the holiest Christians, with their wakefulness being compared to a sort of slumber. However, it is important to note that this passage does not imply that all Christians will be spiritually asleep when Christ returns. Instead, it emphasizes the necessity of being prepared and vigilant. The state of slumber described in the verse represents a decline into inactivity and a deliberate yielding to it after resisting. This slumber affected both the wise and foolish virgins until the cry of the Bridegroom's approach awoke them. The use of different tenses, such as nodded and slept, vividly portrays the gradual progression of slumber. Ultimately, this passage underscores the need to stay spiritually awake and ready for Christ's return, as it will be unexpected by all.",
