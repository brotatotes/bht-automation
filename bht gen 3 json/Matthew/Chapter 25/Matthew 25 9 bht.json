They pleaded with the wise virgins to share their oil, but it was simply not possible. Each person can only have as much of God's provision as will supply their own needs; it is not something that can be shared or given away. The wise virgins understood this and refused to sell their oil, explaining that if they were to share it, both would be undone. While it may seem unkind or uncaring, this refusal was a necessary reminder of the proper way of obtaining the needed and precious oil. The foolish virgins had missed their opportunity to acquire it and now had to face the consequences of their neglect. The Greek language used in this passage reflects the certainty that there would not be enough for both parties, using double negatives to emphasize the impossibility of the situation. The time for obtaining the oil had passed, and now they had to face the reality that there was simply not enough. This serves as a reminder that we must not neglect the opportunity to seek and acquire the necessary provisions for our spiritual journey, as there may come a time when it is too late to obtain them.",
