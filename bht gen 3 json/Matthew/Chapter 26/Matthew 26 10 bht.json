It was an excellent and morally beautiful deed that would be spoken of in churches for generations to come. Though some disciples saw it as unnecessary or wasteful, Jesus recognized its true value and praised the love and devotion behind it. This highlights the challenge of allowing others the freedom to express themselves and the tendency to prioritize utility over genuine acts of love. Just as Mary's action cut her to the heart when it was criticized, believers today can feel deeply hurt when their sincere love for Christ is met with indifference or judgment. Nonetheless, true acts of love, rooted in faith and performed for the glory of God, possess the essentials of a good work, regardless of others' opinions.",
