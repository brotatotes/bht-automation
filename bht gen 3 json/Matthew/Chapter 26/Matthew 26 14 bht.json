            "To inquire here whether or not Satan entered into Judas bodily is an idle speculation. We ought rather to consider how fearfully monstrous it is, that men formed after the image of God, and appointed to be temples for the Holy Spirit, should not only be turned into filthy stables or sinks, but should become the wretched abodes of Satan."

The fact that Jesus's death was being foretold in His mention of His burial should have softened Judas's heart, but instead, he allowed his desire for wealth to blind him.
