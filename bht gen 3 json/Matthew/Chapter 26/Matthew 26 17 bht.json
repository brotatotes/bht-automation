This was not just any ordinary time of sacrificing the Passover, but a significant moment when two feasts, the Passover feast and the feast of unleavened bread, were rolled into one. According to some interpretations, Jesus ate the Passover meal at the regular time, around 6 PM on the 15th of Nisan, and it was on this day that he was crucified. By adhering to the Law, even at his final hour, Jesus showed his commitment to deliver humanity from its yoke. The disciples, Peter and John, came to Jesus to inquire about the meal, as they were the only ones aware of Judas's betrayal. Their obedience to their Master's instructions led them to seek a suitable house for the Passover, as the location was not specified.
