This revelation, mentioned by Matthew, Mark, and John, was not recorded by Luke, who focused more on other aspects of the supper. However, it was John who provided a detailed account of the events that unfolded. The betrayal that Jesus foretold was an act of incredible baseness, as Judas was both meditating on betraying Jesus and participating in the sacred meal. This treachery was even more detestable because it came from one of Jesus' closest friends. Although Luke presents this saying of Christ after the supper, it is important to note that the exact order of events may not be strictly adhered to by the Gospel writers. Nevertheless, the significance of this moment cannot be understated, and it serves as a reminder of the solemnity and gravity surrounding the act of betrayal.",
