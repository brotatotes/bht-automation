Judas heard it, yet still proceeded with his hellish arrangement with the Sanhedrin. While the prophecy implies the purpose, it is important to remember that God's purposes also include our freedom. Our Lord, in His pity for Judas, declares woe unto that man. The expression Good were it for that man is a proverbial phrase representing a most terrible destiny with no possibility of deliverance. We must always remember that the death of Christ was not an accidental occurrence, but rather an ordained sacrifice for the expiation of the sins of the world. Through God's providence, even wicked men like Judas are compelled to carry out His will, despite their own desires and intentions. Nonetheless, this concept of God's sovereignty and damnation of the reprobate may appear contradictory to human reason. Yet, Christ's death perfectly aligns with the Scriptures written about Him, demonstrating His purpose in dying for the sins of His people. The phrase The Son of man goeth signifies the voluntary nature of His death, in perfect agreement with the divine determinations. Ultimately, it is said that it would have been better for Judas to have never been created, emphasizing the severity of his punishment. We can't help but wonder if the same may be said for every person who finally perishes, which raises questions about the doctrine of universal salvation.",
