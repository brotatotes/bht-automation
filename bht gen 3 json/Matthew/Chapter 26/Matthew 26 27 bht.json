            "Without shedding of blood, was no remission of sins under the old covenant: and blood was, throughout, the covenant sign of forgiveness and acceptance. Now all this blood of sacrifice finds its true reality and fulfillment in the blood of Christ, shed for the remission of sins.",

            "But those childish cavils yield no support to their impiety; for nothing can be more absurd than that believers should, of their own accord, part with the aids which the Lord has given, or allow themselves to be deprived of them; and, therefore, nothing can be more intolerable than this wicked mangling of the mystery."
