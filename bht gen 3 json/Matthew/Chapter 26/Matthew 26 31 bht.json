This statement also alludes to the rejection and piercing of the Shepherd mentioned in other Scriptures, making it clear that Jesus is referring to himself as the Messiah. This prediction of the disciples' stumbling and falling away echoes the faith failure that would occur both among them and the Jews after rejecting the smitten Shepherd. While the statement was addressed to all, it is likely that Jesus directed it to Peter in particular, who needed extraordinary consolation to avoid being overwhelmed with despair after denying Christ. Without Jesus' prayer for them, their faith would have failed. Thus, the sufferings of Christ, symbolized by his smiting, were part of God's plan and executed with justice, and it is within that context that the disciples would falter and stumble.",
