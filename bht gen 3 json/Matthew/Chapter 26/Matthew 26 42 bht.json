However, there is a subtle difference in this prayer as it reflects His complete surrender to the will of the Father. Despite knowing that God always hears Him, Jesus acknowledges the continuation of His trial as an answer to His previous words. He utters, If it is not possible... Thy will be done, displaying a fullness of self-resignation. It is as if, having conquered fear, He approaches the Father with even greater boldness, prepared to fulfill His role.
