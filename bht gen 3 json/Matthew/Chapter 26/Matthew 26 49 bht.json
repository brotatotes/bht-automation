            "The salutation he gave him was wishing him all health, prosperity, and happiness. The Syriac version renders it, 'peace, Rabbi'; and the Persic, 'peace be upon thee, Rabbi'; which was the very form of salutation the disciples of the wise men gave to their Rabbins.",
            "In Mark 14:45, the word 'Rabbi' is repeated, this being usual in the salutation of the Jewish doctors; and the rather used by Judas under a pretence of doing him the greater honour, and of showing the highest respect, and strongest affection for him.",
