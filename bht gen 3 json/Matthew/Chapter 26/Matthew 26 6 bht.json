The commentators speculate whether he may have been the owner of the house or related to Martha, but these theories are uncertain. Nonetheless, it is clear that Simon was an important person as he was a guest at the dinner. As for the anointing of Jesus, the Gospel accounts differ in certain details, such as whether it was his head or feet that were anointed, but this does not contradict their overall narrative. The anointing takes place as Jesus draws near to Jerusalem, where he will soon suffer and die for the salvation of sinners. This story also serves as evidence of Jesus' healing power and his willingness to dwell with those whom he heals. (51 words)",
