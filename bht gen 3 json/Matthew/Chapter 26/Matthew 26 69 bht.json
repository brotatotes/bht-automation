Peter, standing in the hall, is accused by a damsel of being with Jesus the Galilean. This accusation is likely based on his previous association with John and Jesus on the streets of Jerusalem. Peter, warming himself by the fire, is caught off guard by the accusation, causing him to deny his association with Jesus. This denial takes place in the lower part of the hall, where servants and a maid are gathered. However, even in this seemingly insignificant moment, Peter's denial has significant consequences.
