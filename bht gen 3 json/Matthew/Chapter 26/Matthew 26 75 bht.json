Peter's denial fulfilled Jesus' prophecy of denying him before the Father in heaven, and it was the look from Jesus that brought Peter back to his senses, causing him to weep bitterly in true penitence. This tragic event serves as a reminder that even genuine believers may stray and fall into sin, but the grace of God is always available for those who sincerely repent, just as Peter did. Through this example, we learn that our repentance does not have to be perfect but it must be sincere, and it is the loving gaze of the Lord that initiates true repentance in our hearts.",
