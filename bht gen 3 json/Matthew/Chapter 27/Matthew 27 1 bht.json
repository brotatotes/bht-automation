If necessary, to make the vague charge, that Jesus claimed to be King of the Jews (Matthew 27:11). This was the ground on which they forced Pilate to consent. 3. Another charge mentioned by John (John 19:7), that He claimed to be the Son of God, may have been determined on, in case He denied the political character of His Messiahship. But it had no effect, and the other accusation was resumed."
