Some commentators suggest that Jesus chose to remain silent because he was aware of his innocence and knew that the charges against him could not be proven. His silence would not have convinced his accusers or helped Pilate's desire to release him. But we must consider that God had determined that Jesus, who was sinless, would be condemned as guilty in our place, so his silence served a greater purpose. It allowed him to become our advocate and intercessor, enabling us to be delivered from condemnation. He was silent so that through his grace, we can boast that we are made righteous.",
