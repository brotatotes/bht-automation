        "bht": "With silent dignity, Jesus refused to answer the charges brought against him by the Jews, impressing Pilate with his composure. Despite being innocent and lacking evidence of guilt, Jesus chose not to defend himself, surprising everyone with his meekness. This unexpected response not only amazed Pilate, but also led to a newfound respect between him and Herod. Jesus' silence continued until just before the final decision, and Pilate, accustomed to the vociferousness of those accused, marveled at Jesus' patience and fearlessness in the face of false accusations that could cost him his life.",

            "That a man, who at other times had such fluency of speech, and readiness of expression, who both for matter and words, and also weight and authority, spake as never man did: and who had so often silenced the Scribes and Pharisees, men of the greatest learning among the Jews, of which Pilate, doubtless, had knowledge, should say nothing in his own defence.",
            "He marvelled at the patience of Jesus, that he could hear such notorious falsities, and which so affected his character, and his life, and say nothing to them; and at the fortitude of his mind, at his being so regardless of his life, and fearless of death."
