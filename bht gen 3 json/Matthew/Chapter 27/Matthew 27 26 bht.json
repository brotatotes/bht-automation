            "But as this is a display of the dreadful vengeance of God, so, on the other hand, it holds out to us the most abundant grounds of confidence; for we have no reason to fear that our sins, from which the Son of God acquits us by so valuable a ransom, will ever again be brought into judgment before God."

This act of scourging was a cruel display of divine justice, symbolizing the scourges and strokes that Jesus endured in his soul as the surety for his people. Despite Pilate's role as a judge, he condemned the innocent and released the guilty, ultimately succumbing to the pressures of religious fanaticism. This serves as a cautionary tale for rulers who pander to popular opinion at the expense of justice.
