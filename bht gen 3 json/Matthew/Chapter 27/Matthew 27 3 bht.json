            "Wicked men are far from such a feeling; for they would desire to sin without intermission, and even, as far as lies in their power, they endeavor to deceive both God and their own conscience.",

His awakened conscience served as a powerful example, demonstrating the importance of true repentance. However, those around him refused to acknowledge the question of Christ's innocence, proclaiming that Judas's sin and conscience were his own responsibility. While he returned the money out of a sense of remorse, true repentance requires a change of heart and life. Judas's actions revealed that his motives were rooted in avarice, not a genuine desire for Christ's glory. Instead of leading him to the Savior, his sorrow led him to the gallows. This lack of expectation for such a calamitous outcome suggests that Judas did not anticipate the full consequences of his actions. The remorse he experienced was focused on the consequences, rather than the sin itself, highlighting the key difference between remorse and repentance.",
