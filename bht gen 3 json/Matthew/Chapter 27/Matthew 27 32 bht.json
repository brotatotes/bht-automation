In his place, the soldiers compelled, or rather impressed, Simon of Cyrene, a man coming from the country, to carry the cross. Simon, a peasant of humble rank, was chosen for this detestable task, highlighting the disgrace associated with crucifixion. Yet, in mentioning his name, country, and even his children, the Evangelists acknowledge God's elevation of Simon from the lowest dregs of society to an important role in Christ's journey to the cross. Just as Jesus went without the camp to suffer without the gate, Simon, an ordinary man, was called to participate in the extraordinary act of bearing Christ's cross. Thus, the act of taking up the cross and following Christ, though difficult and repugnant to our human nature, is a necessary part of our journey as believers.",
