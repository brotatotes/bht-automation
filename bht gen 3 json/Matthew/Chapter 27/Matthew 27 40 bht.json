Such taunting of one executed has been repeated often enough, and does not, in itself, show that these spectators were worse than the mass of men.",

            "If thou art the Son of God. Another reference to the proceedings before the Sanhedrin (chap. Matthew 26:64). The taunt is in a poetic form (Hebrew parallelism); and the crowds at an execution in the east are said to give vent to their feelings in this way still."

            "Seeing his followers believed in him as the Son of God, and he had owned himself to be so before the sanhedrim, they require a sign of it by his power, and to do that which they believed no mere man in his situation could do; which shows, that they had no other notion of the Son of God, but that he was a divine person.",
            "But his sonship was not to be declared by his coming down from the cross, which he could have easily effected, but by a much greater instance of power, even by his resurrection from the dead; and no other but that sign was to be given to that wicked and perverse generation."
