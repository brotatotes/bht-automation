            "Whether these words are to be taken in all their strictness is doubtful. Of course, over the whole globe the darkness would not be supernatural\u2014as it would be night naturally over half of it."

            "This darkness was noticed by one at least of the pagan writers. Phlegon, a Roman astronomer, speaking of the 14th year of the reign of Tiberius, which is supposed to be that in which our Saviour died, says 'that the greatest eclipse of the sun that was ever known happened then, for the day was so turned into night that the stars appeared.'"

            "Meanwhile, let us learn that, when they were bewitched by the enchantments of Satan, the glory of God, however manifest, was afterwards hidden from them, or, at least, that their minds were darkened, so that, seeing they did not see."

            "It was a representation of that darkness that was now on the soul of Christ, expressed in the following verse; as well as of the eclipse of him, the sun of righteousness, of the glory of his person, both by his incarnation, and by his sufferings."
