The significance of their response lies in the deep-rooted belief that Elijah, as prophesied, would come before the Messiah. Their mockery served to deny Jesus' true identity as the Messiah, deliberately taunting him and deriding his power. This taunt was not a misunderstanding or fear of Elijah's actual arrival, but a deliberate act to belittle Jesus and undermine his authority. The close resemblance between Eli and Elijah in the original Hebrew heightened the sting of their sarcastic denial.
