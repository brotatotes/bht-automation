Though some have debated whether his dying words in different Gospels should be identified or distinguished, a closer examination confirms that Jesus willingly gave up his life at the appointed time and in the way he chose. The fact that the evangelists use the phrase breathed out his life instead of he died suggests a deliberate release of his life and a testament to his divine authority. By uttering a loud cry, Jesus demonstrated the profound impact of bearing the sins of the world, including the physical rupture of his heart. This cry, together with the preceding events, marked the completion of his work of atonement and the opening of salvation to believers. In his final moments, Jesus commended his spirit to God, exemplifying the faithful trust in God's care that all believers can emulate in their own deaths.",
