However, the second-tier commentary points out that if the soldiers were truly asleep, they wouldn't have been able to catch the thieves or even acknowledge their own negligence. The skeptical tone of the third-tier commentary highlights the implausibility of this claim, as it questions the intelligence of a group of men risking their lives to steal Jesus' body, only to then spread a lie about His resurrection.
