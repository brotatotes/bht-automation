The first-tier commentary emphasizes the exclusivity of the Coming One's role in baptizing and describes the fiery nature of the Spirit's operations on the soul. John, recognizing his unworthiness, compares himself to the lowest of servants and feels inadequate to even take off the sandals of the Coming One. The second-tier commentary further explains that the baptism of the Holy Spirit refers to the inward work of conversion, purification, and guidance. It also highlights the rapid and transformative effects the Coming One's ministry will have on people's lives. The third-tier commentary reiterates the superiority and greatness of the Coming One, emphasizing John's humility and magnifying the distinction between master and servant. It references the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, where the fire-like appearance signified the powerful and purifying influences of the Spirit. Overall, the verse and the commentary offer insights into the extraordinary nature and transformative power of the Coming One's baptism in the Holy Spirit and fire.",
