            "But the fourth Gospel gives us one more piece of information here, on the authority of one who saw and testified of it: 'John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and IT ABODE UPON HIM.'",
            "And when with this we compare the predicted descent of the Spirit upon Messiah (Isaiah 11:2), 'And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him,' we cannot doubt that it was this permanent and perfect resting of the Holy Ghost upon the Son of God\u2014now and henceforward in His official capacity\u2014that was here visibly manifested."
