            "The Hebrew word \u05d8\u05d1\u05dc Tabal which is rendered by the word 'baptize,' occurs in the Old Testament in the following places, namely: [list of verses]. It occurs in no other places; and from a careful examination of these passages its meaning among the Jews is to be derived.",
            "In none of these cases can it be shown that the meaning of the word is to immerse entirely. But in nearly all the cases the notion of applying the water to a part only of the person or object, though it was by dipping, is necessarily to be supposed."

            "That men may come forward, in a right manner, to be baptized, confession of sins is demanded from them: otherwise the whole performance would be nothing but an idle mockery.",

            "The manner in which they were baptized by him was by immersion or plunging them in the water: this may be concluded from the signification of the word \u03b2\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03b6\u03c9 where used, which in the primary sense of it signifies to dip or plunge; from the place in which they were baptized, 'the river Jordan'; and from John's constant manner of baptizing elsewhere, who chose places for this purpose, where and because there was there much water.\" ",
            "Even in baptism itself there is a tacit confession and acknowledgment of sin, for it represents the sufferings and death of Christ which were for sin, into which persons are baptized, and profess to be dead to sin thereby; and also the resurrection of Christ for justification from sin, which obliges the baptized person to walk in newness of life.",
            "Now this is the character given of the very first persons that were baptized by John, and ought surely to be attended to, by us; and as much care as possible should be taken, that none but such as have a true sense of sin, and are brought to an humble and hearty acknowledgment of it, be admitted to this ordinance."

        "John Wesley": [
            "Such prodigious numbers could hardly be baptized by immerging their whole bodies under water: nor can we think they were provided with change of raiment for it, which was scarcely practicable for such vast multitudes.",
            "It seems, therefore, that they stood in ranks on the edge of the river, and that John, passing along before them, cast water on their heads or faces, by which means he might baptize many thousands in a day.",
            "And this way most naturally signified Christ's baptizing them with the Holy Ghost and with fire, which John spoke of, as prefigured by his baptizing with water, and which was eminently fulfilled, when the Holy Ghost sat upon the disciples in the appearance of tongues, or flames of fire."
