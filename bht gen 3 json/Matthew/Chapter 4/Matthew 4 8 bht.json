            "In this last temptation the enemy reveals himself openly, as the Prince of this world, and as the father of lies: for though power is given him over this world and its sons, his assertion here is most untrue."

            "A scene was presented to our Lord's natural eye seems plainly expressed.",
            "To limit this to the most extensive scene which the natural eye could take in, is to give a sense to the expression, 'all the kingdoms of the world,' quite violent.",
            "It was permitted to the tempter to extend preternaturally for a moment our Lord's range of vision, and throw a 'glory' or glitter over the scene of vision."

            "It is not known what mountain this was. It was probably some elevated place in the vicinity of Jerusalem, from the top of which could be seen no small part of the land of Palestine.",

            "All the kingdoms of the world; not to be restricted to Palestine, a narrower meaning which \u2018world\u2019 occasionally has, but never in such a phrase. It becomes intelligible on the theory suggested: actual vision with added rhetorical description."

            "This wonderful panorama had to be partially mental and imaginative, since the devil caused to pass in review 'all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.'",
            "But this fact does not prove that all phases of the temptations were subjective without any objective presence of the devil. Both could be true.",

            "By 'all the kingdoms of the world' are meant, not only the Roman empire, as Dr. Lightfoot thinks, though that was, to be sure, the greatest in the world at that time; but all the kingdoms in the whole world, which subsisted in any form, whether within, or independent of the Roman empire; or whether greater or lesser: and by 'the glory of them', is meant, the riches, pomp, power, and grandeur of them.",
            "Now the view which Satan gave Christ of all this, was not by a representation of them in a picture, or in a map, or in any geographical tables, as some have thought...but this was a fictitious, delusive representation, which Satan was permitted to make; to cover which, and that it might be thought to be real, he took Christ into an high mountain; where he proposed an object externally to his sight, and internally to his imagination, which represented, in appearance, the whole world, and all its glory.",
            "The word \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b7, used by Luke 4:5 sometimes signifies a mathematical point, which Zeno says is the end of the line, and the least mark; to which the allusion may be here, and designs the smallest part of time that can be conceived of...If this could be thought to be a true and exact account of a moment, or point of time, it was a very short space of time indeed, in which the devil showed to Christ the kingdoms of this world, and their glory."

It is important to note that the vision presented to Jesus was not merely a mental or imaginative one, but a supernatural and vivid panorama of all the kingdoms of the world.
