            "Is not Satan thrice called by our Lord Himself, 'the prince of this world'...Does not the apostle call him 'the god of this world'? And still further, is it not said that Christ came to destroy by His death 'him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil'?...No doubt these passages only express men's voluntary subjection to the rule of the wicked one while they live, and his power to surround death to them, when it comes, with all the terrors of the wages of sin. But as this is a real and terrible sway, so all Scripture represents men as righteously sold under it.",
            "But how does he deliver this 'to whomsoever he will?' As employing whomsoever he pleases of his willing subjects in keeping men under his power.",
            "No Scripture, it will be observed, is quoted now, because none could be found to support so blasphemous a claim. In fact, he has ceased now to present his temptations under the mask of piety, and he stands out unblushingly as the rival of God Himself in his claims on the homage of men."

            "The proposal was bold, but in the contest between them it must come to this. Satan at last offers all he could, but throwing away all disguise, asks from One tempted in all points like as we are, what he asks from us."

            "The temptation was threefold: to gain a temporal, not a spiritual, dominion; to gain it at once; and to gain it by an act of homage to the ruler of this world, which would make the self-constituted Messiah the vice-regent of the devil and not of God."
