            "Our Lord is speaking of the sin of adultery, and therefore, however the saying may undoubtedly apply by implication to cases where this sin is out of the question, yet the direct assertion in this verse must be understood as applying to the cases where this sin is in question.",
            "And again, 'hath adulterously used her already in his heart,' whatever it may undoubtedly imply respecting the guilt incurred in God\u2019s sight, does not directly state anything; but plainly understood, affirms that the man who can do this has already in his heart passed the barrier of criminal intention; made up his mind, stifled his conscience; in thought, committed the deed.\" ",
            "But perhaps there is justice in Stier's remark, that our Lord speaks here after the O.T. usage, in which, both in the seventh commandment and elsewhere, adultery also includes fornication; for marriage is the becoming one flesh,\u2014and therefore every such union, except that after the manner and in the state appointed by God, is a violation and contempt of that holy ordinance."
