            "Accordingly, our translators sometimes render such words 'the humble' [...] 'the meek' [...] 'the lowly', as having no reference to outward circumstances.",
            "But here the explanatory words, 'in spirit', fix the sense to 'those who in their deepest consciousness realize their entire need.'",

            "Blessed are the poor in spirit - The word 'blessed' means 'happy,' referring to that which produces felicity, from whatever quarter it may come.",
            "To be poor in spirit is to have a humble opinion of ourselves; to be sensible that we are sinners, and have no righteousness of our own; to be willing to be saved only by the rich grace and mercy of God; to be willing to be where God places us, to bear what he lays on us, to go where he bids us, and to die when he commands.",
            "It is remarkable that Jesus began his ministry in this manner, so unlike all others. Other teachers had taught that happiness was to be found in honor, or riches, or splendor, or sensual pleasure. Jesus overlooked all those things, and fixed his eye on the poor and the humble, and said that happiness was to be found in the lowly vale of poverty more than in the pomp and splendors of life."

            "Others explain the poor in spirit to be those who claim nothing for themselves, and are even so completely emptied of confidence in the flesh, that they acknowledge their poverty.",
            "It deserves our attention, that he only who is reduced to nothing in himself, and relies on the mercy of God, is poor in spirit: for they who are broken or overwhelmed by despair murmur against God, and this proves them to be of a proud and haughty spirit."
