            "They are the expression of the yearning for redemption of the sons of God (Rom. viii. 28), and so are fitly placed at the end of the prayer, and as the sum and substance of the personal petitions."

            "It is surprising that this clause, which agrees so well with the rest of the prayer, has been left out by the Latins: for it was not added merely for the purpose of kindling our hearts to seek the glory of God, and of reminding us what ought to be the object of our prayers; but likewise to teach us, that our prayers, which are here dictated to us, are founded on God alone, that we may not rely on our own merits."

            "For, 'we ask all this of Thee because,' thine, by right and possession, is the kingdom, the blessed dominion for which we pray, and the power, omnipotence, ability to answer, and the glory, the glory prayed for in the first petition which is the end of all our petitions."
