        "Albert Barnes": [
            "Fasting, then, is the natural expression of grief... It is because the soul, when oppressed and burdened by a sense of sin, is so filled with grief that the body refuses food.",
            "It is also useful to humble us, to bring us to reflection, to direct the thoughts away from the allurements of this world to the bliss of a better.",

        "John Calvin": [
            "He does not enjoin us to counterfeit splendor, or exhort us to temperance in food in such a manner, as to encourage the luxuries of ointments and of dress: but merely exhorts us to preserve moderation, without any thing new or affected;\u2014in short, that the fastings, in which we engage, should make no change in our accustomed way of living.",
            "Prayer holds the first rank among the antics of piety: but fasting is a doubtful operation, and does not, like alms, belong to the class of those actions which God requires and approves.",

            "Fasting as an aid to prayer and meditation, and a wholesome discipline, is a religious duty, and has a place in Christian practice.",

            "Now these practices they used, that they might appear unto men to fast: so that either they did not really fast, when they pretended to it; only put on these outward appearances, that men might think they did.",
            "For their view in fasting was not to satisfy their own consciences, or please God, but that they might have glory of men. Hence, says Christ, verily I say unto you, they have their reward; they obtain what they seek for, honour from men, and that is all they will have."
