This rule, which summarizes the teachings of the Old Testament, requires us to put ourselves in others' shoes and consider what actions we would expect from them in a given situation. It goes beyond simply acting in ways that we selfishly desire, but instead calls us to exercise impartial judgment and consider what is reasonable and just. By following this rule, we are called to self-sacrifice at each step, which may be challenging for many. However, it is essential for living out the righteousness of the kingdom.
