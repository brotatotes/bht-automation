True discipleship involves aligning one's actions with God's will, going beyond empty words. Genuine obedience and a transformed life grounded in faith are necessary for entering the eternal glory of God's Kingdom. Mere acknowledgment of Christ as Lord is insufficient; it must be accompanied by wholehearted devotion. The contrast between talkers and doers serves as a reminder to live out one's faith in every aspect of life.",
