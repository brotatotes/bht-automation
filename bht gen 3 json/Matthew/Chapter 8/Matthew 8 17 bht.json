            "Diseases themselves, on which those miracles, are all so many testimonies to existence, and types of the effect, of sin.",
            "The very act of compassion is (as the name imports) a suffering with its object; and if this be true between man and man, how much more strictly so in His case who had taken upon Him the whole burden of the sin of the world, with all its sad train of sorrow and suffering."

            "The word translated 'griefs' in Isaiah, and 'infirmities' in Matthew, means properly, in the Hebrew and Greek, 'diseases of the body.' In neither does it refer to the disease of the mind, or to sin.\" ",
            "To bear those griefs is clearly to bear them away, or to remove them. This was done by his miraculous power in healing the sick.",
            "The word rendered 'sorrows' in Isaiah, and 'sicknesses' in Matthew, means 'pain, grief, or anguish of mind.' To 'carry' these is to sympathize with the sufferers; to make provision for alleviating those sorrows, and to take them away."

            "This passage is the corner-stone of the faith - cure theory, which claims that the atonement of Christ includes provision for bodily no less than for spiritual healing.",
            "Matthew may be presumed to have understood the sense of the passage he was citing from Isaiah, and he could have used no word more inadequate to express his meaning if that meaning had been that Christ took away infirmities."

            "He gave sight to the blind, in order to show that he is 'the light of the world.'",
            "Following out this analogy, let us connect those benefits, which Christ bestowed on men in the flesh, with the design which is stated to us by Matthew, that he was sent by the Father, to relieve us from all evils and miseries."

            "Hence it is manifest, that according to the mind of the ancient Jews, this passage belongs to the Messiah, and is rightly applied to him by the evangelist.",
            "Though the prophet chiefly designs to point out Christ taking upon him, and bearing the sins of his people, in order to make satisfaction for them, and to save them from them; yet so likewise, as to include his bearing, by way of sympathy, and taking away by his power, the bodily diseases of men."
