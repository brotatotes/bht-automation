This occurrence holds symbolic significance and offers comfort and faith-strengthening during times of danger and doubt. The men possessed by demons sought solace in the tombs due to their inherent madness, and the eerie and desolate surroundings of the cliffs and caves on the eastern side of the lake catered to their inclination. The presence of these madmen made the region dangerous and avoided by people. The disciples' lack of faith contrasts with the power of Jesus, who demonstrated his divine ability by subduing the possessed and freeing them from their torment. It is crucial to note that while Matthew mentions two possessed individuals, the other accounts refer to one, indicating that they all describe the same miraculous incident.",
