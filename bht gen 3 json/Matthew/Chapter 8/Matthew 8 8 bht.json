            "And if such a man was unworthy, having been an idolater, and lived a profane course of life, that Christ should come into his house, and be, though but for a short time, under his roof; how much more unworthy are poor sinful creatures (and sensible sinners see themselves to be so unworthy), that Christ should come into their hearts, and dwell there by faith, as he does, in all true believers, however vile and sinful they have been?",
            "But speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed... he signifies that if he would but speak a word, the least word whatever; or, as Luke has it, 'say in a word'; let but a word come out of thy mouth, and it will be done."
