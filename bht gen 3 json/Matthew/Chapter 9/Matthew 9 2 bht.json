            "This destitution of doors and lights from the streets, though it gives their dwellings a sombre appearance, is yet adapted to the habits of retirement and secrecy among the people of the East, where they are desirous of keeping their 'females' from observation.",
            "The perseverance they had manifested was the evidence of their faith or confidence in his power to heal the sick man.",

            "The only way of obtaining deliverance from all evils is to have God reconciled to us. It does sometimes happen, that wicked men are freed from their distresses, while God is still their enemy: but when they think that they have completely escaped, the same evils immediately return, or more numerous and heavier calamities overwhelm them, which make it manifest that they will not be mitigated or terminated until the wrath of God shall be appeased."

            "Son, be of good cheer. Words of affectionate address, fully given by Matthew alone. 'Son' implies that a new relation was now to exist between them, since Christ thus addressed His chosen disciples (Mark 10:24). The 'good cheer' came before the bodily healing, as a result of a purely spiritual blessing.",
            "Thy sins are forgiven. A positive declaration, 'they have been, and are now forgiven.' Certainly not a concession to the popular notion that such sickness was a direct judgment for sin. There is no proof that the disease was in this case the fruit of indulgence. The man\u2019s conscience was aroused through his sickness; our Lord first of all gives him spiritual health; afterwards bodily health; proving His authority to pardon by His power to cure, He thus places 'forgiveness' not only before but above miraculous healing.",
