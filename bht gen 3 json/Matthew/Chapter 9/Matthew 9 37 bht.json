Recognizing the plenitude of the harvest and the scarcity of laborers, Jesus emphasized the need for more divinely-qualified laborers to gather souls to Him. Jesus, as the Lord of the harvest, appointed His disciples and later, other holy laborers, to engage in the work of spreading the Gospel and saving lost sinners. It is vital for us to trust in Jesus' power to pardon and save, for He alone holds the authority to forgive transgressors. We must wholeheartedly embrace our role as laborers and recognize that our weak faith not only hinders our ability to see the abundant harvest but also limits the number of laborers available.",
