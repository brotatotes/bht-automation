But this he will not press, though by a delicate reference to it, he gives force to the appeal which he is making.",

It appears probable that Philemon\u2019s conversion was wrought by the apostle\u2019s preaching at Ephesus, for St. Paul seems up to this time not to have been in Coloss\u00e6. And he speaks to Philemon of his \u2018own self,\u2019 that he may remind him how paltry the consideration of money gain or loss must be in comparison of the salvation of that which alone of man is to know immortality."
