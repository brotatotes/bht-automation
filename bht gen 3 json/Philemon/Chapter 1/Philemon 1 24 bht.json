It may well have been the most fruitful period of the apostle\u2019s life, for from his own lips the Roman soldiery learnt the story of the Cross, while the self-sacrificing zeal of his Christian companions was ready to undertake any duty that would prove them deserving of the name of fellow-labourers."

Mark, once a source of displeasure for Paul, had become profitable to him for the ministry. Demas, however, later deserted Paul for the love of the world. Despite being a prisoner, Paul and his companions, including these co-workers, continued to spread the Word of God. The zeal and self-sacrificing nature of these individuals made the two years in Rome an incredibly fruitful period for Paul. It is a reminder that one should not be too confident in the zeal of a single year and should pray for steadfastness in the face of worldly temptations.
