            "bht": "The apostle Paul writes with a sense of deep sorrow in this passage, expressing his concern for his dear friend Epaphroditus who was sick and on the brink of death. This shows that Paul, despite his apostolic authority, did not possess a permanent gift of miracles or inspiration but rather relied on the Spirit's guidance for each specific situation. He felt the weight of sorrow, both from the possibility of losing Epaphroditus and from his own imprisonment. It is notable that this is the only instance of sadness in an otherwise joyous epistle. Paul describes this sorrow as wave after wave, emphasizing the mounting and overwhelming nature of his grief. Nevertheless, God showed mercy by restoring Epaphroditus to health, not through a miraculous intervention but through ordinary means. This account affirms the genuineness of Paul's writing and highlights the depth of his emotions.",
