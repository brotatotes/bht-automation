            "He emptied Himself of the form of God [not His essential glory, but its manifested possession.",
            "He was not a man pure and simple, and nothing else, but the Son of God manifest in the flesh and nature of men."

            "His subjection to the law and to His parents, His low state as a carpenter, His betrayal for the price of a bond-servant, and slave-like death to relieve us from the slavery of sin and death, finally and chiefly, His servant-like dependence as man on God, while His divinity was not outwardly manifested, are all marks of His 'form as a servant.'"

        "Albert Barnes": [
            "The essential idea is that of bringing to emptiness, vanity, or nothingness; and, hence, it is applied to a case where one lays aside his rank and dignity, and becomes in respect to that as nothing; that is, he assumes a more humble rank and station.",
            "The language before us fairly implies that he laid aside that which was expressive of his being divine - that glory which is involved in the phrase 'being in the form of God' - and took upon himself another form and manifestation in the condition of a servant.",
            "His object is to state the depth of humiliation to which he descended, and this was best done by saying that he descended to the lowest condition of humanity and appeared in the most humble garb."

            "He was content to forego the glories of the Creator, and to appear in the form of a creature; nay, to be made in the likeness of the fallen creatures; and not only to share the disgrace, but to suffer the punishment, due to the meanest and vilest among them all.",
            "He emptied himself \u2014 Of that divine fullness, which he received again at his exaltation. Though he remained full, yet he appeared as if he had been empty; for he veiled his fullness from the sight of men and angels.",
            "Taking \u2014 And by that very act emptying himself. The form of a servant \u2014 The form, the likeness, the fashion, though not exactly the same, are yet nearly related to each other. The form expresses something absolute; the likeness refers to other things of the same kind; the fashion respects what appears to sight and sense."
