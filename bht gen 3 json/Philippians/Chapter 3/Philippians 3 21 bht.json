            "The A.V. seems to countenance the stoic contempt of the body. Compare Colossians 1:22. The biographer of Archbishop Whately relates that, during his last illness, one of his chaplains, watching, during the night at his bedside, in making some remark expressive of sympathy for his sufferings, quoted these words : 'Who shall change our vile body.' The Archbishop interrupted him with the request 'Read the words.' The chaplain read them from the English Bible; but he reiterated, 'Read his own words.' The chaplain gave the literal translation, 'this body of our humiliation.' 'That's right, interrupted the Archbishop, 'not vile - nothing that He made is vile.'",
            "As the body of Christ 's glory is a spiritual body, this word is appropriate to describe a conformation to what is more essential, permanent, and characteristic. See 1 Corinthians 14:35-53.",
            "Hence the perfected heavenly state as depicted by John is thrown into the figure of a city, an organized commonwealth. The verb is thus in harmony with ver. 20. The work of God in Christ is therefore not only to transform, but to subject, and that not only the body, but all things."

            "And now who would but follow such persons, who are citizens of heaven, have their conversation there, look for Christ the Saviour from thence, Philippians 3:20, who when he comes will raise the dead in Christ first, put such a glory on their bodies as is on his own."
