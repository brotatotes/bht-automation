Smyrna, bitter suffering, yet sweet and costly perfume, the martyr period of the Decian and Diocletian age. Pergamos, the Church possessing earthly power and decreasing spirituality from Constantine's time until the seventh century. Thyatira, the Papal Church in the first half of the Middle Ages; like 'Jezebel,' keen about its so-called sacrifice of the mass, and slaying the prophets and witnesses of God. Sardis, from the close of the twelfth century to the Reformation. Philadelphia, the first century of the Reformation. Laodicea, the Reformed Church after its first zeal had become lukewarm."
