His voice, on the other hand, was described as the terrifying rush of many waters, highlighting its power and authority. In comparing his voice to the roar of the ocean, nothing could be a more sublime description of his majesty and sovereignty. This voice both comforts his friends and strikes fear into his enemies. The image of burnished brass, resembling a metal unknown to us, further emphasizes the refinement and intensity of his feet as they tread upon his foes. The significance of the voice and feet in this verse can be seen in their representations of Christ's power, authority, and judgment.",
