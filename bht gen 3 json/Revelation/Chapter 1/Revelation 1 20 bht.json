In a lonely island; far away from the homes of people; surrounded by the ocean, and amid barron rocks; on the day consecrated to the purposes of sacred repose and the holy duties of religion - the day observed in commemoration of the resurrection of his Lord, it was most fit that the Redeemer should appear."

These symbols convey the idea that faithful teachers in the churches are like stars, beings of light, symbolizing their lordship. Moreover, the term angel is transferred from heavenly to earthly ministers of God, and angels of the churches represent the churches themselves. The seven golden candlesticks in this verse are identified with the stars, signifying that the churches are lampstands reflecting Christ's light to the world. These symbols and their hidden meanings are part of the mystery revealed in the book of Revelation.
