John's immediate obedience to eat the book highlights his promptness, and the reversal of the order of the results indicates his actual experience--sweetness in the mouth, bitterness in the belly. This effect is not caused by different parts of the book, but rather by the nature of the tidings themselves. Discovering the Lord's love for the Church, yet also realizing their potential to forget Him and become lukewarm, brings both sweetness and bitterness.
