This highlights the mysterious and divine nature of the thunders, which are described as part of the intricate machinery of the Apocalypse. While God's tender mercy withholds some terrors from being revealed, it is clear that other unutterable and horrifying aspects lie in the background. The command to seal up and not write stands in contrast to the injunction in Revelation 22:20. It is suggested that these thunders were so terrible that John was forbidden to impart them to others in this book of Revelation. Through the caution against recording them, it becomes clear that these utterances should not be regarded as the voice of God. Instead, there is a sense that the thunders must be understood in the context of trials before darkness is dispelled and light shines around the suffering church.",
