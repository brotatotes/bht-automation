It forms one of those landmarks by which the legitimacy of various interpretations may be tested; and of which we may say, notwithstanding the contradiction sure to be given to the saying, that every interpretation which oversteps their measure is thereby convicted of error."

The other bodies of light which shine in heaven are therefore called into requisition. By means of them she has light around, beneath, and above her.\" ",
