            "So the dragon, represented by his agent Pharaoh... was ready to devour Israel's males at the birth of the nation.",
            "Antitypically the true Israel, Jesus, when born, was sought for destruction by Herod, who slew all the males in and around Bethlehem."

            "The main idea here undoubtedly is that of power, and the object of John is to show that the power of the dragon was as if it extended to the stars, and as if it dragged down a third part of them to the earth, or swept them away with its tail, leaving two-thirds unaffected.",
            "A power that would sweep them all away would be universal; a power that would sweep away one-third only would represent a dominion of that extent only.",
            "A sufficient fulfillment is found if there was a period when the church, bright, glorious, and prosperous, was apparently about to become greatly enlarged, but when the monstrous pagan power still held its sway over a considerable part of the world, exposing the church to persecution."

            "The Pagan empire, or the Pagan emperors, took every opportunity to stifle the kingdom of Christ in embryo, and to prevent the bringing forth of any illustrious person; and sought to destroy him as soon as he appeared.",

The dragon's actions also allude to the fallen angels. It is notable that this monster-like dragon and its attempts to destroy are reminiscent of the persecution faced by both the early martyrs and the child Jesus.
