The bloodshed represents the slaughter of apostates, not their eternal punishment. The mention of the four quarters signifies the universal extent of the destruction. The use of the term furlong emphasizes the magnitude of the distance covered by the flowing blood. The phrase without the city echoes the sufferings of Christ, who was crucified outside the city gates. The blood pouring out from the winepress reaches up to the horses' bridles, indicating a deep and extensive outpouring. Ultimately, this verse illustrates a divine act of judgment that will bring about the downfall of the Antichristian forces and vindicate the righteous.",
