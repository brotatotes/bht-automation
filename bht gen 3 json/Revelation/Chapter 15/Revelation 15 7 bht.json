            "These vials were given to the seven angels by one of the living creatures, the ministers of the word; from whence it seems that these angels design members of churches, as distinct from ministers; and may intend civil magistrates, and very principal ones, as kings of the earth, who, in this state of things, and times, will belong to the churches, and will be the instruments of destroying antichrist."

The breadth of the bowls suggests the overwhelming suddenness of the coming woes. It is interesting to contrast these bowls, filled with the prayers of the saints, with the sweet-smelling incense in Revelation 5:8. These bowls, rather than vials, are well-suited for the sudden and terrible outpouring of God's wrath. The mention of the ever-living and unchangeable God implies that though there may be perceived delay, His purposes will certainly be accomplished. The redeemed, represented by the living creatures, are depicted as summoning judgment upon their enemies, making this a solemn and awe-inspiring portrayal of the forthcoming events.",
