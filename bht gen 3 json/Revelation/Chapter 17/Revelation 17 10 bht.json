The verse refers to kings who are in a different relation to the beast rather than kings over the woman or the city symbolized by her. The identification of these seven kings is challenging, with Galba, Otho, and Vitellius possibly being excluded due to their brief reigns. It is important to note that the word fallen implies more than a peaceful passing away, but rather speaks of domination overthrown and glory ruined. These seven kings are seen as representing seven world-powers, including Rome, which was existing during John's time. The verse also mentions the eighth, who can be properly reckoned as the seventh. The reign of this eighth king will be short, compared to the six that preceded it and the one that follows. The verse provides comfort to the saints, reminding them of the temporary nature of the dominion of antichristian states.",
