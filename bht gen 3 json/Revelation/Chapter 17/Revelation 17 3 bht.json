This emphasizes that beneath Rome's pomp and luxury, there is desolation. Additionally, the use of the color scarlet in the depiction of the beast and the harlot represents Rome's imperial dignity and authority. Overall, this imagery suggests the influential and controlling role of Rome in the world at that time, particularly during the rise of the papacy.",
