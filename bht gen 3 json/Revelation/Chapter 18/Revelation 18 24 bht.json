In Revelation 18:24, it is revealed that the blood of prophets, saints, and all who have been slain for Christ's sake was found in this city. The city of Rome, both in its pagan and papal forms, was a place where the persecution of Christians and the shedding of innocent blood took place. The violent acts committed against believers in Jesus were not limited to Rome alone but extended far beyond its borders. The city's luxuriousness, idolatry, and its role in suppressing the spread of the Gospel contributed to its ultimate destruction. This verse serves as a reminder of the immense suffering endured by the faithful, and a testament to the justice of God in bringing judgment upon those who perpetuated this violence.",
