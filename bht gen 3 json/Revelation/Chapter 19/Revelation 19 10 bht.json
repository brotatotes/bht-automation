If so, his error was soon corrected. He was told by the angel himself who made these communications that he had no claims to such homage, and that the praise which he offered him should be rendered to God alone.",
            "It should be observed that there is not the slightest intimation that this was the Messiah himself, and consequently this does not contain any evidence that it would be improper to worship him. The only fair conclusion from the passage is, that it is wrong to offer religious homage to an angel.",
            "The sentiment is, that in promoting religion in the world, we are associated with angels. It is no condescension in them to be engaged in the service of the Redeemer, though it seems to be condescension for them to be associated with us in anything; it constitutes no ground of merit in us to be engaged in the service of the Redeemer, though we may regard it as an honor to be associated with the angels, and it may raise us in conscious dignity to feel that we are united with them."

            "the testimony of Jesus, or the Gospel which John and his brethren had, is the very spirit, life, and soul of the prophecy of this book; for as all the prophets bore witness to Christ, so does the Spirit of God in this; or the testimony which they had, and bore to Christ, was equal to the spirit of prophecy with which this angel was endowed."

The angel emphasizes that both he and John, along with their brethren, possess the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy. This distinction is significant because it contrasts with the potential for mistaken reverence and idolatry. John, an apostle himself, was at risk of falling into voluntary humility and worshiping angels. The angel's refusal of worship from John highlights the condemnation of the Roman Catholic practice of invoking saints. Instead, the angel affirms that he and John are fellow servants, both bearing witness to Jesus by the power of the same Spirit. This passage emphasizes the importance of bearing witness to Jesus and recognizing that worship is solely for God.",
