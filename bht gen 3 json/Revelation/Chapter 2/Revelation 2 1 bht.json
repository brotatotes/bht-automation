The Ephesian church may have left their first love by being more focused on the love of this world. Christ, the one who holds fast the seven stars and walks in the midst of the seven candlesticks, warns them to remember where they have fallen, to repent, and do their first works. His charge was temporary but expressed His unwearied activity in the Church, guarding her from internal and external evils. Ephesus was a place of great privilege and great preaching. Christ\u2019s power over the churches as He moves among them is emphasized with these two epithets. The commendation for their patience, opposition to evil, and zeal is accompanied by a reproof for leaving their first love. Christ assures them that whoever overcomes will eat of the tree of life. The address to the angel of the church signifies the church itself as the appointed interpreter and messenger of Christ\u2019s purposes. The Church at Ephesus is not more representative of the universal Church than any other of the seven. Christ's mighty power and care are manifested as He stands in the midst of the golden candlesticks, beholding all their works and thoughts, ready to remove the candlestick if any will not repent.",
