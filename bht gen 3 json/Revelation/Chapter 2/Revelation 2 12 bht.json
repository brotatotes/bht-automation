This language is relevant to the church in Pergamos, where the wickedness and corruption were prevalent, influenced by the city's association with Satan and idolatrous practices. Through this imagery, it is clear that the sword is a symbol of reproof and judgment, intended to expose and combat the evils within the church and the city.",
