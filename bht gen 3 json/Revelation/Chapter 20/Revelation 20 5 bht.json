However, the first-tier commentators believe that it is important to take the words of the passage in their plain sense and chronological order, without distorting their meaning. They argue against disregarding the ancient teachings on the millennium and emphasize the significance of the language used in the passage. It is said that John saw the souls in the act of reviving, signifying a literal resurrection. Furthermore, the millennial reign on earth is seen as consistent with Old Testament prophecy. While there are differing views on the meaning of the rest of the dead, some argue that it refers to the wicked. The second-tier commentators suggest that those who were faithful during challenging times will have a higher position in reward and honor. They also note that the first resurrection does not necessarily resemble the literal resurrection. In the third-tier commentary, it is suggested that the first resurrection is not about spiritual rising but should be distinguished from the living again of the rest of the dead. Ultimately, by carefully considering the distinct thousand years mentioned in Revelation, the commentators believe that the prophecies can be fulfilled without conflicting with one another.",
