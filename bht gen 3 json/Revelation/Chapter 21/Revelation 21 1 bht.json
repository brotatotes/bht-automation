The absence of the sea in this new vision symbolizes a state of solid peace and rest that will prevail, no longer necessary due to the perfected state of man. The old physical world is gone, replaced by a glorious picture of bliss for the saints, contrasting sharply with the lake of fire. While the symbolism should not be taken too literally, there exists a stern and glorious reality behind it all. The new heaven and new earth represent a complete transformation, with a renovated universe that seemed freshly created. It is a new purpose and elevation to a higher state of being that the old physical world serves. In this new creation, the whole world will be inhabitable, with no part given up to the disorder and sin of the ungodly. Ultimately, this passage speaks of an eternal state where the church of the firstborn will be united with Christ, presented as a glorious, spotless church. This new heaven and earth will be a fit habitation for the redeemed, where righteousness prevails and all former things pass away to make all things new.",
