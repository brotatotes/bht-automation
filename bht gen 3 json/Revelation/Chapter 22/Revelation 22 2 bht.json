            "To make good sense, supposing there to be but one tree, we should either, as MEDE, suppose that the Greek for street is a plain washed on both sides by the river (as the first Paradise was washed on one side by the Tigris, on the other by the Euphrates), and that in the midst of the plain, which itself is in the midst of the river's branches, stood the tree: in which case we may translate, 'In the midst of the street (plain) itself, and of the river (having two branches flowing) on this and on that side, was there the tree of life.'",
            "The leaves shall be the health-giving preventive securing the redeemed against, not healing them of, sicknesses, while 'the fruit shall be for meat.' In the millennium described in Ezekiel 47:1-23; Revelation 20:1-15, the Church shall give the Gospel-tree to the nations outside Israel and the Church, and so shall heal their spiritual malady; but in the final and perfect new Jerusalem here described, the state of all is eternally fixed, and no saving process goes on any longer."
