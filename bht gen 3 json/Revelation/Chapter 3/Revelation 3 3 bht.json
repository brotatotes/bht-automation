And it follows on the plain declaration which has been made of that present evil state; coming forcibly and unexpectedly where we should rather have looked for 'But if') thou dost not watch (shalt not have awaked and become watchful, before the time about to be indicated in the threat which is coming), I will come as a thief (these words do not here refer to our Lord\u2019s final coming, but to some signal judgment in which He would overtake the Sardian church.",
