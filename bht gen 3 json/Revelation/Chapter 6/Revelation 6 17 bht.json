The cry of the sinners in terror is mistaken, for their only hope is to keep awake and pray to gain the strength to stand before the Son of Man. This cry is in response to the terrifying signs bursting upon them, and the only possible answer is to heed Jesus' command to be vigilant and prayerful. Ultimately, this day of wrath is a response to the cry of the martyrs and signifies the judgment against the ungodly and persecutors.
