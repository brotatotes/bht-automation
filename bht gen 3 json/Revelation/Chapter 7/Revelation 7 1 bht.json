They are two: (1) That at the period of time here referred to...there would be a state of things which would be well represented by rising tempests and storms...and (2) That this impending ruin was held back as if by angels having control of those winds.",
            "A suspended tempest calamity held in check; armies hovering on the borders of a kingdom, but not allowed to proceed for a time; hordes of invaders detained, or stayed in their march, as if by some restraining power not their own, and from causes not within themselves - any of these things would be an obvious fulfilling of the meaning of the symbol."
