The seal signifies belonging to the Lord, as these individuals are gathered out of the world and prepared to enter the city of God. The parallels with the Old Testament, such as in Exodus and Ezekiel, support this view, as those who are exempted or marked are represented similarly. The number 144,000 signifies fixity and completeness, expressing that the Church is built upon the foundation of the twelve apostles, with Christ being the chief cornerstone. While the interpretation of this number may vary, it is symbolic of full completion and represents the true Israel of God, encompassing all faithful people. Furthermore, it is important to note that the mark of Satan is indiscriminately placed upon his servants, regardless of their race. Overall, this passage emphasizes the sealed and numbered individuals as God's chosen ones, representative of the perfect and complete Church.",
