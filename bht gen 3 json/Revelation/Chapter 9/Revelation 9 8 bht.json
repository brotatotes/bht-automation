It is also noted that the locusts are voracious in their consumption, likened to the devouring jaws of the Romish clergy. Furthermore, the comparison to lions' teeth emphasizes the destructive power of these locusts, who bring desolation and spread terror, much like the Saracens who robbed and pillaged in the past.
