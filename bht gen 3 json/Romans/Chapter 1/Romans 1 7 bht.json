This is significant as it highlights the unity of Jew and Gentile under Christ.

In fact, the juxtaposition of Christ with the eternal God throughout Scripture speaks to the divinity of Christ and the importance of honoring Him. The term saints can be seen in three senses: collectively as all Christians, individually as holy, and as those who are what they are called to be. The use of the ablative case after the verbal adjective further emphasizes the divine teaching and calling. The mention of grace refers not to ministerial gifts or the Gospel, but to an increase of divine favor and the benefits produced in the believers' hearts and lives. On the other hand, peace is not just a mere salutation, but refers to the peace of reconciliation with God and the spiritual blessings that result from it. Overall, this passage presents a powerful picture of God's love, grace, and peace towards His beloved people, who are called to be saints.",

The mention of both God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ emphasizes that grace and peace come from both of them. This association of Christ with the eternal God throughout Scripture reveals the divinity of Christ and the importance of honoring Him. The term saints is understood in three senses: as the collective body of believers, as individually holy, and as those called to be what they are. The use of the ablative case brings forth the idea of divine teaching and calling. The mention of grace refers to an increase in divine favor and the transformative effects it produces in the believers' lives. Likewise, peace is not just a customary greeting but refers to the peace that comes from being reconciled with God and the spiritual blessings that result from it. This verse beautifully underscores God's love, grace, and peace toward His beloved people while emphasizing their calling to be saints.",
