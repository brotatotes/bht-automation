While it may be easier to empathize with someone's sorrows because they need us in those moments, it is the disinterested and noble act to rejoice with others in their joy. Through this, happiness is expanded and multiplied within society, as the Christian body unites to enlarge the sphere of happiness and prolong the joy conferred by religion. The Christian duty to sympathize with one another's griefs is emphasized, demonstrating that sympathy and forgiveness are both challenging virtues which require us to forget ourselves. Ultimately, our goal is to transfer to ourselves the feelings of others and adapt to all kinds of emotions, rejoicing with those who boast in the Lord and finding joy in their prosperity rather than envy or murmuring.",
