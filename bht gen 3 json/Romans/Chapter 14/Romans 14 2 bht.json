This distinction is not about personal preference, but about the strength or weakness of one's faith. The vegetarians are likely concerned about eating food that may have been offered to idols. Paul acknowledges that there are disagreements among these believers, including those who freely eat all things and those who adhere to a stricter diet. The scruples of the Jewish believers may have arisen from their understanding of the law and the penalties for sins of ignorance.
