Additionally, Paul greets Herodion, who is likely a relative and from the same Herod family mentioned earlier. The commentators explain that Narcissus was a distinguished freedman who served Claudius, and although he himself may not have been a believer, it was remarkable that Christ's grace extended to his impure household. It is not mentioned if Narcissus was at home or if he was deceased, but it is noted that not all members of his household were greeted, as not all of them were converted. This reminds us that divine grace often reaches some members of a family while not touching others. Overall, while Paul's greetings demonstrate courtesy and respect, they also highlight the diverse and sometimes unexpected ways in which God's grace reaches people.",
