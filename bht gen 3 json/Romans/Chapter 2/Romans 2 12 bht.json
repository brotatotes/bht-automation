            "The strain of the argument, as well as this express declaration, shows that they who had sinned - and in the first chapter he had proved that all the pagan were sinners - would be punished. If any of the pagan are saved, it will be, therefore, an exception to the general rule in regard to them.",

But if conjecture may be allowed, it may have been for the following reasons."

The distinction lies in the fact that the Gentiles, who do not have the Mosaic law or Christianity, will perish because they have not kept the law that they do have. On the other hand, the Jews will be judged by the very law they boast about and claim to follow. This is a sobering reminder that God's judgment is impartial and based on the light and knowledge that each individual has been given. Ultimately, all who have sinned will be held accountable, whether under the written law or not.
