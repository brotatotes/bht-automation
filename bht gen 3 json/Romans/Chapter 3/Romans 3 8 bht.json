            "Whatever is evil is not to be done under any pretence. Any imaginable good which we may think will result from it; any advantage to ourselves or to our cause; or any glory which we may think may result to God, will not sanction or justify the deed."

            "Let us then bear this evil, when the ungodly abuse the truth which we preach by their calumnies: nor let us cease, on this account, constantly to defend the genuine confession of it, inasmuch as it has sufficient power to crush and to dissipate their falsehoods.",
            "And their perverseness was, on two accounts, to be condemned, \u2014 first, because this impiety had gained the assent of their minds; and secondly, because, in traducing the gospel, they dared to draw from it their calumny."

            "The absurdity of the principle, that the end justifies the means, is not proven; the Apostle makes short work of an objection which has this logical issue. A doctrine directly leading to immoral results cannot belong to the gospel Paul is setting forth."

The objection posed was that if God's righteousness is shown through human unrighteousness, then why be held accountable for our actions? To answer this objection, Paul dismisses the notion that the end justifies the means, stating that doing evil is never justified, regardless of any perceived good that may result. Those who slandered Paul's doctrine, driven by their perverseness, were condemned for their actions. It is crucial for believers to defend the truth from calumnies, trusting that the power of the gospel would prevail over falsehoods. Ultimately, God can overcome our wickedness and use it to promote His own glory. Therefore, we should persevere in upholding the genuine confession of the truth, even when it is twisted by the ungodly.",
