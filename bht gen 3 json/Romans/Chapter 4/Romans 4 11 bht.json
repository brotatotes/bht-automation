The sign of circumcision acted as a seal, testifying to the covenant between God and Abraham. In the same way, the Christian church may expect an outward sign and seal to confirm the righteousness reckoned through faith.

It is through faith, not the act of circumcision or any works, that we are justified and treated as righteous. This truth is further affirmed in Galatians 3:0, where the spiritual sonship of Abraham is expounded upon.
