For not only are all other theories liable to the same objection, in some other form\u2014besides being inconsistent with the text\u2014but the actual facts of human nature, which none dispute, and which cannot be explained away, involve essentially the same difficulties as the great principle on which the apostle here explains them."

And he says, that it has reigned, in the past tense; not that it has ceased to reign in those who are born only of flesh, and he thus distinguishes between Adam and Christ, and assigns to each his own time. Hence as soon as the grace of Christ begins to prevail in any one, the reign of sin and death ceases.",

Sin, which delighted in death, can no longer hold sway, for the grace of God, displayed through Jesus Christ, has triumphed. Let us not be mistaken, it is not the dominance of death that reigns, but rather the abundant grace that birthed the plan of salvation and sent the Son to be our Savior. Though the prepositions in the text are often misinterpreted, we ought to remember that Adam has passed away, but Christ remains. This passage serves as a final doxology, reminding us of the purpose and goal of God. Let us comprehend the great mystery of imputed guilt, recognizing that all other explanations fall short and are inconsistent with Scripture. It is in the sphere of death's tyranny that grace triumphs, leading us to eternal life.",
