Although they seemed free in relation to righteousness, there is an underlying irony in this freedom. It becomes clear that while they were in the service of sin, they were not truly servants of righteousness. Their actions and services were solely devoted to sin, with no genuine contribution to righteousness. This verse raises a probing question about the nature and advantages of serving sin versus serving righteousness. The word free here does not mean that they considered themselves free or that righteousness had no claims upon them, but rather, they were disengaged and independent from its demands. The dative case of righteousness indicates their personal relation to it. They could not serve two masters, thus highlighting the necessity of choosing between sin and righteousness.",
