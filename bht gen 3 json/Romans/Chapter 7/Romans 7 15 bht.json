            "The pious mind performs not the good it desires to do, because it proceeds not with due activity, and doeth the evil which it would not; for while it desires to stand, it falls, or at least it staggers.",
            "We may hence learn the truth of what we have stated \u2014 that Paul speaks here of the faithful, in whom the grace of the Spirit exists, which brings an agreement between the mind and the righteousness of the law; for no hatred of sin is to be found in the flesh."

He feels as if he is in the dark, hurried along, and ignorant of the true nature of his actions. Despite his desire to do good, he finds himself face to face with the sinful results of his actions. This inner conflict is characteristic of the dual life that exists within all believers, who, even with the regeneration of God, are divided between their aspiration towards righteousness and the lingering influence of their sinful nature. They condemn their sins not only through reason, but because they genuinely abhor them. Ultimately, this passage highlights the tension between the desires of the Spirit and the remnants of the flesh that believers grapple with in their pursuit of holiness.",
