He clarifies that it is not his entire self, his true and higher personality, that commits the sinful actions, but rather the sin that dwells within him. By using this paradox, Paul emphasizes that he is not denying his moral responsibility, but rather highlighting the conflict between his regenerated self, which honors the law of God, and his corrupt nature. This conflict within the believer is a vivid portrayal of the coexistence and mutual hostility of the flesh and the spirit. It is important to recognize that Paul's intention is not to absolve believers of their accountability for sin but to underscore the necessity of owning and disowning sin in order to be saved from it. As Paul affirms, For the faithful are carried along in their obedience to God with such fervor of spirit that they deny the flesh.",
