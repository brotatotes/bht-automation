            "However difficult it may be for finite minds to comprehend the emotions of the Divine Mind, let us never for a moment doubt that in 'not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up for us all,' God made a real sacrifice of all that was dearest to His heart, and that in doing so He meant for ever to assure His people that all other things which they need...will in due time be forthcoming."

            "By 'the love of God', is not meant the saints' love to God...but the apostle would not have expressed such a strong confidence and full persuasion about this, and would rather have said, had this been his meaning, that nothing shall be able to separate our love from God, or God from our love, and not us from the love of God.",
            "Which is to be understood, not of the effects of love, and the application of it, which may be suspended for a time; nor of the manifestation and sense of it, which believers may be without for a while; nor of any sort of separation from God, for saints themselves may be separated from him, with respect to intimate sensible communion and fellowship; but the sense of this passage is, that they can never be separated from the love of God, so as that that union which is made by it between God and them can ever be dissolved, or they cease to have any share or interest in his love."
