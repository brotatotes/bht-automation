            "Then in both these dispensations will appear, not the arbitrary power, but the rich goodness of God.",
            "Vessels of wrath and vessels of mercy are vessels prepared to subserve, as it were to hold, His wrath and mercy: hardly, as Calvin, instruments to shew them forth: that is done, over and above their being vessels, but is not necessary to it."

            "Yet, even in the necessary punishment of the wicked, as HODGE observes, so far from proceeding with undue severity, the apostle would have it remarked that God 'endures with much long-suffering' those objects of His righteous displeasure."

            "He yet shows, that as far as God\u2019s predestination manifests itself, it appears perfectly just.",
            "Whatever way may be adopted, the sense is materially the same. It has also been suggested that\u03b5\u1f30 \u03b4\u1f72 is for \u03b5\u1f34\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1, since, seeing, 2 Thessalonians 1:6; 1 Peter 2:3. In this case no apodosis is necessary."

            "Probably the mediate agency of God is not to be excluded, but the obvious differences between the two phrases (\u2018fitted for destruction\u2019 and \u2018which He before prepared for glory') point unmistakably to such a difference as should guard the passage against fatalistic interpretations."
