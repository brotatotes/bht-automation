The purpose of God's saving grace is to instruct us and guide us towards virtue. It teaches us to have a reverent and respectful attitude towards God, to turn away from worldliness, and to pursue a life that is dedicated to Him. This includes denying ourselves of ungodliness and practicing self-restraint, fulfilling our obligations to others, and fulfilling our obligations to God. Our desires should no longer be focused on the sinful pursuits of the world, but rather on the heavenly life. In His grace, God offers us love and forgiveness, which should motivate us to obey Him. The Gospel is not a doctrine that allows for licentiousness, but rather, it aligns us with godliness and empowers us to live in purity and holiness. Sobriety, in this context, refers to being fully alert, guided by divine wisdom, and conforming to holy affections. And being godly means being consecrated and devoted to God in both heart and life.",
