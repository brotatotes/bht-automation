## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words through the will of God point probably to the depreciation of Paulâ€™s apostolic authority at Corinth."
2. "Because it was His will we were called, not because we were worthy."
3. "Perhaps some slight may have been put upon him by the parties at Corinth, and for that reason St. Paul puts him forward."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Translate, literally, 'a called apostle'... while constituting the ground of the authority he claims in the Corinthian Church, is a reason for humility on his own part." 
2. "In assuming the ministerial office a man should see he does so not of his own impulse, but by the will of God."
3. "Sosthenes... associated by Paul with himself in the inscription, either in modesty... or in order that the name of a 'brother' of note in Corinth might give weight to his Epistle and might show, in opposition to his detractors, that he was supported by leading brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That will was made known to him by the special revelation granted to him at his conversion, and call to the apostleship."
2. "Paul often refers to the fact that he had received a direct commission from God, and that he did not act on his own authority."
3. "It is evident that Sosthenes was not an apostle, nor is there any reason to think that he was inspired."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not distinguishing him from other apostles." 
2. "Paul was called no less directly than these by Jesus Christ."
3. "John does not use the word apostle, but gives the idea."

### John Calvin:
1. "We believe much more readily the man whom we look upon as regarding us with affection, and as faithfully endeavoring to promote our welfare."
2. "For as no man can lawfully assume the designation and rank of a minister, unless he be called, so it were not enough for any one to be called, if he does not also fulfill the duties of his office."
3. "It ought, however, to be observed, that it is not enough for any one to hold out to view the title to a call to the office, along with faithfulness in discharging its duties, if he does not in reality give proof of both."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Called to be an apostle, apparently when first called to discipleship."
2. "Rather, it is to bring to the front at once that official authority which he had to exercise."
3. "And was not the example of so notable a convert as â€˜Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue,â€™ going before fitted to make an impression on his successor in office?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul knows that he is not one of the twelve apostles, but he is on a par with them because, like them, he is chosen by God." 
2. "He is an apostle of Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus."
3. "The refusal of the Judaizers to recognize Paul as equal to the twelve made him the more careful to claim his position."

### John Gill:
1. "He is described by his name Paul, though his Jewish name was Saul; and very probably he being a Jew by birth, and yet born in a Roman city, might have two names, the one Jewish, the other Gentile."
2. "This his character he the rather mentions, because some in this church, through the insinuations of the false apostles, demurred upon it; whereas this was not a mere name given him by men, and by which he was only commonly called by them, but was an office he was 'called' to by Christ."
3. "and shows, that it was not owing to any worth or merit in him, but purely to the free grace and sovereign will and pleasure of God, that he was made an apostle of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is great propriety in every clause of the salutation, particularly in this, as there were some in the church of Corinth who called the authority of his mission in question."
2. "By the mention of God, the authority of man is excluded, Galatians 1:1; by the mention of the will of God, the merit of Paul, 1 Corinthians 15:8, etc."
3. "It was both humility and prudence in the apostle, thus to join his name with his own, in an epistle wherein he was to reprove so many irregularities."
