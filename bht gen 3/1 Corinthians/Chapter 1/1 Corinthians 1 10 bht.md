- Attempt 1 BHT: In 1 Corinthians 1:10, Paul urges the Corinthian church to come together in unity under the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, setting aside the divisions that had arisen among them. This unity goes beyond mere agreement in doctrine, as it encompasses their affections and dispositions as well. The goal is for them to speak the same thing, not just in words, but also in their hearts and minds. By doing so, they can be perfectly joined together, healing the wounds caused by their divisions. This call to unity is not only for the sake of peace and well-being within the church, but also to demonstrate their love for one another. They are called to be of the same mind and judgment, operating from a shared Christian standpoint. The various divisions within the Corinthian church centered around different issues, such as marriage, food, and the prerogatives of different Christian teachers. However, in order to be truly united, they must focus on the main article of their religion, which is harmony among themselves. They should be careful not to pollute the graces and gifts bestowed upon them by the Lord by allowing their vices to undermine their unity. Ultimately, Paul's exhortation is for the Corinthian believers to not only have faith and hope, but also to cultivate love among themselves, using the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as the bond of their union.
