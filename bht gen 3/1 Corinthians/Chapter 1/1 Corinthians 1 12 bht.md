# 1 Corinthians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthian church showed signs of factionalism, with different groups claiming allegiance to Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or Christ alone to the exclusion of others. These divisions sparked contentions and disputes, providing an advantage to Jewish-Christian adversaries to promote legalism and ceremonial observances. Apollos, although admired for his eloquence, refused to be part of the strife. The true essence of unity lies not in following human leaders, but in acknowledging Christ as the ultimate authority and preferencing him above all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "You are all in the habit of alleging against one another, some your special attachment to Paul, some to Apollos, some to Cephas, others to no mere human teacher, but barely to Christ, to the exclusion of us his Apostles."
2. "Their profession of being guided especially by the words and acts of Paul would probably belong to those who were the first fruits of, or directly converted under, his ministry."
3. "As Peter was the Apostle of the circumcision, it is very conceivable that some of those who in Corinth lightly esteemed Paul might take advantage of this honored name, and cite against the Christian liberty taught by their own spiritual founder, the stricter practice of Peter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those alleging the name of Apollos, Paul's successor at Corinth...were persons attracted by his rhetorical style as contrasted with the 'weak bodily presence' and 'contemptible speech' of the apostle." 
2. "Apollos, doubtless, did not willingly foster this spirit of undue preference; nay, to discourage it, he would not repeat his visit just then."
3. "If it be wrong to boast 'I am of Peter,' how much more so to boast 'I am of the Pope!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now I say that there are contentions, because you are ranged under different leaders." - Calvin.
2. "It can scarcely be doubted that Paul here meant to say that there were parties existing in the church at Corinth, who were called by the names of himself, of Apollos, of Cephas, and of Christ." 
3. "And I of Christ - Why this sect professed to be the followers of Christ, is not certainly known."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The state of the Corinthian church offered the most favorable ground for Paul's Jewish-Christian adversaries, who took advantage of the reaction created by the looser views and practice of Gentile Christians, and by the differences of opinion on important questions, to press the necessity of legal regulation, and of ceremonial observances in non-essentials."
2. "Many modern authorities hold that Paul thus designates a fourth and quite distinct party. This view rests mainly on the form of statement in this verse, and has no support in the epistle."
3. "It seems more probable that those who were 'of Christ' belonged to the party of Peter: that they were native Jews, coming from abroad with letters of recommendation to Corinth, representing themselves as ministers and apostles of Christ, and using His name as the watchword under which they could most successfully prosecute their opposition to Paul and the gospel which he preached."

### John Calvin:
1. "My reason for saying that there are contentions among you is, because every one of you glories in the name of some individual."
2. "In any other point of view it is not likely that there were any parties that espoused the separate interests of ministers joined together by a sacred agreement."
3. "The unity of the Church consists more especially in this one thing â€” that we all depend upon Christ alone, and that men thus occupy an inferior place, so as not to detract in any degree from his pre-eminence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "People naturally have different tastes about styles of preaching and that is well, but Apollos refused to be a party to this strife and soon returned to Ephesus..." 
2. "But there is no evidence that Peter himself visited Corinth." 
3. "This partisan use of the name of Christ may have been made in the name of unity against the other three factions, but it merely added another party to those existing."

### John Gill:
1. "But others said, and I of Christ; which some take to be the words of the apostle, declaring who he was of, and for, and belonged unto; intimating that they, as he, should call no man father, or master, on earth, or be called by any other name than that of Christ."
2. "Others consider them as the words of the Corinthians, a small part of them who were very mean and contemptible, and therefore mentioned last, who chose to be known and called by no other name than that of Christians."
3. "They were for Christ without his ministers; they were wiser than their teachers; they were above being under any ministrations and ordinances; as the others attributed too much to the ministers of the Gospel, these detracted too much from them, and denied them to be of any use and service."

### John Wesley:
1. "There are various parties among you, who set themselves, one against another, in behalf of the several teachers they admire."
2. "Perhaps they valued themselves on having heard Christ preach in his own person."
3. "They spoke well, if they had not on this pretence despised their teachers."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Corinthian church was divided by factions, each claiming allegiance to different leaders. Some were attached to Paul, others to Apollos, and some even to Peter. In their zeal, they boasted of their preferred teacher, creating divisions and contentions in the church. These factions not only caused discord, but also gave an opportunity for Jewish-Christian adversaries to press for legalism and ceremonial observances. Meanwhile, there was another party that professed to be solely of Christ, potentially representing native Jews opposing Paul's teachings. Amidst all this, Apollos, whose rhetorical style attracted many, refused to engage in this strife and soon returned to Ephesus. Ultimately, the unity of the church should not be found in following human leaders, but in depending on Christ alone.
