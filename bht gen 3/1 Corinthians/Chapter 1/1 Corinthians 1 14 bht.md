# 1 Corinthians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It may seem surprising that St. Paul does not refer to the import of baptism itself as a reason to substantiate his argument, but rather thanks God for not baptizing many Corinthians except for Crispus and Gaius. Baptism was primarily the office of deacons, and Paul rejoices in the providential arrangement that he did not baptize many, as it could have led to abuse and division. This highlights the need to avoid using baptism as a reason for glorying or boasting, emphasizing unity instead.
