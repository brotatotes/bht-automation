# 1 Corinthians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's purpose in not allowing Paul to baptize many in Corinth was to prevent any accusations that Paul had baptized them for his own glory. This was important because Paul did not want to be seen as the founder of the Church or as the leader of a new sect. Jesus himself did not baptize anyone, so claiming Paul as a sacramentalist is unfounded. The absence of baptism in Paul's commission and his deliberate avoidance of controversy regarding baptism demonstrate that he was focused on proclaiming the message of Christ rather than promoting himself.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: God orchestrated it so that Paul did not baptize many people in the church of Corinth, not because Paul had this intention at the time, but in order to prevent any accusations that Paul had baptized them for his own glory instead of for the sake of Christ. This was important because as the one inaugurating the second epoch of Christianity, Paul wanted to ensure that no one would claim him as the founder of the Church or as the leader of a new sect. In fact, Jesus himself did not baptize anyone to avoid similar controversies. Thus, claiming Paul as a sacramentalist is an impossible claim based on his own words in this verse.
