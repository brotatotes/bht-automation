# 1 Corinthians 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's wisdom perishes and is blotted out by the Lord, causing the wisdom of the wise and prudence of the prudent to disappear. This is because the wisdom of the wise sometimes amounts to folly, and the understanding of the understanding is often rejected. Human philosophizing may scoff at the wisdom of God revealed through the cross of Christ, which stands above human reasoning. Thus, the Gospel exposes the limitations of human wisdom and offers true wisdom and understanding to those who embrace it.
