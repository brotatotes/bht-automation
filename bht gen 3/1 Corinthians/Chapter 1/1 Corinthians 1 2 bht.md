## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It may perhaps seem strange that he should call by the name of the Church of God that assembly of men among whom so many corruptions were rife, that Satan seemed to reign there rather than God." 
2. "This passage is carefully to be noted, to keep us from requiring in this world a Church without any spot or wrinkle; or refusing this title to any assembly in which all is not according to our wish." 
3. "If we ask what cause had St. Paul to recognize the Church at Corinth? the answer is, because he saw among them the doctrine of the Gospel, Baptism, the Supper of the Lord; symbols by which the Church ought to be discerned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Fanatics and sectaries vainly think to anticipate the final sifting of the wheat and tares. It is a dangerous temptation to think there is no church where there is not apparent perfect purity."
2. "It was enough for Paul in recognizing the Corinthians as a church, that he saw among them evangelical doctrine, baptism, and the Lord's Supper."
3. "The true CATHOLIC CHURCH: not consisting of those who call themselves from Paul, Cephas, or any other eminent leader, but of all, wherever they be, who call on Jesus as their Savior in sincerity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The church is called 'the church of God,' because it has been founded by His agency, and was devoted to his service."
2. "Though the word used here (Œ∑ÃîŒ≥ŒπŒ±œÉŒºŒµÃÅŒΩŒøŒπœÇ heÃÑgiasmenois) has this idea of separation from the mass around them, yet it is separation on account of their being in fact, and not in profession merely, different from others, and truly devoted to God."
3. "The idea in the former part of the verse is, that this was done 'by Christ Jesus;' here he says that it was because they were called to this privilege. He doubtless means to say that it was not by any native tendency in themselves to holiness, but because God had called them to it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In more modern times it was known as 'the Gibraltar of Greece.'"
2. "The commercial position of Corinth was, therefore, most important, communicating with the eastern and the western world, with the north and the south."
3. "When, therefore, the apostle preached to the Corinthians, the Gospel spoke to the whole world and to the living present."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a passage that ought to be carefully observed, that we may not require that the Church, while in this world, should be free from every wrinkle and stain, or forthwith pronounce unworthy of such a title every society in which everything is not as we would wish it."
2. "For it is a dangerous temptation to think that there is no Church at all where perfect purity is not to be seen."
3. "Accordingly, wherever the worship of God is preserved uninfringed, and that fundamental doctrine, of which I have spoken, remains, we must without hesitation conclude that in that case a Church exists."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "sanctified in Christ Jesus; through living union with the Fountain of Holiness in His Person."
2. "Called to be saints; not in the mere external sense...but in that inward, efficacious, saving sense which invariably issues in the cordial reception of the Gospel message."
3. "When, then, we find a phrase already so familiar and so dear to devout Jewish ears transferred to Christians, defining them as 'callers upon,' 'invokers,' or 'worshippers of' Christ and this incorporated among the household words of the churches what can we conclude but that the first Christians were taught to regard their Master as the rightful Heir, in human flesh, of all the worship which the ancient Church had been trained jealously to render to Jehovah alone?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This city, destroyed by Mummius B.C. 146, had been restored by Julius Caesar a hundred years later, B.C. 44, and now after another hundred years has become very rich and very corrupt. The very word 'to Corinthianize' meant to practise vile immoralities in the worship of Aphrodite (Venus)." 
2. "All the problems of a modern city church come to the front in Corinth. They call for all the wisdom and statesmanship in Paul."
3. "This phrase occurs in the LXX (Genesis 12:8; Zechariah 13:9) and is applied to Christ as to Jehovah (2 Thessalonians 1:7; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; 2 Thessalonians 1:12; Philippians 2:9; Philippians 2:10). Paul heard Stephen pray to Christ as Lord (Acts 7:59). Here 'with a plain and direct reference to the Divinity of our Lord' (Ellicott)."

### John Gill:
1. "a church of God is not to be unchurched for everything that is amiss in them"
2. "they were chosen to holiness in Christ, and through sanctification of the Spirit unto salvation"
3. "Christ is the common Lord of his people, whom they all invoke, and by whom they are called, and therefore ought to love one another"

### John Wesley:
1. "Sanctified through Jesus Christ - And so undoubtedly they were in general, notwithstanding some exceptions."
2. "Called - Of Jesus Christ, Romans 1:6 And - As the fruit of that calling made holy."
3. "Call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ - This plainly implies that all Christians pray to Christ, as well as to the Father through him."
