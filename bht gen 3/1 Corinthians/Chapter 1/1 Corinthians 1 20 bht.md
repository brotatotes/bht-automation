3. "Did not God make foolish?" - The old verb ŒºœâœÅŒ±ŒπŒΩœâ from ŒºœâœÅŒøœÇ, foolish, was to be foolish, to act foolish, then to prove one foolish as here or to make foolish as in Romans 1:22.

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. "The deliverance of Judea from Sennacherib is what Isaiah refers to in these words; in a bold and beautiful allusion to which, the apostle in the clause that follows triumphs over all the opposition of human wisdom to the victorious gospel of Christ." 
2. "What could the wise men of the gentiles do against this? or the Jewish scribes? or the disputers of this world? - Those among both, who, proud of their acuteness, were fond of controversy, and thought they could confute all opponents."
3. "Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ‚Äî That is, shown it to be very foolishness."
