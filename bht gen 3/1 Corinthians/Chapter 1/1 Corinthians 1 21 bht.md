# 1 Corinthians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man has never discovered his duty to God by the light of nature alone; it is only through revelation that this knowledge has been attained. The preaching of the Cross, though deemed foolishness by the world, is actually God's consummate wisdom and plan of redemption. Trusting in Jesus Christ and his sacrificial death is the direct path to salvation, bypassing the rituals and ceremonies of other religions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The deistic theory that man can by the light of nature discover his duty to God, is disproved by the fact that man has never discovered it without revelation."
2. "All the stars and moon cannot make it day; that is the prerogative of the sun. Nor can nature's highest gifts make the moral day arise; that is the office of Christ."
3. "By that preaching which the world (unbelieving Jews and Gentiles alike) deem foolishness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "After all the experience of the world it was ascertained that human beings would never by their own wisdom come to the true knowledge of God, and it pleased him to devise another plan for salvation."
2. "For when, by the wise arrangement or government of God; after a full and fair trial of the native, unaided powers of man, it was ascertained that the true knowledge of God would not be arrived at by man, it pleased him"
3. "The plan of salvation originated in his good pleasure, and was such as his wisdom approved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "After that [ÎµÏ€ÎµÎ¹Î´Î·] . Rev., correctly, seeing that."
2. "By wisdom [Î´Î¹Î± Ï„Î·Ï‚ ÏƒÎ¿Ï†Î¹Î±Ï‚] . Better, as Rev., giving the force of the article, 'through its wisdom.'"
3. "To save [ÏƒÏ‰ÏƒÎ±Î¹] . The word was technically used in the Old Testament of deliverance at the Messiah's coming; of salvation from the penalties of the messianic judgment, or from the evils which obstruct the messianic deliverance."

### John Calvin:
1. "God designs in the first place to make us see ourselves to be fools, before he makes us wise unto salvation."
2. "He makes a concession when he calls the gospel the foolishness of preaching, having that appearance in the view of those foolish sages who, intoxicated with false confidence, fear not to subject God's sacred truth to their senseless criticism."
3. "For it is true, that this world is like a theater, in which the Lord presents to us a clear manifestation of his glory, and yet, notwithstanding that we have such a spectacle placed before our eyes, we are stone-blind, not because the manifestation is furnished obscurely, but because we are alienated in mind, and for this matter we lack not merely inclination but ability."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God." 
2. "â€¦it pleased God by the foolishness of the preaching meaning the message itself, the thing preached to save them that believe for in the believing reception of it lies its whole saving efficacy."
3. "â€¦in the believing reception of it lies its whole saving efficacy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Failed to know, second aorist (effective) active indicative of Î³Î¹Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎºÏ‰, solemn dirge of doom on both Greek philosophy and Jewish theology that failed to know God."
2. "The proclamation of the Cross seemed foolishness to the wiseacres then (and now), but it is consummate wisdom, God's wisdom and good-pleasure (ÎµÏ…Î´Î¿ÎºÎ·ÏƒÎ±Î½)."
3. "This is the heart of God's plan of redemption, the proclamation of salvation for all those who trust Jesus Christ on the basis of his death for sin on the Cross. The mystery-religions all offered salvation by initiation and ritual as the Pharisees did by ceremonialism. Christianity reaches the heart directly by trust in Christ as the Saviour. It is God's wisdom."

### John Gill:
1. "The world by wisdom knew not God; the author of them: the Gentiles knew him not in any spiritual and saving manner, as in Christ, or the God of all grace; yea, they knew him not as the God of nature to be the one, only, true God; they knew him not so as to glorify him as God, or to worship him in a right way and manner." 
2. "It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe; it was his purpose and decree within himself; it was his sovereign good will and pleasure; it was what he, without any motion from, or merit in the creature, resolved of himself from all eternity that he would 'save', not the wise man, the Scribe, the disputer of this world, the rationalist, the talker, nor the worker, but 'them that believe' in his Son."
3. "The Gospel they despise is the power of God unto salvation to all that believe in Christ; this, through efficacious grace, becomes the means of regenerating and quickening men, showing them their need of salvation, and where it is, and of working faith in them to look to Christ for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "For since in the wisdom of God...the world...by all its boasted wisdom knew not God." 
2. "Though the whole creation declared its Creator, and though he declared himself by all the prophets."
3. "It pleased God, by a way which those who perish count mere foolishness, to save them that believe."

The preaching of the Cross may be deemed foolishness by the world, but it is in fact consummate wisdom, being God's plan of redemption. It pleased God to save those who trust in Jesus Christ and his sacrificial death, on the basis of the messianic deliverance.

This is the heart of God's wisdom and plan of redemption.
