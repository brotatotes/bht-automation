## BHT:
The Christian church, empowered by the Spirit of God, often consisted of individuals despised by the world. The expansion of the church throughout history has shown a victory of the ignorant over the learned and the lowly over the lofty. God's calling is not based on human wisdom, power, or lineage, but on His sovereign love. This challenges the standards of the flesh, which value wisdom, power, and noble birth. Paul's argument reminds us that God's ways often confound the wisdom and expectations of the world.
