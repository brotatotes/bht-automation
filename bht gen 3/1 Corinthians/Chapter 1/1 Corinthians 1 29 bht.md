# 1 Corinthians 1:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who boast in human greatness and wisdom will be put to shame, for flesh is beautiful but frail like the flower of the field. Our glory is not before God, but in Him. No flesh should glory in His presence. This is why the majority of Christian converts are often found among those of humble lifeâ€”to produce humility and place all on an equal level. Let us remember that there is nothing we can justly glory in, as everything deserving of praise comes from God alone.
