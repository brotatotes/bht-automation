## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fellowship of His Son, as Meyer well remarks, is the glory of the sons of God, Rom. viii. 21: for they will be joint-heirs with Christ, glorified together." 
2. "The mention of fellowship may perhaps have been intended to prepare the way, as was before done in ver. 2, for the reproof which is coming." 
3. "See how he is always riveting them close with the name of Christ. He makes mention, not of any apostle or teacher, but evermore of Him who is their desire, as if he were endeavoring to bring back men after a debauch to their sound state. For nowhere in any other epistle is the name of Christ so often repeated."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "calledâ€”according to His purpose" (Romans 8:28).
3. "unto . . . fellowship of . . . Jesusâ€”to be fellow heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:28- :), like Him sons of God and heirs of glory (Romans 8:30; 2 Thessalonians 2:14; 1 Peter 5:10; 1 John 1:3).
