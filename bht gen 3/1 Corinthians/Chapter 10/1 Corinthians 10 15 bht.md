# 1 Corinthians 10:15 Commentary Help Text

I urge you to exercise your judgment and wisdom as you consider what I am saying. You have the responsibility to judge for yourselves, using the mind that has been given to you.

So, I speak to you as wise men, appealing to your understanding and asking you to judge what I say.
