# 1 Corinthians 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By partaking of the bread, we become one bread, sharing in the substance of Christ's body. We are united as believers, representing the mystical spiritual body of Christ. As we all eat from the same loaf, we signify our spiritual unity and connection to each other. This communion not only binds us together but also distinguishes us from those who partake in idolatrous feasts. Just as believers are one body with Christ, we publicly display our oneness and belonging to the same family.

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In all ancient times friends were made one over a common meal; much more is this oneness manifested when, on some festal occasion, great principles are represented and celebrated by those whose principles they are"
2. "How much more when Christians, as 'one body,' 'eat of that bread' in which their Lord would have them see 'His body broken for them,' and 'drink of that cup' in which they were to see 'His blood of the new covenant shed for them,' Thus was their common oneness with Him, in the first instance, and in virtue of this, their oneness among themselves, visibly set forth and palpably expressed."

2. "Believers, though they are many, yet are one body, of which Christ is the head; one in union with him and one another, and one in their communion together at the Lord's table."
3. "The application designed is this, that as believers, by partaking of the same bread, appear to be the same body, and of the same mass and lump with one another; so such as eat things sacrificed unto idols, appear to be of the same mass and lump with Heathen idolaters."
