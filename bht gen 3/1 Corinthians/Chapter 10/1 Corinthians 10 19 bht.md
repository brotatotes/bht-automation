# 1 Corinthians 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians sacrificed to devils, not to God, because heathendom was under the dominion of Satan, and therefore the powers honored and worshipped by the heathen were actually Satan and his angels. Paul clarifies that he is not saying that a thing sacrificed to an idol is a real thing in the sense that the heathen regard it. He urges the Corinthians to not participate in such idol worship because fear rather than love is the motive of heathen worship, just as fear is the spirit of Satan and his demons.
