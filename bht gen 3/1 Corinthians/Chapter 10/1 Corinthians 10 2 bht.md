# 1 Corinthians 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through baptism, Christians enter a covenant with God, similar to the Israelites who were initiated into a spiritual union with Moses. The cloud and sea, consisting of water, symbolize the immersion experienced by the Israelites. This immersion signifies their acknowledgment of Moses as their guide. The descent of the Israelites into the sea and their ascent out of it has a great agreement with baptism through immersion. We can see a resemblance between their experience and the act of baptism, as they were all, in a sense, baptized into Moses and initiated into his teachings.
