# 1 Corinthians 10:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are we so arrogant that we believe we can provoke the Lord to jealousy, that we can defy His power to punish? By dividing our fellowship between Him and idols, we risk a contest with God that we cannot win. It is foolish and inconsistent to be in communion with the Lord and also associate with demons. Such double-dealing will surely provoke Him to assert His power, just as it did with the old Israelites. Let us not test the limits of His patience or our own strength by courting destruction and waging war against God.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'jealousy,' as applied to God, seems to express the sense of slighted love in one of two wedded parties towards the other; an idea familiar to the Old Testament with reference to Jehovah‚Äôs relation to His people Israel, and their treatment of Him." 
2. "Here this idea is transferred to Christ; for since 'the table of the Lord' certainly means Christ‚Äôs eucharistic table, 'the Lord,' whom they 'provoked to jealousy' by partaking both of it and of idol-feasts, must be the Lord Jesus."
3. "Mean ye to try how far His patience will go? Would ye try your strength against His?"

2. "To give into idolatrous practices, is to proclaim and enter into a war against God; and what madness must this be?" 
3. "Partly from its ill effect, in bringing men into fellowship with devils; and partly from the impossibility of practicing it, in consistence with a true and real participation of the cup and table of the Lord."

### John Wesley:
