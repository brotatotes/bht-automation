1. "In the shambles (ŒµŒΩ ŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒªŒªœâ). Only here in N.T.... the Corinthian Macellum (1 Corinthians 10:25), with the same life-like reality with which the Diocletian maximum tariff called up the picture of the Galilean woman purchasing her five sparrows."
2. "Asking no questions for conscience sake (ŒºŒ∑Œ¥ŒµŒΩ Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÉœÖŒΩŒµŒπŒ¥Œ∑œÉŒπŒΩ). As to whether a particular piece of meat had been offered to idols before put in the market."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle allows, that such meat that was sold in the shambles might be bought and eat of, but not in an idol's temple; there was a difference between an idol's temple, and eating things sacrificed to idols there, and buying them in shambles or meat market, and eating them at home."
2. "For conscience sake; either a man's own, which may be hurt, wounded, and defiled, by eating contrary to it, should he know that what he eats had been offered to an idol; whereas if he asks no questions, and knows nothing of the matter, his conscience will not be afflicted."
3. "Or else another man's that may stand by whilst the meat is bought, and sold; and who hearing questions asked and answered, and yet observes the meat, though sacrificed to idols, dressed and ate by the buyer, his conscience being weak, may be offended and grieved."

### John Wesley:
1. The apostle now applies this principle to the point in question.
Asking no questions ‚Äî Whether it has been sacrificed or not.
