## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The same maxim applied to their conduct at a banquet given by a heathen."
2. "At such, there might be meat which had been offered to idols."
3. "He admonishes them tacitly that they would do better by not going: but he does not prohibit their going."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye be disposed to goâ€”tacitly implying, they would be as well not to go, but yet not forbidding them to go." 
2. "The feast is not an idol feast, but a general entertainment, at which, however, there might be meat that had been offered to an idol." 
3. "For conscience' sake."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And ye be disposed to go - Greek, 'And you will to go.' It is evidently implied here that it would not be improper to go."
2. "Christianity is not designed to abolish the courtesies of social life; or to break the bonds of contact...It allows and cultivates, under proper Christian restraints, the contact in society which will promote the comfort of people."
3. "The apostle says 'eat,' not 'drink;' and the principle will not authorize us to 'drink' whatever is set before us, asking no questions for conscience sake; for while it was matter of indifference in regard to eating, whether the meat had been sacrificed to idols or not, it is not a matter of indifference whether a man may drink intoxicating liquor."

3. "Whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no questions for conscience sake."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "but if they were inclined, and did think fit to go, which they might without sin; for as it is lawful to trade, so to eat and drink with unbelievers"
2. "whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no questions for conscience sake"
3. "lest either their own, or another's conscience should be hurt thereby"

- Attempt 5 BHT: If a pagan invites Christians to a banquet, one is encouraged to attend as long as it is a general entertainment and not a temple feast. However, the apostle implies that it would be better not to go but does not outright forbid it. The principle here is that Christianity does not seek to abolish the courtesies of social life and allows for contact in society under proper Christian restraints. Nevertheless, caution must be exercised to avoid hurting weak consciences, and one should be mindful of the potential dangers and snares that may arise. Ultimately, the instruction is to eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for conscience sake, to ensure that neither your own nor another's conscience is hurt.
