# 1 Corinthians 10:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why should my exercise of Christian freedom, such as eating and giving thanks, be a matter of condemnation to someone else? What warrants the censure of my liberty based on another's conscience? Love is the foundation for restricting personal freedom for the sake of the weaker brother, promoting the glory of God. Instead of causing offense, we should bear with the weak conscience of others. Our own conscience, not another's, should determine the extent of our liberty.
