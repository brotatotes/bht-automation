## BHT:
The Apostle Paul's testimony underscores the significance of Christian sacraments as more than mere signs or remembrances, but essential for membership in Christ. The manna, a miraculous provision from God, held a spiritual meaning and foreshadowed Christ's role as the true bread from heaven. Just as the manna was not mere physical food, the sacraments go beyond surface rituals, pointing to the deeper spiritual realities and benefits in our relationship with Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole passage is a standing testimony, incidentally, but most providentially, given by the great Apostle to the importance of the Christian sacraments, as necessary to membership of Christ, and not mere signs or remembrances: and an inspired protest against those who, whether as individuals or sects, would lower their dignity, or deny their necessity."
2. "The manna is thus called, from its being no mere physical production, but miraculously given by God the work of His Spirit."
3. "We can scarcely avoid recognizing in these words a tacit reference to our Lord‚Äôs discourse, or at all events to the substanee of it, John 6:31-58."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "an inspired protest against those who lower their dignity, or deny their necessity" [ALFORD].
2. "He does not mean by 'the same' that the Israelites and we Christians have the 'same' sacrament; but that believing and unbelieving Israelites alike had 'the same' spiritual privilege of the manna."
3. "Not that the Israelites clearly understood the signification; but believers among them would feel that in the type something more was meant; and their implicit and reverent, though indistinct, faith was counted to them for justification, of which the manna was a kind of sacramental seal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'spiritual' here is evidently used to denote that which was given by the Spirit, or by God; that which was the result of his miraculous gift, and which was not produced in the ordinary way."
2. "It had an excellency and value from the fact that it was the immediate gift of God, and is thus called 'angels food.'"
3. "In the language of the Scriptures, that which is distinguished for excellence, which is the immediate gift of God, which is unlike that which is gross and of earthly origin, is called 'spiritual,' to denote its purity, value, and excellence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Spiritual meat. The manna, called spiritual because coming from heaven. See Psalms 78:25; John 6:31; and on Revelation 11:8; Revelation 2:17.


### John Calvin:
1. "A sign, it is true, is a sign, and retains its essence, but, as Papists act a ridiculous part, who dream of transformations, (I know not of what sort), so it is not for us to separate between the reality and the emblem which God has conjoined."
2. "Thus there is a difference between us and them only in degree, or, (as they commonly say), of 'more and less,' for we receive more fully what they received in a smaller measure. It is not as if they had had bare emblems, while we enjoy the reality."
3. "What does he mean to say here, but that the ancient people of God were honored with the same benefits with us, and were partakers of the same sacraments, that we might not, from confiding in any peculiar privilege, imagine that we would be exempted from the punishment which they endured?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. 1 Corinthians 10:3. and did all eat the same spiritual meat the manna which, by a mysterious arrangement of heaven, fed them all their journey through.

2. "ŒíœÅœâŒºŒ± is food, not just flesh."
3. "Jesus called himself the true bread from heaven (John 6:35) which the manna typified."

### John Gill:

2. "it resembled Christ in its original; it was prepared of God, as Christ is, as his salvation prepared before the face of all his people."
3. "so Christ, and the fulness of grace that is in him, are the food and supply of the spiritual Israel, and church of God, whilst they are passing through this world to the heavenly glory."

### John Wesley:

- Attempt 1 BHT: In 1 Corinthians 10:3, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance and necessity of the Christian sacraments, such as the Lord's Supper, which are not mere signs or remembrances, but essential to our participation in Christ. The manna mentioned in this verse is not just a physical provision, but a miraculous gift from God, a work of His Spirit. This reference to the manna also echoes Jesus' discourse in John 6, where He identifies Himself as the true bread from heaven. The term spiritual is used to describe the manna because it came from heaven and had a supernatural character. It represented something more than physical sustenance; it pointed to a deeper spiritual reality, just as the sacraments do for us as believers today.
