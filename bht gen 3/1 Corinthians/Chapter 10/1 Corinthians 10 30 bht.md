It seems inconsistent to say grace over food that I should not eat, as it may lead to slander or defamation. Instead, it is better to deny oneself in such a case and avoid risking one's character, the glory of God, and the honor of religion. We should make a good use of our blessings, preventing the weak from having occasion to revile us, and sincerely give thanks for our food.
