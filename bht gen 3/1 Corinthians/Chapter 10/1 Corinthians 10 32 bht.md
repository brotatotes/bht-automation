In all essential things affecting Christian doctrine and practice, even in the smallest detail, we must not swerve from principle, whatever offense may be the result. Giving offense is unnecessary if our own spirit causes it, but necessary if it is caused by the truth. We should be inoffensive and not lead others into sin, especially when it comes to idol worship. Our desire for the glory of God holds the first place, and we are debtors to all, even strangers, that we may gain them for Christ.
