## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His own course of conduct:‚Äîas I in all things please (this expresses, as Meyer well remarks, not the result, but the practice on Paul‚Äôs part; for to please all men would be impossible even for one who had no fixed principle, still less for one like St. Paul)."
2. "That they, his great aim and end;‚Äîso ch. ix. 22."
3. "May be saved: compare on the sense, Phil. ii. 4, 5."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 33. I please‚ÄîI try to please
	(1 Corinthians 9:19; 1 Corinthians 9:22;
	Romans 15:2). 
	
not seeking mine own‚Äî
	(1 Corinthians 10:24). 
	
many‚Äîrather as Greek,
	"THE many."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul here proposes his own example as their guide."
2. "His main object had been to please all people; that is, not to alarm their prejudices, or needlessly to excite their opposition."
3. "It is well when a minister can without ostentation appeal to his own example, and urge others to a life of self-denial and holiness, by his own manner of living, and by what he is himself in his daily walk and conversation."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is, however, more than certain, that Paul accommodated himself to men only in things indifferent, and in things lawful in themselves."
2. "Farther, the end must be carefully observed ‚Äî that they may be saved."
3. "The former is that sweet inoffensiveness of spirit which teaches us to lay aside all self-will and self-importance, that charity which ‚Äòseeketh not her own,‚Äô and ‚Äòis not easily provoked.‚Äô"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "even as I also please all men in all things all things indifferent (as the next verse makes plain)."
2. "not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved."
3. "Within the limits of Christian consistency, and so far as was fitted to win others to Christ, he was ready to go; but concessions compromising his own conscience, and against the real good of others, he would never make."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That they may be saved (ŒπŒΩŒ± œÉœâŒ∏œâœÉŒπŒΩ). First aorist passive subjunctive of œÉœâŒ∂œâ, to save, with ŒπŒΩŒ± purpose clause with same high motive as in 1 Corinthians 9:22."
2. "This is the ruling passion of Paul in his dealings with men."
3. "Mine own profit (œÑŒø ŒµŒºŒøœÖœÑŒøœÖ œÉœÖŒºœÜŒµœÅŒøŒΩ). Old word from œÉœÖŒºœÜŒµœÅœâ, to bear together, and explains use of verb in verse 1 Corinthians 10:23."

### John Gill:
1. "He neglected his own private advantage, and the gratifying of himself in anything which was otherwise lawful, when he saw that would be an offence to others."
2. "That so he might be the means of promoting the spiritual profit and edification of many souls, that they might be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation."
3. "He behaved in this manner to all men, that he might be the instrument of the spiritual good and salvation of the chosen ones among them, by preaching the Gospel to them without offense."

### John Wesley:
