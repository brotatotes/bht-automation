## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They drank from the Spiritual (or, miraculous) rock which followed them."
2. "The rock was Christ."
3. "The Jews' miraculous supplies of food and drink were sacramentally significant of the Body and Blood of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The literal water typified 'spiritual drink,' and is therefore so called."
2. "Christ, the 'Spiritual Rock,' accompanied them."
3. "He satisfied all alike as to their bodily thirst whenever they needed it; as on three occasions is expressly recorded."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'spiritual' must be used in the sense of supernatural, or that which is immediately given by God." 
2. "The Rock here is called 'spiritual,' not from anything special in the nature of the rock, but because it was the source to them of supernatural mercies."
3. "That rock, with the stream of water thus gushing from it, was a representation of the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul appears to recall a rabbinic tradition that there was a well formed out of the spring in Horeb, which gathered itself up into a rock like a swarm of bees, and followed the people for forty years; sometimes rolling itself, sometimes carried by Miriam, and always addressed by the elders, when they encamped, with the words, 'Spring up, O well!' Numbers 21:17."
2. "The important point is that Christ the Word was with His people under the old covenant. 'In each case we recognize the mystery of a 'real presence' ' (Ellicott)."
3. "The mosaic and the christian economies are only different sides of one dispensation, which is a gospel dispensation throughout. The Jewish sacraments are not mere types of ours. They are identical."

### John Calvin:
1. "On this principle the Apostle says, that the rock was Christ, for nothing is more common than metonymy in speaking of sacraments."
2. "Nor is this an empty or sophistical subtilty, for their salvation depended on the benefit of his death and resurrection."
3. "He means, however, that they ate in their own way, which was different from ours... For, in the present day, the eating is substantial, which it could not have been then."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This 'meat' and 'drink' are called 'spiritual,' perhaps primarily, as having been supplied supernaturally, but mainly because under this merely outward and visible sustenance, by which the chosen people were enabled to pursue their way to the Promised Land, is couched the higher nutriment of Godâ€™s true people which certainly is 'Christ' in their progress towards the 'better country.'" 
2. "The question is as Neander pertinently asks whether the tradition is not itself of later date than our Epistle, and was not suggested by it. As to the actual matter of fact, all we know for certain is, that they had two miraculous supplies of water one, near the outset of their wilderness journey, at Horeb; the other, at Meribah Kadesh, near its close; and since without a supply of water all through they could not have subsisted for a week, and yet no such fatal want overtook them, one may well say that they had an unfailing supply, or that 'the Rock followed them.'"
3. "The reader should observe how, five times in the course of these four opening verses, the word 'all' is ominously repeated, the more emphatically to make the sad contrast between the commencement and the close of the journey how all had a common start, and, almost to the end, all made common progress, and yet, as is now to be added, in the case of most of them, far from a common end."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Change to the imperfect ÎµÏ€Î¹Î½Î¿Î½ shows their continual access to the supernatural source of supply."
2. "Paul adopts this 'Rabbinical legend that the water-bearing Rephidim rock journeyed onwards with the Israelites' and gives it a spiritual turn as a type of Christ in allegorical fashion."
3. "He definitely states here in symbolic form the preexistence of Christ. But surely 'we must not disgrace Paul by making him say that the pre-incarnate Christ followed the march of Israel in the shape of a lump of rock.'"

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant the water out of the rock, which was typical of the blood of Christ, which is drink indeed, and not figurative, as this was, for which reason it is called spiritual."
2. "And as those waters continued through the wilderness as a constant supply for them, so the grace of Christ is always sufficient for his people; a continual supply is afforded them; goodness and mercy follow them all the days of their lives."
3. "And the rock was Christ: that is, it signified Christ, it was a type of him. Christ may be compared to the rock for his outward meanness in his parentage and education, in his ministry and audience, in his life and death; and for his height also, being made higher than the kings of the earth, than the angels in heaven, and than the heavens themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. "And all drank the same spiritual drink."  
2. "For they drank out of the spiritual or mysterious rock, the wonderful streams of which followed them in their several journeyings, for many years, through the wilderness."  
3. "And that rock was a manifest type of Christ - The Rock of Eternity, from whom his people derive those streams of blessings which follow them through all this wilderness."
