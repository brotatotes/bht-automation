# 1 Corinthians 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us take heed of the caution given by Paul against the sin of impatience and the desire to impose our own will on God. Similar to the Israelites who tested and provoked God through rebellious conduct and sin, we must be careful not to tempt Christ and provoke Him through our own sins. We ought to cease from sorely tempting the Lord with such behavior, learning from the mistakes of those who came before us.
