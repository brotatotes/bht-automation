### Albert Barnes:

2.

1. "Power on her head [ÎµÎ¾Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î±Î½]. Not in the primary sense of liberty or permission, but authority. Used here of the symbol of power, i.e., the covering upon the head as a sign of her husband's authority."

3. "Angels present in worship... would be shocked at the conduct of the women since the angels themselves veil their faces before Jehovah."

### John Gill:
1. "It is better to understand them of good angels, who attend the assemblies of the saints, and observe the air and behaviour of the worshippers; wherefore women should cover their heads with respect to them, and not give offence to those pure spirits, by an indecent appearance." 
2. "Moreover, this veiling of the woman in public worship because of angels, may be an imitation of the good angels, who when they sung the praises of God, and adored and glorified his perfections, covered their faces and their feet with their wings, Isaiah 6:1." 
3. "She had power over her head to take off her veil, and show herself, if she thought fit; or to keep it on, as expressing her modesty; or just as she pleased, when she by them was espoused to a man, for whose sake she was made."

### John Wesley:
1. "For this cause also a woman ought to be veiled in the public assemblies..."
2. "because of the angels - Who attend there..."
3. "and before whom they should be careful not to do anything indecent or irregular."
