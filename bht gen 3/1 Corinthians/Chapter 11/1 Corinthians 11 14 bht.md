# 1 Corinthians 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to clothing, we should follow what nature has indicated. Nature, in this context, refers to the law of creation. The distinction between men and women's hair length is a clear example of this. Long hair on men is considered a sign of effeminacy and dishonor. This aligns with the recognized constitution of things and the native sense of propriety that nature has provided. Therefore, it is generally understood that a man with long hair is seen as unmanly and exposes himself to ridicule.

- Attempt 5 BHT: According to the first-tier commentary, we should be regulated by nature's suggestion when it comes to clothing. Nature, defined as the law of creation, determines what should be covered and uncovered. For instance, women's long hair reflects their need for covering, while men's lack of long hair indicates they should be uncovered. Having long hair as a man is viewed as effeminate and a dishonor. Thus, following the native sense of propriety and customs, it is generally unacceptable for a man to have long hair.
