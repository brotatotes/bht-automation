## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But this (viz. what has gone before, respecting the veiling of women, not as Chrysostom and others, that which follows: see below) I command you (not, ‚Äòannounce to you,‚Äô nor ‚Äòdeclare to you from report,‚Äô which are senses of the original word unknown to the New Test., where it only means ‚Äòto command,‚Äô‚Äîto deliver ‚Äòby way of precept.‚Äô This makes it hardly possible to refer the word this to what follows: for if so, some definite command should immediately succeed) not praising (refers to the praise bestowed on them in v. 2, and excepts what has been said since from that category) [you]; because ye come together not for the better (so that edification results), but for the worse (so that propriety is violated, and the result is to the hindering of the faith)"
2. "These last words are introduced with a manifest view to include more than the subject hitherto treated, and to prepare the way for other abuses of their assemblies to be noticed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This I enjoin (you) not praising (you)."
2. "I must now give injunction in the name of the Lord, on a matter in which I praise you not; namely, as to the Lord's Supper."
3. "The result of such 'coming together' must be 'condemnation'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Your meetings, and your observance of the ordinances of the gospel, do not promote your edification, your piety, spirituality, and harmony; but tend to division, alienation, and disorder."
2. "You should assemble to worship God, and promote harmony, love, and piety; the actual effect of your assembling is just the reverse."
3. "These evil consequences were chiefly two, first, divisions and contentions; and, secondly, the abuse and profanation of the Lord‚Äôs Supper."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I declare [œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒªœâ] . Wrong. It means in the New Testament only command. See on Luke 5:14; Acts 1:4.


### John Calvin:
1. "The Corinthians are reproved, because they came together not for the better but for the worse."
2. "If the sacred assemblies are of no benefit to us, and we are not made better by them, it is our ingratitude that is to blame."
3. "It usually happens, too, that negligence gives birth to many corruptions, especially on this account, that those who do not observe the natural use of things usually fall erelong into hurtful inventions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, [1] that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse." 
2. "The 'charge' or 'command' is not what went before (as most modern interpreters understand it), but as will appear on careful study, we think the whole directory here following, as to the celebration of the Lord's Supper." 
3. "Such appears to be the true reading."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I praise you not (ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµœÄŒ±ŒπŒΩœâ). In contrast to the praise in 1 Corinthians 11:2."
2. "For the better (ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø Œ∫œÅŒµŒπœÉœÉŒøŒΩ). Neuter articular comparative of Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑœÖœÇ, but used as comparative of Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÇ, good."
3. "For the worse (ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø Œ∑œÉœÉŒøŒΩ). Old comparative from Œ∑Œ∫Œ±, softly, used as comparative of Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÇ, bad."

### John Gill:
1. "I praise you not; as he did in 1 Corinthians 11:2 that they were mindful of him, remembered his doctrines, and kept the ordinances in the manner he had delivered them to them."
2. "but in what he was about to say, he could not praise them at all."
3. "not for the better; for edification and instruction, for the quickening and comforting of your souls; that you may grow in grace and knowledge, become more holy, zealous, fruitful, and useful: but for the worse; to indulge luxury and intemperance, to encourage heresies, schisms, and divisions, and so grow more carnal, scandalous, and useless."
