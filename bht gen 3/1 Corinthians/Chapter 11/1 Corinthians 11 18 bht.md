## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The divisions before the Apostle‚Äôs mind are, specifically, those occurring at the Agap√¶, but on the mention of them he breaks off to shew that such divisions were to be no matters of surprise, but were ordained to test them."
2. "The ABUSE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS, which also created disorder in their assemblies, ch. xiv. 23 al., and concerning which he concludes, xiv. 40, 'let all things be done decently and in order,' was the other point before his mind."
3. "In ver. 16, where the same word (ecclesia) was used of distinct bodies of Christians, it was not possible to keep the word assemblies: but it should be done where the sense admits it, and it suits the matter in hand."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'divisions' meant, are not merely those of opinion, but in outward acts at the love-feasts."
2. "The very ordinance instituted for uniting together believers in one body, was made an occasion of 'divisions.'"
3. "I am unwilling to believe all I hear, but some I cannot help believing, while my love is unaffected by it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When ye come together in the church - When you come together in a religious assembly; when you convene for public worship."
2. "The word ‚Äúchurch‚Äù here does not mean, as it frequently does with us, a ‚Äúbuilding.‚Äù No instance of such a use of the word occurs in the New Testament; but it means when they came together as a Christian assembly; when they convened for the worship of God."
3. "That there be divisions among you - Greek, as in the margin, Schisms. The word properly means a rent, such as is made in cloth...and then a division, a split, a faction among people...It does not mean here that they had proceeded so far as to form separate churches, but that there was discord and division in the church itself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not the church edifice, a meaning which the word never has in the New Testament."
2. "The marginal rendering of the Rev. is better: in congregation."
3. "See on Matthew 16:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a reproof of a general kind ‚Äî that they were not of one accord as becomes Christians, but every one was so much taken up with his own interests, that he was not prepared to accommodate himself to others."
2. "Hence arose that abuse, as to which we shall see in a little ‚Äî hence sprung ambition and pride, so that every one exalted himself and despised others ‚Äî hence sprung carelessness as to edification ‚Äî hence sprung profanation of the gifts of God."
3. "He says that he partly believes it, that they might not think that he charged them all with this heinous crime, and might accordingly complain, that they were groundlessly accused."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you." 
2. "I partly believe it a delicate way of saying what was unpleasant." 
3. "For he is going to speak in no pleasant manner of their behaviour in relation to the Lord‚Äôs Supper."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is the primary reason for Paul's condemnation and the only one given."
2. "Here ŒµŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπŒ± has the literal meaning of assembly."
3. "Not yet formal cleavages into two or more organizations, but partisan divisions that showed in the love-feasts and at the Lord's Supper."

### John Gill:
1. "The first thing he took notice of as worthy of dispraise and reproof, in their religious assemblies, were their animosities and factions."
2. "This the apostle had heard from the house of Chloe."
3. "since things are generally heightened and increased by fame; but yet he had it from such good hands, that he could not but believe there was something in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is plain that by schisms is not meant any separation from the church, but uncharitable divisions in it."
2. "Therefore, the indulging any temper contrary to this tender care of each other is the true scriptural schism."
3. "Both heresies and schisms are here mentioned in very near the same sense; unless by schisms be meant, rather, those inward animosities which occasion heresies; that is, outward divisions or parties."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In the verse, there are divisions among the Corinthians, specifically occurring during the Agap√¶ or love-feasts. These divisions are not just differences of opinion, but manifest in outward acts. This abuse of spiritual gifts and disorderliness in their assemblies has created schisms or factions within the church. The word church in this context does not refer to a physical building, but to a Christian assembly. The apostle partly believes the reports of these divisions, and he reproves the Corinthians for their animosities and factions, emphasizing the importance of unity and caring for one another. This reproof is not meant to accuse them all, but to address a specific behavior during the Lord's Supper. These divisions and factions are not isolated separations from the church, but rather uncharitable divisions within it. It is important for believers to have a tender care for one another and avoid any behavior that goes against this unity.
