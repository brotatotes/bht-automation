# 1 Corinthians 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is inevitable that divisions and even deliberate choices of party distinction will arise in the church, indicating a further and more matured separation. While these separations had not yet taken place among the Corinthians, they will serve to reveal the approved from the contentious and separatists. These heresies and schisms, although unfortunate, are overruled by God for the probation of character and the discipline of believers. In all matters, there should be liberty in doubtful questions, unity in essentials, and charity in all things.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "there must be (not only dissensions but) even heresies...indicating a further and more matured separation, where not only is there present: dissension, as in the Agap√¶, but a deliberate choice and maintenance of party distinction." 
2. "It does not appear...that such separations had yet taken place among the Corinthians...but only, as here, to a general spirit of dissension and variance."
3. "the approved [also] may be made manifest among you; viz. through a better and nobler spirit being shewn by them, than by the contentious and separatists."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "heresies . . . schisms which have now become inveterate . . . matured separations, and established parties in secession, as separatists." 
2. "The 'must be' arises from sin in professors necessarily bearing its natural fruits: these are overruled by God to the probation of character of both the godly and the ungodly, and to the discipline of the former for glory."
3. "In doubtful questions, liberty; in essentials, unity; in all things, charity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Such is human nature, such are the corrupt passions of men, the propensity to ambition and strifes, that [divisions] are to be expected, and they serve the purpose of showing who are, and who are not, the true friends of God."
2. "Religion may be made the means of power; and they who have the control of the consciences of people, and of their religious feelings and opinions, can control them altogether."
3. "The effect of divisions and separations would be to show who were the friends of order, and peace, and truth... Such divisions show who are the restless, ambitious, and dissatisfied spirits; who they are that are indisposed to follow the things that make for peace, and the laws of Christ enjoining union; and who they are who are gentle and peaceful, and disposed to pursue the way of truth, and love, and order, without contentions and strifes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Heresies [Œ±ŒπœÅŒµœÉŒµŒπœÇ] . See on 2 Peter 2:1. In Paul only here and Galatians 5:20. Better, parties or factions, as the result of the divisions.


### John Calvin:
1. "So far, says he, should we be from being troubled, or cast down, when we do not see complete unity in the Church, but on the contrary some threatenings of separation from want of proper agreement, that even if sects should start up, we ought to remain firm and constant."
2. "For in this way hypocrites are detected ‚Äî in this way, on the other hand, the sincerity of believers is tried."
3. "For we ought not to ascribe this advantage to heresies, which, being evil, can produce nothing but what is evil, but to God, who, by his infinite goodness, changes the nature of things, so that those things are salutary to the elect, which Satan had contrived for their ruin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word signifies, first, a ‚Äòtaking‚Äô or ‚Äòchoice;‚Äô then, the thing chosen, and (in matters of judgment) an ‚Äòopinion‚Äô or set of opinions" (Quote 1).
2. "here it is used in a bad sense, as in Galatians 5:20, for opinions tending to rend the Church" (Quote 2).
3. "that they which are approved (of God) may be made manifest among you by contrast with the others" (Quote 3).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Heresy is theoretical schism, schism practical heresy." (100 words)
2. "These Œ±ŒπœÅŒµœÉŒµŒπœÇ are a magnet attracting unsound and unsettled minds." (13 words)
3. "It has always been so. Instance so-called Christian Science, Russellism, New Thought, etc., today." (16 words)

### John Gill:
1. "if there were heresies, false doctrines, and bad principles, among them, such as were subversive of the fundamentals of Christianity, as the denial of the resurrection of the dead, c. it was no wonder that there were schisms and factions among them"
2. "human nature, being both weak and wicked, is so susceptible thereof, and so easily imposed upon and deceived, it cannot be thought that it should be otherwise"
3. "by their steadfastness in the faith, their zealous attachment to it, earnest contention for it, and warm and honest vindication of it; and by the departure of those from them who oppose it, and go on the side of error and heresy; by which means it is known who are the sincere followers of the Lamb, in doctrine, discipline, and conversation, and who not"

### John Wesley:
1. "There must be heresies ‚Äî Divisions."
2. "Among you ‚Äî In the ordinary course of things; and God permits them, that it may appear who among you are, and who are not, upright of heart."
3. "God permits them, that it may appear who among you are, and who are not, upright of heart."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In this verse, there is a recognition that in the church, not only dissensions, but even deliberate choices and maintenance of party distinctions will arise. These divisions serve to reveal the approved from the contentious and separatists, as heresies and schisms become inveterate and established parties in secession. While these separations may not have taken place among the Corinthians at that time, such divisions and separations are a natural consequence of sin in professing Christians. However, in all matters, there should be liberty in doubtful questions, unity in essentials, and charity in all things. These divisions and heresies, as unfortunate as they are, serve the purpose of showing who are the true friends of God and who are not, revealing the restless, ambitious spirits and those who are gentle, peaceful, and disposed to pursue the way of truth and love.
