### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hold fast the traditions (œÑŒ±œÇ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒøœÉŒµŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœáŒµœÑŒµ). Hold down as in 1 Corinthians 15:2. Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒøœÉŒπœÇ (tradition) from œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ¥œâŒº (œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ¥œâŒ∫Œ±, first aorist active indicative) is an old word and merely something handed on from one to another."

3. "There is a constant conflict between the new and the old in science, medicine, law, theology. The obscurantist rejects all the new and holds to the old both true and untrue. New truth must rest upon old truth and is in harmony with it."

### John Gill:
1. "Whoever considers the change of style in 1 Corinthians 11:17 will easily see, that this must be spoken seriously here, and is designed to raise the attention to what he was about to say, and to prepare their minds to receive, and take in good part, what he should say by way of rebuke."
2. "The things he commends them for are as follow, that ye remember me in all things; that is, either that they were mindful of him, though at a distance from them, and had such a veneration for him, and paid such respect to him, and to his judgment, as to write to him to have his sense about any point of doctrine, or case of conscience which had any difficulty in them."
3. "But was the apostle alive now, could he praise the generality of those that are called Christians on this account? no; neither of these ordinances in common are kept as they were delivered: as to baptism, it is not attended to either as to subject or mode, both are altered, and are different from the original institution; and the Lord's supper is prostituted to the vilest of men."

### John Wesley:
1. I praise you ‚Äî The greater part of you.
