# 1 Corinthians 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthian assembly fell short of truly participating in the Lord's Supper. Instead of honoring Christ through the sacrament, they were consumed with their own meals, displaying greed and lacking the necessary intention. By putting their own needs before the unity and significance of the occasion, they contaminated the sacred institution and rendered it devoid of its solemnity. Their inability to approach the Lord's Supper with reverence and discernment reduced it to a mere formality, rather than a meaningful act of worship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When then ye come together (are assembling, present tense, and perhaps here, where he deals with particulars, this is to be pressed,â€”as their intention in thus assembling is blamed) to one placeâ€”there is no eating (or, it is not to eat, i.e. with any idea of eating) the Lordâ€™s Supper."
2. "During and after this feast, as shewn by the institution, by the custom at the Passover, by the context here, and by the remnants of the ancient custom and its abuse until forbidden by the council of Carthage,â€”the ancient Christians partook of the Supper of the Lord."
3. "This being their practice, there could be no possibility, and at the same time no intention of celebrating the Lordâ€™s Supper,â€”no provision for it, nor discernment of the solemnity of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is no such thing as eating the LORD'S Supper."
2. "It is not possible where each is greedily intent only on devouring 'HIS OWN supper.'"
3. "The love-feast usually preceded the Lord's Supper... from it the bread and wine were taken for the Eucharist."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though you come together professedly to worship God, and to partake of the Lordâ€™s Supper, yet this cannot be the real design which you have in view."
2. "Your greediness; your intemperance; your partaking of the food separately and not in common, cannot be a celebration of the Lordâ€™s Supper."
3. "The Lordâ€™s supper - That which the Lord Jesus instituted to commemorate his death... it is in honor of him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Lord's Supper. The emphasis is on Lord's." 
2. "The social and festive character of the meal grew largely out of the gentile institution of clubs or fraternities."
3. "The communion-meal of the first and second centuries exhibited this character in being a feast of contribution, to which each brought his own provision."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul says, that in this way it is not the Lordâ€™s supper that is partaken of â€” not that a single abuse altogether set aside the sacred institution of Christ, and reduced it to nothing, but that they polluted the sacrament by observing it in a wrong way." 
2. "For we are accustomed to say, in common conversation, that a thing is not done at all, if it is not done aright."
3. "What I stated a little ago, however, is more simple â€” that he condemns that profane admixture, which had nothing in it akin to the Lordâ€™s Supper."

### Philip Schaff:
1. 1 Corinthians 11:20. When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lordâ€™s Supper.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To eat the Lord's Supper... It is possible that here the term applies both to the Î‘Î³Î±Ï€Î· or Love-feast and the Eucharist or Lord's Supper." 
2. "The selfish conduct of the Corinthians made it impossible to eat a Lord's Supper at all."

### John Gill:
1. "Their view in coming together was not so much to celebrate the supper of the Lord, as to partake of their own supper."
2. "Or when they did meet together on this account, it was in such an irregular and disorderly manner, and they confounded these suppers together, and behaved so ill at them."
3. "It was not fit for them to eat the Lord's supper, to go from such a full meal to the table of the Lord."

### John Wesley:
1. Therefore â€” That is, in consequence of those schisms.
It is not eating the Lord's supper â€” That solemn memorial of his death; but quite another thing.

- Attempt 1 BHT: When the Corinthians came together, it wasn't truly to eat the Lord's Supper.
