## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When then ye come together (are assembling, present tense, and perhaps here, where he deals with particulars, this is to be pressed,â€”as their intention in thus assembling is blamed) to one placeâ€”there is no eating (or, it is not to eat, i.e. with any idea of eating) the Lordâ€™s Supper."
2. "During and after this feast, as shewn by the institution, by the custom at the Passover, by the context here, and by the remnants of the ancient custom and its abuse until forbidden by the council of Carthage,â€”the ancient Christians partook of the Supper of the Lord."
3. "This being their practice, there could be no possibility, and at the same time no intention of celebrating the Lordâ€™s Supper,â€”no provision for it, nor discernment of the solemnity of it."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul says, that in this way it is not the Lordâ€™s supper that is partaken of â€” not that a single abuse altogether set aside the sacred institution of Christ, and reduced it to nothing, but that they polluted the sacrament by observing it in a wrong way." 
2. "For we are accustomed to say, in common conversation, that a thing is not done at all, if it is not done aright."
