# 1 Corinthians 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Corinthians gathered to one place with the intention of partaking in the Lord's Supper, their greed and self-centeredness led them astray. Instead of observing the solemnity and unity of the sacrament, they were consumed with their own suppers, disregarding the true meaning of the Lord's Supper. Their indulgence and lack of reverence transformed the gathering into a profane admixture, far from the sacred institution it was meant to be. Thus, they were unable to truly eat the Lord's Supper, defiling its significance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When then ye come together (are assembling, present tense, and perhaps here, where he deals with particulars, this is to be pressed,‚Äîas their intention in thus assembling is blamed) to one place‚Äîthere is no eating (or, it is not to eat, i.e. with any idea of eating) the Lord‚Äôs Supper (emphasis on the Lord‚Äôs, as opposed to 'his own' below)."
2. "During and after this feast, as shewn by the institution, by the custom at the Passover, by the context here, and by the remnants of the ancient custom and its abuse until forbidden by the council of Carthage,‚Äîthe ancient Christians partook of the Supper of the Lord."
3. "Hence cessation of the feast itself, and solemn order and silence, would be necessitated even by the outward requirements of the ordinance. These could not be obtained, where each man was greedily devouring that which he had brought with him: where the extremes were seen, of one craving, and another being drunken."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is no such thing as eating the LORD'S Supper."
2. "It is not possible where each is greedily intent only on devouring 'HIS OWN supper.'"
3. "The love-feast usually preceded the Lord's Supper... and it was at it that the excesses took place."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians were constantly in the habit of assembling for public worship. It is probable that at this early period all the Christians in Corinth were accustomed to meet in the same place."
2. "Your greediness, your intemperance, your partaking of the food separately and not in common, cannot be a celebration of the Lord‚Äôs Supper."
3. "The Lord‚Äôs Supper is called 'supper' because the word denotes the evening repast; it was instituted in the evening; and it is evidently most proper that it should be observed in the after part of the day."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Eucharist proper was originally celebrated as a private expression of devotion, and in connection with a common, daily meal, an agape or love - feast." 
2. "The social and festive character of the meal grew largely out of the gentile institution of clubs or fraternities, which served as savings - banks, mutual - help societies, insurance offices, and which expressed and fostered the spirit of good - fellowship by common festive meals."
3. "The communion-meal of the first and second centuries exhibited this character in being a feast of contribution, to which each brought his own provision."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul says, that in this way it is not the Lord‚Äôs supper that is partaken of ‚Äî not that a single abuse altogether set aside the sacred institution of Christ, and reduced it to nothing, but that they polluted the sacrament by observing it in a wrong way."
2. "For we are accustomed to say, in common conversation, that a thing is not done at all, if it is not done aright."
3. "He condemns that profane admixture, which had nothing in it akin to the Lord‚Äôs Supper."

### Philip Schaff:
1. 1 Corinthians 11:20. When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord‚Äôs Supper.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To eat the Lord's Supper (ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩ Œ¥ŒµŒπœÄŒΩŒøŒΩ œÜŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒπŒΩ). ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÇ, adjective from ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒøœÇ, belonging to or pertaining to the Lord, is not just a biblical or ecclesiastical word, for it is found in the inscriptions and papyri in the sense of imperial (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, p. 358), as imperial finance, imperial treasury." 
2. "It is possible that here the term applies both to the ŒëŒ≥Œ±œÄŒ∑ or Love-feast (a sort of church supper or club supper held in connection with, before or after, the Lord's Supper) and the Eucharist or Lord's Supper."
3. "The selfish conduct of the Corinthians made it impossible to eat a Lord's Supper at all."

### John Gill:
1. "Their view in coming together was not so much to celebrate the supper of the Lord, as to partake of their own supper, which was either the paschal supper, or something like it."
2. "Many of them came together for no other end but to partake of that, at least this was their chief view, and not the Lord's supper."
3. "It was not fit for them to eat the Lord's supper, to go from such a full meal to the table of the Lord."

### John Wesley:
1. Therefore ‚Äî That is, in consequence of those schisms.
It is not eating the Lord's supper ‚Äî That solemn memorial of his death; but quite another thing.

- Attempt 1 BHT: When the Corinthians gathered together, their intention was to partake in the Lord's Supper. However, their selfishness and greediness caused them to lose sight of the true meaning of the sacrament. Instead of sharing in the unity and fellowship of the meal, they were consumed with their own desires and indulgence. Their feast lacked the solemn order and silence that was necessary for the sacrament, and it became a far cry from the Lord's Supper. It is clear that their focus was on their own supper rather than the meal that symbolized Christ's sacrifice. In their disregard for the sacred institution, they polluted the sacrament by observing it in a wrong way. As a result, their gathering was not truly a celebration of the Lord's Supper, but a profane admixture that had nothing in common with it.
