# 1 Corinthians 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians' greediness and self-centeredness during their gatherings made it impossible for them to truly celebrate the Lord's Supper. Instead of partaking in a sacred and spiritual feast in honor of the Lord, they mixed it with profane banquets, despising the poor. Their assembly was not suitable to partake in the Lord's Supper, as their divided state prevented them from experiencing the sacrament.
