# 1 Corinthians 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Corinth, the Lord's Supper had been distorted into a selfish feast where the rich indulged themselves while the poor went hungry, neglecting the true meaning of the spiritual feast. This selfishness and excess led to a separation between the Love Feasts and the actual observance of the Lord's Supper, with the rich taking their own supper before others arrived. Such conduct went against the spirit of equality and communal fellowship that should have characterized the early Christian community, causing a division between the rich and the poor.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In apostolic times it was never observed by itself, so far as appears, but always in connection with those friendly meals called 'Agapse' or 'Love Feasts,' designed partly to exhibit and exemplify the equality of all Christians rich and poor, slaves and masters alike but also as a way of helping the poorer members without creating the feeling of pauperism."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Some in the church of Corinth had lost sight of the true meaning of the Lord's Supper, turning it into a occasion for their own self-indulgence and excess. The rich would arrive early and eat a lavish meal, while the poor, who had no meal to bring, were left hungry and neglected. This behavior not only neglected the spiritual significance of the Lord's Supper, but also created a division between the rich and the poor in the church. The Corinthians had completely departed from the original intention of the Love Feasts associated with the Lord's Supper - a time of communal fellowship and equality among all believers. This misuse of the Lord's Supper was a stark contrast to the spirit of unity and care for one another that should have characterized the early Christian community.
