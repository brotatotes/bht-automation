# 1 Corinthians 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The assembly of the brethren is not the place for satiating appetites; it is where contempt for the congregation of God should not be shown. The congregation mostly comprises the poor, whom God has chosen, and by treating them with disdain, they imitate heathen practices. Sharing their abundance would be appropriate instead of shaming their poorer comrades. Paul expresses his disapproval and bewilderment at their sacrilege in despising the church of God.
