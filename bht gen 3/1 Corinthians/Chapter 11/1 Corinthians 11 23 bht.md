# 1 Corinthians 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For I received from the Lord (by special revelation)... If the Apostle had referred only to the Evangelic tradition or writings, he would not have used the first person singular, but would have said, we received. His object is to show the unworthiness of such conduct from the dignity of the holy supper. It is not my own invention, but the Lord's institution. Though about to receive such an injury from man, He gave this pledge of His amazing love to man. He instituted the Eucharist while His betrayal was going on.
