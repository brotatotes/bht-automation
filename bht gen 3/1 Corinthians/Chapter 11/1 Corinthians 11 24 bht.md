## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The breaking of the bread involves its distribution and reproves the Corinthian mode at the love-feast, of 'every one taking before other his own supper.'" 
2. "The literal 'body' could not have been meant; for Christ was still sensibly present among His disciples when He said, 'This is My body.' They could only have understood Him symbolically and analogically: As this bread is to your bodily health, so My body is to the spiritual health of the believing communicant." 
3. "The words, 'Take, eat,' are not in the oldest manuscripts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Saviour designed that the exact form of the words should be used in its observance, and should thus be constantly borne in mind by his people."
2. "Take eat ..."
3. "The words used here are, however, substantially the same as there; and this fact shows that since this was communicated to Paul 'directly' by the Saviour, and in a manner distinct from that by which Matthew learned the mode of the institution."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Eucharist was the technical term for the Lord's Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for all the gifts of God, especially for the 'unspeakable gift,' Jesus Christ."
2. "The very mention of the breaking involves distribution and refutes the Corinthian plan - every man his own" (ver. 21).
3. "Remembrance implies Christ's bodily absence in the future."

### John Calvin:
1. "This giving of thanks, however, has a reference to something higher, for Christ gives thanks to the Father for his mercy towards the human race, and the inestimable benefit of redemption; and he invites us, by his example, to raise up our minds as often as we approach the sacred table, to an acknowledgment of the boundless love of God towards us, and to have our minds kindled up to true gratitude."
2. "Christ does not simply present to us the benefit of his death and resurrection, but the very body in which he suffered and rose again."
3. "But that participation in the body of Christ, which, I affirm, is presented to us in the Supper, does not require a local presence, nor the descent of Christ, nor infinite extension, nor anything of that nature, for the Supper being a heavenly action, there is no absurdity in saying, that Christ, while remaining in heaven, is received by us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When he had given thanks (ŒµœÖœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑŒ∑œÉŒ±œÇ). First aorist active participle of ŒµœÖœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑŒµœâ from which word our word Eucharist comes..."
2. "The bread was broken, but not the body of Jesus."
3. "Not my remembrance of you, but your remembrance of me."

### John Gill:
1. "And as he and his disciples lay at table, he blessed and gave thanks for them all; for this is not to be understood of any consecration of the bread by a certain form of words, changing its nature and property, and converting it into the body of Christ; but either of asking a blessing of his Father upon it, that whilst his disciples were caring of it, their faith might be led to him, the bread of life, and to his broken body, and spiritually feed and live on him, and receive spiritual nourishment from him."
2. "Christ himself took the bread and brake it, denoting his willingness to lay down his life, to suffer and die in the room of his people; and this action of breaking the bread was used in order to be distributed, and that everyone might partake...Christ broke the bread, that everyone might have a part, as every believer may and ought, who may eat of this bread, and drink of the wine, and feed by faith on Christ, and take every blessing procured by him to themselves."
3. "The bread in the supper, after the blessing over it, and thanks given for it, retains its same nature, properties, form, and figure, only is set apart for the use of commemorating the broken body of Christ; and therefore this phrase is to be understood in a figurative sense, that it was a sign and seal of his body; it being broken into pieces represented his wounds, bruises, sufferings, and death; just in such sense as the rock is said to be Christ."


### John Wesley:
1. "This is my body, which is broken for you ‚Äî That is, this broken bread is the sign of my body, which is even now to be pierced and wounded for your iniquities." 
2. "Take then, and eat of, this bread, in an humble, thankful, obediential remembrance of my dying love."
3. "of the obligations to love and duty which I have by all this laid upon you."
