## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This cup is the new covenant in (ratified by the shedding of, and therefore standing in, as its conditioning element) my blood." 
2. "as oft as ye drink...] Not a general rule for all common meals of Christians; but a precept that as often as that cup is drunk, it should be in remembrance of Him."
3. "on these last words is the emphasis: see below."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The cup is the parchment-deed, as it were, on which My new covenant, or last will is written and sealed, making over to you all blessings here and hereafter."
2. "The old sacrifices brought sins continually to remembrance. The Lord's Supper brings to remembrance Christ and His sacrifice once for all for the full and final remission of sins."
3. "The Lord's Supper is an ordinance often to be partaken of, as many times soever."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was after the supper, and was therefore to be observed in a distinct manner."
2. "The new covenant which God is about to establish with people."
3. "The ordinance is rightly observed when it recalls the memory of the Saviour; and when its observance is the means of producing a deep, and lively, and vivid impression on the mind, of his death for sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "After supper. Only Luke records this detail. It is added to mark the distinction between the Lord 's Supper and the ordinary meal."
2. "Testament [Î´Î¹Î±Î¸Î·ÎºÎ·] . Rev., correctly, covenant. See on Matthew 26:28. The Hebrew word is derived from a verb meaning to cut. Hence the connection of dividing the victims with the ratification of a covenant."
3. "In the Septuagint proper, where it occurs nearly three hundred times, diaqhkh, in all but four passages, is the translation of the Hebrew word for covenant (berith)."

### John Calvin:
1. "What is affirmed as to the cup, is applicable also to the bread; and thus, by this form of expression, he intimates what he had before stated more briefly â€” that the bread is the body."
2. "For in consequence of the connection between the word and the sign, the covenant of the Lord is really included in the sacraments, and the term covenant has a reference or relation to us."
3. "To distribute, therefore, the bread without the cup, is to man Christâ€™s institution. For we hear Christâ€™s words. As he commands us to eat of the bread, so he commands us to drink of the cup... And to keep back the people from that cup, which Christ sets before all...this is diabolical presumption."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Here the memorial design of the Lordâ€™s Supper is reiterated, as if to teach that, if this was not its sole design, yet any view of it, which either sinks this altogether or throws it into the shade, must be erroneous."
  
2. "The word here rendered 'covenant' is that which the Greek of the Old Testament constantly uses for the Hebrew word 'covenant,' and as there is here a manifest allusion to Exodus 24:8 'Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words' we cannot doubt that the word should be rendered 'covenant' here."
  
3. "Since it is by the death of Christ that the eternal inheritance becomes ours who believe, one can hardly resist regarding that death as, in its effect, that of a testator, bequeathing to us the eternal inheritance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After supper (Î¼ÎµÏ„Î± Ï„Î¿ Î´ÎµÎ¹Ï€Î½Î·ÏƒÎ±)."
2. "The new covenant (Î· ÎºÎ±Î¹Î½Î· Î´Î¹Î±Î¸Î·ÎºÎ·)."
3. "As oft as ye drink it (Î¿ÏƒÎ±ÎºÎ¹Ï‚ Î±Î½ Ï€Î¹Î½Î·Ï„Îµ)."

### John Gill:
1. "This cup is the New Testament, or covenant, in my blood... the wine in the cup was a sign and symbol."
2. "It provides for and promises new things, and which are famous and excellent, and preferable to all others."
3. "This do ye as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me... of his great love in giving himself an atoning sacrifice to divine justice."

### John Wesley:
1. "After supper â€” Therefore ye ought not to confound this with a common meal."
2. "Do this in remembrance of me â€” The ancient sacrifices were in remembrance of sin: this sacrifice, once offered, is still represented in remembrance of the remission of sins."
