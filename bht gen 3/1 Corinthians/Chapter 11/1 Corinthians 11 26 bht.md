2. "Hence it has the name of the Eucharist."
3. "For as he is not present with us in a visible form, it is necessary for us to have some symbol of his presence, by which our minds may exercise themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "[...] ye proclaim the Lord‚Äôs death hold it forth as, to you, a certain fact till he come."
2. "This clearly shows not only that the observance of this ordinance was designed to continue from the very time of its first institution till the second appearing of the Lord Jesus, but that the belief of the one as the great accomplished fact of the past, and of the other as the great expected fact of the future, was as the substance of all Christianity proclaimed by every participant of the Lord‚Äôs Supper."
3. "The faith of the one and the hope of the other are the two 'wings as eagles,' on which the Christian mounts up heavenward."

3. "This assures of the certainty of Christ's second coming; as it leads back to his coming in the flesh, suffering and dying in our stead, and thereby obtaining redemption for us; it leads forward to expect and believe he will come again, to put us into the full possession of the salvation he is the author of."

### John Wesley:
1. Ye show forth the Lord's death ‚Äî Ye proclaim, as it were, and openly avow it to God, and to all the world.
Till he come ‚Äî In glory.
