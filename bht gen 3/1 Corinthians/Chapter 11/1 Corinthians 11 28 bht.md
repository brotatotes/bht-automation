### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Before participating in the communion, it is crucial for a believer to engage in self-examination. This examination should be thorough and extend to the individual's words, thoughts, feelings, and conduct. By testing themselves like one would examine a piece of metal, a person can ascertain their true state of feeling towards the death of Christ and determine if they are worthy to partake in the sacrament. This self-examination is not meant to discourage one from partaking, but rather to ensure that they approach the table in a proper manner. Ultimately, the responsibility falls on the individual to examine themselves and prove their genuine faith and repentance, as only those who possess a true sense of sin, sorrow, and repentance can fully appreciate the benefit offered by Christ. Therefore, every person should engage in self-reflection, assessing whether they hold the true grace of faith and love for Christ and the saints. Additionally, they should consider whether Christ is truly within them and has been revealed to them, for without Christ's presence in their hearts, participating in communion serves no purpose.
