# 1 Corinthians 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For he that eateth and drinketh without discerning the body, eats and drinketh judgment to himself, not appreciating the body of the Lord.

By not discerning the significance and sacredness of the Lord's body, one falls under the divine judgment, as trifling with the Death of Christ. Eating the bread and drinking the wine as symbols of the Lord's body and blood probes one's heart to the very depths.

2. "Just as Adam and Eve might be said to eat condemnation to themselves and posterity, because their eating of the forbidden fruit was the cause of it."
3. "they distinguish not the Lord's supper from an ordinary and common meal, but confound them together, as did many of the Corinthians, who also did not distinguish the body of Christ in it from the body of the paschal lamb; or discern not the body of Christ, and distinguish it from the bread, the sign or symbol of it"
