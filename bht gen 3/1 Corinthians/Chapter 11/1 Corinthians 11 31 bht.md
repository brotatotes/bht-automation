# 1 Corinthians 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we duly judged ourselves and discerned the Lord's body, we would not be judged by God. A proper self-examination before partaking in the Lord's Supper can save us from divine judgment. It involves examining and forming a right estimate of our own spiritual condition, acknowledging and mourning over sin, and repentance. This voluntary self-condemnation is the remedy to obtain absolution in the sight of God. By faithfully taking our spiritual condition into our hands, we avert the tokens of His displeasure.
