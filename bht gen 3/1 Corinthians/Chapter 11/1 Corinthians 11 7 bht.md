## BHT:
Man is the glory of God, created as the crown of creation and representing His authority. Woman, derived from man and shining with the light derived from him, reflects his honor and dignity. While both man and woman are the image of God, the Apostle emphasizes the distinction between the sexes and the woman's subordination to man. The wearing of a veil by women in public assemblies signifies her submission to her husband and the recognition of the presence of angels. Both man and woman have unique roles and purposes in God's design.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is obviously the point here brought out, as in Ps. viii. 6; not that he is set to shew forth Godâ€™s glory, because God glories in him."
2. "Man is Godâ€™s glory: He has put in him His Majesty, and he represents God on earth: woman is manâ€™s glory: taken (ver. 8) from the man, shining not with light direct from God, but with light derived from man."
3. "The Apostle omits in this case the image, because anthropologically the woman is not the image of the man, on account of the difference of the sexes: and also perhaps because thus he would seem to deny to the woman the being created in the divine image, which she is as well as the man, Gen. i. 26, 27. The former reason appears the more probable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Man is the representative of God's 'glory' this ideal of man being realized most fully in the Son of man."
2. "Man is declared in Scripture to be both the 'image,' and in the 'likeness,' of God."
3. "Woman shines not so much with light direct from God, as with light derived from man, that is, in her order in creation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For a man indeed ought not to cover his head... It is not fit and proper that he should be covered." 
2. "Man was created first; he had dominion given him; by him, therefore, the divine authority and wisdom first shone forth; and this fact should be recognized in the due subordination of rank, and even in the apparel and attire which shall be worn."
3. "She was made for him; she was made after he was; she was taken from him, and was 'bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh.' All her comeliness, loveliness, and purity are therefore an expression of his honor and dignity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Man represents God's authority by his position as the ruler of the woman."
2. "In the case of the woman, the word image is omitted, although she, like the man, is the image of God."
3. "Paul is expounding the relation of the woman, not to God, but to man."

### John Calvin:
1. "The simple solution is thisâ€”that he does not treat here of innocence and holiness, which are equally becoming in men and women, but of the distinction, which God has conferred upon the man, so as to have superiority over the woman." 
2. "The woman is a distinguished ornament of the man; for it is a great honor that God has appointed her to the man as the partner of his life, and a helper to him, and has made her subject to him as the body is to the head." 
3. "For what Solomon affirms as to a careful wifeâ€”that she is a crown to her husbandâ€”is true of the whole sex, if we look to the appointment of God, which Paul here commends, showing that the woman was created for this purposeâ€”that she might be a distinguished ornament of the man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The man, as the image and glory of God, in having dominion over sublunary things, ought not to have his head his noblest and most godlike feature covered in the public assemblies of the Church; but since the woman is distinctively the glory of the man, out of and for whom she was formed, this glory, belonging all to her husband, should be reserved for him at home, and in the public assemblies she should be veiled." 
2. "For this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head. This verse has puzzled critics more than almost any other. To refute the almost endless interpretations, most of them manifestly false, would be needless. With the simple supplement here inserted, the words speak for themselves; the veil being viewed as the symbol of her subjection to her husband." 
3. "Because of the angels a statement which from its unusual character is apt to startle one. The meaning probably is, that as 'ministering spirits to do service to the heirs of salvation,' and so, present though unseen in their religious assemblies, they ought, in consideration of this, to avoid anything unbefitting the modesty of their sex."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is the moral likeness of God, not any bodily resemblance."
2. "Man is the glory of God as the crown of creation and as endowed with sovereignty like God himself."
3. "It is equally logical to argue that woman is the crown and climax of all creation, being the last."

### John Gill:
1. "For a man indeed ought not to cover his head... whilst he is in public worship, praying, prophesying, or singing of psalms... forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God."
2. "Man ought to worship him with his head uncovered, where this image and glory of God is most illustriously displayed."
3. "The man is more perfectly and conspicuously the image and glory of God... the woman is the glory of the man."

### John Wesley:
1. "A man indeed ought not to veil his head, because he is the image of God - In the dominion he bears over the creation, representing the supreme dominion of God, which is his glory."
