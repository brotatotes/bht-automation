# 1 Corinthians 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man, created directly and specially, represents God's glory, while woman, taken from man, is his distinguished ornament and helper. This pertains to their roles in creation and providential subordination, not the woman's direct dependence on God. The woman's veiling signifies her acknowledgement and submission to her husband's authority. It may seem puzzling, but man, as God's image and glory, should not have his head covered in worship, while the woman, as the man's glory, should have a sign of authority on her head.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This the man is, having been created first, directly, and in a special manner: the woman indirectly, only through the man." 
2. "Man is Godâ€™s glory: He has put in him His Majesty, and he represents God on earth: woman is manâ€™s glory: taken from the man." 
3. "This of course is true only as regards her place in creation, and her providential subordination, not in respect of the dependence of every womanâ€™s individual soul directly on God, not on man, for supplies of grace and preparations for glory."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Man is the representative of God's 'glory' this ideal of man being realized most fully in the Son of man."
2. "But 'image' alone is applied to the Son of God."
3. "As the moon in relation to the sun, so woman shines not so much with light direct from God, as with light derived from man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not fit and proper that he should be covered. The reason why it is not proper, the apostle immediately states." 
2. "If he wore a veil or turban, it would be a mark of servitude or inferiority." 
3. "The honor, the ornament, etc. She was made for him; she was made after he was; she was taken from him, and was 'bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Man represents God's authority by his position as the ruler of the woman."
2. "In the case of the woman, the word image is omitted, although she, like the man, is the image of God."
3. "Paul is expounding the relation of the woman, not to God, but to man."

### John Calvin:
1. "The image, however, of which he is now speaking, relates to the order of marriage, and hence it belongs to the present life, and is not connected with conscience."
2. "The woman is a distinguished ornament of the man; for it is a great honor that God has appointed her to the man as the partner of his life, and a helper to him."
3. "The woman was created for this purpose â€” that she might be a distinguished ornament of the man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The man, as the image and glory of God, in having dominion over sublunary things, ought not to have his head his noblest and most godlike feature covered in the public assemblies of the Church..."
2. "For this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head. This verse has puzzled critics more than almost any other...the veil being viewed as the symbol of her subjection to her husband."
3. "...as 'ministering spirits to do service to the heirs of salvation,' and so, present though unseen in their religious assemblies, they ought, in consideration of this, to avoid anything unbefitting the modesty of their sex."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is the moral likeness of God, not any bodily resemblance."
2. "Man is the glory of God as the crown of creation and as endowed with sovereignty like God himself."
3. "On the other hand, it is equally logical to argue that woman is the crown and climax of all creation, being the last."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle's meaning is not, that a man should not have his head covered at any time, but whilst he is in public worship, praying, prophesying, or singing of psalms: the reason is, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God."
2. "The man is more perfectly and conspicuously the image and glory of God, on account of his more extensive dominion and authority."
3. "The woman is the glory of the man; being made out of him, and for his help and assistance, and to be a crown of honour and glory to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "A man indeed ought not to veil his head, because he is the image of God - In the dominion he bears over the creation, representing the supreme dominion of God, which is his glory." 
2. "But the woman is only matter of glory to the man, who has a becoming dominion over her."
3. "Therefore she ought not to appear, but with her head veiled, as a tacit acknowledgment of it."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Man, as the first created, directly and specially made, represents God's glory on earth. Woman, on the other hand, is the glory of man, taken from him to be his partner and helper. While this may pertain to the order of creation and the woman's subordinate role, it does not diminish the fact that every woman's individual soul depends directly on God. As the moon shines with reflected light from the sun, so woman shines with light derived from man. The woman's veiling is an acknowledgment of her subjection to her husband, representing her husband's authority. While the reasoning behind veiling and uncovering may perplex critics, it is clear that man, as the image and glory of God in his dominion, should not have his head covered in public worship. As for the woman, she is to wear a sign of authority on her head because she is the glory of man. It is important to understand that Paul is addressing the relationship between man and woman, not the relationship between women and God. Therefore, the woman's veiling is not about conscience, but rather about her role as an ornament and helper to man.
