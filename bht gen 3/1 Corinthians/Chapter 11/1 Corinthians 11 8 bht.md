# 1 Corinthians 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman is the glory of the man, for she was taken out of man. She is made by God through the man, serving as a medium between her and God. Thus, in acknowledgement of this subordination to man in the order of creation, the woman should wear a head-covering in public worship. On the other hand, the man, being made directly by God, has no veil between himself and God. Ultimately, the woman's origin from man signifies her inferiority and subjection to him, as she was created for the sake of the man.
