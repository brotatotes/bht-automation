## BHT:
In the early church, believers were bestowed with various gifts by the Holy Spirit, such as prophecy, discernment between spirits, tongues, interpretation of tongues, and the working of miracles. These gifts were not dependent on any specific office and served to enlighten, exhort, and comfort believers, as well as persuade unbelievers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "discourse flowing from the revelation and impulse of the Holy Spirit, which, not being attached to any particular office in the church, but improvised,â€”disclosed the depths of the human heart and of the divine counsel, and thus was exceedingly effectual for the enlightening, exhortation, and consolation of believers, and the winning of unbelievers."
2. "the power of distinguishing between the operation of the Spirit of God, and the evil spirit, or the unassisted human spirit."
3. "the power of uttering, in ecstasy, as the mouthpiece of the Spirit, prayer and praise in languages unknown to the utterer,â€”or even in a spiritual language unknown to man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Miracles of special and extraordinary POWER."
2. "The inspired disclosure of the future."
3. "A spiritual language unknown to man, uttered in ecstasy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident that the apostle there refers to the power of working miracles in healing inveterate and violent diseases."
2. "It is clear from all this that there was a difference even among those who had the power of working miracles, and that this power was conferred in a more eminent degree on some than on others."
3. "It is evident that where the gift of prophecy and inspiration was possessed, and where it would confer such advantages on those who possessed it, there would be many pretenders to it; and that it would be of vast importance to the infant church, in order to prevent imposition, that there should be a power in the church of detecting the imposture."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prophecy. Not mere foretelling of the future. Quite probably very little of this element is contemplated; but utterance under immediate divine inspiration : delivering inspired exhortations, instructions, or warnings."
2. "Discerning of spirits. Distinguishing between the different prophetic utterances, whether they proceed from true or false spirits."
3. "It was an ecstatic utterance, unintelligible to the hearers, and requiring interpretation, or a corresponding ecstatic condition on the part of the hearer in order to understand it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Some of the miracles were not healings as the blindness on Elymas the sorcerer."
2. "Discernings of spirits... A most needed gift to tell whether the gifts were really of the Holy Spirit and supernatural or merely strange though natural or even diabolical."
3. "The interpretation of tongues... In case there was no one present who understood the particular tongue it required a special gift of the Spirit to some one to interpret it if any one was to receive benefit from it."

### John Gill:
1. "Mighty deeds, wonderful works, such as are apparently above, and out of the reach of nature, and beyond the compass of human power and skill."
2. "By this gift, they could also tell whether a man that made a profession of religion had the truth of grace in him, or not."
3. "This Christ promised his disciples, when he sent them into all the world to preach the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "The working of other miracles."
2. "Prophecy â€” Foretelling things to come."
3. "The discerning â€” Whether men be of an upright spirit or no; whether they have natural or supernatural gifts for offices in the church; and whether they who profess to speak by inspiration speak from a divine, a natural, or a diabolical spirit."
