## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "discourse flowing from the revelation and impulse of the Holy Spirit... exceedingly effectual for the enlightening, exhortation, and consolation of believers, and the winning of unbelievers."

3. "discerning between the operation of God's Spirit, and the evil spirit, or unaided human spirit"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "it is evident that the apostle there refers to the power of working miracles in healing inveterate and violent diseases."
2. "That this power was possessed by the apostles is well known; and it is possible that it was possessed by others also of the early Christians."
3. "This passage also seems to imply that the extraordinary endowments of the Holy Spirit were not conferred on all alike."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "whereby such could speak all manner of languages, which they had never learned, understood, and been used to"

### John Wesley:
1. "The discerning - Whether men be of an upright spirit or no; whether they have natural or supernatural gifts for offices in the church; and whether they who profess to speak by inspiration speak from a divine, a natural, or a diabolical spirit." 
2. "The working of other miracles."
3. "Prophecy - Foretelling things to come."
