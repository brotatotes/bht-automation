# 1 Corinthians 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By one Spirit, we were all baptized into one Body - Jew or Greek, slave or free - and made to drink of one Spirit. This baptism, not a mere symbol, unites believers into one body, signifying the reception of the Holy Spirit. Through baptism and the inward experience of the Spirit, we are not only outwardly marked as members of Christ's body but inwardly transformed by His grace. Despite our differences, we are brought together in the spiritual unity that baptism signifies, for we all share in Christ's life.
