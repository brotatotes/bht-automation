# 1 Corinthians 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as the natural body, though one, consists of many members, so it is with the Christian body. The weaker as well as the stronger, the less comely as well as the more comely members, are necessary. The analogy of the body illustrates the mutual dependence of the various members in the one body, the Church. This understanding is essential for church life, both locally and universally. We must remember that God created us to cooperate, just as Socrates pointed out the absurdity of feet and hands working against each other. The church is made up of many different individuals, yet all are one in Christ and related to each other.
