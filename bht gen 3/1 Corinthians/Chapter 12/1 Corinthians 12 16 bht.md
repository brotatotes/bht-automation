# 1 Corinthians 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as the previous verse explains that every part of the body is important, this verse reiterates the point. Just like the ear is a less noble part compared to the eye, there are members of the church who may be considered less significant but are still valued by Christ. These members are those who internalize and apply the word of God, the ministers who bring light to the world, and the true and respected members of the church.
