# 1 Corinthians 12:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If each member of the body were the same, there would be no body. Just as a body has many members, so too does the church. This applies to individuals and even those in positions of authority. Without the variety of talents and gifts that each member brings, the church couldn't thrive. God has intentionally assigned different gifts to each member for the benefit of the whole. We should acknowledge and appreciate the diverse talents in the body of Christ, as they contribute to the church's strength and effectiveness.
