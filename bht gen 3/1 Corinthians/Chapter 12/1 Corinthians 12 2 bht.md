## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ye know (that) when ye were Gentiles, led about (or, carried away: not necessarily, â€˜led wrong;â€™ the context seems rather to favour the idea of being â€˜led at will,â€™ blindly transported hither and thither) to idols which were without utterance."
2. "The God in whom you now believe is a living and speaking Godâ€”speaking by his Spirit in every believer: how should you know any thing of such spiritual speech or gifts at all, who have been accustomed to dumb idols?"
3. "These last words imply the absence of all fixed principle in the oracles of Heathendom, such as he is about to announce as regulating and furnishing the criterion of the spiritual gifts of Christendom."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye were blindly transported hither and thither at the will of your false guides." 
2. "The idols which are dumb; contrasted with the living God who 'speaks' in the believer by His Spirit."
3. "The heathen oracles led their votaries at random, without any definite principle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design seems to be to remind them of their former miserable condition as idolaters, in order to make them more sensible of their advantages as Christians, and that they might be led more highly to appreciate their present condition."
2. "The idea is, that they had been under a strong infatuation, and were entirely at the control of their spiritual leaders - a description remarkably applicable now to all forms of imposture in the world."
3. "No system of paganism consults the freedom and independence of the mind of man; but it is everywhere characterized as a system of 'power,' and not of 'thought;' and all its arrangements are made to secure that power without an intelligent assent of the understanding and the heart."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The contrast is implied with the living vocal spirit, which dwells and works in Christ's people, and responds to their prayers."
2. "Even as ye were led [Ï‰Ï‚ Î±Î½ Î·Î³ÎµÏƒÎ¸Îµ]. Rev., howsoever ye might be led. Better, Ellicott: 'As from time to time ye might be led. The imperfect tense with the indefinite particle signifies habitually, whenever the occasion might arise.'"
3. "Now the fatal storm carried the blinded gentile, with a whole procession, to the temple of Jupiter; again it was to the altars of Mars or Venus, always to give them over to one or other of their deified passions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As for your gods, they were 'dumb idols' which, whatever crafty priests and interested statesmen might say, never uttered a word to their votaries."
2. "Our worship, as children of Israel, imperfect as it was, was intelligent; yours was blind and senseless."
3. "No wonder, then, that in the exercise of spiritual gifts some confusion should arise among you, and some instruction should be needed how to use them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unto the idols the dumb."
2. "Pagans were led astray by demons."
3. "As often as ye were led."

### John Gill:
1. "They were born and brought up in the Heathen religion, when they knew not the true God, much less had any knowledge of Christ, and still less of the Spirit of God."
2. "To idols that were nothing in the world, had no divinity in them."
3. "If they had now received the Spirit, and his gifts, they ought to ascribe the whole to the free grace of God, and be humble under a sense of their unworthiness."

### John Wesley:
1. "Therefore, whatever gifts ye have received, it is from the free grace of God."
2. "The blind to the dumb; idols of wood and stone, unable to speak themselves, and much more to open your mouths, as God has done."
3. "By the subtlety of your priests."
