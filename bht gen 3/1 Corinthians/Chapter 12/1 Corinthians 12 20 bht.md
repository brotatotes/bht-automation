# 1 Corinthians 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In contrast to a supposition, it is revealed that the body of Christ is made up of many members that are mutually dependent on one another.

None of the members can be spared, as even the meanest contributes to the church's fulness. The church, as one complete body, consists of many members, all united together.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In 1 Corinthians 12:20, it is emphasized that the body of Christ is made up of many members that are mutually dependent on one another. The unity of the body can only be maintained through a diversity of members that have a mutual connection for the preservation of the one body. Without this diversified symmetry, the body would not be complete. Each member, regardless of their role or position, is essential and cannot be spared. The church, as one complete body, consists of many members who contribute in different ways. It is a necessary consequence of this unity that the several members need one another for the body to function properly.
