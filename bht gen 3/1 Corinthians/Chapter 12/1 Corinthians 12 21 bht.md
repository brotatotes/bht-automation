# 1 Corinthians 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The higher organs cannot do without the lower members, just as the eye needs the hand, and the head needs the feet. Each member is useful in its proper place, even those who are most richly endowed cannot perform their duties without the aid and cooperation of those of more humble attainments. The less honorable members have a duty to discharge their duty to the body and not envy the more distinguished members. The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you, just as the head cannot say to the feet, You are needless and useless.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse reminds us that the higher members cannot disregard the lower members. Just as the eye needs the hand, and the head needs the feet, each member is important in its own place and contributes to the functioning of the whole body. Even those who are highly gifted cannot fulfill their duties without the aid and cooperation of those with more humble abilities. The less honorable members have a vital role in serving the body and should not envy the more distinguished members, just as the eye should not insult or despise the hand. Similarly, those in authority, like the head, cannot deem the lower parts, like the feet, as needless or useless. The verse emphasizes the necessity of every member, regardless of their status, for the well-being of the body.
