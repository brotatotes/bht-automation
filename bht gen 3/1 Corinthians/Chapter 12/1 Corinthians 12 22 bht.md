# 1 Corinthians 12:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The feeble and seemingly weaker members are not to be overlooked or undervalued, for their very vulnerability reinforces our care and preservation towards them as essential components. Although these members may appear to be more delicate or easily injured, they possess a profound necessity in the body's overall function. In fact, their significance surpasses that of more prominent members like eyes or hands. Just as vital organs are unseen yet indispensable for life, these less noticeable members play a vital role in the unity and growth of the body.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their very feebleness, so far from doing away with the need for them, calls forth our greater care for their preservation, as being felt 'necessary.'" 
2. "More feebleâ€”more susceptible of injury: for example, the brain, the belly, the eye." 
3. "The need for them, calls forth our greater care for their preservation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man can live if his arm or his leg be amputated; but not if his brain, his lungs or his heart be removed. So that, although these parts are more feeble, and more easily injured, they are really more necessary to life, and therefore more useful than the more vigorous portions of the frame."
2. "Those members of the church which are most retiring and feeble apparently which are concealed from public view, unnoticed and unknown - the humble, the meek, the peaceful, and the prayerful - are often more necessary to the true welfare of the church than those who are eminent for their talent and learning."
3. "The vitality of the church could be continued though the man of talent and learning should be removed; as the body may live when the arm or the leg is amputated; but that vitality could not continue if the saint of humble and retiring piety, and of fervent prayerfulness, were removed, any more than the body can live when there is no heart and no lungs."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Seem to be weaker in their original structure, naturally."
2. "This may be indicated by the use of uJparcein to be."
3. "Others explain of those which on occasion seem to be weaker, as when a member is diseased."

### Philip Schaff:
1. 1 Corinthians 12:22. Nay, much rather those members . . . which seem . . . more feeble, are necessary even more than eyes, hands, feet.
	
 


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "So far from the more dignified members like the eye and the head being independent of the subordinate ones like the hands and feet, they are 'much more' in need of them."
2. "Things are not always what they seem. The vital organs (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys) are not visible, but life cannot exist without them."
3. "The vital organs are not visible, but life cannot exist without them."

### John Gill:
1. "The more weak and feeble saints, whose hearts and hands are to be strengthened, whose infirmities are to be bore, have their usefulness."
2. "The effectual working in the measure of every part, even of the feeble and tender, maketh increase of the body, to the edifying of itself in love."
3. "These God has seen fit, as necessary to call by his grace, and place in the body, that his strength may be made perfect in their weakness, and to confound the mighty; and out of the mouths even of babes and sucklings to ordain strength and praise."

### John Wesley:
1. "The members which appear to be weaker." 
2. "Being of a more delicate and tender structure."
3. "Perhaps the brains and bowels, or the veins, arteries, and other minute channels in the body."
