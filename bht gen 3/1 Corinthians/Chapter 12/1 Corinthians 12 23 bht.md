# 1 Corinthians 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Public opinion often designates certain parts of the body as less honorable, but this perception is not based on the true nature of these parts. We tend to bestow more honor on the parts we deem comely, covering them with clothing and adorning them. However, all parts of the body deserve honor. By covering and protecting these supposedly less honorable parts, we show a greater sense of honor. Similarly, it is important to extend honor to all members of the church, regardless of their position or gifts, in order to maintain the unity and integrity of the body as a whole.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Even though culture may deem certain parts of the body as less honorable, this perception is based on public opinion rather than the inherent nature of these parts. In reality, all parts of the body are important and deserve honor. We often dedicate more attention and care to the parts we consider comely, adorning them with clothing and ornaments, while the parts we deem less honorable are covered and protected. However, these less honorable parts still possess a hidden beauty that is not immediately obvious. By covering and caring for these parts, we demonstrate a deeper sense of honor and protect them from unjust disparagement. It is essential that we extend this same level of honor and care to all members of the church, regardless of their position or giftedness. This way, we prevent any potential disgrace and uphold the integrity of the body as a whole.
