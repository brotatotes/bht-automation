# 1 Corinthians 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to maintain unity and harmony within the body, it is crucial to avoid divisions and disunion among the members. Each part of the body, though different, should have the same care and concern for one another's well-being. This means that every member should actively look out for the needs and welfare of others. Just as trouble in one organ affects the entire body, the church should understand that they are interconnected and interdependent. No member should be despised or regarded as unnecessary, for all are equally necessary in their places.
