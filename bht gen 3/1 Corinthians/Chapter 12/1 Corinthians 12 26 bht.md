# 1 Corinthians 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The body is a powerful analogy for the church. Just like when a part of our physical body is hurt, the whole body feels it and reacts accordingly, the body of Christ should also function this way. When one member of the church suffers, the rest should sympathize and support them. Similarly, when one member is honored or succeeds, the entire body should rejoice. This interconnectedness and care for one another fosters unity, harmony, and eliminates envy and contempt within the church community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When the heel, as often happens, is pricked by a thorn, the whole body feels it, and is distressed." 
2. "The head is crowned, and the whole man is glorified; the mouth speaks, and the eyes laugh and are joyous." 
3. "Perhaps the analogy requires that we should rather understand the glorification of those things which physically refresh or benefit the member, e.g. anointing or nourishment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When a thorn enters the heel, the whole body feels it, and is concerned: the back bends, the belly and thighs contract themselves, the hands come forward and draw out the thorn, the head stoops, and the eyes regard the affected member with intense gaze." 
2. "When the head is crowned, the whole man feels honored, the mouth expresses, and the eyes look, gladness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If one is tempted or afflicted, the other members of the church should feel it, and 'bear one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfil his law.'"
2. "In all things pertaining to religion and to their mutual welfare, they should feel that they have a common cause, and regard it as a privilege to aid one another."
3. "If one member is favored with remarkable talent, or is raised to a station of influence, and exerts his influence in the cause of Christ, all the members of the church partake of the benefit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If any one was beaten or maimed or suffered any violence, any man that would and was able might prosecute the wrongdoer; intending by this to accustom the citizens, like members of the same body, to resent and be sensible of one another's injuries."
2. "As in the body, when but a finger is hurt, the whole frame, drawn towards the soul and forming one realm under the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with the part affected."
3. "The head is crowned, and all the members have a share in the honor; the eyes laugh when the mouth speaks."

### John Calvin:
1. "Such a measure of fellow-feeling."
2. "Hence there is no room there for envy or contempt."
3. "Nothing, however, is better fitted to promote harmony than this community of interest, when every one feels that, by the prosperity of others, he is proportionally enriched, and, by their penury, impoverished."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Suffer with it. One of Solon's Laws allowed retaliation by any one for another's injuries."
2. "Rejoice with it. One may tingle with joy all over the body thanks to the wonderful nervous system and to the relation between mind and matter."
3. "See 1 Corinthians 13:6 for joy of love with truth."

### John Gill:
1. "When anyone member of the mystical body is in affliction, whether inward or outward, of body or mind, the rest are, or should be, affected with it, condole, sympathize, help, and assist." 
2. "If one member of the church of Christ is honoured with an high office, with great gifts, with a large measure of grace...the other members rejoice at it." 
3. "Upon the whole it is clear, that the meanest have no reason to be discouraged, nor the highest and greatest to be proud and elated."
