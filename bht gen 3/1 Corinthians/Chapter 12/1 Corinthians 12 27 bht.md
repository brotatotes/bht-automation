# 1 Corinthians 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Each church is a microcosm of the whole body of Christ, with its members having their own place and function. As Christians, we are part of the body of Christ, connected to and dependent on one another. Just as a human body consists of different parts working together, so too are we called to use our unique gifts for the benefit of the whole. Let us not be proud or envious, but recognize the significance of each person's role and fulfill our assigned place in the body.
