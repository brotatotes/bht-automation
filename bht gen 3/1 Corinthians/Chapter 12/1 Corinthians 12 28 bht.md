## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "first apostles] Not merely the Twelve are thus designated, but they and others who bore the same name and had equal power..."
2. "prophets]...those who had the gift of expounding and unfolding doctrine and applying it to practice"
3. "divers kinds of tongues] 'Do you see where he places this gift, and how he uniformly assigns it the last rank?' Chrysostom."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not merely the Twelve, but others are so called, for example, Barnabas."

3. "Government (literally, 'guiding the helm' of affairs), as being occupied with external things, notwithstanding the outward status it gives, is ranked by the Spirit with the lower functions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He has given them the highest authority in the church; he has more signally endowed them and qualified them than he has others."
2. "It is certain that the 'order' of 'apostles' has ceased, and also the 'order' of 'miracles,' and the order of 'healings,' and of 'diversity of tongues.'"
3. "There can be little doubt that the Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÉŒµŒπœÇ kuberneÃÑseis, or governments, refer to offices of rule and authority in the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The middle voice implies for His own use." 
2. "Only here in the New Testament. From kubernaw to steer." 
3. "The ship is one of the ornaments which Clement of Alexandria allows a Christian to wear."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord did not appoint ministers, without first endowing them with the requisite gifts, and qualifying them for discharging their duty. Hence we must infer, that those are fanatics, and actuated by an evil spirit, who intrude themselves into the Church, while destitute of the necessary qualifications."
2. "The natural order...is that gifts come before the office to be discharged."
3. "In this respect there is a difference between them and Pastors, who are, in a manner, tied to their particular churches."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And God hath set some in the church, first (some to be) apostles, secondly prophets the prophets of the New Testament (not of the Old Testament), on whose functions see on 1 Corinthians 12:10."
2. "On comparing this list with that in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, it will be seen that here we have both the gifts and the gifted; there the gifts only: also, two gifts in the first list 'faith and discerning of spirits' are omitted in the second; whereas in the second list there are two which are wanting in the first 'helps,' 'governments.' This shows how little completeness and systematic arrangement were aimed at."
3. "Any and every kind of 'helping' and 'governing' needed in the Church seems to be the things in view... all the supernatural endowments of the early Church will be found to have their counterpart in the ordinary work of the Church of Christ, modified according to circumstances."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Prophets are needed today if men will let God's Spirit use them, men moved to utter the deep things of God."
2. "It is a calamity when the preacher is no longer a teacher, but only an exhorter."
3. "Probably refers to the work of the deacons, help rendered to the poor and the sick."

### John Gill:
1. "first apostles; as were the twelve disciples, and Paul the apostle; men that were immediately sent by Christ himself, and had their commission and doctrine directly from him"
2. "helps: meaning either the ministers of the word in common, who are helpers of the faith and joy of the saints, and are means of increasing their knowledge and spiritual experience, and of establishing them in the truth"
3. "diversities of tongues; such as have the gift of speaking with divers tongues; or of interpreting them, or both"

### John Wesley:
1. "First apostles ‚Äî Who plant the gospel in the heathen nations."
2. "Secondly prophets ‚Äî Who either foretell things to come, or speak by extraordinary inspiration, for the edification of the church."
3. "Helps, governments ‚Äî It does not appear that these mean distinct offices: rather, any persons might be called helps, from a peculiar dexterity in helping the distressed; and governments, from a peculiar talent for governing or presiding in assemblies."
