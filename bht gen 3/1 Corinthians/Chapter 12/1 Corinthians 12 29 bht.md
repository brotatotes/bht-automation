- Attempt 4 BHT: Not everyone possesses all the gifts and offices within the body of Christ. Each member has a specific role, contributing to the common advantage. This helps to prevent boasting, envy, and other contentious attitudes among believers. While some may be apostles, others may be prophets or teachers. The distribution of gifts and offices is intentional, ensuring that no member becomes the whole body. The gift of working miracles, for example, was not given to all but only to a select few in the early times.

- Attempt 5 BHT: Not all members of the body of Christ possess the same gifts and offices. The distribution of these roles prevents pride, envy, and contempt among believers. There were apostles, prophets, and teachers, each with distinct gifts and levels of authority. The gift of working miracles was bestowed on only a few individuals during that time. It is important to recognize that no one person constitutes the entirety of the body, but rather each member contributes to the collective benefit.
