# 1 Corinthians 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The confession or rejection of Jesus as Lord serves as the criteria to determine whether one is inspired by the Spirit of God or not. It is through the Holy Spirit that believers can acknowledge Jesus as the cursed one or as their Lord and Redeemer. Calling Jesus accursed excommunicates Him from one's faith, while true recognition of Jesus as Lord can only come by the working of the Spirit in one's life. The Spirit extends His influence beyond supernatural gifts to encompass the faith and confession of every Christian.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The negative and positive criteria of inspiration by the Spirit of God: viz. the rejection, or confession, of Jesus as the Lord."
2. "Jesus is accursed... the curse, and the confession, are in this way far deeper."
3. "By these last words the influence of the Holy Spirit is widened by the Apostle from the supernatural gifts to which perhaps it had been improperly confined, to the faith and confession of every Christian."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul gives a test of truth against the Gentiles; John, against the false prophets."
2. "The same Spirit is called at one time 'the Spirit of GOD'; at another, 'the HOLY Ghost,' or 'Holy Spirit.' Infinite Holiness is almost synonymous with Godhead."
3. "The spiritual man feels Him to be the Source of all blessings and to be severed from Him is to be accursed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the passage is, to give them some simple general guide by which they could at once recognize the operations of the Spirit of God, and determine whether they who claimed to be under that operation were really so."
2. "It is a proof that any man is under the influence of the Holy Spirit who is heartily disposed to honor the name and work of Jesus Christ."
3. "All true religion is the production of the Holy Spirit. For religion consists essentially in a willingness to honor, and love, and serve the Lord Jesus Christ; and where that exists, it is produced by the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Calleth Jesus accursed [ŒªŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπ Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒºŒ± ŒπŒ∑œÉŒøœÖœÇ] . Lit., saith Anathema Jesus." 
2. "Paul uses only the form ajnaqema, and always in the sense of accursed."

### John Calvin:
1. "From this, too, it follows, that all things that pertain to the true knowledge of God, are the gifts of the Holy Spirit."
2. "No one, speaking by the Spirit of God, can revile Christ; so, on the other hand, no one can speak well of Christ, but by the Spirit of Christ."
3. "We cannot so much as move our tongue for the celebration of God's praise, unless it be governed by his Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Speaking in the Spirit of God (ŒµŒΩ œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ ŒªŒ±ŒªœâŒΩ). Either sphere or instrumentality. No great distinction here between ŒªŒ±ŒªŒµœâ (utter sounds) and ŒªŒµŒ≥œâ (to say)."
2. "Jesus is anathema (Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒºŒ± ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖœÇ). On distinction between Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒºŒ± (curse) and Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒ± (offering Luke 21:5) see discussion there."
3. "Jesus is Lord (ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒøœÇ ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖœÇ). The term ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒøœÇ, as we have seen, is common in the LXX for God. The Romans used it freely for the emperor in the emperor worship."

### John Gill:
1. "No man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed."
2. "Such call Jesus accursed, or 'anathema,' who, if I may be allowed the expression, excommunicate him out of their sermons and faith."
3. "No man can call him his Lord, can appropriate him to himself truly and really, as his Lord, Saviour, and Redeemer, as David, Thomas, the Apostle Paul, and others have done; but by the Spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "Since the heathen idols cannot speak themselves, much less give spiritual gifts to others, these must necessarily be among Christians only."
2. "As none who does this, (which all the Jews and heathens did,) speaketh by the Spirit of God - Is actuated by that Spirit, so as to speak with tongues, heal diseases, or cast out devils."
3. "None can receive him as such; for, in the scripture language, to say, or to believe, implies an experimental assurance."
