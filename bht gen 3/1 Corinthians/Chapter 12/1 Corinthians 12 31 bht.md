# 1 Corinthians 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you must be ambitious for gifts, I will show you a more excellent way, a way of love. Love includes faith and hope and bears the same fruits as the permanent fruits of the Spirit. Love is the mediator that bridges the gap between gods and men, conveying prayers and commands. Love rules without a sword, reigning as the master of all arts. Instead of seeking the greatest gifts, cultivate universal charity and love, which is accessible to all and promotes the harmonious operation of the church.
