## BHT:
Do not just aim at the greater gifts, for there is a more excellent way - the way of love. Love is more to be desired than all gifts, as it includes faith, hope, kindness, forgiveness, and friendship. Love is the fairest and best in itself, and through it, we experience the connection between God and man. This way of love is spiritual wisdom, surpassing all other gifts. While it is not wrong to desire higher gifts, it is crucial to recognize that love is the supremely excellent and valuable endowment that all should aspire to possess.

3. "He did not denounce their zeal as wicked. He did not attempt at once to repress it. He did not say that it was wrong to desire high endowments.

That endowment was love."

### Marvin Vincent:
