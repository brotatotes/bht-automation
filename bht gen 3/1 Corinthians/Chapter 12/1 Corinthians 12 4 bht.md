## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "diversities of gifts‚Äîthat
	is, varieties of spiritual endowments peculiar to the several members
	of the Church."
2. "same Spirit‚ÄîThe Holy
	Trinity appears here: the Holy Spirit in this verse; Christ
	in 1 Corinthians 12:5; and the Father
	in 1 Corinthians 12:6."
3. "The terms 'gifts,'
	'administrations,' and 'operations,' respectively
	correspond to the Divine Three."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design for which he refers to these various endowments is evidently to show those whom he addressed, that since they are all produced by the same Holy Spirit, have all the same divine origin, and are all intended to answer some important purpose and end in the Christian church, that, therefore, none are to be despised; nor is one man to regard himself as authorized to treat another with contempt."
2. "The Spirit has divided and conferred those gifts according to his sovereign will; and his arrangements should be regarded with submission, and the favors which he confers should be received with thankfulness."
3. "That the Holy Spirit - the third person of the adorable Trinity - is here intended by the word 'Spirit,' seems to be manifest on the face of the passage, and has been the received interpretation of the church until it was called in question by some recent German commentators, at the head of whom was Eichhorn."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is no objection to combining both meanings, a distribution of gifts implying a diversity." 
2. "Gifts [œáŒ±œÅŒπœÉŒºŒ±œÑœâŒΩ] . See on Romans 1:11." 
3. "In the New Testament commonly of spiritual service of an official character."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of what he states amounts to this ‚Äî that gifts are not distributed thus variously among believers, in order that they may be used apart, but that in the division there is a unity, inasmuch as one Spirit is the source of all those gifts, one God is the Lord of all administrations, and the author of all exercises of power."
2. "Here, however, Paul plainly testifies, that there is one essential power of God, whence all his works proceed. The term Spirit, it is true, is sometimes transferred by metonymy to the gifts themselves... Paul, however, here plainly testifies that judgment, and knowledge, and gentleness, and all other gifts, proceed from one source."
3. "The administrations, says Paul, are different, but there is only one God whom we must serve, whatever administration we discharge. This antithesis, then, shows what is the simple meaning, so that to confine it to Christ is rather forced."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Diversities (Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœÉŒµŒπœÇ). Old word for distinctions, differences, distributions."
2. "Of gifts (œáŒ±œÅŒπœÉŒºŒ±œÑœâŒΩ). Late word and chiefly in Paul (cf. Romans 12:6) in N.T."
3. "It means a favour (from œáŒ±œÅŒπŒ∂ŒøŒºŒ±) bestowed or received without any merit."

### John Gill:
1. "Those who have the largest share of them should not boast of them as acquired by themselves, or be puffed up on account of them."
2. "And those who have the smallest measure should be content and thankful; for though the gifts are different, some have greater, and others lesser, none have all, but all have some, yet not alike."
3. "The lesser gifts, and the smallest degree of them, come from the Spirit of God, as well as the greater."

### John Wesley:
1. "Divers streams, but all from one fountain." 
2. "This verse speaks of the Holy Ghost, the next of Christ, the sixth of God the Father." 
3. "The apostle treats of the Spirit, of Christ, of God."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In 1 Corinthians 12:4, we are reminded of the various gifts that are bestowed upon members of the Church by the Holy Spirit. These gifts, referred to as diversities of gifts, are diverse because each member is uniquely equipped with spiritual endowments. However, although these gifts may differ, they all come from the same source - the Holy Spirit. Just as the Holy Trinity is revealed through the Holy Spirit, Christ, and the Father in subsequent verses, the distribution of gifts corresponds to the divine nature of the Triune God. It is important to recognize that these gifts are not meant to be used in isolation, but rather to contribute to the unity and edification of the Church. Ultimately, regardless of the type or magnitude of the gifts we possess, we should humbly acknowledge that they are bestowed upon us by God's grace, and we should use them for His glory.
