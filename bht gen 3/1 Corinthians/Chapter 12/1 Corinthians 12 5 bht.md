### Albert Barnes:
1. "There are different ranks and grades in the ministries which Christ has appointed."
2. "The term 'Lord,' when it stands by itself in the New Testament, usually refers to the Lord Jesus."
3. "The design of the verse is, to show that all these offices had their appointment from him; and that since all were his appointment, and all were necessary, no one should be proud of an elevated station; no one should be depressed, or feel himself degraded, because he had been designated to a more humble office."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This old word is from Î´Î¹Î±ÎºÎ¿Î½Î¿Ï‚ and has a general meaning of service as here (Romans 11:13) and a special ministration like that of Martha (Luke 10:40) and the collection (1 Corinthians 16:15; 2 Corinthians 8:4)."

### John Gill:
1. "And there are differences of administrations,.... Or ministries; offices in the church, ministered in by different persons, as apostles, prophets, pastors, or teachers and deacons; who were employed in planting and forming of churches, ordaining elders, preaching the word, administering ordinances, and taking care of the poor." 
2. "But the same Lord; meaning either Jesus Christ, whom the believer, by the Holy Ghost, says is Lord; who, as the ascended King of saints, and Lord and head of the church, appoints different offices and officers in it."
3. "Or rather the Lord, the Spirit, who calls men to these several ministrations, separates and fits them for them, and constitutes and installs them into them, and assists them in the discharge of them; since he only, and all along, is spoken of in the context as the efficient of these several things."

### John Wesley:
1. Administrations â€” Offices. But the same Lord appoints them all.
