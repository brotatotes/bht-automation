### Albert Barnes:
1. "All that he produces in the mind is a manifestation of his character and work, in the same way as the works of God in the visible creation are a manifestation of his perfections."
2. "The Spirit of God gives to each Christian such graces and endowments as he pleases; that he distributes his gifts to all, not equally, but in a manner which he shall choose; and that the design of this is, that all Christians should use his endowments for the common good."
3. "They are bestowed not on all equally, but in such a manner as shall best subserve the interests of piety and the church, and as shall tend harmoniously to carry on the great interests of religion, and further the welfare of the whole Christian body."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not confer them upon us in vain, nor does he intend that they shall serve the purpose of ostentation."
2. "The manifestation of the Spirit may be taken in a passive as well as in an active sense - in a passive sense, because wherever there is prophecy, or knowledge, or any other gift, the Spirit of God does there manifest himself - in an active sense, because the Spirit of God, when he enriches us with any gift, unlocks his treasures, for the purpose of manifesting to us those things that would otherwise have been concealed and shut up."
3. "The view taken by Chrysostom is rather harsh and forced - that this term is used, because unbelievers do not recognize God, except by visible miracles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Manifestation (œÜŒ±ŒΩŒµœÅœâœÉŒπœÇ). Late word, in papyri, in N.T. only here and 2 Corinthians 4:2, from œÜŒ±ŒΩŒµœÅŒøœâ, to make manifest (œÜŒ±ŒΩŒµœÅŒøœÇ)." 
2. "Each instance of the whole (verse 1 Corinthians 12:6) is repeatedly given (Œ¥ŒπŒ¥ŒøœÑŒ±, present passive indicative of Œ¥ŒπŒ¥œâŒº)." 
3. "To profit withal (œÄœÅŒøœÇ œÑŒø œÉœÖŒºœÜŒµœÅŒøŒΩ). See on 1 Corinthians 6:12; 1 Corinthians 10:23; 1 Corinthians 10:33 for Paul's guiding principle in such matters."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that which the Spirit manifests, as the grace and love of God, an interest in Christ, the doctrines of the Gospel, and the things of another world; but that which manifests that a man has the Spirit of God..."
2. "the least measure of which, as being able to say that Jesus is Lord, shows that a man has the Spirit of God; or rather the gifts of the Spirit, ordinary or extraordinary, which are such as manifestly declare their author..."
3. "but for profit and advantage, and that not merely private, or a man's own, but public, the good of the whole community or church, to which the least grace or gift, rightly used, may contribute."

### John Wesley:
1. The manifestation ‚Äî The gift whereby the Spirit manifests itself.
Is given to each ‚Äî For the profit of the whole body.
