## BHT:
Wisdom and knowledge are distinct yet interconnected gifts. Wisdom encompasses the practical application of Christian truths, reducing them to order and clarity, while knowledge delves into theoretical insights. Wisdom is not fleeting like knowledge; it pertains to eternal matters. The word of wisdom is a speech rooted in divine wisdom, guided by the Spirit. The word of knowledge illuminates and interprets the scriptures. These gifts, given by the Spirit, serve to differentiate true ministers from imposters and aid in comprehending the grand design of salvation.
