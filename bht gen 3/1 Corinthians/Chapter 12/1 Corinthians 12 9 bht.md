## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "This faith is the mother of miracles."
3. "A faith, enabling a man to place himself beyond the region of mere moral certainty, in the actual realization of things believed, in a high and unusual manner."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith...confidence in God, by the impulse of His Spirit, that He would enable them to perform any required miracle."
2. "Its nature, or principle, is the same as that of saving faith, namely, reliance on God; the producing cause, also, in the same, namely, a power altogether supernatural."
3. "Saving faith does not save by its intrinsic merit, but by the merits of Him who is the object of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many of the most useful people in the church are distinguished mainly for their simple confidence in the promises of God."
2. "Humble piety and reliance in the divine promises... will often do infinitely more in the promotion of his kingdom than the most splendid endowments of learning and talent."
3. "Faith is one of the highest endowments of the Christian life; and yet, though all may obtain it, it is one of the rarest endowments."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Faith. Not saving faith in general, which is the common endowment of all Christians, but wonder - working faith.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Faith (œÄŒπœÉœÑŒπœÇ). Not faith of surrender, saving faith, but wonder-working faith like that in 1 Corinthians 13:2 (Matthew 17:20; Matthew 21:21)." 
2. "Gifts of healings (œáŒ±œÅŒπœÉŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ŒπŒ±ŒºŒ±œÑœâŒΩ). ŒôŒ±ŒºŒ±, old word from ŒπŒ±ŒøŒºŒ±, common in LXX, in N.T. only in this chapter. It means acts of healing as in Acts 4:30 (cf. James 5:14) and Luke 7:21 (of Jesus)."
3. "Note ŒµŒΩ here as just before."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the grace of faith, which is common to all believers, though given by the same Spirit: but rather the doctrine of faith, and ability to preach it, and boldness and intrepidity of spirit to assert and defend it in the face of all opposition."
2. "Though generally this is understood of a faith of working miracles, but the working of miracles is mentioned afterwards as distinct."
3. "These gifts were bestowed in common, by the Spirit, on apostles, prophets, and pastors, or elders of the church, in those early times."

### John Wesley:
1. "Faith may here mean an extraordinary trust in God under the most difficult or dangerous circumstances."
2. "The gift of healing need not be wholly confined to the healing diseases with a word or a touch."
3. "And thus it may be with regard to other gifts likewise."
