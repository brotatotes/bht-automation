# 1 Corinthians 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even if I could speak with the tongues of men and of angels, my words would be like empty clanging sounds without love. Gifted languages without love are meaningless and lack soul. Love is the essence that gives significance and depth to our words, even if they may not be understood by others. It surpasses all other virtues and is the driving force behind the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. Love is the greatest and strongest attribute, embodying the very heart of what Paul taught.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Though I speak (or, should speak) supposes a case which never has been exemplified: even if I can speak with the tongues of men and of angels."
2. "See where he sets ont: first beginning with that which seemed to them so great and wonderful, the gift of tongues."
3. "The â€˜caritasâ€™ of the Latin versions has occasioned the rendering â€˜charityâ€™ in most modern versions. Of this word Stanley remarks, 'The limitation of its meaning on the one hand to mere almsgiving, or on the other to mere toleration, has so much narrowed its sense, that the simpler term â€˜Love,â€™ though too general exactly to meet the case, is now the best equivalent.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though I speak with the tonguesâ€”with the eloquence which was so much admired at Corinth, and with the command of various languages, which some at Corinth abused to purposes of mere ostentation."
2. "Charityâ€”the principle of the ordinary and more important gifts of the Spirit, as contrasted with the extraordinary gifts."
3. "Sounding . . . tinklingâ€”sound without soul or feeling: such are 'tongues' without charity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Even though a man had a far higher faculty of speaking languages than would be included in the endowment of speaking all the languages of human beings as people speak them, and even had the higher and more perfect mode of utterance which the angels have, and yet were destitute of love, all would be nothing." 
2. "The 'love' which is referred to in this chapter, and illustrated, is mainly 'love to man'; though there is no reason to doubt that the apostle meant also to include in the general term love to God, or love in general."
3. "If I could speak all languages, yet if I had not love, the faculty would be like the clattering, clanging sound of the cymbal, that contributes nothing to the welfare of others. It would all be hollow, vain, useless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Charity follows the caritas of the Vulgate, and is not used consistently in the A. V. On the contrary, in the gospels, ajgaph is always rendered love, and mostly elsewhere, except in this epistle, where the word occurs but twice."
2. "There is no more reason for saying 'charity envieth not,' than for saying 'God is charity;' 'the charity of Christ constraineth us;' 'the charity of God is shed abroad in our hearts.'"
3. "The comparison is between the unmeaning clash of metal, and music; between ecstatic utterances which are jargon, and utterances inspired by love, which, though unintelligible to the hearers, may carry a meaning to the speaker himself and to God, 1 Corinthians 14:4, 1 Corinthians 14:7."

### John Calvin:
1. "For what purpose did it serve to connect with what goes before a detached sentence, which agrees so well with what comes after â€” nay more, is thereby rendered complete?"
2. "All excellencies are of no value without love; for nothing is so excellent or estimable as not to be vitiated in the sight of God, if love is wanting."
3. "Make yourself master of all the languages, not of men merely, but even of Angels. You have, in that case, no reason to think, that you are of higher estimation in the sight of God than a mere cymbal, if you have not love."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though I speak with the tongues of men. The gift of tongues seems to have been largely possessed and eagerly exercised in the Corinthian church."
2. "And of angels who doubtless have a way of holding mutual communication, though here the reference seems quite general, for 'the most exalted form of creature utterance.'"
3. "And have not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal giving forth no real music but mere jumbling sounds."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The greatest, strongest, deepest thing Paul ever wrote."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of love which they were possessed of, was abundantly preferable to it."
2. "The most eloquent speech, and most excellent of languages; or if there can be thought to be any tongue that exceeds that of men, which, if angels spoke, they would make use of."
3. "Just as the face of angels is used, to express the greatest glory and beauty of the face, or countenance, Acts 6:15 and angels' bread is used for the most excellent food, Psalms 78:25."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Even if I could speak with the tongues of men and of angels, if I do not have love, my words would be just empty noise, like the clash of a cymbal or the sound of a brass instrument. It is not enough to possess the gift of tongues, which was highly regarded in the Corinthian church but instead, love is the principle that truly matters, contrasting with the vain and showy nature of flashy languages. As one commentator aptly puts it, All excellencies are of no value without love; for nothing is so excellent or estimable as not to be vitiated in the sight of God, if love is wanting. Love is the essence that breathes meaning and soul into our words, carrying significance not just to the speaker, but also to God. This verse encapsulates the truth that love is the greatest, strongest, and deepest virtue, surpassing all other gifts and faculties that one may possess.
