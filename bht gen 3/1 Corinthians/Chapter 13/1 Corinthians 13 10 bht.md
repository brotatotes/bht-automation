# 1 Corinthians 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When that which is perfect, the full-grown and mature state, arrives, the partial and fragmentary knowledge we now possess will be abolished, forgotten, and lost in the superior and perfect glory of the eternal world. The imperfection of our knowledge will be removed, giving way to the enduring and vanishing away the temporary. At death and in the last day, when perfect knowledge of God and Christ is attained, the imperfect methods and reception of knowledge will cease.
