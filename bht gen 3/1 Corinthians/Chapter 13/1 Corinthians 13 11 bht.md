# 1 Corinthians 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As a child, my thoughts, words, and reasoning were naive and incomplete. However, now that I have matured, I have put away those childish ways. This transformation reflects the growth we experience in our understanding of spiritual matters as we mature in our faith. Our current knowledge is like a child's compared to the wisdom and knowledge that await us in heaven. We are constantly learning and developing in this world, but one day, in the fullness of maturity, we will gain a deeper understanding and leave behind the limitations of our childish thinking.

1. "Hereby the apostle illustrates the then present gift of speaking with divers tongues, which was an extraordinary gift of the Spirit, was peculiar to some persons, and what many were very fond of; and yet this, in its highest degree and exercise, was but like the lisping of a child, in comparison of what will be known and expressed by saints when they come to be perfect men in heaven."

3. "So when the saints shall be grown to the full age of Christ, and are become perfect men in him, tongues shall cease, prophecies shall fail, and knowledge vanish away; and in the room thereof, such conversation, understanding, and knowledge take place, as will be entirely suited to the manly state in glory."

### John Wesley:

- Attempt 1 BHT: As a child, I spoke, felt, and thought like a child - my knowledge and understanding were limited, my reasoning incomplete. However, now that I am matured and have put away those childish ways of thinking, I have embraced a deeper level of understanding. This verse emphasizes the improvement we experience in our comprehension of spiritual matters as we grow in our faith. Just as a child's speech is incomparable to that of an adult, our current knowledge is limited in comparison to the wisdom and understanding we will have in heaven. In our present state, we still have much more to learn and develop, but one day, when we reach the fullness of spiritual maturity, we will leave behind childish things and fully embrace the depth of knowledge and understanding that lies ahead.
