# 1 Corinthians 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our comprehension of God's truth is like peering into an ancient, imperfectly-reflecting metallic mirror. Although God has complete knowledge of us, our knowledge of Him is only partial in this present life. Yet, we eagerly anticipate a future time when we will fully know God, just as He fully knows us. In that state, there will be no need for intermediary means of understanding Him; we will see God and all truths clearly, without any veils or obscurity separating us from Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We must think, not of our mirrors of glass, but of the imperfectly-reflecting metallic mirrors of the ancients."

3. "I shall thoroughly know even as I was (during this life: he places himself in that state, and uses the aor. as of a thing gone by) thoroughly known."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The contrast is between the inadequate knowledge of an object gained by seeing it reflected in a dim mirror (such as ancient mirrors were), compared with the perfect idea we have of it by seeing itself directly." 
2. "But neither 'eye nor ear' can fully represent (though the believer's soul gets a small revelation now of) 'the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him'." 
3. "Now we are known by, rather than know, God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Compared with what it will be in the future world, it is like the imperfect view of an object which we have in looking through an obscure and opaque medium compared with the view which we have when we look at it 'face to face.'"
2. "It is not improbable, I think, that even in the time of Paul the ancients had the knowledge of glass, though it was probably at first very imperfect and obscure."
3. "He would see things as he was now seen and would be seen there. It would be face to face. He would be in their presence."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The figure of the mirror, illustrating the partial vision of divine things, is frequent in the rabbinical writings."
3. "I shall fully know."

### John Calvin:
1. "The ministry of the word, I say, is like a looking-glass For the angels have no need of preaching, or other inferior helps, nor of sacraments, for they enjoy a vision of God of another kind."
2. "How so? Because it sees not his face, but rests satisfied with the image in the mirror; but when we shall have left the world, and gone to him, it will behold him as near and before its eyes."
3. "The knowledge of God, which we now have from his word, is indeed certain and true, and has nothing in it that is confused, or perplexed, or dark, but is spoken of as comparatively obscure, because it comes far short of that clear manifestation to which we look forward; for then we shall see face to face."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For new we see in a mirror darkly or ‚Äòdimly:'" 
2. "The mirrors of those days were not like ours, but polished metallic surfaces, reflecting objects but imperfectly; and since the figure seemed to be behind the mirror, the observer seemed to see ‚Äúthrough‚Äù it."

2. "To see a friend's face in a cheap mirror would be very different from looking at the friend."
3. "Shall I know. I shall fully know."

### John Gill:
1. "In this present life, they that are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see God, the perfections and glory of his nature, the riches of his grace and goodness, as displayed in Christ; they behold the glory of Christ, as full of grace and truth, and are filled with love to him."
2. "There will be no intervening mediums of vision; not the glass of the word and ordinances; there will be no need of them, God and Christ will be seen as they are."

### John Wesley:

2. "Now I know in part ‚Äî Even when God himself reveals things to me, great part of them is still kept under the veil."
3. "But then I shall know even as also I am known ‚Äî In a clear, full, comprehensive manner; in some measure like God, who penetrates the centre of every object, and sees at one glance through my soul and all things."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In this verse, we are reminded of the limitations of our current knowledge and understanding of God's truth. Our comprehension is like looking at a reflection in an ancient metallic mirror, lacking the clarity and fullness that comes from seeing something face to face. Although we are known by God, our knowledge of Him is only partial and incomplete. However, we have hope that in the future, we will fully know and understand Him, just as He fully knows and understands us. In that future state, we will see God and all things clearly, without any intermediary or veil obstructing our vision. Until then, we continue to seek and grow in our understanding, knowing that one day we will have a complete and perfect knowledge of God.
