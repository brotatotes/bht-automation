# 1 Corinthians 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without love, all the spiritual gifts - the ability to understand mysteries, to prophesy, and even to have faith that can move mountains - are meaningless. Even if one possesses the knowledge of all mysteries, it is ultimately empty without love. Love is what transforms these gifts from a superficial exhibition of power to a genuine expression of God's grace and compassion. Without love, all these gifts amount to nothing; one is reduced to being a mere zero in the eyes of God.
