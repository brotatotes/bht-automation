# 1 Corinthians 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though I may give away all my possessions and offer my body to be burned, if it is not done with true love, it is worthless. True love is not just natural benevolence or mere acts of generosity, but rather a love for God and for others that is all-encompassing and eternal. Even acts of martyrdom or extreme charity, if not motivated by genuine love, are of no benefit to the soul. Without love, all virtues are empty and offensive in the sight of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The true and most significant sense is 'though I dole away in mouthfuls all my property or estates.' Who that has witnessed the almsgiving in a Catholic monastery, or the court of a Spanish or Sicilian bishopâ€™s or archbishopâ€™s palace, where immense revenues are syringed away in farthings to herds of beggars, but must feel the force of the Apostleâ€™s half-satirical expression?"
2. "Both the deeds mentioned in this verse are such as ordinarily are held to be the fruits of love, but they may be done without it, and if so are worthless."
3. "The objection to 'that I may boast' seems to be that it introduces an irrelevant and confusing element, a boastful motive, into a set of hypotheses which put forward merely an act or set of acts on the one side, and the absence of love on the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These are most noble exemplifications of love in giving and in suffering."
2. "Yet they may be without love; in which case the 'goods' and 'body' are given, but not the soul, which is the sphere of love."
3. "Men will fight for Christianity, and die for Christianity, but not live in its spirit, which is love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If all that a man had were dealt out in this way, in small portions, so as to benefit as many as possible, and yet were not attended 'with true love toward God and toward man,' it would be all false, hollow, hypocritical, and really of no value in regard to his own salvation. It would profit nothing."
2. "Though I should be willing to lay down my life in the most painful manner, and have not charity, it would profit me nothing."
3. "If there is no true piety, there can be no benefit in this to my soul. It will not save me. If I have no true love to God, I must perish, after all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means to feed out in morsels, dole out."
2. "Martyrdom for the sake of ambition was a fact of early occurrence in the Church."
3. "There were Christians who...imagined redemptiveness of the baptism of blood."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as liberality in many cases proceeds from ambition â€” not from true generosity, or even the man that is liberal is destitute of the other departments of love, (for even liberality, that is inwardly felt, is only one department of love,) it may happen that a work, otherwise so commendable, has...a fair show in the sight of men, and is applauded by them, and yet is regarded as nothing in the sight of God."
2. "Yet even this, too, God regards as nothing, if the mind is destitute of love."
3. "For where it is wanting, the beauty of all virtues is mere tinsel â€” is empty sound â€” is not worth a straw â€” nay more, is offensive and disgusting."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And though I bestow [1] all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give (â€˜deliver upâ€™) my body to be burned [2] a practice not unknown even to heathenism, as witness Sutteeism in India, happily now abolished... Yet without love, this will avail me nothing."
2. "But what is the love meant here? Certainly, not mere natural benevolence, even in its most disinterested form. Fundamentally, it can only be what Israel was familiar with even from the days of their wilderness journeyings: 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and mind and strength, and thy neighbour as thyself.'"
3. "Such then, is the love here opened up in its varied outgoings towards our fellow-men, and held forth as indispensable, incomparable, eternal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Bestow to feed, to nourish, by putting a morsel into the mouth like an infant (or bird)." 
2. "There were even some who courted martyrdom in later years." 
3. "Literally, I am helped nothing."

### John Gill:
1. "But of what avail was all this, when what these men did, they did not from a principle of love to God, nor to Christ, nor even to the poor... but to have honour and applause from men, and have and obtain eternal life hereafter?"
2. "Such things may profit others, but not a man's self; giving all his goods to the poor may be of advantage to them, and giving his body to be burned in the cause of religion may be of service to others, to confirm their faith, and encourage them to like sufferings when called to them; but can be of no avail to themselves in the business of salvation..."
3. "Which is not procured by works of righteousness, even the best, and much less by such which proceed from wrong principles, and are directed to wrong ends; the grace of God being wanting, and particularly that of love."

### John Wesley:
1. "And though I â€” Deliberately, piece by piece. Give all my goods to feed the poor, yea, though I deliver up my body to be burned - Rather than I would renounce my religion."
2. "And have not the love â€” Hereafter described."
3. "It profiteth me nothing â€” Without this, whatever I speak, whatever I have, whatever I know, whatever I do, whatever I suffer, is nothing."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Even if I were to give away all my possessions to feed the poor or even sacrifice my own body in martyrdom, if I do not possess true love, it is all in vain. These acts, while seemingly noble, are worthless if not driven by love. True love is not simply natural benevolence, but rather a deep and all-encompassing love for both God and our neighbors. It is only through this kind of love that our actions hold value and have eternal significance. Without love, all our works, words, possessions, and even sacrifices are meaningless in the sight of God.
