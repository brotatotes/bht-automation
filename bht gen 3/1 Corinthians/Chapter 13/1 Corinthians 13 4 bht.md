### Albert Barnes:
1. "Charity suffereth long - Paul now proceeds to illustrate the 'nature' of love, or to show how it is exemplified. His illustrations are all drawn from its effect in regulating our conduct toward others, or our contact with them."
2. "The 'reason' why he made use of this illustration, rather than its nature as evinced toward 'God,' was, probably, because it was especially necessary for them to understand in what way it should be manifested toward each other."
3. "Besides, it is not the 'nature' of love to fill the mind in this manner. Pride, vanity, and even knowledge 1 Corinthians 8:1, may swell the mind with the conviction of self-importance; but love is humble, meek, modest, unobtrusive."

2. "A third excellence is ‚Äî that it counteracts emulation, the seed of all contentions."
3. "Paul, therefore, ascribes to love moderation, and declares that it is a bridle to restrain men, that they may not break forth into ferocity, but may live together in a peaceable and orderly manner."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Love suffereth long. This long-suffering is the protracted endurance of wrong, such as is fitted to provoke resentment." (Commentary)
2. "The word means to 'shew oneself benignant, gentle, good, meek.' Though used only here as a verb, it occurs frequently as an adjective, and precisely as it occurs here, in conjunction with long-suffering, the one being the negative, the other the positive side of the same quality; shewing that though there is no conjunction between them in the original, they were intended to go together." (Commentary)
3. "Love vaunteth not itself; is not puffed up, does not ostentatiously parade its superiority to others, whether real or supposed, priding itself on it." (Commentary)

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. "The love of God, and of our neighbour for God's sake, is patient toward, all men. It, suffers all the weakness, ignorance, errors, and infirmities of the children of God; all the malice and wickedness of the children of the world: and all this, not only for a time, but to the end." 
2. "Love acteth not rashly ‚Äî Does not hastily condemn any one; never passes a severe sentence on a slight or sudden view of things."
3. "Nor does it ever act or behave in a violent, headstrong, or precipitate manner."
