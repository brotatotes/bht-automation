## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "longsuffering is the negative side, kindness the positive, of a loving temper: the former the withholding of anger; the latter, the exercise of kindness."
2. "envieth not] the word in the original means more,— ‘knows neither envy nor jealousy:’ both are included under it."
3. "vaunteth not itself] The word in the original is an universal one; a good definition of its meaning is given by Basil, as including 'all that a man takes upon himself, not from duty or necessity, but for the sake of self-exaltation.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "suffereth long—under provocations of evil from others. The negative side of love."
2. "is kind—the positive side. Extending good to others. Compare with love's features here those of the 'wisdom from above'."
3. "vaunteth not—in words, even of gifts which it really possesses; an indirect rebuke of those at Corinth who used the gift of tongues for mere display."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Love is benignant. It wishes well. It is not harsh, sour, morose, ill-natured. ... It is gentle and mild."
2. "Love does not envy others the happiness which they enjoy; it delights in their welfare."
3. "A man may be very proud and vain and not express it in the form of boasting. That state is indicated by this word [puffed up]. If he gives expression to this feeling, and boasts of his endowments, that is indicated by the previous word [vaunteth]. Love would prevent this, as it would the former. It would destroy the feeling, as well as the expression of it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The high charity which makes us servants Prompt to the counsel which controls the world." DANTE, "Paradiso," 21, 70, 71.
2. "Heavens! How I showed off [ενεπερπερευσαμην] before my new auditor Pompey," and describes the various rhetorical tricks which he employed.
3. "That swells with love the spirit well - disposed." " Paradiso, " 10, 144.

### John Calvin:
1. "The first commendation of love is this — that, by patient endurance of many things, it promotes peace and harmony in the Church."
2. "A third excellence is — that it counteracts emulation, the seed of all contentions."
3. "That man, then, who is governed by love, is not puffed up with pride, so as to despise others and feel satisfied with himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Love suffereth long. This long-suffering is the protracted endurance of wrong, such as is fitted to provoke resentment." 
2. "Love envieth not. Here 'envy' is plainly meant that miserable feeling of chagrin at the good of another, not possessed by ourselves, which corrodes the heart."
3. "Love vaunteth not itself; is not puffed up does not ostentatiously parade its superiority to others, whether real or supposed, priding itself on it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Suffereth long (μακροθυμε). Late Koine word (Plutarch) from μακρος, long, θυμος, passion, ardour. Cf. James 5:7." 
2. "Envieth not (ου ζηλο). Present active indicative of ζηλοω (contraction οει=ο, same as subjunctive and optative forms). Bad sense of ζηλος from ζεω, to boil, good sense in 1 Corinthians 12:31. Love is neither jealous nor envious (both ideas)."
3. "Is not puffed up (ου φυσιουτα). Present direct middle indicative of φυσιοω from φυσις (late form for φυσαω, φυσιαω from φυσα, bellows), to puff oneself out like a pair of bellows. This form in Herodas and Menander. Is not arrogant. See on 1 Corinthians 4:6."

### John Gill:
1. "Charity suffereth long... exercises forbearance, suffers long, and bears much, and is ready to forgive."
2. "and is kind... accommodates himself to their infirmities, capacities, manners, and circumstances."
3. "charity vaunteth not itself...such an one is not troublesome in a commonwealth, nor does he go into parties and factions in churches, but is all the reverse."

### John Wesley:
1. "The love of God, and of our neighbour for God's sake, is patient toward all men."
2. "Love acteth not rashly — Does not hastily condemn any one; never passes a severe sentence on a slight or sudden view of things."
3. "Is not puffed up — Yea, humbles the soul to the dust."
