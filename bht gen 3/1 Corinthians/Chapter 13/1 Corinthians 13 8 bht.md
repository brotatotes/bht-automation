Love never fails; it always holds its place. While other spiritual gifts may cease and be superseded by more perfect heavenly analogues, love will always exist.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "In heaven, also, there will be no need that the faith of Godâ€™s people shall be encouraged, or their devotions excited, by such exhortations and instructions as are needful now; and the endowment of prophecy will be, therefore, unknown."

2. "If we may conjecture as to the state of the dead, it is a more probable supposition, that departed saints are ignorant of what is doing here, than that they are aware of our necessities."
3. "So far as I can conjecture, and am able even to gather in part from this passage â€” inasmuch as learning, knowledge of languages, and similar gifts are subservient to the necessity of this life, I do not think that there will be any of them then remaining. The learned, however, will sustain no loss from the want of them, inasmuch as they will receive the fruit of them, which is greatly to be preferred."

### John Gill:
1. "Charity never faileth.... It may be left, but not lost; the fervour of it may be remitted and abated; it may wax cold through the prevalence of sin; it may be greatly damped by the growth of error and heresy, which eat as do a canker; and may be much obstructed by an anxious and immoderate care and concern for worldly things..."
2. "[Love] also continues as to its use, and will do so, when faith and hope will loose theirs, even in the other world; for faith will be changed into vision, and hope into enjoyment; but love will be the same, only act in a higher sphere, and to a greater degree, and in a perfect manner."
3. "The gift of speaking with divers tongues will cease, indeed it has already; nor will there be any use for such an extraordinary gift in the other world; when probably, and as it is thought by some, there will be but one language, and that the Hebrew language; as the whole earth was of one language and speech before the confusion at Babel."

### John Wesley:
1. "Love never faileth â€” It accompanies to, and adorns us in, eternity; it prepares us for, and constitutes, heaven."
2. "Whether there be tongues, they shall cease â€” One language shall prevail among all the inhabitants of heaven, and the low and imperfect languages of earth be forgotten."
3. "The knowledge likewise which we now so eagerly pursue, shall then vanish away - As starlight is lost in that of the midday sun, so our present knowledge in the light of eternity."
