# 1 Corinthians 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There are various kinds of voices in the world, each with its own distinct mode of speech and meaning. None of these voices are without signification; they all carry a definite message. Every language has its purpose and significance, conveying ideas and bringing understanding to those who comprehend it. The multitude of voices we hear reminds us to speak in a way that can be understood, just as every word in a language has a meaning that cannot be conveyed without a voice.
