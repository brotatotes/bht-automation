# 1 Corinthians 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If I do not understand the meaning of the voice, then I will be like a foreigner, a barbarian, to the speaker. Likewise, the one who speaks will be like a barbarian to me, an outsider. It is foolish and preposterous to speak in a way that is not understood, for it hinders true fellowship. The inability to understand each other's language creates a sense of isolation, as if we are inhabitants of desolate and foreign places, unable to comprehend the words spoken by others.
