# 1 Corinthians 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When I pray in tongues, my spirit is inflamed with holy desires, but my intellectual part bears no fruit to edify others. The prayer is rhapsodical, moving my spirit, yet my understanding remains unfruitful for the benefit of others. It is important that my prayer is intelligible and the understanding can join in, so it is not in vain or profitless. If I pray without understanding, my intellect gets no benefit, and it does not align with the nature of prayer to merely proceed from the lips without involving the inmost soul.

- Attempt 4 BHT: When I pray in a tongue, my higher being, my spirit, is filled with the Holy Ghost and rapt in prayer. However, my intellectual part, lacking material to exercise its powers, does not bear fruit in edifying others. While rhapsodical praying moves my spirit, it leaves my understanding unfruitful and unintelligible to others. Prayer should be both heartfelt and intelligible, engaging the inmost soul instead of proceeding solely from the lips. True prayer involves both the spirit and the understanding, benefiting both the self and others.
