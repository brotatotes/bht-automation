### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When it comes to speaking in tongues, the Apostle does not criticize the act of thanksgiving itself, as it is a good thing inspired by the Spirit. However, what he finds fault with is when it is done without regard for edifying others. This pertains to the private individual who prays and gives thanks in a language that is not understood by the rest of the congregation. They may offer their prayers with sincerity and skill, but if the others cannot comprehend what is being said, they will not benefit from it. In contrast, the prayers of the Christian Church are seen as a form of blessing and giving thanks, which aligns with other biblical references to the importance of prayer and gratitude.
