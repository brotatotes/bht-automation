# 1 Corinthians 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the one who speaks in tongues is not speaking to men, but to God. This form of communication is characterized by speaking mysteries in the Spirit, which are often hidden and unintelligible to both the hearers and even the speaker himself. While there are a few exceptions who possess the gift of interpreting tongues, for most people, these utterances serve as unexplained mysteries, exciting wonder rather than conveying clear understanding. Thus, the purpose of speaking in tongues is to express profound truths and secrets directly to God.
