2. "Howbeit in malice be ye children... to be without guile and hypocrisy, without rancour and bitterness, envying and malice, but tender hearted, and ready to forgive."
3. "But in understanding be men; or 'perfect', of ripe and full age, who have their senses exercised to discern between good and evil."

### John Wesley:
