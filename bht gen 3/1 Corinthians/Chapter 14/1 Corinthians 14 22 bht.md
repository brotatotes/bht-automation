# 1 Corinthians 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of tongues in 1 Corinthians 14:22 is primarily for condemning those who reject the sign and message, rather than serving as a means of persuasion for believers. Tongues are a sign, evidence, or proof that God approves of the preaching of the gospel, while prophesying serves to spiritually nourish and confirm the faith of believers. Tongues are not primarily for the unbelieving, but rather for captivating their attention and instilling awe. So, while tongues have a miraculous aspect, prophesying is more significant for believers in terms of edification and assurance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The tongues are for a sign: but there is no emphasis on the words... the meaning being much the same as if 'for a sign' were omitted."
2. "Tongues are (sign) for the unbelieving, not for the believing."
3. "The mistake has been occasioned by regarding those to whom the prophecy was directed, and interpreting Paul by Isaiah, instead of by himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Tongues" are not a sign mainly intended for believers, but mainly to be a condemnation to those who reject the sign and the accompanying message.
2. "Sign" is often used for a condemnatory sign.
3. Prophesying has no effect on unbelievers, but on those who are either in receptivity or in fact believers; it makes believers of those not wilfully unbelievers and spiritually nourishes those that already believe.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tongues are for a sign, an indication, an evidence, or a proof that God has imparted this power, and that he attends the preaching of the gospel with his approbation."
2. "It [prophesying] is not so striking, so replete with proofs of the divine presence and power as the gift of tongues."
3. "The 'truths' conveyed by it, and the consolations administered by it, might be as clear evidence to the church of the attending power, and presence, and goodness of God, as the power of speaking foreign languages might be to infidels."

### John Calvin:
1. "You see, brethren, that what you so eagerly desire is not a blessing bestowed by God upon believers, but a punishment, by which he inflicts vengeance upon unbelievers."
2. "Tongues, in so far as they are given for a sign â€” that is, for a miracle â€” are appointed not properly for believers, but for unbelievers."
3. "Hence, the Corinthians brought forward that gift improperly and out of its right place, allowing prophecy in the meantime to be neglected, which was peculiarly and specially set apart for believers, and ought, therefore, to be familiar to them, for in tongues they looked to nothing farther than the miracle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving who, on hearing their own language spoken by those who themselves understood it not, would be filled with awe."
2. "Prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  For a sign (ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ ÏƒÎ·Î¼ÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½). Like the Hebrew and occasional Koine idiom also. 


### John Gill:
1. "Wherefore tongues are for a sign,.... Of wrath and punishment inflicted on a rebellious and unbelieving people, and not of grace and kindness."
2. "But if these words refer to all that is said before on this subject, the word 'sign' may be taken for a miracle; and so a new argument is formed against an over fondness for divers tongues, and the use of them in public worship, showing the preferableness of prophecy to them."
3. "but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not; that is, not for them only; for prophesying or explaining the prophetic writings, or preaching the word, may be, and often is, the means of converting unbelievers."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tongues are intended for a sign to unbelievers - To engage their attention, and convince them the message is of God."
2. "Whereas prophecy is not so much for unbelievers, as for the confirmation of them that already believe."
