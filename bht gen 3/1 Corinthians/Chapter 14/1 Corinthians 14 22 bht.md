# 1 Corinthians 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of speaking in tongues is to serve as a sign, particularly for unbelievers who reject the message and accompanying sign. In contrast, prophecy is meant for believers, providing evidence of God's presence among them and nourishing their faith. While speaking in tongues is a miracle designed to convince unbelievers of the truth of the Christian religion, prophesying is more focused on edifying the church and confirming the faith of existing believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The tongues, in the then acceptation of the term, are for a sign: but there is no emphasis on the wordsâ€”the meaning being much the same as if 'for a sign' were omitted."
2. "Tongues are (sign) for the unbelieving, not for the believing."
3. "Prophecy, i. e, inspired and intelligent exposition of the word and doctrine, was eminently for believers, but, as below, would be also profitable to unbelievers, furnishing a token that God was truly among his assembled servants."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Tongues" (unknown and uninterpreted) are not a sign mainly intended for believers...but mainly to be a condemnation to those, the majority, who reject the sign and the accompanying message.
2. "Sign" is often used for a condemnatory sign.
3. Prophesying has no effect on them that are radically and obstinately unbelievers, but on them that are either in receptivity or in fact believers; it makes believers of those not wilfully unbelievers and spiritually nourishes those that already believe.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tongues are for a sign, an indication, an evidence or a proof that God has imparted this power."
2. "It is a miracle designed to convince them of the truth of the Christian religion."
3. "Prophesying...is intended mainly for the edifying of the church. It is...better adapted to edify the church than to convince gainsayers."

### John Calvin:
1. "You see, brethren, that what you so eagerly desire is not a blessing bestowed by God upon believers, but a punishment, by which he inflicts vengeance upon unbelievers."
2. "Tongues, in so far as they are given for a sign â€” that is, for a miracle â€” are appointed not properly for believers, but for unbelievers."
3. "Hence, the Corinthians brought forward that gift improperly and out of its right place, allowing prophecy in the meantime to be neglected, which was peculiarly and specially set apart for believers, and ought, therefore, to be familiar to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving who, on hearing their own language spoken by those who themselves understood it not, would be filled with awe." 
2. "Prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  For a sign (ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ ÏƒÎ·Î¼ÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½). Like the Hebrew and occasional Koine idiom also. 


### John Gill:
1. "Wherefore tongues are for a sign,.... Of wrath and punishment inflicted on a rebellious and unbelieving people, and not of grace and kindness"
2. "Speaking with divers tongues was used in a miraculous way, not to them that believe; who have no need of miracles to raise their attention to what is said, and that it may gain credit with them, or to confirm their faith in it"
3. "Prophesying serveth not for them that believe not; that is, not for them only...but is profitable to, and serves for them which believe: it is for their edification, exhortation, and comfort"

### John Wesley:
1. "Tongues are intended for a sign to unbelievers - To engage their attention, and convince them the message is of God."
2. "Prophecy is not so much for unbelievers, as for the confirmation of them that already believe."
