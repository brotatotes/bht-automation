# 1 Corinthians 14:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If there is no interpreter, the one who speaks in tongues should be silent in the church and speak privately to himself and to God. Without an interpreter, using the gift would be useless in the congregation. However, he can still make use of it to his own edification and the glory of God by speaking with a low voice or in his heart, even if it is not brought into the public congregation.
