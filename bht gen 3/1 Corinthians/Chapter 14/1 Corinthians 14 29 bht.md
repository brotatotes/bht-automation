### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In 1 Corinthians 14:29, Paul addresses the exercise of spiritual gifts, specifically the gift of prophecy. He encourages the prophets to speak, but not all at once, as the purpose is not to limit the edification of the Church. Rather, he suggests that two or three prophets speak at a time, while the others carefully discern the spirit behind the words being spoken. This discernment is vital because it ensures that what is being said is truly inspired by the Spirit of God. By allowing this judgment, Paul affirms the importance of testing every spirit and verifying the authenticity of the prophetic messages being shared.
