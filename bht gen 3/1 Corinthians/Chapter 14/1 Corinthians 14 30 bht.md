# 1 Corinthians 14:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to prophesying, the first person should be silent and make room for the second, without causing any disorder. If an important truth is revealed to someone else while another is speaking, the first one should hold their peace and allow the second person to speak. This was the practice in early churches, where the congregation would sit and the prophet or preacher would stand. Sometimes, revelations were given in a sudden and extraordinary manner for the benefit of the whole community.
