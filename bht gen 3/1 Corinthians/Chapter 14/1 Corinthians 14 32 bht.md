# 1 Corinthians 14:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The spirits of the prophets, their own spirits filled with the Holy Spirit, are subject to prophets. They have the ability to control their inclination to speak and are not under a necessity to do so, even when they are inspired. The gift of prophecy does not destroy their conscious powers of free agency or their individuality; instead, it enables them to regulate and exercise their gift according to their own judgment while maintaining self-control. The prophets' expressions, thoughts, and style remain intact as they submit their gifts to examination and promote truth and edification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "spirits of prophets (i. e. their own spirits, filled with the Holy Spirit: not the Spirit of God within each: and so in ver. 12: the inspired spirit being regarded as a spirit in a peculiar sense‚Äîfrom God, or otherwise. See the distinction plainly made 1 John iv. 2: 'In this ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit,'&c.) are subject to prophets"
2. "The gift that is in thee, and the working of the spirit which is in thee, is subjected to the gift of the other, who is moved to prophesy"
3. "But the command 'let the first keep silence,' would be superfluous, if his gift was in subjection to another"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye can (if ye will) prophesy one by one."
2. "And the spirits of the prophets, that is, their own spirits, acted on by the Holy Spirit, are not so hurried away by His influence, as to cease to be under their own control."
3. "They can if they will hear others, and not demand that they alone should be heard uttering communications from God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The evident meaning of this is, that they were able to control their inclination to speak; they were not under a necessity of speaking, even though they might be inspired. There was no need of disorder."
2. "The Scripture account of inspiration is, however, a very different thing. In whatever way the mind was influenced, or whatever was the mode in which the truth was conveyed, yet it was not such as to destroy the conscious powers of free agency, nor such as to destroy the individuality of the inspired person, or to annihilate what was special in his mode of thinking, his style, or his customary manner of expression."
3. "The immediate reference of the passage is to those who are called 'prophets' in the New Testament: and the interpretation should be confined to them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In true prophecy, self - consciousness, and self - command are never lost."
2. "The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets."
3. "The divine authority of the prophetic word were somehow dependent on, or confirmed by, the fact that the prophets enjoyed visions."

### John Calvin:
1. "It means...that no one is exempted from the scrutiny of others, but that all must be listened to, with this understanding, that their doctrine is, nevertheless, to be subjected to examination."
2. "The Holy Spirit, I say, retains his majesty unimpaired, so as to judge all things, while he is judged by no one."
3. "The sum of all, therefore, is this ‚Äî that the gift is subjected to examination in such a way, that whatever is set forth, the Prophets consider as to it ‚Äî whether it has proceeded from the Spirit of God; for if it shall appear that the Spirit is the author of it, there is no room left for hesitation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets."
2. "The statement is thus in glorious contrast with demoniacal impulses, under no control of consciousness and rational will."
3. "The Divine gift of prophecy left the gifted in full possession of their own faculties, enabling them to regulate and exercise their gift according to their own judgment of propriety."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets (œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒ± œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑœâŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒ±ŒπœÇ œÖœÄŒøœÑŒ±œÉœÉŒµœÑŒ±). A principle that some had forgotten. 


### John Gill:
1. "The doctrines which the prophets deliver, the explanations they give of passages of Scriptures, the revelations they declare, are subject to the examination, judgment, and censure of other prophets."
2. "And indeed they are subject to the trial and judgment of the whole church, and therefore ought not to be stiff in their own sentiments, and obstinately persist in them, but cheerfully and readily submit them to be examined."
3. "They ought to submit and give way to [others]; and thereby truth may be made manifest and established, instruction, edification, and comfort promoted, and peace and order preserved."

### John Wesley:
1. "The impulses of the Holy Spirit, even in men really inspired, so suit themselves to their rational faculties, as not to divest them of the government of themselves, like the heathen priests under their diabolical possession."
2. "Evil spirits threw their prophets into such ungovernable ecstasies, as forced them to speak and act like madmen."
3. "But the Spirit of God left his prophets the clear use of their judgment, when, and how long, it was fit for them to speak, and never hurried them into any improprieties either as to the matter, manner, or time of their speaking."
