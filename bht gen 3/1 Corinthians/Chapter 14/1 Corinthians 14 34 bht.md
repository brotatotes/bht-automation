The reasoning behind this prohibition is that women exercising authority in teaching would disrupt the proper order of male leadership.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "(1 Timothy 2:11; 1 Timothy 2:12). For women to speak in public would be an act of independence, as if they were not subject to their husbands."
2. "For 'under obedience,' translate, 'in subjection' or 'submission,' as the Greek is translated."
3. "the law‚Äîa term applied to the whole Old Testament; here, Ephesians 5:24."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "It is probable that, on pretence of being inspired, the women had assumed the office of public teachers."
3. "No rule in the New Testament is more positive than this; and however plausible may be the reasons which may be urged for disregarding it, and for suffering women to take part in conducting public worship, yet the authority of the apostle Paul is positive, and his meaning cannot be mistaken."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul‚Äôs reasoning, however, is simple ‚Äî that authority to teach is not suitable to the station that a woman occupies, because, if she teaches, she presides over all the men, while it becomes her to be under subjection."
2. "It is the dictate of common sense, that female government is improper and unseemly."
3. "If the woman is under subjection, she is, consequently, prohibited from authority to teach in public."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law referring probably to Genesis 3:16..."
2. "...of which idea all subsequent passages of the same import are but repetitions and expansions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In church the women are not allowed to speak (ŒªŒ±ŒªŒµŒπŒΩ) nor even to ask questions."

3. "Certainly women are still in subjection (œÖœÄŒøœÑŒ±œÉœÉŒµœÉŒ∏œâœÉŒ±ŒΩ) to their husbands (or ought to be)."

### John Gill:
1. "For it is not permitted unto them to speak; that is, in public assemblies, in the church of God, they might not speak with tongues, nor prophesy, or preach, or teach the word."
2. "They might speak their experiences to the church, or give an account of the work of God upon their souls; they might speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs."
3. "The reason why women are not to speak in the church, or to preach and teach publicly, or be concerned in the ministerial function, is, because this is an act of power, and authority; of rule and government, and so contrary to that subjection which God in his law requires of women unto men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let your women be silent in the churches ‚Äî Unless they are under an extraordinary impulse of the Spirit."
2. "But to be in subjection ‚Äî To the man whose proper office it is to lead and instruct the congregation."
3. "Genesis 3:16."
