# 1 Corinthians 14:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Is your church the first and only church from which the gospel word came? Should you not conform to the customs and rules of older churches? Let there be no ambition, obstinacy, pride, or contempt for other churches, but rather a desire to edify. The word of God did not come out from you alone. Consider the practices of other churches and conform to them. Your church is not the only one with the word of God, gifts, and prophesying. Conform to the customs of all the churches.
