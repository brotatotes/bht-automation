# 1 Corinthians 14:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, as an apostle, boldly asserts his authority and claims inspiration for the regulations he is writing, stamping his seal of approval on them. He challenges those who consider themselves spiritually endowed or prophets to acknowledge that his instructions are the commandments of the Lord, demonstrating their true obedience to God. True religion is characterized by a sacred regard for the commands of the Lord, while false zeal disregards scriptural authority and disrupts the peace and order of the church. The discerning of spirits is crucial for those with spiritual gifts to affirm the validity of Paul's words.

2. "the things which I am writing, viz. â€˜these regulations which I am now making.â€™"

### Albert Barnes:

2. "True religion everywhere, and the most ardent and enthusiastic zeal that is prompted by true religion, will show their genuineness and purity by a sacred and constant regard for the commands of the Lord."

### John Calvin:

3. "Paul, however, merely says, that he enjoins nothing, but what is in accordance with the will of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "[1] If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual (spiritually gifted), let him (shew it by being ready to) acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandment [2] of the Lord for inspiration cannot disown inspiration."
2. "[1] This is not a new topic, as some deem it, but a sequel to the question of the verse before."

2. "Not merely one that has the Spirit of God, is regenerated and sanctified by him, in opposition to a natural and carnal man; or one that has a larger knowledge of spiritual things, in distinction from a babe in Christ; but one that is endued with spiritual gifts." 
3. "If he is a true prophet, and really a spiritual man, he will clearly see, and therefore ought to own, that the rules here prescribed...are perfectly agreeable to the commands of Christ, and are to be esteemed as such."

### John Wesley:
1. Or spiritual â€” Endowed with any extraordinary gift of the Spirit.
Let him â€” Prove it, by acknowledging that I now write by the Spirit.
