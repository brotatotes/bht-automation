## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He wished them all to speak with tongues, but rather that they should prophesy."
2. "The distinction between the wishing them all to speak with tongues, as the simple direct object of the wish, and his wishing that they should prophesy, as its higher and ulterior object."
3. "Superior in usefulness, and therefore in dignity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Tongues must therefore mean languages, not ecstatic, unintelligible rhapsodie"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I would rejoice if these extraordinary endowments were conferred on all."
2. "The power of speaking in an unknown tongue was certainly a more striking endowment than that of speaking so as simply to be 'useful,' and yet the apostle tells us that the latter is the more valuable."
3. "A man who is useful, however humble and unknown he may be, really occupies a more elevated and venerable rank than the man of most splendid talents and dazzling eloquence, who accomplishes nothing in saving the souls of people."

### John Calvin:
1. "For God has conferred nothing upon his Church in vain, and languages were of some benefit." 
2. "As it is certain, that the Holy Spirit has here honored the use of tongues with never-dying praise, we may very readily gather, what is the kind of spirit that actuates those reformers, who level as many reproaches as they can against the pursuit of them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy...because tongues require an interpreter, else they are a heap of unmeaning sounds, whereas by prophecy all may at once benefit." 
2. "Could anything make it clearer that 'speaking with tongues' meant speaking in articulate and actually spoken languages, unknown to the speaker save through an interpreter himself or another?"

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The apostle Paul encourages the Corinthians to prioritize prophesying over speaking in tongues. While he does express his desire for them all to speak in tongues, he also emphasizes that the purpose of this wish is to ultimately encourage prophesying, which is considered superior in usefulness and dignity. Speaking in tongues should be accompanied by interpretation for the edification of the church. The power to speak in tongues may be impressive, but being useful and beneficial to others is of greater value. Therefore, prophesying, which benefits all immediately, is preferred over tongues that require interpretation. Ultimately, the focus should be on edifying the church and using the gifts of the Spirit in a way that benefits everyone.
