Speaking in tongues without interpretation is futile, as it lacks profitability. Prophecy is based on revelation, the supernatural unveiling of divine truths, while teaching is rooted in knowledge, the ability to share understanding.

To truly edify, Paul must convey his message through revelation, imparting knowledge, prophesying, or teaching in a clear and comprehensible manner.

3. "Though Paul should utter among them, as he had abundant ability to do, the most weighty and important truths, yet, unless he interpreted what he said in a manner clear from obscurity, like 'revelation'; or intelligibly, and so as to constitute 'knowledge'; or in the manner that the prophets spoke, in a plain and intelligible manner; or in the manner usual in simple and plain 'instruction,' it would be useless to them."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Without interpretation, the act of speaking in tongues holds no profit. The foundation for prophecy lies in revelation, which refers to the supernatural unveiling of divine truths to humans. On the other hand, teaching is grounded in knowledge, which corresponds to the ability to pass on our understanding to others. In order for edification to occur, interpretation is necessary. Without it, the message is lost. So the question remains, what advantage is there if Paul were to speak in foreign languages that are not understood by the Corinthians? It would be of no use unless he provides clarity and understanding by revealing, imparting knowledge, prophesying, or teaching.
