# 1 Corinthians 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a pipe or harp does not give a distinction in tones, how will one know what tune is being played? Just as music has the power to influence emotions, speaking in an unknown tongue is like creating a confused and indistinguishable sound. It is clear that intelligibility is key, for speaking into the air is to beat the air to no purpose. Just as we understand the power of music, we must recognize the futility of speaking in an unknown tongue, which yields no understanding or pleasure to the hearer.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If they shall not have yielded a distinction (of musical intervals) in their tones, how shall be known that which is being played on the flute, or that which is being played on the harp?"
2. "The uncertain sound of the trumpet being exactly analogous to an unknown language, not to an inarticulate sound."
3. "But the fact is that all such inferences, from pressing analogies close, are insecure."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And things without life-giving sound, whether pipe or harp, YET (notwithstanding their giving sound) if they give not a distinction in the tones (that is, notes) how?" &amp;c.
2. Translate, "And things without life-giving sound, whether pipe or harp, YET (notwithstanding their giving sound) if they give not a distinction in the tones (that is, notes) how?" &amp;c. 
3. what is piped or harpedâ€”that is, what tune is played on the pipe or harp.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Unless they give a distinction in the sounds - Unless they give a difference in the â€˜tones,â€™ such as are indicated in the gamut for music."
2. "How shall it be known ... - That is, there would be no time, no music. Nothing would be indicated by it. It would not be suited to excite the emotions of sorrow or of joy."
3. "Unless there was something that was suited to excite thought or emotion; unless what was spoken was made â€˜intelligible,â€™ no matter how important in itself it might be, yet it would be useless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sound generally. Used sometimes of sounds emitted by things without life, as a trumpet or the wind." 
2. "Harp."
3. "Proper modulation. Compare the use of the word in Romans 3:22; Romans 10:12."

### John Calvin:
1. "A man cannot give life to a harp or flute, but he makes it give forth a sound that is regulated in such a manner, that it can be distinguished. How absurd then it is, that even men, endowed with intelligence, should utter a confused, indistinguishable sound!"
2. "To speak into the air is to beat the air to no purpose. 'Thy voice will not reach either God or man, but will vanish into air.'"
3. "We all know by experience what power music has in exciting menâ€™s feelings, so that Plato affirms, and not without good reason, that music has very much effect in influencing, in one way or another, the manners of a state."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp... if they give not a distinction in the sounds or â€˜notes,â€™ such as to denote some musical ideas..." 
2. "What are the ideas intended."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Things without life (Î±ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Î±). Without a soul (Î± privative, ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Î·) or life."
2. "Pipe (Î±Ï…Î»Î¿Ï‚). Old word (from Î±Ï‰, Î±Ï…Ï‰, to blow), only here in N.T."
3. "If they give not a distinction in the sounds (ÎµÎ±Î½ Î´Î¹Î±ÏƒÏ„Î¿Î»Î·Î½ Ï„Î¿Î¹Ï‚ Ï†Î¸Î¿Î³Î³Î¿Î¹Ï‚ Î¼Î· Î´Ï‰)."

### John Gill:
1. "Even things without life giving sound...whether pipe or harp...except they give a distinction in the sounds...how shall it be known what is piped or harped?" 
2. "Such an use of instruments would be a mere jargon, and not music, and so yield no pleasure to the ear, or mind." 
3. "Just the like must speaking in an unknown tongue be, to one who understands it not."

### John Wesley:
1. How shall it be known what is piped or harped â€” What music can be made, or what end answered?

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: If a flute or harp does not produce distinct musical tones, how can one discern the melody being played? The uncertain sound of a trumpet is similar to speaking in an unknown language, for it lacks intelligibility. It is clear that things without life, like a pipe or harp, must give a discernible distinction in the sounds or notes they produce. Similarly, when one speaks in an unknown tongue, it is like creating a confused and indistinguishable sound. Just as music has the power to influence and evoke emotions, speaking in an unknown tongue is futile, as it yields no understanding or pleasure to the listener.
