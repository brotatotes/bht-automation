# 1 Corinthians 14:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Speaking in tongues should involve clear and intelligible words, ensuring that the message is not lost in confusion. If the language used is not understandable to others, it becomes like speaking into thin air, akin to beating the air or talking to the wind. It is crucial to employ words that are easy to comprehend, enabling effective communication and avoiding the futility of speaking without making an impact.
