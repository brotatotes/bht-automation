# 1 Corinthians 15:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I am constrained to declare the whole gospel which I preached to you in reproach, as if it is necessary to make it known to them afresh. Now I make known unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, by which also ye are saved - on what footing I placed it, namely, on the fact of Christ's resurrection. If the resurrection is taken away, they have no religion left, no assurance of faith, and in short, have no faith remaining.
