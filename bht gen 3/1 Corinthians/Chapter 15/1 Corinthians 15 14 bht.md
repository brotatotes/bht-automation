# 1 Corinthians 15:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without the resurrection of Christ, our faith is empty and without result. The principal argument of the first preachers was that God had raised Christ from the dead, and if this fact were false, the faith built on it must be false too. If Christ has not been raised, our preaching and their faith have nothing to stand on. The entire gospel rests on the death and resurrection of Christ, and without it, our preaching and the doctrine of faith would be vain and without any foundation.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Without the resurrection of Christ, our faith would be in vain and empty. The emphasis on the word vain reflects the emptiness and futility of a faith without the reality of Christ's resurrection. The entire gospel rests upon this fundamental truth, and if it is subverted, everything else becomes insignificant. Without Christ's victory over death, our preaching and the doctrine of faith would be empty and without any foundation. It is through the resurrection that Christ abolished death and brought life and immortality to light, making our faith and preaching meaningful and powerful.
