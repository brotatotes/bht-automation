# 1 Corinthians 15:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the resurrection is denied, the witnesses of God are exposed as false, bringing dishonor to God Himself. By testifying that God raised Christ from the dead, they would be guilty of bearing false witness if Christ did not truly rise. This would not only be a scandalous and odious character flaw but also make God Himself a participant in falsehood. Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge the reality of the resurrection, else we undermine the credibility of those who testified on behalf of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  15.] false witnesses of (i. e. with regard to) God, not ‘of God, as belonging to God,’ as some: and false witnesses, as bearing false testimony (see below), not, as pretending to be witnesses, and not being.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The rendering of others is, 'against God':... the Greek preposition with the genitive implies, not direct antagonism (as the accusative would mean), but indirect to the dishonor of God." 
2. "If so be—as they assert."
3. "It is not right to tell untrue stories, though they are told and seem for the glory of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It will follow, if the Lord Jesus was not raised up, that we have been false witnesses."
2. "Nothing could be regarded as a greater crime than this, whatever might be the immediate subject under consideration."
3. "This would be so: If the dead rise not - If there is, and can be no resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "Yet this also was no trivial absurdity — that the Apostles, who were ordained by God to be the heralds of his eternal truth, were detected as persons who had deceived the world with falsehoods; for this tends to God’s highest dishonor."
2. "If the resurrection of Christ is denied, God is made guilty of falsehood in the witnesses that have been brought forward and hired by him."
3. "He declares that God will be exposed to the charge of falsehood, inasmuch as what they publish has come forth from him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "False witnesses of God (ψευδομαρτυρες του θεου). Late word, but ψευδομαρτυρεω, to bear false witness, old and common."
2. "Because we witnessed of God (οτ εμαρτυρησαμεν κατα του θεου). Vulgate has adversus Deum."
3. "This is the more natural way to take κατα and genitive, against God not as equal to περ (concerning). He would indeed make God play false in that case."

### John Gill:
1. "Now if Christ is not risen, they have bore a false testimony; and what greater scandal, or a more odious character can be fixed upon a man, than to be a false witness?" 
2. "And yet this must follow, upon a denial of the resurrection of Christ: because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ, whom he raised not up, if so be the dead rise not."
3. "To say that he raised Christ from the dead, when he is not risen; which must be the case, if there is no resurrection of the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. If the dead rise not — If the very notion of a resurrection be, as they say, absurd and impossible.
