# 1 Corinthians 15:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If our hope in Christ is limited to this life alone, we would be more miserable than anyone else. Our intense hope exposes us to danger and death, denying ourselves the pleasures of the world. All our hope of salvation depends on the resurrection of Christ. Disappointment in this hope would be the height of misery. The Epicureans would have an argument against us. However, if our hope extends beyond this life and we have an assurance of the unseen, then despite our present trials, we are happier than all others.

2. "The word used here (ŒµÃìŒªŒ∑ŒπŒΩŒøÃÅœÑŒµœÅŒøŒπ eleÃÑinoteroi) means, properly, more deserving of pity, more pitiable."

### John Calvin:
1. "To believe in this life means here to limit the fruit of our faith to this life, so that our faith looks no farther, and does not extend beyond the confines of the present life."
2. "There are two reasons why Christians have in all ages fared worse, in addition to which, there was one that was peculiar to the times of Paul. The first is, that while the Lord frequently chastises the wicked, too, with his lashes, and begins to inflict his judgments upon them, he at the same time peculiarly afflicts his own in various ways."
3. "Believers, even though they should abound in riches and in blessings of every kind, they nevertheless do not go to excess, and do not gormandize at their ease; in fine, they do not enjoy the world, as unbelievers do, but go forward with anxiety, constantly groaning, partly from a consciousness of their weakness, and partly from an eager longing for the future life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable building our hope of a future resurrection on a mere delusion." 
2. "To die at length as a fool dieth."
3. "Building our hope of a future resurrection on a mere delusion."

2. "The Epicureans have the argument on us."
3. "Paul makes morality turn on the hope of immortality."

### John Gill:
1. "The object of a believer's hope is not any creature, man, or angel; nor any creature enjoyment... but Christ alone as a surety, Saviour, and Redeemer." 
2. "If our hope in him is bounded with this life... we are of all men the most miserable." 
3. "For these [believers] not only deny themselves the pleasures, honours, and profits of this world, but are exposed continually to the hatred, reproach, and persecution of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "If in this life only we have hope ‚Äî If we look for nothing beyond the grave."
2. "But if we have a divine evidence of things not seen, if we have 'a hope full of immortality,' if we now taste of 'the powers of the world to come,' and see 'the crown that fadeth not away.'"
3. "Then, notwithstanding 'all our present trials, we are more happy than all men."
