# 1 Corinthians 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians were urged to hold fast to the gospel message they had received, for it was not just a matter of belief, but held the power to save them. Their salvation depended on faithfully retaining and remembering the teachings they had received, even in the face of opposition or doubt. If they were to let go of this truth, their faith would be in vain and their profession empty. They needed to understand that true salvation required a steadfast belief in Christ's resurrection and a commitment to the gospel's message.

### Henry Alford:
1. "which ye also received, in which moreover ye stand, by means of which ye are even being saved (in the course of salvation)." 
2. "The only chance if you hold fast what I have taught you, of your missing salvation, is the hardly supposable one, that your faith is vain, and the gospel a fable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By which also ye are saved...It does not mean simply that by this they were brought into a salvable state...but it means that their hopes of eternal life rested on this; and by this they were then 'in fact' saved from the condemnation of sin, and were in the possession of the hope of eternal life."
2. "If ye keep in memory...the idea is, that they were saved by this, or would be, if they faithfully retained or held the doctrine as he delivered it; if they observed it, and still believed it, notwithstanding all the efforts of their enemies, and all the arts of false teaching to wrest it from them."
3. "Unless ye have believed in vain...Unless all your trials, discouragements, and hopes were to no purpose, and all have been the result of imposture; and unless all your profession is false and hollow, you will be saved by this great doctrine which I first preached to you."
