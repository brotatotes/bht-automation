# 1 Corinthians 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's resurrection serves as the firstling or earnest of the future resurrection of believers. By rising from the dead, Christ affirms that our faith and hope are not in vain. His resurrection on the day after the Passover Sabbath, like the offering of the firstfruits, symbolizes his role as the First-fruits of his sleeping people, assuring our own resurrection in him. This connection to the Levitical ordinances of the firstfruits illustrates the promise of a future harvest and the sanctification of death through Christ's resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ, in rising from the dead, is but the firstling or earnest of the resurrection of the whole number of those that sleep."
2. "There does not appear to be any intended reference to the legal ordinance of the firstfruits (Lev. xxiii. 10, 11): but however general the application of the analogy may be, it can hardly fail to have been suggested to the mind of a Jew by the Levitical ordinances."
3. "It is the Christian dead who are before the Apostle‚Äôs mind."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Now‚Äîas the case really is."
2. "The first-fruits‚Äîthe earnest or pledge, that the whole resurrection harvest will follow, so that our faith is not vain, nor our hope limited to this life."
3. "The time of writing this Epistle was probably about the Passover; the day after the Passover sabbath was that for offering the first-fruits, and the same was the day of Christ's resurrection: whence appears the appropriateness of the image."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That was a point on which he was certain. He had seen him after he was risen; and he could no more doubt this 'fact' than he could any other which he had witnessed with his own eyes." 
2. "He was connected with all that should rise, as the first sheaf of the harvest was with the crop; he was a 'part' of the mighty harvest of the resurrection, and his rising was a 'portion' of that great rising." 
3. "May it not be implied that, by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, all those of whom he speaks are regarded as sacred to God, and as consecrated and accepted by the resurrection and acceptance of him who was the first-fruits?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The first - fruits [Œ±œÄŒ±œÅœáŒ∑] . See on James 1:18. Omit become. 
Compare Colossians 1:18, and see on Revelation 1:5.


### John Calvin:
1. "For as in the first-fruits the produce of the entire year was consecrated, so the power of Christ's resurrection is extended to all of us." 
2. "The rest of the dead will follow him, as the entire harvest does the first-fruits."
3. "Christ is the first-fruits of all who shall be raised from the dead to die no more."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As if impatient at having to linger over such wretched speculations, with what a bound does the apostle here spring on the firm ground and into the clear air of an indubitable resurrection in the Person of Christ."
2. "The allusion here is as obvious as it is beautiful. On the morrow after the first Sabbath of the Passover, a sheaf of the first-fruits of the barley harvest was reaped and 'waved before the Lord,' as a joyful pledge of the full harvest to come."
3. "Even so, on the morrow after the first Sabbath of that Passover when our Lord was crucified being the first day of the week did He rise 'the First-fruits of His sleeping people.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But now (ŒΩœÖŒΩ Œ¥Œµ). Emphatic form of ŒΩœÖŒΩ with - added (cf. 1 Corinthians 12:18). It is the logical triumph of Paul after the reductio ad impossibile (Findlay) of the preceding argument."
2. "The first-fruits (Œ±œÄŒ±œÅœáŒ∑). Old word from Œ±œÄŒ±œÅœáŒøŒºŒ±, to offer firstlings or first-fruits. In LXX for first-fruits. In papyri for legacy-duty, entrance-fee, and also first-fruits as here. See also verse 1 Corinthians 15:23; 1 Corinthians 16:15; Romans 8:23, etc. Christ is 'first-born from the dead' (Colossians 1:18). Others raised from the dead died again, but not so Jesus."
3. "That sleep (œÑœâŒΩ Œ∫ŒµŒ∫ŒøŒπŒºŒ∑ŒºŒµŒΩœâŒΩ). Perfect middle participle as in Matthew 27:52 which see. Beautiful picture of death from which word (Œ∫ŒøŒπŒºŒ±ŒøŒºŒ±) comes our word 'cemetery'."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ first rose from the dead, and ascended to heaven, and presented himself to God; as the representative of his people."
2. "Christ is the first, and rose the first in dignity, as well as in time; he rose as the head of the body, as the firstborn, the beginning, that in all things he might have, and appear to have, as he ought to have, the pre-eminence."
3. "Christ by lying in the grave, and rising out of it, sanctified it for his people, and in his resurrection represented them; they rose with him, and in him; and their resurrection is secured by his; because he lives, they shall live also."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christians 'have hope,' not 'in this life only.'" 
2. "The proof is short, but solid and convincing, that which arose from Christ's resurrection."
3. "The first fruit of them that slept ‚Äî The earnest, pledge, and insurance of their resurrection who slept in him."
