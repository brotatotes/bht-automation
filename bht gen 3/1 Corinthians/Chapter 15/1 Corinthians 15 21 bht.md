By man, both death and life take hold. Christ, the firstfruits of those who sleep, brings life to humanity in the same way that Adam brought death. The fundamental truth of this declaration is that only a human can usher in effects that permeate the entire human race. Adam, the bringer of death, belonged to the same nature as those upon whom he brought it.
