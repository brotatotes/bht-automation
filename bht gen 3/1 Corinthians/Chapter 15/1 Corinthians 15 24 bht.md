# 1 Corinthians 15:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of Christ has one great end - the glorification of the Father by the Son. His reign will endure until he has put all enemies under his feet and then he will lay his name at the feet of the Father, completing the obedience which he manifested in his death. His giving up of the mediatorial kingdom to the Father, when the end for which it was established has been accomplished, is in harmony with its continuing everlastingly. The end will bring about the consummation of the age and the restoration of all power to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "THE KINGDOM oF CHRIST over this world, in its beginning, its furtherance, and its completion, has one great end,‚ÄîTHE GLORIFICATION OF THE FATHER BY THE SON."
2. "Hence, as in ver. 25, His reign will endure, not like that of earthly kings, WHEN HE shall have put all enemies under His feet, but only TILL He shall have, &c.‚Äîand then will be absorbed in the all-pervading majesty of Him for whose glory it was from first to last carried onward."
3. "The name will no sooner be won, than laid at the feet of the Father, thus completing by the last great act of Redemption the obedience which he manifested in his Incarnation, and in His death."

3. "The unity of the Godhead, and the unity of the Church, shall be simultaneously manifested at Christ's second coming."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Then cometh the end - Then is the end; or then 'is' the consummation. It does not mean that the end, or consummation is to 'follow' that event; but that this 'will' be the ending, the winding up, the consummation of the affairs under the mediatorial reign of Christ."
2. "As the work had been accomplished which had been contemplated in his design; as there would be no further necessity for mediation when redemption should have been made, and his church recovered from sin and brought to glory; there would be no further need of that special arrangement which had been implied in the work of redemption, and, of course, all the entrustment of power involved in that would be again restored to the hands of God."
3. "The Mediator shall have given up the special power and rule as Mediator, and it shall be exercised by God as God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Then, therefore, shall come the end ‚Äî that is, the goal of our course ‚Äî a quiet harbour ‚Äî a condition that will no longer be exposed to changes..."
2. "Hence as the world will have an end, so also will government, and magistracy, and laws, and distinctions of ranks, and different orders of dignities, and everything of that nature."
3. "The angels, it is true, will continue to exist, and they will also retain their distinction. The righteous, too, will shine forth, every one according to the measure of his grace; but the angels will have to resign the dominion, which they now exercise in the name and by the commandment of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then cometh the end... when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God."

3. "All forms of power opposing the will of God. Constative aorist tense covering the whole period of conflict with final victory as climax."

### John Gill:
1. "Then cometh the end...the end of the righteous will be peace and everlasting joy, and an uninterrupted communion with Christ, and enjoyment of life eternal...or at the beginning of the thousand years; immediately upon Christ's second and personal coming, will be the end of the world...the earth and all its works be burnt up; though these shall not be annihilated or destroyed, as to their being and substance, but only as to their present form and qualities; they shall be renewed, out of them shall arise new heavens, and a new earth..."
2. "the mediatorial kingdom is here meant, the kingdom of saints, over which Christ is appointed and set as King; even the whole church and general assembly of the firstborn, written in heaven...and now having completed the number of them, in whose hearts he has reigned by his Spirit and grace, he will deliver them up to the Father from whom he received them; even everyone of them; all the children he gave unto him."
3. "when the end comes, and the kingdom is delivered to the Father: nor will there be any more domestic, or family rule and government, as of the husband over the wife, the parent over the child...all will be upon an equal foot: nor any angelical authority and power...especially all diabolical rule, authority, and power will be abolished..."

### John Wesley:
1. "When he shall have delivered up the kingdom to the Father, and he (the Father) shall have abolished all adverse rule, authority, and power - Not that the Father will then begin to reign without the Son, nor will the Son then cease to reign."
2. "But this is spoken of the Son's mediatorial kingdom, which will then be delivered up, and of the immediate kingdom or reign of the Father, which will then commence."
3. "Nor does the Father cease to reign, when he gives it to the Son; neither the Son, when he delivers it to the Father: but the glory which he had before the world began will remain even after this is delivered up."
