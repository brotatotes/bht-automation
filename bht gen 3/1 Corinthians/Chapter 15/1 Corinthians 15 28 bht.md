# 1 Corinthians 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son's voluntary subordination to the Father is clearly proclaimed here, as the Son Himself will be subject. In the mediatorial kingdom, the Son existed separately from the Father, but in the new creation, their kingdoms will merge, and God alone will be recognized as the sole Lord. This ultimate goal of God's redemptive plans is for God to be all in all. Even the saints will fully realize God's all-sufficiency, experiencing Him as their everything in a personal and immediate way.

3. "He surrenders, therefore, the seals of office; and as He was 'exalted to be a Prince and Saviour' for all saving purposes, He will, when these ends have been fully achieved, 'be subjected unto Him that did subject all things unto Him,' and, as the grand result, GOD, in the most absolute sense Father, Son, and Holy Ghost will be all in the entire new creation."
