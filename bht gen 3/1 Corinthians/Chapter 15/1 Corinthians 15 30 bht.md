# 1 Corinthians 15:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The practice of constantly risking our lives, and standing in jeopardy every hour, as the preachers do, would be absurd and foolish if there is no resurrection. We voluntarily encounter death because we have hope for a better life beyond this world. This magnanimity of soul, in despising death, would be ascribed to rashness rather than firmness if the saints perished at death, for it is nonsensical to act such a part if there is no resurrection.
