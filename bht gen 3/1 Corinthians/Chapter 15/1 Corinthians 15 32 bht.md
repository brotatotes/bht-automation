### John Gill:
1. "if after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus" - There were two sorts of usages among the Romans in their theatres; sometimes they cast men naked to the wild beasts, to be devoured by them, as wicked servants, deadly enemies, and the vilest of men; and sometimes they put men armed into the theatre to fight with beasts, and if they could conquer them and save themselves it was well, if not, they fell a prey to them.
2. "what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?" - Instead of its being a glorious action, it was a foolhardy one; and if he had died in it, what profit could he have had by it, if he rose not again; or if there is no resurrection of the dead? 
3. "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die" - Instead of incurring such dangers, and running such risks, it would be more eligible to sit down and say with the Epicureans, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.

### John Wesley:
1. "If to speak after the manner of men - That is, to use a proverbial phrase, expressive of the most imminent danger" 
2. "I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus - With the savage fury of a lawless multitude"
3. "Let as eat, ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî We might, on that supposition, as well say, with the Epicureans, Let us make the best of this short life, seeing we have no other portion"
