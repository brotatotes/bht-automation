# 1 Corinthians 15:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in His sovereign will, can give each seed its own body and specific development, reflecting the form that is distinct to its species. He will provide the blessed with suitable resurrection bodies at the time of resurrection, designed according to His pleasure and their glorified state. This is similar to how God established different types of grain at creation, ensuring that each maintains its distinctive identity. Just as the vegetable world exhibits remarkable variety, so God can bestow upon the resurrected a body peculiar to the individual yet consistent with its nature.

### John Gill:
1. "It is not the husbandman, nor the sun, nor the rain, that give the grain of wheat, or any other, its verdure and beauty, the form in which it springs up, its stalk, blade, and ear, but God by his own power, and of his sovereign will and pleasure."
2. "The resurrection of the dead is God's work; it is an instance of his power, and of his sovereign will; and is to his people a branch of that eternal life, which is his pure gift through Jesus Christ."
3. "If it is not a resurrection of the same body, but new ones are created, to which the soul will be united, it will not be a resurrection, but a transmigration of souls into other bodies; but as every seed has its own body, so will every soul have its own body, though greatly different as to its qualities, and much improved for the better."

### John Wesley:
1. "But God ‚Äî Not thou, O man, not the grain itself, giveth it a body as it hath pleased him..." 
2. "...to each of the seeds, not only of the fruits, but animals also, its own body..." 
3. "...proper to that individual, and arising out of the substance of that very grain."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: God, in His sovereign will, has the power to give each seed a specific development and a body suitable to its species. He can and will give the blessed at the resurrection their own unique body, crafted according to His pleasure and their glorified state. Just as God determined the different types of grain at creation, so each seed permanently assumes a form according to its own distinctive type, always remaining true to itself. This concept is exemplified by the variety seen in the vegetable world, where the Creator demonstrates inexhaustible resources. Therefore, it should not be deemed necessary for the same body to rise as was sown; God is capable of creating a resurrection-body for each individual, substantially the same as the body sown, but suited to its own species.
