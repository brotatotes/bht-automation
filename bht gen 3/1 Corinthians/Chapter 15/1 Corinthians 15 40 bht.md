## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The bodies of angels, the only heavenly organisms of which we are aware, which will bear comparison with bodies on earth."
3. "Œ¥œåŒæŒ± belongs to the ·ºêœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ¨ŒΩŒπŒ± more strictly than to the ·ºêœÄŒØŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ±."

2. "Can it be deemed strange if there should be a difference between our bodies when on earth and when in heaven? Do we not, in fact, see a vast difference between what strikes our eye here on earth and in the sky?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sense is, the heavenly bodies, described more specifically in ver. 41."

### Philip Schaff:
