# 1 Corinthians 15:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our current bodies are weak, subject to disease and decay, and as repulsive as a decomposing corpse. However, in the resurrection, our bodies will be raised in glory, honored by God, and filled with the eternal energy and vigor of a spiritual body. Death cannot conquer this new body, for it will be transformed into a glorious form that reflects the splendor and beauty of God. It will be free from weakness and infirmity, and clothed in robes of light that signify its power and strength.
