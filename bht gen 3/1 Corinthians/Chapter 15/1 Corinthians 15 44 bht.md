## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A spiritual body is one rich with the working of the Holy Spirit, and administered in all things by Him."
2. "But then the Spirit shall for ever abide in the body of the just."
3. "It is no more wonderful a thing, that there should be a body fitted to the capacities and wants of man‚Äôs highest part, his spirit, than that there should be one fitted to the capacities and wants of his subordinate animal soul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A natural body‚Äîliterally, 'an animal body,' a body moulded in its organism of 'flesh and blood' to suit the animal soul which predominates in it." 
2. "The Holy Spirit in the spirit of believers, indeed, is an earnest of a superior state, but meanwhile in the body the animal soul preponderates."
3. "A spiritual body‚Äîa body wholly moulded by the Spirit, and its organism not conformed to the lower and animal, but to the higher and spiritual life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle here, by affirming that the body will be spiritual, intends to deny that it will need that which is now necessary to the support of the animal functions; it will not be sustained in that way; it will lay aside these special animal organizations, and will cease to convey the idea which we now attach to the word animal, or to possess that which we now include under the name of vital functions."
2. "It is raised a spiritual body - Not a mere spirit, for then it would not be a body. The word spiritual (œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒøÃÅŒΩ pneumatikon) here stands opposed to the word natural, or animal. it will not be a body that is subject to the laws of the vital functions, or organized or sustained in that way."
3. "It will be a body without the vital functions of the animal economy; a body sustained in the manner in which we conceive the spirit to be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression natural body signifies an organism animated by a yuch soul...which characterizes the man as a mortal creature; while pneuma spirit is that phase which looks Godward, and characterizes him as related to God." 
2. "A body in which a divine pneuma spirit supersedes the yuch soul, so that the resurrection - body is the fitting organ for its indwelling and work, and so is properly characterized as a spiritual body." 
3. "The existence of the one forms a logical presumption for the existence of the other."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us, however, always bear in mind, what we have seen previously ‚Äî that the substance of the body is the same, and that it is the quality only that is here treated of." 
2. "For as to the soul‚Äôs now quickening the body, that is effected through the intervention of many helps; for we stand in need of drink, food, clothing, sleep, and other things of a similar nature. Hence the weakness of animation is clearly manifested."
3. "The energy of the Spirit, on the other hand, for quickening, will be much more complete, and, consequently, exempted from necessities of that nature."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "it is sown a natural body... it is raised a spiritual body... a body all whose organs and properties will be adapted to the inner and higher nature"
2. "If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body"
3. "the one no less certain than the other and simply an advance from the lower to the higher"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The resurrection body is not wholly œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±. Caution is needed here in filling out details concerning the œàœÖœáŒ∑ and the œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±."
2. "Certainly he means to say that the 'spiritual body' has some kind of germinal connection with the 'natural body,' though the development is glorious beyond our comprehension though not beyond the power of Christ to perform."
3. "The force of the argument remains unimpaired though we cannot follow fully into the thought beyond us."

### John Gill:
1. "It is raised a spiritual body; not as to substance, but as to its quality; it will not be changed into a spirit; our Lord's risen body, to which ours will be conformed, was not a spirit, but, as before, consisted of flesh and bones."
2. "The body will then be subject to the spirit and soul of man; it will be employed in spiritual service, for which it will be abundantly fitted and assisted by the Spirit of God; and it will be delighted with spiritual objects; it will be like the angels, those excellent spirits; it will live as spirits do, without natural helps and means, as meat, drink, clothes, sleep, and, as they, will never die."
3. "There is a natural; or 'animal body', such as the first man's was, and those are that descend from him by ordinary generation; and there is a spiritual body; such as the body of Christ now is, and as will be the bodies of the risen saints."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is sown in this world a merely animal body - Maintained by food, sleep, and air, like the bodies of brutes."
2. "It is raised of a more refined contexture, needing none of these animal refreshments."
3. "Endued with qualities of a spiritual nature, like the angels of God."
