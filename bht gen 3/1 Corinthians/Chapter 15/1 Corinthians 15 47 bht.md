## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Since the body of Adam is thus characterized as a psychical (animal) body, as ver. 45, and animal organism involves mortality (ver. 44), it is clear that Paul treats of Adam not as created exempt from death." 
2. "For had our first parents not sinned, they would have remained in Paradise, and would, by the use of the Tree of Life, which God had not forbidden them, have become immortal." 
3. "But they were driven out of Paradise, ere yet they had tasted of this tree, and so, according to the record in Genesis also, Death came into the world by sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "being sprung from the earth, he is 'earthy'"
2. "Humanity in Christ is generic. In Him man is impersonated in his true ideal as God originally designed him."
3. "Christ is the representative man, the federal head of redeemed man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Is of the earth - Was made of the dust; see Genesis 2:7."
2. "Of course, he must partake of a nature that was low, mean, mortal, and corruptible."
3. "And while, therefore, the phrase 'from heaven' refers to his heavenly origin, the essential idea is, that he would have a body that was adapted to such an origin and such a world - a body unlike that which was earthy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "no predicate in this second clause corresponds to the earthy of the first half of the verse, because the material of the glorified body of Christ transcends alike conception and expression."
2. "The phrase includes both the divine origin and the heavenly nature."
3. "its reference, determined by the line of the whole argument, is to the glorified body of Christ - the Lord who shall descend from heaven in His glorified body."

### John Calvin:
1. "The earthy man is first... The spiritual life will come afterwards, as Christ, the heavenly man, came after Adam."
2. "Christ, on the other hand, brought us from heaven a life-giving Spirit, that he might regenerate us into a better life, and elevated above the earth."
3. "We have it from Adam ‚Äî that we live in this world, as branches from the root: Christ, on the other hand, is the beginning and author of the heavenly life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first man is of the earth. The word signifies 'rubbish,' 'loose earth,' 'dust'... the second man is of heaven." 
2. "The reference here is not to the properties of Christ's flesh, as received from the Virgin, but to the properties of His resurrection or spiritual body."
3. "The Lord, in the received text of this verse, is plainly an addition to the true text."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Earthly (œáŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ). Late rare word, from œáŒøœÖœÇ, dust."
2. "The second man from heaven (Œø Œ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ ŒµŒæ ŒøœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖ)."
3. "Paul saw Jesus after his resurrection and he appeared to him 'from heaven.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Adam was certainly made out of the earth, and had his habitation and abode assigned him in the garden of Eden, and was made to cultivate and till it."
2. "As Adam was the first man, Christ is the second man; and these two are spoken of, as if they were the only two men in the world."
3. "Christ is Lord of all, not only Lord of lords below, but Lord of angels and saints above; the whole family in heaven and in earth is named of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "The first man, being from the earth, is subject to corruption and dissolution, like the earth from which he came."
2. "The Lord does not owe his glory to heaven. He himself made the heavens, and by descending from thence showed himself to us as the Lord."
3. "As Adam was the first general representative of men, Christ was the second and the last. And what they severally did, terminated not in themselves, but affected all whom they represented."
