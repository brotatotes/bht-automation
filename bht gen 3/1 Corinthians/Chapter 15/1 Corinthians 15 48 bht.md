# 1 Corinthians 15:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All of Adam's posterity in their natural state are like the man of dust, being frail, corruptible, and mortal, subject to corruption and decay. However, those who are heavenly, like Christ in His ascended state, will also be heavenly. These are His risen people, invested with heavenly properties, and they will have heavenly, spiritual, and glorious bodies, like their Head. They are the ones who partake in the heavenly calling and have their conversation in heaven.
