# 1 Corinthians 15:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The transformation from the earthly to the heavenly image is a promise rather than an exhortation. It signifies that our conformity to the heavenly Representative man begins within our souls and will be perfected at the resurrection. The close connection between the believer and the Savior parallels that between Adam and humanity. Just as we bear the image of frailty and mortality now, we will bear the image of holiness and glory in the resurrection, when we will be restored fully in body and soul.
