## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That the following appearances are related in chronological order, is evident from the use of the definite marks of sequence." 
2. "The occasion referred to seems to be that in John xx. 19 ff.; Luke xxiv. 36 ff."
3. "Clearly we must not with Chrysostom suppose Matthias to be included as possibly having seen Him after His ascension: for the appearance is evidently one and the same."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "seen of Cephasâ€”Peter"
2. "The round number for 'the Eleven'... 'the Twelve.'"
3. "However, very possibly Matthias was present... but the best on the whole, 'the Twelve.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The resurrection of Christ was A fact to be proved, like all other facts, by competent and credible witnesses."
2. "Paul, therefore, appeals to the witnesses who had attested, or who yet lived to attest, the truth of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus."
3. "But he does not refer to them in general merely, but mentions 'names,' and refers to persons who 'were then alive,' who could attest the truth of the resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word most commonly used in the New Testament for seeing visions."
2. "Compare the kindred ojptasia vision, Luke 1:22; Acts 26:19; 2 Corinthians 12:1."
3. "The word most commonly used in the New Testament for seeing visions. See on Luke 22:43."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as we know, that there were twelve in number that were set apart by Christâ€™s appointment, though one of them had been expunged from the roll, there is no absurdity in supposing that the name was retained."
2. "By all the Apostles I understand not merely the twelve, but also those disciples to whom Christ had assigned the office of preaching the gospel."
3. "In proportion as our Lord was desirous that there should be many witnesses of his resurrection, and that it should be frequently testified of, let us know that it should be so much the more surely believed among us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul means not a mere 'vision,' but actual appearance."
2. "The natural way to understand Paul's adverbs of time here is chronological: then, then, then, then, last of all."
3. "To the twelve. The technical name. Only ten were present, for Judas was dead and Thomas was absent."

### John Gill:
1. "This was not another Cephas, one of the seventy disciples, as Clemens suggests, but the Apostle Peter himself, to whom it is certain the Lord appeared."
2. "Not that he was the first person by whom Christ was seen after his resurrection, for he first appeared to Mary Magdalene, but the testimony of the women the apostle omits, and it seems as if Peter was the first of the men that saw Christ when risen."
3. "Though there were then but eleven of them, Judas being gone from them, and having destroyed himself, and at the first appearance of Christ to them, there were but ten present, Thomas being absent, yet because their original number, when first chosen and called, were twelve, they still went by the same name."

### John Wesley:
1. By the twelve â€” This was their standing appellation; but their full number was not then present.
