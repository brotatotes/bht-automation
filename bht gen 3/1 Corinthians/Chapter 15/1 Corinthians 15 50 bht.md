# 1 Corinthians 15:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our present mortal bodies, fragile and corruptible, cannot inherit the incorruptible kingdom of God. However, it is necessary for us to undergo a change from our natural bodies to spiritual bodies in order to enter into God's kingdom. This change was exemplified in Christ's resurrection, showing that our bodies will still retain personal identity while being transformed to be fit for the heavenly glory. Our current flesh and blood, being subject to corruption, must be renewed and quickened by the Spirit of Christ to participate in the kingdom.
