# 1 Corinthians 15:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, I reveal to you a mystery, a truth that was hidden but has now been made known. There will come a time when not all of us will experience the sleep of death, but all of us will be changed. This change, which is equivalent to both death and resurrection, will happen in an instant, even to those who are alive at that time. It is a transformation from corruption to incorruption, from dishonor to glory, and from weakness to power. This mystery, unknown before and not fully comprehended even now, is a hope that Christians in every generation hold on to, anticipating the second coming of Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "Behold, I show you a mystery,.... Or a secret, which could never have been discovered by reason, or the light of nature, and what is of pure revelation; and which perhaps the apostle became acquainted with, when he was caught up into the third heaven; and is what is never made mention of by any prophet, or apostle, but himself: he prefaces the account of it in this manner, partly to show the great respect he had for these Corinthians, that he treated them as his bosom friends, to whom he communicated his secrets; and partly to excite their curiosity and attention."
2. "we shall all be changed; some copies read, 'we shall all rise again, but we shall not all be changed', and so the Vulgate Latin version; according to which the sense is, all will rise again, both just and unjust, but all will not be changed into a state of glory; but the apostle is only speaking of the saints, of whom it is true, not only that they shall rise again, but shall be changed from corruption to incorruption; wherefore this cannot be a true reading."
3. "they will not die as men ordinarily do, and continue under the power of death, but they will be changed at once from corruption to incorruption, from dishonour to glory, from weakness to power, from being natural to be spiritual bodies; this change all the saints will undergo, whether dead or alive, at Christ's coming."

### John Wesley:
1. "A mystery ‚Äî A truth hitherto unknown; and not yet fully known to any of the sons of men."
2. "We ‚Äî Christians. The Apostle considers them all as one, in their succeeding generations."
3. "Shall not all die ‚Äî Suffer a separation of soul and body. But we shall all ‚Äî Who do not die, be changed - So that this animal body shall become spiritual."
