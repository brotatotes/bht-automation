# 1 Corinthians 15:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Death has been conquered and swallowed up in victory. The power and dominion of death will be completely destroyed, and it will never regain its power. Although death still has a sting for us now, the day will come when death will be reduced to nothing and we will have a complete victory over it. In the resurrection, when we are all raised from the dead, death will be so completely swallowed up that it will be no more. Victory is established over the king of Terrors.
