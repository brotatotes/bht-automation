## BHT:
We give thanks to God, who grants us the blessed consummation of victory over death through our Lord Jesus Christ. This victory is not of our own doing; we owe it all to God. He has given us the victory over sin, death, and hades. Death and Hades aimed to triumph, but they were overcome through Christ's victory over sin and death. In the face of death, we are reminded of our own humility and the insignificance of pride and insolence.
