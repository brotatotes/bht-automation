# 1 Corinthians 15:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The term 'apostle' goes beyond the Twelve in this context, including the Seventy and others. It's probable that James, mentioned here among the apostles, was not one of the original Twelve. The presence of James and the brothers of Jesus in the upper room can be understood in light of this. The Ascension of Christ from Olivet also plays a significant role in interpreting this.

### Philip Schaff:
