1. "The Christian 'salutation' was no unmeaning ceremony: it was the Hebrew 'Peace be unto you' in its highest, warmest sense."
2. "From this and similar references to churches regularly meeting in the private houses of their members, it is plain that up to this time and probably for long after the Christians met only in private houses."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "True of the Roman province (Acts 10:10; Acts 10:26; Colossians 1:6; Colossians 2:1; Colossians 4:13; Colossians 4:16). The gospel spread rapidly from Ephesus."
