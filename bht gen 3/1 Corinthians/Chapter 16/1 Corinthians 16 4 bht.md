# 1 Corinthians 16:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the collection is large enough to be considered worthy of the apostle's journey, then the apostle will accompany them instead of just providing letters of recommendation. This would not be for security or to ensure a warm reception, but rather to carry the collection with the dignity of an apostolic mission. By going together, any suspicions of wrongdoing can be avoided, and the apostle's commitment to the cause can be demonstrated.
