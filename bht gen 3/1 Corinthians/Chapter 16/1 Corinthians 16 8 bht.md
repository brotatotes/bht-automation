### John Calvin:
1. "He accordingly tells them beforehand that he will remain at Ephesus until Pentecost, adding the reason â€” in order that they may wait for him the more patiently."
2. "I do not concede to him, however, that Paul celebrated that day at Ephesus from being influenced by a superstitious regard to the day, but because there would be a larger assembly at that time, and he hoped that, in that way, an opportunity would be presented to him of propagating the gospel."
3. "Thus, when he was hastening forward to Jerusalem, he assigned as the reason of his haste, that he might arrive there at Pentecost, but while others presented themselves there for the purpose of sacrificing according to the ritual of the law, he himself had another object in view â€” that his ministry might be the more useful in proportion to the largeness of the attendance."
