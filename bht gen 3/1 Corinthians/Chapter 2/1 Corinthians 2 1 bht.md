2. "Hellenistic (Grecizing) Judaism at Tarsus and Alexandria was the connecting link between the schools of Athens and those of the Rabbis."
3. "Thus, as the three elements, Greek cultivation, Roman polity, and the divine law given to the Jews, combined just at Christ's time, to prepare the world for the Gospel, so the same three, by God's marvellous providence, met together in the apostle to the Gentiles."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "With excellency [Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ œÖœÄŒµœÅŒøœáŒ∑ŒΩ] . Lit., according to elevation or superiority. The noun occurs only here and 1 Timothy 2:2, where it is rendered authority. The phrase expresses the mode of his preaching." 
2. "Declaring [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒªœâŒΩ] . Rev., proclaiming. See on 1 John 1:5; Acts 17:23. Authoritative proclamation is implied. The word is found only in the Acts and in Paul." 
3. "Testimony [ŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒπŒøŒΩ] . Some of the best texts read musthrion mystery. So Rev. See on Romans 11:25."

### John Calvin:
1. "He allows therefore that he had not had any of the aids of human eloquence or wisdom to qualify him for producing any effect, but while he acknowledges himself to be destitute of such resources, he hints at the inference to be drawn from this ‚Äî that the power of God shone the more illustriously in his ministry, from its standing in no need of such helps."
2. "For the present he simply grants that he has nothing of human wisdom, and in the meantime reserves to himself this much ‚Äî that he published the testimony of God."
3. "He now distinguishes between speech and wisdom (Œª·ΩπŒ≥ŒøŒΩ ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ œÑ·Ω¢œÇ œÉŒøœÜ·Ω∑Œ±œÇ.) Hence what I noticed before (103) is here confirmed ‚Äî that hitherto he has not been speaking of mere empty prattling, but has included the entire training of human learning."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech (as a rhetorician), or of wisdom (as a philosopher), proclaiming to you the testimony of God that concerns His Son."
2. "Or, according to another reading, which has striking support, ‚Äòthe mystery of God.‚Äô But the evidence for the received reading, given above, appears to us stronger, and with Meyer we think the word ‚Äòmystery‚Äô crept in here from 1 Corinthians 2:7."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not in excellence of rhetorical display or of philosophical subtlety."
2. "Christ crucified is the mystery of God."
3. "This mystery was once hidden from the ages, but is now made plain in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "He chose not such a high and florid style, and which savoured so much of human wisdom and art; for the subject he treated of required no such dress, nor any great swelling words of vanity, or a bombast style to set it off, and gain the applause and assent of men."
2. "declaring unto you the testimony of God; that is, the Gospel, which bears a testimony to the love, grace, and mercy of God, his kindness and good will to the sons of men."
3. "All which being matter of fact, and depending upon the witness of God, which is greater than that of men, needed no art nor oratory of men to recommend it: it was enough in plain words, and easy language, to declare it, with the evidence by which it was supported."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not with loftiness of speech or of wisdom - I did not affect either deep wisdom or eloquence."
2. "Declaring the testimony of God ‚Äî What God gave me to testify concerning his Son."
