## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the Spirit of God searches and knows the manifold and infinite depths of God‚ÄîHis Essence, His Attributes, His Counsels." 
2. "being the Spirit which is in us, besides being the Spirit of God, teaches us, according to our capacity, those depths of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The secrets of revelation are secret to some, not because those who know them will not reveal them (for indeed, the very notion of revelation implies an unveiling of what had been veiled), but because those to whom they are announced have not the will or power to comprehend them." 
2. "Intelligent men may understand the outline of doctrines; but without the Holy Spirit's revelation to the heart, these will be to them a mere outline‚Äîa skeleton, correct perhaps, but wanting life."
3. "The Spirit delights to explore the infinite depths of His own divine mind, and then reveal them to us, according as we are capable of understanding them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No truth is now communicated to Christians which was not revealed to and by the inspired writers; but the same truths are imparted by means of their writings, and by the illumination of the Spirit to all the true friends of God."
2. "The Holy Spirit has an intimate knowledge of all things. It is not to be supposed that he searches, or inquires as people do who are ignorant; but that he has an intimate and profound knowledge, such as is usually the result of a close and accurate search."
3. "The Spirit is omniscient. He searches or clearly understands 'all things' - the very definition of omniscience. He understands all the profound plans and counsels of God. And how can there be a higher demonstration of omniscience than to 'know God?'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Searcheth [ŒµœÅŒµœÖŒΩŒ±] . See on John 5:39. Not, searcheth in order to discover; but of the ever active, accurate, careful sounding of the depths of God by the Spirit.


### John Calvin:
1. "Hence the greater the bluntness of the human intellect for understanding the mysteries of God, and the greater the uncertainty under which it labors, so much the surer is our faith, which rests for its support on the revelation of God‚Äôs Spirit." 
2. "Let it suffice us to have the Spirit of God as a witness, for there is nothing in God that is too profound for him to reach."
3. "By the deep things you must understand ‚Äî not secret judgments, which we are forbidden to search into, but the entire doctrine of salvation, which would have been to no purpose set before us in the Scriptures, were it not that God elevates our minds to it by his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God not the depths of His Being, but of His purposes, though in themselves these are inseparable." 
2. "Note here the relation and interaction of ‚ÄòGod‚Äô and ‚Äòthe Spirit.‚Äô Why, it may be asked, does God employ the Spirit‚Äôs agency to reveal to believers what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor heart conceived? Because (says this verse) those depths of the Godhead lie open to the Spirit‚Äôs penetrating gaze; a unique statement to which there is no actual parallel, save Romans 8:26-27, which throws much light on the statement here." 
3. "But the following verse contains an equally unique and noteworthy statement."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We do not have to wait for heaven to see them."
2. "The Holy Spirit is the agent of this definite revelation of grace."
3. "The Holy Spirit not merely investigates us, but he searches 'even the deep things of God'."

### John Gill:
1. "God has made a revelation of them, not only in his word, which is common to men, nor only to his ministers, but to private Christians and believers, by his Spirit."
2. "The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God; which does not suppose any ignorance of these things in the Spirit, antecedent to his searching of them; but his complete and perfect knowledge of them."
3. "For the 'deep things of God' intend not the perfections of his nature, which are past finding out unto perfection by men; nor the depths of his wise and righteous providence; but the mysterious doctrines of the Gospel, the fellowship of the mystery which was hid in God, his wise counsels of old concerning man's salvation, the scheme of things drawn in his eternal mind, and revealed in the word."

### John Wesley:
1. "God hath revealed ‚Äî Yea, and 'freely given'..." 
2. "Them to us ‚Äî Even inconceivable peace, and joy unspeakable." 
3. "For the Spirit searcheth even the deep things of God ‚Äî Be they ever so hidden and mysterious; the depths both of his nature and his kingdom."
