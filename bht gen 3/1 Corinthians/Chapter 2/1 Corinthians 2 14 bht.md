# 1 Corinthians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The natural man, whose highest reference is the animal soul turned towards the flesh, worldly desires, and evil spirits, cannot know or receive the things of the Spirit since they are spiritually discerned. This unregenerate man is closely akin to the carnal, earthy, and devilish, lacking the spiritual perception and appreciation needed for them. The change effected in regeneration is a purely moral and spiritual one, divinely conferred, underscoring the dignity of the Gospel. Only through the Holy Spirit can one perceive and embrace the profound and sublime nature of these spiritual truths.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The natural, or animal man, as distinguished from the spiritual man, is he, whose governing principle and highest reference of all things is the animal soul, that which animates his fleshly body."
2. "The animal soul (psyche in Greek) is that side of the human soul, so to speak, which is turned towards the flesh, the world, the devil."
3. "He cannot know them (viz. the things of the Spirit, the matter of our spiritual teaching, itself furnished by the Spirit), because they are spiritually (by the spirit of a man exalted by the Spirit of God into its proper paramount office of judging and ruling, and inspired and enabled for that office) discerned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The carnal man (the man led by bodily appetites, and also by a self-exalting spirit, estranged from the divine life) is closely akin; so too the 'earthly.' 'Devilish,' or 'demon-like'; 'led by an evil spirit,' is the awful character of such a one, in its worst type." 
2. "receiveth notâ€”though they are offered to him, and are 'worthy of being received by all men'"
3. "neither can heâ€”Not only does he not, but he cannot know them, and therefore has no wish to 'receive' them"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'natural' here stands opposed evidently to 'spiritual.' It denotes those who are governed and influenced by the natural instincts; the animal passions and desires, in opposition to those who are influenced by the Spirit of God."
2. "Perhaps, also, the word 'know' here implies also the idea of 'loving,' or 'approving' of them, as it often does in the Scripture. Thus, to know the Lord often means to love him, to have a full, practical acquaintance with him."
3. "The passage here proves that while a man is thus sensual, the things of the Spirit will appear to him to be folly; it proves nothing about his ability, or his natural faculty, to see the excellency of these things, and to turn from his sin. It is the affirmation of a simple fact everywhere discernible, that the natural man does not perceive the beauty of these things; that while he remains in that state he cannot; and that if he is ever brought to perceive their beauty, it will be by the influence of the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The man, therefore, whose cognition of truth depends solely upon his natural insight is yucikov natural, as contrasted with the spiritual man [Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±Ï„Î¹ÎºÎ¿Ï‚] to whom divine insight is imparted." 
2. "The uniform teaching of Scripture is that the change effected in regeneration is a purely moral and spiritual one." 
3. "The apostle condemns all these impatient human praejudicia which anticipate the final judgment, reserving his case for the great tribunal, where at length all the evidence will be forthcoming and a satisfactory verdict can be given."

### John Calvin:
1. "In short, while ignorant persons depreciate the gospel, because they measure its value by the estimation in which it is held by men, Paul derives an argument from this for extolling more highly its dignity." 
2. "For he teaches that the reason why it is contemned is that it is unknown, and that the reason why it is unknown is that it is too profound and sublime to be apprehended by the understanding of man." 
3. "Hence we infer, that faith is not in oneâ€™s own power, but is divinely conferred."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With him 'the natural man' is he who in spiritual things has only his natural human faculties to guide him, without spiritual perception or apprehension, but not necessarily the slave of grovelling impulses."
2. "But it is simply the absence of this life which is denoted by the phrase 'the natural man.'"
3. "The uniform teaching of Scripture is, that the change effected in regeneration is a purely moral and spiritual one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The natural man is the unregenerate man while the spiritual man is the renewed man, born again of the Spirit of God."

### John Gill:
1. "Not a babe in Christ, one that is newly born again, for though such have but little knowledge of spiritual things, yet they have a taste, and do relish and desire, and receive the sincere milk of the word, and grow thereby; but an unregenerate man, that has no knowledge at all of such things."
2. "Indeed, every man in a state of nature, who is as he was born, whatever may be the inward furniture of his mind, or his outward conduct of life, is but a natural man."
3. "There must be a natural visive discerning faculty, suited to the object; as there must be a natural visive faculty to see and discern natural things, so there must be a spiritual one, to see, discern, judge, and approve of spiritual things; and which only a spiritual, and not a natural man has."

### John Wesley:
1. "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit, for they are foolishness to him."
2. "He is so far from understanding, that he utterly despises them."
3. "They can only be discerned by the aid of that Spirit, and by those spiritual senses, which he has not."
