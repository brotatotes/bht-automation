# 1 Corinthians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The spiritual man, the one in whom the Spirit rules, discerns and judges all things by their true standard. His practical insight into the verities of the Gospel allows him to sift, examine, and decide rightly. While men of intellectual gifts may ignorantly speak about things they do not understand, the spiritual man stands superior to their judgments. He cannot be convicted or shaken by the false judgments of the natural man, as his assurance of faith is grounded in the mysteries of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "he that is spiritual (he, in whom the spirit rules: and since by manâ€™s fall the spirit is overridden by the animal soul, and in abeyance, this always presupposes the infusion of the Holy Spirit, to quicken and inform the spiritâ€”so that there is no such thing as an unregenerate spiritual man) discerneth all things"
2. "the high position of the spiritual man, who alone can judge things by their true standard"
3. "he himself is discerned by none (who is not also spiritual, see ch. xiv. 29; 1 John iv. 1, where such judgment is expressly attributed to Christian believers)"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The spiritual is the man distinguished above his fellow men, as he in whom the Spirit rules."
2. "He has a practical insight into the verities of the Gospel, though he is not infallible on all theoretical points."
3. "The Spirit leads into all truth and holiness; but His influence on believers and on the Church is as yet partial."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The man who is enlightened by the Holy Spirit in contradistinction from him who is under the influence of the senses only."
2. "The spiritual man has a discernment of these truths in regard to which the sensual man was blind and ignorant."
3. "His feelings, principles, views, hopes, fears, joys, cannot be fully understood and appreciated by any natural or sensual man."

### John Calvin:
1. "Away with all the discernment of the flesh as to this matter! It is the spiritual man alone that has such a firm and solid acquaintance with the mysteries of God, as to distinguish without fail between truth and falsehood."
2. "He, on the other hand, is judged by no man, because the assurance of faith is not subject to men, as though they could make it totter at their nod."
3. "In this way, too, Paul would exempt the consciences of the pious from all decrees, laws, and censures of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But he that is spiritual judgeth all things not only those spiritual things which the natural man cannot judge, but also those which belong to the natural manâ€™s own domain, and which he only views in their true light."

2. "Men of intellectual gifts who are ignorant of the things of Christ talk learnedly and patronizingly about things of which they are grossly ignorant."
3. "The spiritual man refuses to accept the decision of his ignorant judges. He stands superior to them all as Polycarp did when he preferred to be burnt to saying, 'Lord Caesar' in place of 'Lord Jesus'."

### John Gill:
1. "A spiritual man intends every man that is born of the Spirit."
2. "He has spiritual senses, and these in exercise; he has a spiritual sight of things, of himself, and his lost state by nature, and of the person, grace, and things of Christ."
3. "Sooner may a rock be removed out of its place, than a truly spiritual man can be convicted by a natural man of the falsehood of these things, of which he has had an inward experience, as well as is instructed in them by the word of God."

### John Wesley:

- Attempt 1 BHT: The spiritual man, who is infused with the Holy Spirit, holds a high position and has a practical insight into the truths of the Gospel. He can discern and judge all things, including spiritual matters that the natural man cannot understand. However, he himself is not discerned or understood by those who are not spiritual. This distinction between the spiritual and the natural is crucial, as those who lack spiritual discernment may talk learnedly about things they are ignorant of. The spiritual man stands superior to the judgments of the ignorant and refuses to accept their decisions. His discernment comes from the eyes of his heart being enlightened by the Spirit, giving him the ability to sift, examine, and decide rightly. Ultimately, a truly spiritual man cannot be convicted or shaken by the false judgments or decrees of men, as his assurance of faith is grounded in the mysteries of God.
