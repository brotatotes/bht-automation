# 1 Corinthians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To judge the spiritual man, one must know the mind of the Lord, the intent and disposition of Christ. Natural men who judge spiritual men wish to instruct God and bring Him to another mind. The faith of Christians doesn't rely on human wisdom but evidence in their hearts and transformed characters. Having the mind of Christ allows believers to know all that God reveals. Despite the diversities in Christendom, the spiritual family remains unrecognized by the world as they are known only by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In order for an unassisted man, not gifted from Christ, to judge the spiritual man, he must know the mind of the Lord, the intent and disposition of Christ."
2. "But we (the spiritual, among whom he includes himself and the other Apostles) have (not a wisdom independent of Christ, nor do we know His mind, nor can we teach Him, but) the mind of Christ."
3. "The mind of the Lord is the spiritual intent and designs of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In order to judge the spiritual man, the ordinary man must 'know the mind of the Lord.'"
2. "Natural men who judge spiritual men, living according to the mind of God ('We have the mind of Christ'), are virtually wishing to instruct God, and bring Him to another mind."
3. "We have the mind of Christ - in our degree of capability to apprehend it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The faith of Christians does not stand in the wisdom of man. Every Christian has evidence in his own heart, in his experience, and in the transformation of his character, that none but God could have made the change on his soul."
2. "How little can human science do to advance the eternal interests of man? And how shall all fade away in the future world of glory - just as the feeble glimmering of the stars fades away before the light of the morning sun!"
3. "Without the influences of that Spirit his mind will always be in darkness, and his heart will always hate the gospel. How anxiously, therefore, should he cherish His influences! How careful should he be not to grieve Him away!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Mind [Î½Î¿Ï…Î½] . See on Romans 7:23. The understanding of the Lord. The divine counsels or purposes which are the results of the divine thought. See on Romans 11:34. 
Instruct [ÏƒÏ…Î¼Î²Î¹Î²Î±ÏƒÎµÎ¹] . See on proving, Acts 9:22. 


### John Calvin:
1. "his secret counsel which is contained in the gospel is far removed from the understanding of men."
2. "servants of the Lord are taught by the paramount authority of the Spirit, what is farthest removed from the judgment of the flesh, that they may speak fearlessly as from the mouth of the Lord"
3. "We have the mind of Christ"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though none can penetrate Jehovahâ€™s mind, yet since in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, if we have the mind of Christ, we know all of 'the things of God' which a creature is permitted to know."
2. "The contrast here so sharply drawn between Divine and human wisdom is far-reaching, involving the great question of the rival claims of Reason and Revelation to be the supreme guide to the discovery of what man needs for the regulation of his life and the attainment of his highest bliss."
3. "The deep diversities of Christendom cease to be stumbling. For the family of the spiritual dwell alone in the world. 'Therefore the world knoweth them not, because it knew Him not' They know and recognise each other, yet they themselves are known of no men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±Ï„Î¹ÎºÎ¿Ï‚ man is superior to others who attempt even to instruct God himself."
2. "Thus with the mind."
3. "Paul and all Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±Ï„Î¹ÎºÎ¿ men are superior to those who try to shake their faith in Christ, the mystery of God."

### John Gill:
1. "The deep counsels of his heart, the scheme of salvation by Jesus Christ, as drawn in his eternal mind, the sense of the Spirit of God in the writings of the Old Testament, the things of the Spirit of God, or the doctrines of grace more clearly revealed under the Gospel dispensation; not any natural man, by the light of truth and strength of reason, has known any of these things." 
2. "The spiritual man, whom a natural man, being ignorant of the mind of the Lord, cannot instruct; and so the words give a very proper and sufficient reason why the spiritual man is not discerned, judged, convinced, and instructed by the natural man."
3. "We have the mind of Christ; the same with 'the mind of the Lord' which proves that Christ is the Lord, or Jehovah, and so truly and properly God."

### John Wesley:
1. Who â€” What natural man.
We â€” Spiritual men; apostles in particular.
Have â€” Know, understand.
The mind of Christ â€” Concerning the whole plan of gospel salvation. Isaiah 40:13
