# 1 Corinthians 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
My aim among you was to know and preach Christ Himself, focusing on His crucifixion and His office. The preaching of the cross is the only kind of preaching that will be successful.

My determination to preach only Christ and Him crucified was done with full awareness of its potential impact on my ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For I did not resolve to know any thing (meaning, 'the only thing that I made it definitely my business to know, was') among you, save Jesus Christ (His Person), and Him (as) crucified (His Office)." 
2. "We must not overlook, that Paul does not say 'to know any thing of or concerning Christ,' but to know HIM HIMSELF, to preach HIM HIMSELF."
3. "Therefore it is universally CHRIST HIMSELF, the Crucified and the Risen One, who is the subject of preaching, and is also Wisdom itself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The only definite thing that I made it my business to know among you, was to know Jesus Christ (His person) and Him crucified (His office)."
2. "The historical fact of Christ's crucifixion had probably been put less prominently forward by the seekers after human wisdom in the Corinthian church, to avoid offending learned heathens and Jews."
3. "Christ's person and Christ's office constitute the sum of the Gospel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I resolved not to give my time and attention while among you to the laws and traditions of the Jews; to your orators, philosophers, and poets; to the beauty of your architecture or statuary; to a contemplation of your customs and laws, but to attend to this only - making known the cross of Christ."
2. "This should be the resolution of every minister of the gospel. This is his business. It is not to be a politician; not to engage in the strifes and controversies of people; it is not to be a good farmer, or scholar merely; not to mingle with his people in festive circles and enjoyments; not to be a man of taste and philosophy, and distinguished mainly for refinement of manners; not to be a profound philosopher or metaphysician, but to make Christ crucified the grand object of his attention, and seek always and everywhere to make him known."
3. "The preaching of the cross is the only kind of preaching that will be attended with success. That which has in it much respecting the divine mission, the dignity, the works, the doctrines, the person, and the atonement of Christ, will be successful."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Crucified. Emphatic. That which would be the main stumbling - block to the Corinthians he would emphasize.


### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing did I value myself upon, as worth my knowing, or on the ground of knowledge."
2. "No kind of knowledge was in my view of so much importance as to lead me to desire anything but Christ, crucified though he was."
3. "From which we learn what it is that faithful ministers ought to teach, what it is that we must, during our whole life, be learning, and in comparison with which everything else must be 'counted as dung.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He would not only know but one theme, but would hold that forth in precisely the light which he knew would prove the most repulsive to their fastidious ears and corrupt taste."
2. "For this being that in which every fact of His life has its explanations, and from which the whole principle of His work takes its character, he felt he could neither keep it back, nor soften it down."
3. "Yet this was no bravado. He was tremblingly alive to the possible effect of making this the pivot of His ministry."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For I determined not to know anything among youâ€¦ I did not think it fit or his business to know anything for his message beyond this 'mystery of God.'"

1. "save Christ, and him crucified: he had a spiritual and experimental knowledge of Christ himself, and which he valued above all things else"
2. "he made known the things respecting the person of Christ, as that he was God, the Son of God, and truly man"
3. "His determination was to preach none but Christ; not himself, nor man; nor the power and purity of human nature, the free will and works of the creature, but to exclude all and everything from being partners with Christ in the business of salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "I determined not to know anything...save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."

- Attempt 1 BHT: My purpose among you was to know and preach Jesus Christ Himself, specifically emphasizing His crucifixion and the significance of His office. Rather than getting caught up in the knowledge or wisdom of the world, I focused solely on the Gospel of Christ crucified. This emphasis on the crucifixion, which may have been downplayed by those seeking human wisdom, was crucial in order to highlight the stumbling block it posed to the Corinthians and to magnify Christ Himself. The preaching of the cross is the only kind of preaching that will be successful, as it reveals the divine mission, dignity, works, doctrines, person, and atonement of Christ. My determination to preach only Christ and Him crucified was done with great awareness of the potential impact it could have on my ministry, and I was resolute in making this the central theme of my preaching.
