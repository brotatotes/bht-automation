## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The weakness and fear and much trembling must not be exclusively understood of his manner of speech as contrasted with the rhetorical preachers, for these follow in the next verse,‚Äîbut partly of this, and principally of his internal deep and humble persuasion of his own weakness, and the mightiness of the work which was entrusted to him."
2. "So in Phil. ii. 12, 13, he commands the Philippians to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, for it was God that wrought in them."
3. "The weakness may have reference to the weak bodily presence of 2 Cor. x. 10. Chrysostom and others understand it of persecutions: but in the places to which he refers, it has a far wider meaning,‚Äîviz. infirmities, including those resulting from persecution."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I‚Äîthe preacher: as 'Christ crucified,' the mode of preaching: 'my speech . . . not with enticing words,' 'but in demonstration of the Spirit.'" 
2. "weakness‚Äîpersonal and bodily." 
3. "trembling‚ÄîNot personal fear, but a trembling anxiety to perform a duty; anxious conscientiousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In weakness - In conscious feebleness; diffident of my own powers, and not trusting to my own strength."
2. "And in fear, and in much trembling - Paul was sensible that he had many enemies to encounter, and he was sensible of his own natural disadvantages as a public speaker."
3. "Notwithstanding all Paul‚Äôs fears, he was successful there. And it is commonly, perhaps always, when ministers go to their work conscious of their own weakness; burdened with the weight of their message; diffident of their own powers; and deeply solicitous about the result of their labors, that God sends down His Spirit, and converts sinners to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I fell into a state of weakness, etc., after I had come among you." 
2. "With you, i.e., in intercourse with." 
3. "The implication is that his condition grew out of the circumstances in which he found himself in Corinth."

### John Calvin:
1. "He concedes, however, to his adversaries what they desired in such a way as to make those very things which, in their opinion, tended to detract from the credit of his ministry, redound to its highest commendation."
2. "They were aware that Paul had brought nothing with him in respect of the flesh that was fitted to help him forward, or that might enable him to insinuate himself into the favor of men, and yet they had seen the amazing success which the Lord had vouchsafed to his preaching."
3. "The Lord‚Äôs servants are neither so senseless as not to perceive impending dangers, nor so devoid of feeling as not to be moved by them. Nay more, it is necessary for them to be seriously afraid on two accounts chiefly ‚Äî first, that, abased in their own eyes, they may learn wholly to lean and rest upon God alone, and secondly, that they may be trained to a thorough renunciation of self."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
2. "It is remarkable that nowhere else does the apostle so speak, nor does he seem to have anywhere else felt such an oppressive consciousness of his insufficiency."
3. "The historian of the Acts refers to these very feelings at Corinth in the following unusual terms: 'But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia (to Corinth), Paul was constrained by the word...'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I not only eschewed all affectation of cleverness or grandiloquence, but I went to the opposite extreme of diffidence and nervous self-effacement" (Robertson and Plummer). 
2. "It is a common feeling of the most effective preachers. Cool complacency is not the mood of the finest preaching." 
3. "See œÜŒøŒ≤ŒøœÇ (fear) and œÑœÅŒøŒºŒøœÇ (trembling) combined in 2 Corinthians 7:15; Philippians 2:12; Ephesians 6:5."

### John Gill:
