# 1 Corinthians 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True faith is begotten by the Spirit and not subject to human caprice, finding its resting place in the power of God rather than in the limited wisdom of humans. The ever-changing theories of men in various fields prove the unreliability of human wisdom. By preaching without dependence on human wisdom but relying solely on the Spirit's influence, Paul ensured that the Corinthians' faith was founded on God rather than men. Thus, our faith must stand on the power of God alone and not on human wisdom.
