# 1 Corinthians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul speaks of a higher teaching, a wisdom that surpasses worldly wisdom. This wisdom is not the entirety of Christian doctrine but its deeper and more profound principles. Only those with matured Christian experience can understand its true superiority. While rulers and wise individuals of the world may not perceive it as wisdom, it belongs to the enduring and eternal. Gradually, it nullifies the wisdom of these rulers before the final triumph of Christ's kingdom. Rejecting this wisdom exhibits a corrupt understanding, while embracing it acknowledges the highest wisdom.
