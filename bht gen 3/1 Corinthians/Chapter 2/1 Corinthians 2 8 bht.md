The one arises from inconsiderate zeal, not expressly rejecting what is good, but from having an impression that it is evil...The other kind of ignorance has more of the appearance of insanity and derangement, than of mere ignorance; for those that of their own accord rise up against God, are like persons in a frenzy, who, seeing, see not."
