The wisdom of God, hidden from men, was unknown to the rulers who crucified the Lord of glory. This ignorance demonstrates the natural man's lack of heavenly wisdom.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The wisdom of God was hidden from men, as even the rulers of this world did not know it and put to a disgraceful death the Lord of glory. The ignorance shown by these individuals is a strong proof of their destitution of heavenly wisdom. The contrast between the indignity of the Cross and the majesty of the Victim brings to light the amazing ignorance of God's wisdom. If they had known the wisdom of God, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory, thereby inflicting on Him the punishment of slaves. It is astonishing that those in leadership, who should be clear-sighted and wise, were blind to the wisdom of God that shone forth in Christ. While some may act out of malice and ignorance, the crucifixion of Christ by the leaders of the Jews and the Roman empire was a result of their failure to recognize the Messiah and the prophecies concerning Him. The giving Christ the title of the Lord of glory highlights His divinity and the effectiveness of His crucifixion and suffering in fulfilling His purpose.
