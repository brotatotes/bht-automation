# 1 Corinthians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There can be but one foundation for the Church, and that foundation is Jesus Christ Himself. All who build on other foundations are not God's fellow-laborers, nor is their building His at all. Jesus, the Anointed One, is the one foundation recognized by God. Paul emphasizes that believers must build only what is in full harmony with this foundation. Jesus Christ is the complete system of heavenly doctrine and the firm, immovable Rock of Ages upon which the Church must be rightly founded.

- Attempt 1 BHT: There can be but one foundation for the Church, and that foundation is Jesus Christ Himself. It is not any doctrine, but the person of Jesus, the Messiah and Savior, that serves as the solid rock upon which the Church is built. To build on any other foundation is not only futile but impudent. All believers are living stones in this temple of Christ, but they must build only what is in full harmony with the Foundation. Anything else would be a feeble attempt to establish a church without embracing the truth as it is in Christ. The Church must be rightly founded upon Christ alone, for he is the complete system of heavenly doctrine and the firm, immovable Rock of Ages.
