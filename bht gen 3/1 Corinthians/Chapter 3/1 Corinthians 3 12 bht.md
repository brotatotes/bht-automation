# 1 Corinthians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though there is only one foundation, the building upon it can take many forms. The wood, hay, and straw represent perversions of true doctrine mixed with false philosophy, while the gold, silver, and precious stones signify teachings that will stand the fiery test of judgment. The superstructure also represents the individuals who are joined to the Church through these teachings, whose true conversion will be revealed on the last day. Co-workers with God must diligently ensure that their teaching is aligned with the substantial and vital truths of Christianity, avoiding the interweaving of truth with error.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The but implies that though there can be but one foundation, there are many ways of building upon it." 
2. "The builder of the worthless and unsubstantial is in the end SAVED (see below): so that even his preaching was preaching of Christ, and he himself was in earnest." 
3. "By the wood, hay, straw, he indicates the various perversions of true doctrine, and admixtures of false philosophy which were current."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'gold, silver, precious stones,' which all can withstand fire, are teachings that will stand the fiery test of judgment; 'wood, hay, stubble,' are those which cannot stand it; not positive heresy, for that would destroy the foundation, but teaching mixed up with human philosophy and Judaism, curious rather than useful." 
2. "Besides the teachings, the superstructure represents also the persons cemented to the Church by them, the reality of whose conversion, through the teachers' instrumentality, will be tested at the last day." 
3. "Where there is the least grain of real gold of faith, it shall never be lost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is an impropriety, an unfitness, in rearing the spiritual temple, to interweave truth with error; sound doctrine with false."
2. "Let him look to it, whether he teach the substantial, vital truths of Christianity, and which it was intended to support and illustrate; or set himself to propagate vain subtilties and conceits on the one hand, or legal rites and Jewish traditions on the other."
3. "Those who are referred to may be building on the Lord Jesus, and may be true Christians. Yet there is much error among those who are not Christians. There are many things mistaken for piety which will yet be seen as false."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This figure must be taken in a large and free sense, and not pressed into detail."
2. "The distinction is clearly made between the teacher and the matter of his teaching."
3. "The whole structure will be brought to a final and decisive test at the day of judgment, when the true value of each teacher's work shall be manifested, and that which is worthless shall be destroyed."

### John Calvin:
1. "It would not have been enough to have laid the foundation if the entire superstructure did not correspond; for as it were an absurd thing to raise a structure of vile materials on a foundation of gold, so it were greatly criminal to bury Christ under a mass of strange doctrines."
2. "Let us not imagine, however, that this doctrine is apart from Christ, but on the contrary let us understand that we must continue to preach Christ until the very completion of the building."
3. "He forewarns them that every manâ€™s work will one day be made manifest of what sort it is, however it may be for a time concealed, as though he had said: 'It may indeed happen, that unprincipled workmen may for a time deceive, so that the world does not perceive how far each one has labored faithfully or fraudulently, but what is now as it were buried in darkness must of necessity come to light, and what is now glorious in the eyes of men, must before the face of God fall down, and be regarded as worthless.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The highly artistic form of this statement should be noted."
2. "The one set of materials as incombustible as they are valuable-represent those ministers of Christ whose teaching is sound and faithful; the other as inflammable as they are inferior in value represent those whose teaching is the reverse of the former."
3. "Now, since in all these places the foundation is 'Jesus Christ,' it follows that what is 'built thereupon' must mean what is taught regarding Him considered as sound or unsound, wholesome or noxious."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The durable materials are three (gold, silver, marble or precious stones), perishable materials (pieces of wood, hay, stubble), 'of a palace on the one hand, of a mud hut on the other' (Lightfoot)." 
2. "Probably both ideas are involved, for look at the penalty on shoddy work (verse 1 Corinthians 3:15) and shoddy men (verse 1 Corinthians 3:17)." 
3. "The teaching may not always be vicious and harmful. It may only be indifferent and worthless. A co-worker with God in this great temple should put in his very best effort."

### John Gill:
1. "The different materials laid by one and the same man... are some of them comparable to gold, silver, precious stones... for their weight, importance, solidity, and substantiality." 
2. "Others are like wood, hay, stubble... empty, trifling, useless things... Jewish rites and ceremonies; which... might by some be introduced into their ministry."
3. "Everything that may now be advanced in the Gospel ministry... not so honourable to the grace of God... may be meant."

### John Wesley:
1. "Gold, silver, costly stones - Three sorts of materials which will bear the fire; true and solid doctrines."
2. "Wood, hay, stubble - Three which will not bear the fire. Such are all doctrines, ceremonies, and forms of human invention."
3. "All but the substantial, vital truths of Christianity."
