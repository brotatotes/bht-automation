# 1 Corinthians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At some point, the work that each person has built, their part in constructing the building of God, will be revealed and tested to show what it truly is. The idea of purgatory is inconsistent with this, as the fire mentioned here is not purgatorial but probatory, testing both the godly and ungodly. This fire is universal and not until the last day, unlike the supposed fire of purgatory that begins at death. Men have discovered that some supposedly fireproof buildings are not truly fireproof when faced with an actual fire. Ultimately, there is no escaping this final testing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The work of each man (i.e. that which he has built: his part in erecting the building of God) shall (at some time) be made manifest ... [it] shall not always remain in the present uncertainty but be tested, and shewn of what: sort it is."
2. "The words 'shall receive wages' can hardly be said of mere abiding the test of tribulation."
3. "This universality of trial by fire is equally against the idea of a purgatorial fire, which most convenient and lucrative fiction has been mainly based by the Romanists on a perversion of this passage."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fire is not purgatory (as Rome teaches, that is, purificatory and punitive), but probatory, not restricted to those dying in 'venial sin' the supposed intermediate class between those entering heaven at once, and those dying in mortal sin who go to hell, but universal, testing the godly and ungodly alike."
2. "This fire is not till the last day, the supposed fire of purgatory begins at death."
3. "The fire of Paul is to try the works, the fire of purgatory the persons, of men."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What every man has built on this foundation shall be seen."
2. "The 'fire' which is here referred to, is doubtless that which shall attend the consummation of all things."
3. "It is the property of fire to test the qualities of objects...so shall all that is genuine pass through the trials of the last great Day."

### John Calvin:
1. "The darkness will not always remain: the light will one day break forth; which will make all things manifest."
2. "The nearer the doctrine of God is brought to this fire, so much the brighter will be its luster."
3. "There is nothing but that day to which the Apostle appeals, that tests everything to the quick, not merely by its brightness, but also by its fiery flame."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "the day shall declare it not 'some day' sooner or later...but one definite day alone suits all that is here said 'the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.'" 
2. "literal fire, as seems clearly taught, the bursting forth of which will perhaps be the visible herald of Christâ€™s coming."
3. "the fire itself shall prove each manâ€™s work of what sort it is and with what result?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The day of judgment as in 1 Thessalonians 5:4 (which see), Romans 13:12; Hebrews 10:25. The work of each will be made manifest. There is no escape from this final testing." 
2. "This metaphor of fire was employed in the O.T. (Daniel 7:9; Malachi 4:1) and by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:12; Luke 3:16). It is a metaphor that must not be understood as purgatorial, but simple testing (Ellicott) as every fire tests ( the fire itself will test) the quality of the material used in the building." 
3. "Men today find, alas, that some of the fireproof buildings are not fireproof when the fire actually comes."

### John Gill:
1. "The doctrine he preaches shall be sooner or later made manifest to himself, and to his hearers; who shall see the inconsistency, irregularity, and deformity of such a building."
2. "This day rather designs a day of tribulation; as of persecution, which tries men's principles, whether they are solid or not; and of error and heresy, when men are put upon a re-examination of their doctrines."
3. "By the fire is meant...the fire of tribulation and affliction, which, as it is for the trial of the grace of faith, so of the doctrine of faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "The time is coming when every one's work shall be made manifest: for the day of the Lord, that great and final day, shall declare it - To all the world."
2. "For it is revealed â€” What faith beholds as so certain and so near is spoken of as already present."
3. "But the expression, when applied to the trying of doctrines, and consuming those that are wrong, is evidently figurative; because no material fire can have such an effect on what is of a moral nature."
