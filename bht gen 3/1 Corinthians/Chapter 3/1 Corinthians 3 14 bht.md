# 1 Corinthians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a man's work endures the testing fire, built on the foundation of Christ through faithful teaching, he shall receive wages as a builder. The reward will be in proportion to the genuineness of his work. On the day of the Lord, only the work that stands the test will have true praise and recompense. We must not rely on the empty praises of the world, but rather have an eye to that day and seek the approval of the Lord, who will say, Well done, good and faithful servant.
