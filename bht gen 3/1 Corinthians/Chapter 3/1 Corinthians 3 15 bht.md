# 1 Corinthians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The image of a builder whose work is consumed by fire serves as a cautionary tale of a minister who failed to produce fruit in his ministry. While his salvation is secure, his work will be utterly destroyed. He will suffer the loss of his time, effort, reputation, and hopes, with nothing to show for it in heaven. This emphasizes the importance of building on the true foundation of Jesus Christ and striving to bear fruit that enriches both our character and the Kingdom of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "having held, and built on, the true foundation Jesus Christ, he shall not be excluded from that salvation which is the free gift of God to all who believe on Christ, but shall get no especial reward as a faithful and effectual teacher."
2. "he shall suffer loss (literally, be mulcted, viz. of the wages which would otherwise have been his)"
3. "as a builder whose building was consumed would escape with personal safety, but with the loss of his work"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If his doctrines have not been true; if he has had mistaken views of piety; if he has nourished feelings which he thought were those of religion; and inculcated practices which, however well meant, are not such as the gospel produces; if he has fallen into error of opinion, feeling, practice, however conscientious, yet he shall suffer loss."
2. "He shall not be elevated to as high a rank and to as high happiness as he otherwise would. That which he supposed would be regarded as acceptable by the Judge, and rewarded accordingly, shall be stripped away, and shown to be unfounded and false; and in consequence, he shall not obtain those elevated rewards which he anticipated."
3. "The apostle all along has supposed that the true foundation was laid...The man that is building on the true foundation shall be safe. His errors and imperfections shall be removed, and he may occupy a lower place in heaven, but he shall be safe."

2. "Such persons, Paul says, could be saved, but on this condition â€” if the Lord wiped away their ignorance, and purged them from all dross." 
3. "Farther, although God sometimes purges his own people by afflictions, yet here by the name of fire, I understand the touchstone of the Spirit, by which the Lord corrects and removes the ignorance of his people, by which they were for a time held captive."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "he shall suffer loss loss of his time, his pains, his hopes, his credit; his whole ministry, even though right at bottom, yet all of it which is of this character, disappearing."
2. "but he himself shall be saved a statement of vast importance, as showing that the apostle is not speaking here of false teachers, but of the true servants of Christ."
3. "yet so as by fire as of one who escapes from the fire by a rush, or is plucked out of it, his naked person alone saved."
