## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "œÜŒ∏ŒµŒØœÅŒµŒπ, [destroys, or] mars, whether as regards its unity and beauty, or its purity and sanctity: here, the meaning is left indefinite, but the latter particulars are certainly hinted at, by ·ºÖŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ below."
2. "œÜŒ∏ŒµœÅŒµ·øñ, either by temporal death (Mey.), as in ch. 1 Corinthians 11:30; or by spiritual death, which is more probable, seeing that the figurative temple is spoken of, not (as Mey.) the material temple: and as temporal death was the punishment for defiling the material temple (Exodus 28:43. Lev 16:2 al. fr.), so spiritual death for marring or defiling of God‚Äôs spiritual temple."
3. "Œø·ºµœÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ, i.e. ·ºÖŒ≥ŒπŒøŒπ, not, 'which temple are ye,' which would be tautological after 1 Corinthians 3:16, and would hardly be expressed by Œø·ºµœÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ, 'ut qui,' or 'quales.' Meyer well remarks, that Œø·ºµœÑŒπŒΩŒ≠œÇ ·ºêœÉœÑŒµ ·ΩëŒºŒµ·øñœÇ is the minor proposition of a syllogism: 'Whoever mars the temple of God, him will God destroy, because His temple is holy; but ye also, as His ideal temple, are holy: therefore, whoever mars you, shall be destroyed by God.'"

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The temple of God is to be regarded as sacred and inviolable."
3. "This proves that though Paul regarded them as lamentably corrupt in some respects, he still regarded them as a true church - as a part of the holy temple of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Defile [œÜŒ∏ŒµŒπœÅŒµŒπ] . Rev., more correctly, destroy. This is the primary and almost universal meaning in classical Greek."
2. "The phrase seems to be used here according to the Jewish idea that the temple was destroyed or corrupted by the slightest defilement or damage, or by neglect on the part of its guardians."
3. "Which temple [ŒøŒπœÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ] . Temple is not in the Greek. The double relative which refers to the epithet holy; 'of which holy character or class ye are.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "If any man corrupts the temple of God...that man, whoever he may be, that corrupts it, will not pass with impunity."

3. "The Corinthians themselves in their angry disputes had forgotten their holy heritage and calling, though this failing was no excuse for the ringleaders who had led them on."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Want of holiness is a violation of the temple of God and will not go unpunished. The destroyer of God's temple will himself be destroyed, both in this life and the next. This destruction applies to those who corrupt and defile the temple of God, whether through their actions or false doctrine. The Corinthians had forgotten their holy calling and allowed themselves to be led astray, but this does not excuse the ringleaders who had misled them. The temple of God is to be regarded as sacred and inviolable, and those who usurp God's authority in the Church will face the punishment of God. It is a sobering reminder that God is not only an avenger of immorality, but also of false doctrine and worship that goes against the Gospel.
