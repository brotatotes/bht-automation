Whoever destroys the temple of God, whether through temporal or spiritual means, will be destroyed by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "shall God destroy, or, mar, either by temporal death, as in ch, xi. 30; or by spiritual death, which is more probable"
2. "holy is the constant epithet of the temple in the Old Test., see Ps. xi. 45 lxxix. 1. Hab. ii. 20, and passim."
3. "Whoever mars the temple of God, him will God destroy, because His temple is holy: but ye also, as His ideal temple, are holy:â€”therefore, whoever mars you, shall be destroyed by God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The destroyers here, are distinct from the unwise or unskilful builders; the latter held fast the 'foundation' and, therefore, though they lose their work of superstructure and the special reward, yet they are themselves saved; the destroyers, on the contrary, assailed with false teaching the foundation, and so subvert the temple itself, and shall therefore be destroyed." 
2. "I think Paul passes here from the teachers to all the members of the Church, who, by profession, are 'priests unto God.' As the Aaronic priests were doomed to die if they violated the old temple, so any Christian who violates the sanctity of the spiritual temple, shall perish eternally." 
3. "Want of holiness on the part of any of you...is a violation of the temple, which cannot be let to pass with impunity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If any man by his doctrines or precepts shall pursue such a course as tends to destroy the church, God shall severely punish him."
2. "The temple of God is to be regarded as sacred and inviolable."
3. "This proves that though Paul regarded them as lamentably corrupt in some respects, he still regarded them as a true church - as a part of the holy temple of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Destroy. This is the primary and almost universal meaning in classical Greek."
2. "The phrase seems to be used here according to the Jewish idea that the temple was destroyed or corrupted by the slightest defilement or damage."
3. "Which temple. The double relative which refers to the epithet holy; 'of which holy character or class ye are.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "If any man corrupts the temple of God...that man, whoever he may be, that corrupts it, will not pass with impunity."
2. "The kind of profanation...is...when men intrude themselves, so as to bear rule in the Church in the place of God."
3. "As soon as we are tinctured with the contrivances of men, the temple of God is polluted...because the sacrifice of faith...is in that case offered to creatures."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If any man shall destroy the temple of God, him shall God destroy. The sin and its punishment are in the original purposely expressed by the same word; but this cannot be represented in English."
 
2. "For the temple of God is holy, and such are ye not, as in the Authorised Version, 'which temple ye are;' for that had just before been said, but 'such holy persons ye are,' inasmuch as ye are the temple of God."
3. "What follows, to the close of this chapter, reiterates what had been said about the mischief which this false wisdom, and their disputes in connection with it, were doing at Corinth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a terrible thing to tear down ruthlessly a church or temple of God like an earthquake that shatters a building in ruins."
2. "The church-wrecker God will wreck. What does Paul mean by 'will destroy'? Does he mean punishment here or hereafter? May it not be both?"
3. "The Corinthians themselves in their angry disputes had forgotten their holy heritage and calling."

### John Gill:

2. "The false prophet, as well as the beast, and the devil, shall be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone."
3. "God is not only an avenger of all immoralities committed against his righteous law, but of all false doctrine and false worship, and of everything that is contrary to the Gospel, and to the order and ordinances of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "If any man destroy the temple of God â€” Destroy a real Christian, by schisms, or doctrines fundamentally wrong."
2. "Him shall God destroy â€” He shall not be saved at all..."
3. "...not even as through the fire."
