# 1 Corinthians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever destroys or mars the temple of God, whether as regards its unity and beauty, or its purity and sanctity, shall be destroyed by God. The Corinthians, as His ideal temple, were also holy, but in their angry disputes, they had forgotten their holy heritage and calling. The sin and its punishment are expressed by the same word, for God is not only an avenger of immoralities but also of false doctrine and false worship. Those who ruthlessly tear down a church will themselves be destroyed by God.
