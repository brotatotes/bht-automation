# 1 Corinthians 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God considers the craftiness and wisdom of the world as folly, using it to trap those who are wise in their own eyes. The world's standards and God's standards are not the same, so it is important for the church to discern whose idea dominates. The wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight, and He takes the wise in their own craftiness. Therefore, we must be willing to be fools in the world's eyes to truly possess wisdom in the eyes of God.
