# 1 Corinthians 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For you to glory in men is lowering yourselves from your high position as heirs of all things. All men, including your teachers, belong to Christ and therefore to you, by your union with Him. He makes them and all things work together for good. Therefore, let no one glory in men, for that is degrading to those who are heirs of all things. Instead, let no one exalt one preacher above another or reject others when they all belong to you. Remember, let no one glory in men and boast in the Lord, for all things are yours.
