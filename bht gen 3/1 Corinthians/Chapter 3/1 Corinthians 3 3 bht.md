# 1 Corinthians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians, though having received the Spirit, are still influenced by their sinful nature. Instead of walking in the Spirit, they walk in the flesh, engaging in jealousy, strife, and divisions. Their actions and words reveal their carnality, as they are more concerned with their favorite preachers and personal agendas rather than being united in love. This is a reminder that when the flesh prevails, the wisdom of God finds no place, and the fruits of envy and strife are the result.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As this refers to their feelings, 'strife' refers to their words, and 'divisions' to their actions."

2. "In ver. 1, Paul would say that he was compelled to address the Corinthians as unspiritual, made of flesh."

### John Calvin:

1. "The œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œø who continue to be œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒø are still babes (ŒΩŒ∑œÄŒπŒø), not adults (œÑŒµŒªŒµŒπŒø), while those who are still œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒπŒ∫Œø (carnal) have given way to the flesh as if they were still œàœÖœáŒπŒ∫Œø (unregenerate)."
2. "Zeal (Œ∂Œ∑ŒªŒøœÇ from Œ∂Œµœâ, to boil) is not necessarily evil, but good if under control. It may be not according to knowledge (Romans 10:2) and easily becomes jealousy (same root through the French jaloux) as zeal."
