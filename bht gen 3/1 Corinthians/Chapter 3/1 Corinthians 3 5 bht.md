# 1 Corinthians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The divided state among the Corinthians led Paul to ask the question of who Apollos and himself truly were, mere servants through whom the Corinthians believed. Humility, rather than seeking self-glory, is fitting for ordinary ministers. The gifts and graces Christians possess should be traced back to God alone to prevent contentions and divisions in the church. The external doctrine preached by ministers is praised as the instrument of the Holy Spirit, leading souls to believe in Christ through the free grace and sovereign will of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "Ye believed, as in the references: ye became believers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "He puts Apollos before himself in humility."
3. "Who is Apollos . . . Paul? (mere) ministers (a lowly word appropriate here, servants), by whom (not 'in whom' by whose ministrations) ye believed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God is the fountain of all your blessings, and whoever may have been the 'instrument' by whom you have believed, it is improper to regard them as, in any sense the fountain of your blessings, or to arrange yourselves under their name."
2. "The original word Œ¥ŒπŒ±ÃÅŒ∫ŒøŒΩŒøŒπ diakonoi denotes properly 'servants' in contradistinction from 'masters' and denotes those of course who are in an inferior rank of life."
3. "This idea, that all the gifts and graces which Christians had, were to be traced to God alone, was one which the apostle Paul often insisted on; and if this idea had been kept before the minds and hearts of all Christians, it would have prevented no small part of the contentions in the church, and the formation of no small part of the sects in the Christian world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
