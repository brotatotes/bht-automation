# 1 Corinthians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the work of planting and watering, the ones who labor hold no significance compared to God, who is the giver of growth. The efforts of ministers and believers are indispensable, but only within the framework of God's providence. Without God's intervention and the work of the Holy Spirit, their labor would be fruitless. It is important to recognize that ministers are nothing apart from the abilities bestowed upon them by God, and He deserves all the glory for the increase that He alone grants.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In 1 Corinthians 3:7, it is made clear that the one who plants and waters is insignificant compared to God, who is the ultimate source of growth. The role of ministers and believers is essential in God's providence, just as the farmer's efforts are necessary for a harvest. However, their agency is of no importance when compared to God, who must give the increase. Ministers are not to be exalted above their place or regarded as having any power of their own, for it is only through God's will and the efficacy of the Holy Spirit that their labor can bear fruit. Ultimately, it is God who deserves all the glory for the growth and salvation of souls.
