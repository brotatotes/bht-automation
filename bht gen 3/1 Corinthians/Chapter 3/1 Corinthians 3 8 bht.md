# 1 Corinthians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ministers of the Gospel have a shared service but bear individual responsibility for the outcomes of their own labor. While they are one in their ministry, each minister's work is distinct and they will receive their own reward from God based on their efforts. The planting and watering of the Gospel are interdependent, and God will bestow a certain and adequate reward commensurate with their labor, regardless of the gratitude or ingratitude of others.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are united in reference to the same work. Though they are engaged in different things - for planting and watering are different kinds of work, yet it is one in regard to the end to be gained." 
2. "Their work is one, because one is as necessary as the other. If the grain was not planted there would be no use in pouring water there; if not watered, there would be no use in planting."
3. "The word 'reward' Î¼Î¹ÏƒÎ¸Î¿Ì€Î½ misthon denotes properly that which is given by contract for service rendered; an equivalent in value for services or for kindness... In regard to the righteous, it does not imply merit, or that they deserve heaven; but it means that God will render to them that which, according to the terms of his new covenant, he has promised, and which shall be a fit expression of his acceptance of their services."

### John Calvin:
1. "They are one...their connection does not allow of any separation, because all ought to have one end in view, and they serve one Lord, and are engaged in the same work."
2. "Here we have a beautiful passage for exhorting ministers to concord...employ themselves faithfully in cultivating the Lordâ€™s field, they will maintain unity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one, co-operating to one end."
2. "Each has his own sphere in it, his own gifts for it, his own success in it, his own reward for it."
3. "O how ought this to cheer the faithful labourer, who may be but moderately gifted, may be placed in a remote and uninviting part of the field, may have to fight with many obstacles and sore discouragements, and may live to see but little fruit of his best labour!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If no one planted, the watering would be useless. If no one watered, the planting would come to naught." 
2. "God will bestow to each the reward that his labour deserves."
3. "The due reward from God is certain and it will be adequate however ungrateful men may be."

### John Gill:
1. "Now he that planteth, and he that watereth are one,.... Not in every respect so; they were different as men, they were not the same individual persons, nor in the same office; Paul was an apostle, Apollos only a preacher of the Gospel; nor had they the same measure of gifts, nor did they labour alike, or were of the same usefulness; but they had one and the same commission to preach the Gospel; and the Gospel they preached was the same; and so were their views, aims, and ends, which were the glory of God, and the good of immortal souls; and they had the same love and affection for one another; they were one in their work, judgment, and affection; and which carries in it a strong reason and argument why the members of this church should not contend and divide about them:"
2. "and every man shall receive his own reward; either from men, that double honour he is worthy of, maintenance and respect; or rather from God, not a reward of debt, for his labours are by no means meritorious of anything at the hands of God, from whom he has all the grace, strength, and abilities he labours with; but of grace, even the reward of the inheritance, because he serves the Lord Christ; which is by bequest, through the death of the testator, and common to all the children of God, and heirs of glory:"
3. "according to his own labour; and not another's; and not according to the success of it, but according to that itself; not that that is the measure of the reward, for the reward infinitely exceeds it; but is that to which God has graciously annexed the promise of the reward, as an encouragement to it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Though their labors are different, they are all employed in one general work - the saving of souls."
2. "He who labors much, though with small success, shall have a great reward."
3. "The ministers are still surely instruments in God's hand, and depend as entirely as ever on his blessing, to give the increase to their labors."
