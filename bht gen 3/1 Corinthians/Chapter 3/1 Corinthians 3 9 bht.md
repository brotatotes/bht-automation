# 1 Corinthians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is the major partner in the enterprise of each life, but he lets us work with him as his fellow-laborers. He is the proprietor of the field, the occupier of it, the husbandman who breaks up the fallow ground of the hearts of his people. We are God's co-workers, carrying out his plans and laboring in common with him as we build his kingdom. Let us never forget that God sees and cares about the work we do for him in the part of the building where we are assigned.

2. "Building is a new image introduced here, as suited better than that of husbandry, to set forth the different kinds of teaching and their results, which he is now about to discuss."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "That man, accordingly, is mistaken who looks to men, or depends merely on their remuneration."
2. "It corresponds admirably with the Apostleâ€™s design to understand him to mean, that, while it is peculiarly the work of God to build his temple, or cultivate his vineyard, he calls forth ministers to be fellow-laborers, by means of whom He alone works; but, at the same time, in such a way, that they in their turn labor in common with him."

3. "Believers in a church state are God's house, in which he dwells, and which he himself has built; he has laid the foundation, which is Jesus Christ."
