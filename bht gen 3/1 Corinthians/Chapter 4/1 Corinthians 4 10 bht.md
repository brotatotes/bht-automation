# 1 Corinthians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How different our lot from yours! We, the apostles, are seen as foolish for the sake of Christ, while you Corinthians have grown wise and honorable in the eyes of the world. But we, on account of our connection with Christ, only experience the lowest ignominy and are despised. Our weakness and lack of worldly rhetoric have made us fools in the world's eyes, as we know and preach nothing but Christ.

- Attempt 1 BHT: How different our lot from yours! We, the apostles, are seen as foolish for the sake of Christ, while you Corinthians have grown wise and honorable in the eyes of the world. You have made your Christianity a means to worldly greatness, using your union with Christ as the basis for your worldly wisdom. But we, on account of our connection with Christ, only experience the lowest ignominy and are despised. Our weakness and lack of worldly rhetoric have made us fools in the world's eyes, as we know and preach nothing but Christ. This irony exposes the absurdity of your desire to be seen as wise and honorable while we are pitied for our connection with Christ.
