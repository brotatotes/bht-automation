# 1 Corinthians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How enviable it is to be esteemed wise and honorable! You Corinthians boast of your wisdom, your worldly greatness, and your full participation in Christ. But we, the apostles, are to be regarded as fools for Christ's sake. Our connection with Christ entails on us the lowest ignominy, reducing us to be nothing but fools in the world's eyes. While you make your Christianity a means to your worldly glory, we know and preach nothing but Christ.
