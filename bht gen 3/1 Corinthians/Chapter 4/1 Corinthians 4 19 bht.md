### John Calvin:

2. "We ought not to promise anything to others as to the future...without adding this limitation in so far as the Lord will permit."

1. "But I will come to you shortly... with this condition, if the Lord will... though it is not absolutely necessary that this should be expressed by us always in so many words; though should it, as the sentence is short and full, there would be no impropriety in it; yet this should always be the sense of our minds and conduct in all the affairs of life." 
2. "and will know not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power; meaning chiefly the false teachers; and that his concern would be, not so much to observe their masterly language... but what life there was in their ministry, what power went forth with their words, and how effectual their preaching was to the, conversion of sinners, and the edifying of the church of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "He here shows his fatherly authority."
2. "Not the big, empty speech of these vain boasters."
3. "But how much of the power of God attends them."
