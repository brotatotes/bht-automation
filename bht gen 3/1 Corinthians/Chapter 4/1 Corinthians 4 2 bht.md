# 1 Corinthians 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faithfulness is essential for stewards, whether in earthly matters or in serving as God's steward. While stewards on earth are subject to investigation, God's steward does not await judgment from man but from the Lord's coming. Hence, fidelity is the fundamental requirement in all human relationships, demanding honesty and trustworthiness in handling responsibilities. The emphasis is on serving the Lord, not seeking the approval or glory of men. It is not sufficient to merely hold the position of a steward; one must display upright stewardship and a genuine devotion to serving God and advancing Christ's kingdom.
