# 1 Corinthians 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of God is not about empty words, but about the manifest power of the Spirit. It is a kingdom being prepared on earth, received by believers, and will be consummated when Christ returns. Teachers and preachers should not rely on empty boasting or elegant speeches, but on the internal power of the Holy Spirit. It is not enough to rest in outward gracefulness, but to depend on the power of God ruling the heart. The true essence of the kingdom is found in the power of God, not in mere words.
