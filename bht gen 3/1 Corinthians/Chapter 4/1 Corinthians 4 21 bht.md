2. "By the term rod, he means that severity with which a pastor ought to correct his peopleâ€™s faults. He places in contrast with this, love, and the spirit of meekness â€” not, as though the father hated the sons whom he chastises, for on the contrary the chastisement proceeds from love..."

2. "By which is meant not excommunication, which is what belongs to a whole community, and not any single person; but a power of inflicting punishment on the bodies of delinquents, by smiting with diseases, and even with death itself..."

### John Wesley:
1. With a rod â€” That is, with severity.
