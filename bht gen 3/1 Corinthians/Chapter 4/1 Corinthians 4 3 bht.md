Paul emphasizes that the judgment of man pales in comparison to God's judgment. Ultimately, he affirms that it is the Lord who will judge his faithfulness.

2. "In this manner the Prophets of old, having to do with refractory persons, and such as had the audacity to despise the word of God in their administration of it, required to raise themselves aloft, in order to tread under foot that diabolical obstinacy, which manifestly tended to overthrow at once the authority of God and the light of truth."
3. "As, however, it were very absurd to reject all kinds of judgment, whether of individuals respecting themselves, or of one individual respecting his brother, or of all together respecting their pastor, let it be understood that Paul speaks here not of the actions of men, which may be reckoned good or bad according to the word of the Lord, but of the eminence of each individual, which ought not to be estimated according to menâ€™s humors."
