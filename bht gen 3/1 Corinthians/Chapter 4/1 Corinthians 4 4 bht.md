# 1 Corinthians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I know nothing against myself... I am conscious to myself of no unfaithfulness. Yet, this is not a statement of fact, but rather an acknowledgment of my own limitations. Failure to be aware of my own sins does not mean I am innocent, as I am not the judge of myself. The one who judges me is the Lord, who sees and knows all. Therefore, I rely on His judgment and His promise of mercy, rather than my own perception of righteousness.
