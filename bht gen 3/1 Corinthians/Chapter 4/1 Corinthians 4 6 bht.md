# 1 Corinthians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not attach yourselves to and be proud of any party leaders, one against another, for this would be improper and divisive within the church. Instead, learn from the example of Paul and Apollos to not go beyond what is written in Scripture. Revere the silence of Holy Writ and do not exceed in your estimation of yourselves or others. Humility is key in ensuring that no one is puffed up or looks down upon their neighbor. Remember that all of us are on a level, as brethren in Christ, and should not think of men above what is written.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I have taken out two names as samples, that you may not attach yourselves to and be proud of any party leaders, one against another."
2. "Not above those things which are written...not to exceed in your estimate of yourselves and us, the standard of Scripture."
3. "That you may not adhere together in parties to the detriment or disparagement of a neighbour who is attached to a different party."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident from 1 Corinthians 1:12-13, that there were parties in the church at Corinth that were called by the names of Paul, and Apollos, and Peter; and Paul‚Äôs design here was to show the impropriety of this by mentioning himself, Apollos, and Peter, and thus by transferring the whole discussion from inferior teachers and leaders to show the impropriety of it." 
2. "But this would have been invidious and indelicate. It would have excited their anger. He therefore says that he had transferred it all to himself and Apollos; and it implied that if it were improper to split themselves up into factions with them as leaders, much more was it improper to follow others; that is, it was improper to form parties at all in the church." 
3. "That no one be proud or exalted in self-estimation above his neighbor. That no one be disposed to look upon others with contempt, and to seek to depress and humble them. They should regard themselves as brethren, and as all on a level."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I have in a figure transferred. Here the fashion in which Paul expresses himself." 
2. "Not to go beyond the things which are written. The impersonal it is written is commonly used of Old - Testament references." 
3. "Be puffed up. Used only by Paul in Corinthians and Colossians."

### John Calvin:
1. "I have, for the sake of example, transferred these things to myself and Apollos, in order that you may transfer this example to yourselves."
2. "Learn then in us, that is, in that example which I have placed before you in our person as in a mirror; or, 'Learn in you,' that is, 'apply this example to yourselves.'"
3. "Pride or haughtiness is the cause and commencement of all contentions, when every one, assuming to himself more than he is entitled to do, is eager to have others in subjection to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Putting ourselves forward merely as illustrations of great principles applicable to all"
2. "That in us ye might learn not to go beyond the things which are written"
3. "Not to go beyond the things which are written (in such places as Jeremiah 9:23-24)"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul's use of the word (in Paul only in N.T.) appears also further in 2 Corinthians 11:13-15 where the word occurs three times, twice of the false apostles posing and passing as apostles of Christ and ministers of righteousness, and once of Satan as an angel of light, twice with ŒµŒπœÇ and once with œâœÇ."
2. "The article œÑŒø is in the accusative case as the object of the verb ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑŒµ (learn) and points at the words "ŒúŒ∑ œÖœÄŒµœÅ Œ± Œ≥ŒµŒ≥œÅŒ±œÄœÑŒ±," apparently a proverb or rule, and elliptical in form with no principal verb expressed with ŒºŒ∑, whether "think" (Auth.) or "go" (Revised)."
3. "œÜœÖœÉŒπŒøœÖœÉŒ∏Œµ... is present indicative with ŒπŒΩŒ± like Œ∂Œ∑ŒªŒøœÖœÑŒµ in Galatians 4:17 (cf. ŒπŒΩŒ± Œ≥ŒπŒΩœâœÉŒ∫ŒøŒºŒµŒΩ in 1 John 5:20) or the present subjunctive by irregular contraction (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 203, 342f.), probably the present indicative. Œ¶œÖœÉŒπŒøœâ is from œÜœÖœÉŒπœÇ (nature) and so meant to make natural, but it is used by Paul just like œÜœÖœÉŒ±œâ or œÜœÖœÉŒπŒ±œâ (from œÜœÖœÉŒ±, a pair of bellows), a vivid picture of self-conceit."

### John Gill:
1. "I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos these things; that he had 'brought these comparisons', as the Arabic version reads it, concerning himself and Apollos; namely, that one was a planter, and another a waterer; that they were both labourers and builders, ministers or servants, and stewards."
2. "That ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written: meaning, either in the word of God in general; or in some particular passages of Scripture he might have respect to; or rather in the above places in this, and the foregoing chapter, where he gives the fore mentioned characters of ministers."
3. "That no one of you be puffed up for one against the other; speak great swelling words of vanity, and envy, for one minister against another; when they are all one, bear the same character, are in the same office, and are jointly concerned in the same common cause of Christ and the good of immortal souls."

### John Wesley:
1. "I have by a very obvious figure transferred to myself and Apollos - And Cephas, instead of naming those particular preachers at Corinth, to whom ye are so fondly attached."
2. "From what has been said concerning us, who, however eminent we are, are mere instruments in God's hand."
3. "Not to think of any man above what is here written - Or above what scripture warrants."
