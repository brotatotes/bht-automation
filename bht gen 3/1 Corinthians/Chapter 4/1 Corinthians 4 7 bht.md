# 1 Corinthians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not boast or think yourself superior, for all that you have comes from God. Your gifts and graces are not self-acquired or self-bestowed, but from the Giver. Let go of self-conceit and recognize that any superiority rests on the notion of self-acquired greatness. Remember that God is the one who distinguishes and makes a difference among his people. So, deflate the inflated bag of false pride and humbly acknowledge that all that is worthy of praise is derived from God's grace.
