# 1 Corinthians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this troubling scenario within the Corinthian church, the term used universally highlights the disgraceful nature of the marriage relationship in question. It is astounding that the church authorities allowed such an egregious case to go unaddressed. This form of fornication is so severe that it is not even practiced among unbelievers, indicating that the woman involved may not be a Christian. These Corinthians are engaging in behavior even more immoral than that of the very heathens they seek to convert. Expulsion, as suggested by Paul previously, seems appropriate for such offenders.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In 1 Corinthians 5:1, we see a grave situation unfolding within the Corinthian church. The word used here universally signifies a marriage relationship, highlighting the disgrace even more explicitly. It is astonishing that the authorities in the church would allow such a case to escape their attention. This form of fornication is so gross that it is not even practiced among the heathen, which suggests that the woman involved may have been a non-believer. This connection is referred to as fornication, and both Christian and Gentile laws would have condemned such a marriage. The Corinthians were engaged in loose living that even surpassed the behavior of the heathens in their midst. Expulsion, as Paul had previously urged in 2 Thessalonians 3:6, seems appropriate for such offenders.
