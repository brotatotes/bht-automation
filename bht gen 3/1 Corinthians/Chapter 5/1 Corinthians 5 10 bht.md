# 1 Corinthians 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are not to completely isolate ourselves from the sinful world but exercise caution in our associations. Although it would be impractical to avoid all fornicators and idolaters in the unbelieving world, we are called to refrain from being companions with them or being corrupted by their behavior. The combination of covetousness and idolatry with fornication and idolatry may seem strange, but Paul groups them together as works of the flesh. We should limit our contact to what is necessary and safe while still fulfilling our responsibilities in the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As in dissolute Corinth to 'company with no fornicators,' c., would be almost to company with none in the (unbelieving) world."
2. "Ye need not utterly ('altogether') forego intercourse with fornicators, c., of the unbelieving world."
3. "The attempt to get 'out of the world,' in violation of God's will that believers should remain in it but keep themselves from its evil, led to monasticism and its consequent evils."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You are not to make them companions and friends."
2. "You are not so to associate with them as to be corrupted by their example."
3. "We are not so to associate with them as to be led by that example to neglect prayer and the sanctuary, and the deeds of charity, and the effort to do good to the souls of people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Idolaters [ŒµŒπŒ¥œâŒªŒøŒªŒ±œÑœÅŒ±ŒπœÇ] . Only twice outside of Paul 's writings : Revelation 21:8; Revelation 22:15. This is the earliest known instance of the use of the word."
2. "For the collocation of the covetous and idolaters, compare Colossians 3:15; Ephesians 5:5."
3. "New - Testament usage does not confine the term to the worship of images, but extends it to the soul 's devotion to any object which usurps the place of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "You must rather die." 
2. "We must live among thorns so long as we sojourn on earth."
3. "There is a sort of intentional omission, when he says that he makes no mention of those that are without, inasmuch as the Corinthians ought to be already separated from them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Observe the caution 'not altogether' restricting the allowed intercourse with them to what was necessary and safe."
2. "The collocation of 'the covetous and extortioners' with 'fornicators and idolaters' sounds strange to us; but it is a favourite classification with our apostle."
3. "Perhaps the explanation of this may be found in Galatians 5:19-21, where these are all ranked under the head of 'works of the flesh,' any one of which might, according to individual bent, stir up another."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not absolutely, not in all circumstances. Paul thus puts a limitation on his prohibition and confines it to members of the church."
 
2. "The covetous...always comes in bad company like the modern gangsters who form a combination of liquor, lewdness, lawlessness for money and power."
3. "Bandits, hijackers, grafters they would be called today."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the fornicators of this world' are meant, such as were guilty of this sin, who were the men of the world, mere worldly carnal men, who were never called out of it, or ever professed to be; in distinction from those that were in the church, that had committed this iniquity."
2. "The apostle‚Äôs sense is, that his former prohibition of keeping company with fornicators was not to be understood as referring to such persons as were, out of the church, as if no sort of civil conversation and commerce were to be had with men of such, and the like infamous characters; or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters: that is, of this world; for this clause is to be understood of each of these."
3. "It is an hyperbolical way of speaking, showing that the thing is impracticable and impossible, since men of this sort are everywhere; and were all trade and conversation with them to be forbidden, the families of God‚Äôs people could never be supported, nor the interest of religion maintained; a stop would soon be put to worldly business, and saints would have little or nothing to do in the world."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I did not mean that you should altogether refrain from conversing with heathens, though they are guilty in some of these respects."
2. "Covetous, rapacious, idolaters ‚Äî Sinners against themselves, their neighbour, God."
3. "For then ye must go out of the world ‚Äî Then all civil commerce must cease. So that going out of the world, which some account a perfection, St. Paul accounts an utter absurdity."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: As Christians, we are called to be in the world but not of it. In the corrupt city of Corinth, it would be impossible to avoid all fornicators and idolaters, as they were prevalent in the unbelieving world. However, we are not to be companions with them or be influenced by their behavior. The conjunction of covetousness and idolatry with fornication and idolatry may seem unusual, but Paul classifies them together as manifestations of fleshly works. While we are to refrain from close association with unbelievers who engage in these sins, it is not a call to isolate ourselves completely. We should exercise caution and limit our contact to what is necessary and safe, keeping ourselves from being corrupted while still fulfilling our responsibilities in the world.
