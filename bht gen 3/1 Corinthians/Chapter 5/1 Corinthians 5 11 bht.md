## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "my meaning was....;â€” â€˜but, the case being so, that ye must needs consort with fornicators among the heathen, I wrote to you, not to consort, &c.â€™" 
2. "an idolater] One who from any motive makes a compromise with the habits of the heathen, and partakes in their sacrifices"
3. "Seeing that no not to eat must imply a more complete separation than not to company, it cannot be applied to the agape, or love-feasts only, but must keep its general meaning,â€”not even to sit at table with such an one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Now" does not express time, but "the case being so," namely, that to avoid fornicators, etc., of the world, you would have to leave the world altogether, which would be absurd.
2. Here, as in Ephesians 5:3, "covetousness" is joined with "fornication": the common fount of both being "the fierce and ever fiercer longing of the creature, which has turned from God, to fill itself with the inferior objects of sense."
3. The Corinthians did not fall into open idolatry, but ate things offered to idols, so making a compromise with the heathen; just as they connived at fornication.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not to keep company - To be wholly separated and withdrawn from such a person. Not to associate with him in any manner."
2. "To have no contact or fellowship with him of any kind; not to do anything that would seem to acknowledge him as a brother; with such an one not even to eat at the same table."
3. "But as neighbors and relatives; as those who may be in distress and want, we are assuredly not forbidden to show toward them the offices of kindness and compassion."

### John Calvin:
1. "If any one is reckoned a brother among you, and at the same time leads a wicked life, and such as is unbecoming a Christian, keep aloof from his society."
2. "Paul declares that such persons ought not to be tolerated in the society of Christians; and not without good reason, inasmuch as they made so little account of trampling Godâ€™s glory under foot."
3. "When, therefore, the Church has excommunicated any one, no believer ought to receive him into terms of intimacy with him; otherwise the authority of the Church would be brought into contempt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I did it before in a general way, but 'now' I do it more fully." 
2. "Not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother one in full standing as a member."
3. "With such a one, no, not to eat in friendly meals, or any way implying brotherly recognition."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As it is (when you read it) I did write unto you."
2. "For the verb see 1 Corinthians 4:12."
3. "Social contacts with such 'a brother' are forbidden."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle's meaning is, that in his prohibition of keeping company with men...he would be understood of such persons as were called brethren...who might be mentioned by name, as notoriously guilty of fornication, covetousness, idolatry, and extortion."
2. "...such persons remaining impenitent and incorrigible, still persisting, in such a vicious course of life, after due admonition given them, were not only to be removed from their religious society, from the communion of the church, and be debarred sitting down, and eating with them at the Lord's table, or at their love feasts, but also were to be denied civil conversation and familiarity with them..."
3. "Partly for vindicating the honour of religion, and preventing the stumbling of the weak; and partly to make such offenders ashamed, and bring them to repentance."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who is named a brother, that is, a Christian; especially if a member of the same congregation."
2. "Rapacious, guilty of oppression, extortion, or any open injustice."
3. "No, not to eat with him, which is the lowest degree of familiarity."
