## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That this is the meaning, and not, as A.V., ‚ÄòBut now I have written, &c., seems plain; I have given the reasons in my note in the Greek Test."
2. "One who from any motive makes a compromise with the habits of the heathen, and partakes in their sacrifices: Chrysostom well remarks, 'He introduces by anticipation the subject of things offered to idols, which he is about to treat by and by.'"
3. "Seeing that no not to eat must imply a more complete separation than not to company, it cannot be applied to the agape, or love-feasts only, but must keep its general meaning,‚Äînot even to sit at table with such an one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Now" does not express time, but "the case being so," namely, that to avoid fornicators, etc. of the world, you would have to leave the world altogether, which would be absurd. So "now" is used in Hebrews 11:16. Thus we avoid making the apostle now retract a command which he had before given.
2. There is less danger in associating with open worldlings than with carnal professors. Here, as in Ephesians 5:3 Ephesians 5:5, "covetousness" is joined with "fornication": the common fount of both being "the fierce and ever fiercer longing of the creature, which has turned from God, to fill itself with the inferior objects of sense."
3. Not to sit at the same table with such whether at the love-feasts (agap√¶) or in private intercourse, much more at the Lord's table.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not to keep company - To be wholly separated and withdrawn from such a person. Not to associate with him in any manner."
2. "A railer - A reproachful man; a man of coarse, harsh, and bitter words; a man whose characteristic it was to abuse others; to vilify their character, and wound their feelings."
3. "To have no contact or fellowship with him of any kind; not to do anything that would seem to acknowledge him as a brother; with such an one not even to eat at the same table."

### John Calvin:
1. "If any one is reckoned a brother among you, and at the same time leads a wicked life, and such as is unbecoming a Christian, keep aloof from his society."
2. "Paul declares that such persons ought not to be tolerated in the society of Christians; and not without good reason, inasmuch as they made so little account of trampling God‚Äôs glory under foot."
3. "When, therefore, the Church has excommunicated any one, no believer ought to receive him into terms of intimacy with him; otherwise the authority of the Church would be brought into contempt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I write onto you I did it before in a general way, but 'now' I do it more fully." 
2. "Not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother . . . be a fornicator."
3. "With such a one, no, not to eat in friendly meals, or any way implying brotherly recognition."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If any man that is named a brother be (ŒµŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒπœÇ Œ±Œ¥ŒµŒªœÜŒøœÇ ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œ∂ŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ Œ∑). Condition of the third class, a supposable case." 
2. "ŒúŒµŒ∏œÖœÉŒøœÇ is an old Greek word for women and even men (cf. œÄŒ±œÅŒøŒπŒΩŒøœÇ, of men, 1 Timothy 3:3). In N.T. only here and 1 Corinthians 6:10. Cf. Romans 13:13."
3. "With such a one, no, not to eat (œÑœâ œÑŒøŒπŒøœÖœÑœâ ŒºŒ∑Œ¥Œµ œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÉŒ∏ŒπŒµŒπŒΩ). Associative instrumental case of œÑŒøŒπŒøœÖœÑœâ after œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÉŒ∏ŒπŒµŒπŒΩ, 'not even to eat with such a one.' Social contacts with such 'a brother' are forbidden."

### John Gill:
1. "In his prohibition of keeping company with men of the above character, he would be understood of such persons as were called brethren; who had been received into the church, and had been looked upon, and had professed themselves to be such."
2. "And even not suffered to eat common food at the same table with them: which though lawful to be used with the men of the world, yet for some reasons were not advisable to be used with such."
3. "Partly for vindicating the honour of religion, and preventing the stumbling of the weak; and partly to make such offenders ashamed, and bring them to repentance."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who is named a brother ‚Äî That is, a Christian; especially if a member of the same congregation."
2. "Rapacious ‚Äî Guilty of oppression, extortion, or any open injustice."
3. "No, not to eat with him ‚Äî Which is the lowest degree of familiarity."
