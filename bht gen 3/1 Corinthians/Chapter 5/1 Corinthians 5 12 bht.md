# 1 Corinthians 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For what concern have I with pronouncing sentence on the world without, or with giving rules of discipline for them? My judgment was meant to lead your judgment. This being the case, what concern had I with those without? Is it not on those within, that your judgments are passed? You might have easily understood that my concern is not with unbelievers outside the Church, but that I referred to those within it. Those within give me enough to do without those outside. God shall judge them that are without: do you look at home.

- Attempt 5 BHT: As an apostle, my concern is not with passing judgment on those outside the Church, but with those within it. God will judge those who are outside. It is the responsibility of the Christian community to judge and discipline its own members. We have the power to exercise this judgment and discipline for those who belong to the household of God.
