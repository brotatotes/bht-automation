## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was a delegation to the Corinthian church of a special power, reserved to the Apostles themselves, of inflicting corporeal death or disease as a punishment for sin."
 
2. "The congregation itself could expel from among themselves,â€”but it could not give over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, without the authorized concurrence of the Apostleâ€™s spirit, with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ."
 
3. "What the destruction of his flesh was to be, does not appear: certainly more than the mere destruction of his pride and lust by repentance, as some suppose: rather, as Chrysostom suggests, 'that Satan might afflict him with a malignant ulcer, or other disease.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christâ€”By His authority and as representing His person and will."
2. "Christ's power was promised to be present with HIS Church 'gathered together in His name.'"
3. "This power of infallible judgment was limited to the apostles; for they alone had the power of working miracles as their credentials to attest their infallibility."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea is, that the authority to administer discipline is derived from the Lord Jesus Christ, and is to be exercised in his name, and to promote his honor."
2. "This passage proves that discipline belongs to the church itself; and so deep was Paulâ€™s conviction of this, that even he would not administer it, without their concurrence and action."
3. "The word 'power' is used commonly in the New Testament to denote some miraculous and extraordinary power; and here evidently means that the Lord Jesus would put forth such a power in the infliction of pain and for the preservation of the purity of his church."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, though an Apostle, does not himself, as an individual, excommunicate according to his own pleasure, but consults with the Church, that the matter may be transacted by common authority."
2. "Let us take notice, then, that in excommunicating this limitation be observed â€” that this part of discipline be exercised by the common counsel of the elders, and with the consent of the people, and that this is a remedy in opposition to tyranny."
3. "He adds, with the power of our Lord, for if the promise is true, 'As often as two or three are gathered together in my name, I am in the midst of them,' it follows, that whatever is done in such an assembly is a work of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "It would be done 'in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ'; by his command, power, and authority, and for his glory."
2. "To be witness of this wonderful operation, to acknowledge the justice of God in it, and that they might fear and take warning by it."
3. "The extraordinary gift of the Spirit of God bestowed on him would be visibly exercised upon this man before them all, as if he himself was in the midst of them; and this not by any power of his own, but with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. And my spirit â€” Present with you.
With the power of the Lord Jesus Christ â€” To confirm my sentence.
