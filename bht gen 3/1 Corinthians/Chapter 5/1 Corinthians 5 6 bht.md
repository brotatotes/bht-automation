# 1 Corinthians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your glorying in your own righteousness while tolerating such wickedness is far from good. Are you not aware that one scandalous member tainted the character of the whole church? A little sin, like a little leaven, spreads and corrupts the entire community. Your boasting is unseemly when there is a cancerous spot within your midst.
