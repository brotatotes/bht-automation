# 1 Corinthians 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a lost letter to the Corinthians, Paul had cautioned them against associating with covetous individuals and extortioners, emphasizing the importance of refraining from close and habitual contact with such people. The command not to company with fornicators highlights the need for believers to exercise caution in their relationships, as maintaining intimate connections with those involved in immoral activities can bring disrepute to the faith. Discernment is crucial, as believers should limit their close interactions with individuals whose behavior goes against God's standards.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I wrote unto you in my letter (not this present epistle,â€”for there is nothing in the preceding part of this Epistle which can by any possibility be so interpreted."
2. "but, a former epistle, which has not come down to us."
3. "covetous and extortioners are joined by and, as belonging to the same classâ€”that of persons greedy of money."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That Paul does not refer to the present letter is proved by the fact that no direction 'not to company with fornicators' occurs in the previous part of it."
2. "His letters (plural; not applying to merely one) confirm this."
3. "Paul probably wrote a former brief reply to inquiries of the Corinthians: our first Epistle, as it enters more fully into the same subject, has superseded the former, which the Holy Spirit did not design for the guidance of the Church in general, and which therefore has not been preserved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not true that Paul had in any former part of this Epistle given this direction. He had commanded them to remove an incestuous person, and such a command might seem to imply that they ought not to keep company with such a person; but it was not a general command not to have contact with them." 
2. "It is altogether probable that Paul would write more letters than we have preserved. We have but fourteen of his remaining. Yet he labored many years; founded many churches; and had frequent occasion to write to them." 
3. "If it be objected that this may affect the doctrine of the inspiration of the New Testament, since it is not to be supposed that God would suffer the writings of inspired men to be lost, we may reply... It does not prove that these are not from God. If a man loses a guinea it does not prove that those which he has not lost are counterfeit or worthless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reference is probably to a former letter now lost."
2. "To company [ÏƒÏ…Î½Î±Î½Î±Î¼Î¹Î³Î½Ï…ÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹] : Only here and 2 Thessalonians 3:14."
3. "It denotes, therefore, not only close, but habitual, intercourse."

### John Calvin:
1. "He reminds the Corinthians of what he had already enjoined upon them â€” that they should refrain from intercourse with the wicked." 
2. "Let all that wish to be reckoned brethren, either live holily and becomingly, or be excommunicated from the society of the pious, and let all the good refrain from intercourse and familiarity with them." 
3. "This exception, however, increases the criminality of remissness, inasmuch as they cherished in the bosom of the Church an openly wicked person; for it is more disgraceful to neglect those of your own household than to neglect strangers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What Epistle is here referred to?... The only alternative is, that there is here a reference to some previously-written letter to that church not now preserved." 
2. "Nor is this unworthy of Inspiration, as is evident from the Old Testament prophetic writings, which are very far from containing all that the prophets uttered by inspiration."
3. "Certain it is that the Corinthians sent written questions to the apostle on points of practical difficulty, and even on this very subject (1 Corinthians 7:1); and if one of these related to what intercourse, if any, they should keep up with their heathen friends and fellow-citizens, and a messenger was then going to Corinth who could take his answer, how naturally might he send a hasty reply by him, with the promise to write more fully thereafter!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I wrote unto you in my epistle. Not the epistolary aorist, but a reference to an epistle to the Corinthians earlier than this one, one not preserved to us."
2. "To have no company with fornicators. It is a pertinent question today how far modern views try to put a veneer over the vice in men and women."
3. "What a 'find' it would be if a bundle of papyri in Egypt should give it back to us?"

### John Gill:
1. "No doubt the apostle wrote other epistles to the Corinthians, besides those that are in being; nor does such a supposition at all detract from the perfection of Scripture."
2. "This prohibition does not regard unclean copulation, or a joining with them in the sin of fornication, they had been used to in a state of unregeneracy, for some sort of companying with fornicators is allowed of in the next verse; whereas no degree of a sinful mixture with them would ever be tolerated."
3. "It is to be understood of a civil society and familiar conversation with them; which might bring a reproach upon religion, be a stumbling to weak Christians, and be of dangerous consequence to themselves and others."

### John Wesley:
1. "I wrote to you in a former epistle â€” And, doubtless, both St. Paul and the other apostles wrote many things which are not extant now."
2. "Not to converse â€” Familiarly; not to contract any intimacy or acquaintance with them, more than is absolutely necessary."
