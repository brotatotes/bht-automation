# 1 Corinthians 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In addressing the issue of Christians seeking justice from unbelievers, the apostle urges them to settle their disputes within the Christian community. By using the word Dare, he emphasizes the insult to the majesty of the Christian name when resorting to pagan magistrates. Instead, Christians should rely on godly judges to resolve their differences, reflecting the principles of grace and holiness. Seeking justice from the ungodly is futile, as Christians should not expect fairness from those who do not regard God as the Supreme Judge.
