- Attempt 1 BHT: Our bodies are destined for a higher purpose, to be raised up by the power of God just as He raised the Lord Jesus Christ. The future resurrection is the assurance of our dignity and destiny, a truth that should guide us in our conduct. It is unseemly and base to defile our bodies with sensuality and fornication when they are meant to partake in the heavenly glory and immortality. Let us remember that our union with the risen Savior calls us to a higher standard, to purity and holiness, for the resurrection of the body gives great weight to Paul's argument. It is through the power of God that we, along with Christ, will be raised up, and this should shape our behavior and compel us to honor and respect our bodies.
