# 1 Corinthians 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our bodies, destined to be raised up with the body of Christ, bear the weight of a higher purpose that is incompatible with sexual immorality. The resurrection of the body highlights the dignity and destiny bestowed upon it, and it is unworthy of our connection with the pure Savior and our hope for perfect and immortal purity. As God raised the Lord Jesus Christ and will raise us through His power, let us not defile our bodies but honor their consecration to Christ and the blessed immortality that awaits us.
