# 1 Corinthians 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our bodies, as members of Christ's mystical Body, are intimately connected to the Lord Himself. It is a fact, both certain and mysterious, that moral and spiritual ruin is caused by using Christ's members for immoral purposes. The union between a man and a woman confers a double personality, and engaging in fornication in an immoral manner brings about this result. Deliberately taking members of Christ and making them members of a harlot in an actual union is shocking and should never happen. May it not be so!

3. "Otherwise the hope of a resurrection were weak, if our connection were not of that nature â€” full and complete."

### Philip Schaff:
