# 1 Corinthians 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible teaches that he that is joined to a harlot is one body. This powerful statement, spoken by Adam under God's inspiration, highlights the binding nature of sexual unions. Just as a husband and wife become one flesh, so too does the individual who engages in sexual relations with a harlot. This destructive connection, tearing away a member from Christ's body, reflects the corruption of God's intended design for holy matrimony. It is a stark reminder of the consequences and contrast between a sacred marriage and the curse of fornication.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When the Bible says, he that is joined to a harlot is one body, it is not an exaggeration or metaphorical expression. Adam, under the inspiration of God, spoke these words prophetically. The phrase he which is joined refers to the union formed through carnal intercourse, where two individuals are cemented or cleave together. These words were originally spoken in Genesis 2:24, describing the sexual union between husband and wife, and were also quoted and explained by Jesus in Matthew 19:5. Therefore, when someone engages in sexual activity with a harlot, they become one flesh with her, tearing away a member from Christ's body. This act is an accursed connection, contrary to the sacred bond of marriage, and bears no resemblance to the blessing that comes from the one-flesh union intended by God.

- Attempt 2 BHT: The Bible's statement that he that is joined to a harlot is one body is not merely a strong expression; it is a prophetic truth inspired by God Himself. This phrase refers to the union formed through carnal intercourse, a joining that is comparable to the union between a husband and wife. In Genesis, God declared that a man and his wife become one flesh, and Jesus reemphasized these words. When someone engages in sexual activity with a harlot, they become one flesh with her, a tearing away of a member from Christ's body. This act is an accursed connection, distinct from the intended blessing of a lawful marriage.

- Attempt 3 BHT: The Bible's statement that he that is joined to a harlot is one body carries profound implications. This declaration, spoken by Adam under God's inspiration, refers to the intimate union formed through carnal intercourse. In Genesis, God declared that a man and his wife become one flesh, a sentiment echoed by Jesus. Therefore, when someone engages in sexual activity with a harlot, they become one flesh with her, symbolically tearing away a member from Christ's body. This act is a grievous departure from the intended sanctity of a lawful marriage.
