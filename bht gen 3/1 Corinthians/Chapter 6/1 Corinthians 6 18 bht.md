# 1 Corinthians 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fornication is a sin against the body, alienating it from the Lord, and making it a harlot's body, violating Christ's rights in our bodies and ruining it permanently. The only safety in temptation is flight, to flee with abhorrence and all your might. Fornication leaves a stain on the body that is not found in other sins, defiling and dishonoring it, impairing its strength, health, and filling it with diseases. Therefore, we are commanded to flee from fornication and all its occasions.
