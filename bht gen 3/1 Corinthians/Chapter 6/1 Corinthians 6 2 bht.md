# 1 Corinthians 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians must be aware that as saints, they will sit in judgment with Christ over the world at His return. This truth, acknowledged by all Christians, refutes any attempts to evade its clear meaning. The saints are appointed as judges and rulers, while the world will be under their authority. Therefore, it is contradictory for the Corinthians to consider themselves unworthy of judging even the smallest matters among themselves when they are destined for such a high calling. The significance of their role in the world should outweigh any earthly disputes or tribunals.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse reminds the Corinthians that as saints, they will have the incredible responsibility of judging the world alongside Christ when He returns. This truth, universally recognized by Christians, should shape their actions and decisions. Just as the apostles will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, the saints will have the authority to sit in judgment over the world. The weightiest earthly matters pale in comparison to the importance of the judgments to be made on the day of reckoning. Therefore, it is incongruous for the Corinthians to consider themselves unworthy to judge even the smallest disputes among themselves, when they are destined for such a lofty task.

- Attempt 2 BHT: As Christians, the Corinthians should remember that they will judge the world alongside Christ at His coming.

Just as the apostles will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, the saints will have the authority to sit in judgment over the world. Thus, it is absurd for them to deem themselves unqualified to judge even the smallest matters among themselves, considering the weightiness of the judgments to be made on the final day.
