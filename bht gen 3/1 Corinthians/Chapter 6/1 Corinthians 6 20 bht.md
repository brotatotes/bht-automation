# 1 Corinthians 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we must remember that our bodies are not our own, but temples of the Holy Spirit. The blood of Christ has bought us at a great price, freeing us from punishment and giving us a new obligation to obedience. Therefore, we should glorify God in our bodies, presenting every token of our fealty to Him. By devoting ourselves wholly to His service, both inwardly and outwardly, we demonstrate our gratitude for His redemption. Let us yield our bodies and all their members, as instruments of righteousness, entirely and unreservedly to the glory of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The possession of your body as His temple, by the Holy Ghost, is a presumptive proof that ye are not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A contentious spirit, a fondness for the agitation, the excitement, and the strife of courts, is inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel." 
2. "How much better is it that I should lose a few pounds, than that my Saviour should lose his honor! How much better that my purse should be empty of glittering dust, even by the injustice of others, than that a single gem should be taken from his diadem!"
3. "May we remember that we are not our own... By a reference to the value of that blood; by all its preciousness and worth; by all the sighs, and tears, and groans that bought us; by the agonies of the cross, and the bitter pains of the death of Godâ€™s own Son, we are bound to live to God, and to him alone."

### John Calvin:
1. "The reproof therefore is this he allows that the body is subject to God no less than the soul, and that accordingly it is reasonable that both be devoted to his glory."
2. "As it is befitting that the mind of a believer should be pure, so there must be a corresponding outward profession also before men, inasmuch as the power of both is in the hands of God, who has redeemed both."
3. "We may not think that we discharge our duty to him aright if we do not devote ourselves wholly and entirely to his service, that he may by his word regulate even the outward actions of our life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Is it so? then, as the purchased property of another, ye are at no liberty to dispose of yourselves for uses of your own." 
2. "But since the subject in hand was the abuse of the body, the seeming abruptness of this way of closing the subject will be seen to give it a telling effect."
3. "It is impossible not to be struck with the contrast between the views of even the most cultivated portions of the heathen world on the subject of morality and religion and those of Christianity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For ye were bought with a price...With genitive of price."
2. "Paul holds to his high ideal of the destiny of the body and urges glorifying God in it."
3. "Paul's argument stands four-square for the dignity of the body as the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit united to the Lord Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "This proves them to be the Lord's, not only his redeemed ones, being ransomed by a price from the bondage of the law, sin, Satan, and the world; but his espoused ones."
2. "Christ, indeed, did not purchase his church to be his spouse, but because she was so; but then his purchasing of her with his blood more clearly demonstrated and confirmed his right unto her, as his spouse."
