# 1 Corinthians 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, our focus should be on matters of higher importance rather than getting caught up in disputes over earthly property. Even the lowest esteemed among us in the church have the capability to handle such matters, making it unnecessary to seek judgement from those outside the faith. Instead, let us exercise our discernment and wisdom as we are called to a higher purpose, even being destined to judge angels. We should prioritize settling our differences among fellow believers rather than involving the unbelieving world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "Let it be noticed that he is passing to ver. 7, where he insists on the impropriety of judgments in this life‚Äôs matters between Christians at all, and is here depreciating them ironically."

2. "Set [Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒπŒ∂ŒµœÑŒµ] . Seat them as judges on the tribunal. It is disputed whether kaqizete is to be taken as imperative, set (A. V.), or as interrogative, do ye set (Rev.)."
3. "Dare they, the destined judges of the world and of angels, go to law about mere earthly trifles, and that before the heathen ? Why did they not rather set up the very humblest members of the Church to act as judges in such matters?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If ye have tribunals pertaining to this life" (condition of third class, ŒµŒ±ŒΩ ŒµœáŒ∑œÑŒµ).
2. "If Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒπŒ∂ŒµœÑŒµ (do ye set) is indicative and interrogative, then by 'who are of no account in the church' (œÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒµŒæŒøœÖŒ∏ŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÖœÇ ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ ŒµŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπŒ±) Paul means the heathen as in verse 1 Corinthians 6:1."
