# 1 Corinthians 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians are warned about the fault in going to court against fellow believers, as it falls short of their privileged status as heirs of God's kingdom. Engaging in lawsuits not only undermines their spiritual growth but also damages the unity of the church in the eyes of unbelievers. Instead, they are encouraged to willingly endure personal injustice and be defrauded, putting love and forgiveness above personal gain and revenge. Suffering wrong is preferred over engaging in lawsuits that disregard the principles of love and forgiveness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He gives his own censure of their going to law at all."
2. "a fault, literally, a falling short, viz. of your inheritance of the kingdom of Godâ€”a hindrance in the way of your salvation"
3. "not, as ordinarily understood, a moral delinquency."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Your going to law at all is a falling short of your high privileges, not to say your doing so before unbelievers, which aggravates it."
2. "Rather take wrong; that is, suffer yourselves to be wronged."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They ought by no means to go with their causes against their fellow Christians before pagan magistrates; that whoever had the right side of the question, and whatever might be the decision, 'the thing itself' was unChristian and wrong; and that rather than dishonor religion by a trial or suit of this kind they ought to be willing to take wrong, and to suffer any personal and private injustice."
2. "The private wrong which an individual would suffer, in perhaps all cases, would be a less evil on the whole than the public injury which is done to the cause of piety by the litigations and strifes of Christian brethren before a civil court."
3. "The doctrine here taught is that Christians ought by no means to go to law with each other before a pagan tribunal; that they ought to be willing to suffer any injury from a Christian brother rather than do it. And by implication the same thing is taught in regard to the duty of all Christians, 'that they ought to suffer any injury to their persons and property rather than dishonor religion by litigations before civil magistrates.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is there not one wise man among you who is competent to act as an arbitrator between brethren, so that Christian brethren must needs take their differences into the civil courts and before heathen judges?"
2. "The spirit of litigation which runs into wrong and fraud is a source of damage, resulting in forfeiture of the kingdom of God and in loss of spiritual power."
3. "In the New Testament the word 'defraud' occurs five times. In Mark 10:19, 'defraud not' is apparently Mark's rendering of the tenth commandment."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those are altogether in the wrong who go to law. Hence it will not be allowable in any one to maintain his rights by having recourse to a magistrate."
2. "In this matter love will be the best regulator."
3. "I acknowledge, then, that a Christian man is altogether prohibited from revenge, so that he must not exercise it, either by himself, or by means of the magistrate, nor even desire it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. 1 Corinthians 6:7. ... Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded? like your Master, submitting to felt wrong (1 Peter 2:23; and see Matthew 5:40; Matthew 5:44; Romans 12:17; 1 Peter 2:19-20; Proverbs 20:22). 


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is defeat for Christians to have lawsuits with one another. This was proof of the failure of love and forgiveness."
2. "Better undergo wrong yourself than suffer defeat in the matter of love and forgiveness of a brother."
3. "Allow yourselves to be robbed rather than have a lawsuit."

### John Gill:
1. "It is more advisable to a believer to suffer wrong than to go to law with any man, and especially with a brother."
2. "A want of brotherly love, or there would be no occasion to go to law at all."

2. "Why do ye not rather suffer wrong - All men cannot or will not receive this saying."
3. "Many aim only at this, 'I will neither do wrong, nor suffer it.' These are honest heathens, but no Christians."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Rather than taking their disputes to court before unbelievers, the Corinthians are admonished to be willing to endure personal injustice and be defrauded by their fellow Christians. By engaging in legal battles, they are not only falling short of their privileged position as heirs of the kingdom of God, but also damaging the unity and witness of the church. The spirit of litigation and the pursuit of personal rights can lead to the forfeiture of the kingdom of God and hinder spiritual growth. Love and forgiveness should take precedence over personal gain and the desire for revenge. It is far better to suffer wrong and be defrauded than to engage in lawsuits that undermine the values of love and forgiveness.
