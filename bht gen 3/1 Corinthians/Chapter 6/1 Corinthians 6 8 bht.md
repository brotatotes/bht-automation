Instead of enduring wrong patiently as commanded by the Lord, you, on the contrary, do wrong and defraud your brethren. This is a grave offense that shows a deep depravity when one overcomes the ties of love and kindness to harm those who are near.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Instead of enduring wrong patiently and cheerfully, they were themselves guilty of injustice and fraud."
