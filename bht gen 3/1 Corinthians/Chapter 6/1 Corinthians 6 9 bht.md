# 1 Corinthians 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be deceived by plausible talk that covers up sin as mere animal behavior. Fornication was a prevalent sin in Corinth and is a reminder of the exclusion from the kingdom of God for wrongdoers. The wicked may inherit the kingdom, but only if they have repented and turned to the Lord. Allurements that encourage us in our sins are dangerous poisons, leading us away from the righteousness necessary for eternal bliss. Guard against even the smallest sins, as they are steps toward hell.
