# 1 Corinthians 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Marriage is honorable and morally salutary, but in certain cases, celibacy may be expedient for devoting oneself to the Lord. While celibacy is not wrong but good, it is important to distinguish God's pure ordinance from the punishment of sin. Balancing the advantages of a single life with the mixture of bitter and sweet consequences is crucial. Paul argues that it is better for a man to abstain if he has the gift of continency, but ultimately, one must make wise choices regarding marriage and be master of oneself.
