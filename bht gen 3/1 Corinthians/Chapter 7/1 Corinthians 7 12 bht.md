# 1 Corinthians 7:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In addressing mixed marriages with unbelievers, Paul makes it clear that his advice comes from his apostolic office and not directly from Jesus. He advises that if the unbelieving spouse is willing to continue the marriage, the believer should not seek divorce. These marriages are still valid, and the Gospel does not dissolve the natural obligations between husband and wife. Instead, the believer should demonstrate the transformative power of their faith through kindness, tenderness, and faithfulness in the marriage.
