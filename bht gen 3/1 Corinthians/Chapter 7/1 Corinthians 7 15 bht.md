# 1 Corinthians 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If an unbeliever wishes to separate from a believer, the union may be dissolved. However, if the unbeliever is content to remain in the marriage, the believer should stay for the sake of peace. Marriage should not become a form of enslavement for believers, nor should they be obligated to give up their faith to preserve the relationship. Only when the unbeliever intentionally deserts the believer can the believer be set free. Ultimately, God has called us to live in peace and should seek reconciliation if possible.

2. "A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases...being in such circumstances, that either Christ must be forsaken, or the unbeliever will depart, are they obliged to yield to such an one, but rather suffer a departure; nor are they bound to remain unmarried, but are free to marry another person..."
3. "The believing party being threatened with a desertion, ought as much as possible to seek for peace and reconciliation, and do all that can be to prevent a departure; for saints are called by the grace of God, to follow after and cultivate peace..."

- Attempt 5 BHT: When an unbeliever desires to separate from a believer, the union may be dissolved. However, believers are encouraged to remain in the marriage if the unbeliever is content to stay. It is crucial to understand that marriage should not be a form of enslavement for believers and that renouncing one's faith for the sake of the relationship is not required. Only if the unbeliever deliberately abandons the believer can the believer be set free. Therefore, as God has called us to live in peace, seeking reconciliation is essential in such situations.
