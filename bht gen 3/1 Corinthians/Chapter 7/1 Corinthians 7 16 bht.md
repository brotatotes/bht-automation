# 1 Corinthians 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse suggests that staying united in hope with an unbelieving partner might not be wise due to the uncertainty of their conversion. It is important to prioritize one's own peace and happiness as a Christian. However, if there is still the possibility of saving the unbelieving partner, it is recommended to exhaust all efforts before considering separation. While there are no guarantees, believers can have a significant impact on the spiritual and even temporal lives of their unbelieving partners.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fact is, that the verse is not a ground for remaining united, in hope, &c.,â€”but a ground for consummating a separation, and not marring the Christianâ€™s peace for so uncertain a prospect as that of converting the unbelieving party." 
2. "Hazard not for an uncertainty the peace in which you ought to be living as Christians."
3. "Or what assurance hast thou, O husband, whether thou shalt be the means of thy wifeâ€™s conversion?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What knowest thou but that by staying with thy unbelieving partner thou mayest save him or her?" 
2. "Enforcing the precept to stay with the unbelieving consort." 
3. "Or else... if thy unbelieving consort wishes to depart, let him go, so that thou mayest live 'in peace'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This object is of so much importance that the Christian should be willing to submit to much, to bear much, and to bear long, in order that it may be accomplished."
2. "It is not hopeless. Many a wife has thus been the means of saving a husband; many a husband has been the means of the salvation of the wife."
3. "Not by harshness or severity of manner, is the result to be hoped for, but by tender entreaty, and mildness of life, and by prayer."

### John Calvin:
1. "An uncertain hope ought not to detain thee...so long, therefore, as there remains any hope of doing good, and the pious wife knows not but that she may by her holy conversation bring back her husband into the way, she ought to try every means before leaving him; for so long as a manâ€™s salvation is doubtful, it becomes us to be prepared rather to hope the best."
2. "For as God acts efficaciously by his instruments which he makes use of, he does, in a manner, communicate his power to them, or, at least, he connects it with their service in such a manner, that what he does he speaks of as being done by them, and hence, too, he sometimes ascribes to them the honor which is due to himself alone."
3. "Let us, however, bear in mind, that we have nothing in our power, except in so far as we are directed by Him as instruments."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is the idea in Îµ (if) hope of saving the other or fear of not saving and hence peril in continuing the slavery of such a bondage?"
2. "The latter idea probably suits the context best and is adopted by most commentators."
3. "If it is a hopeless case, acquiescence is the only wise solution. But surely the believer ought to be sure that there is no hope before he agrees to break the bond."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou dost not know, thou canst not know, thou canst not be sure, whether thou shalt save thy husband."
2. "There is no likelihood of it, since he is such an implacable enemy to Christ, and so bitterly averse to the Gospel."
3. "Persons in such a relation have often great influence upon one another, and are by divine Providence often great blessings to each other, in things spiritual as well as temporal."

The hope is not in the individual's ability, but in God's power working through them as instruments. While there is no guarantee of salvation, the believer should recognize that they can have a significant influence on their unbelieving partner.
