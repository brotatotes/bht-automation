# 1 Corinthians 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whether called into Christianity as circumcised or uncircumcised, one should remain in that state. Resisting pressure to change, a Jew should continue as a Jew, and a Gentile as a Gentile, for both are equal in the Christian churches. This demonstrates the freedom Christians have in matters such as circumcision and Gentile mixed marriages. The key is to be content with one's condition, as external factors do not determine one's standing with God.

2. "If a Gentile who was never circumcised is called by grace, let him not submit to circumcision, which is now abrogated, and is altogether unnecessary and unprofitable in the business of salvation; yea, hurtful and pernicious if done on that account, since it makes men debtors to do the whole law, and Christ of none effect unto them."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Whether someone was called into Christianity as a circumcised or uncircumcised person, it is important for them to remain in that state. This is not to say that an uncircumcised person should undergo a surgical operation to become circumcised, or that a circumcised person should try to reverse the circumcision. A Jew should continue to live as a Jew, and a Gentile should continue to live as a Gentile, as both are equal in the Christian churches. This freedom regarding circumcision exemplifies the freedom regarding Gentile mixed marriages. The bottom line is that one should be content with their current condition, recognizing that external factors do not determine their standing with God.
