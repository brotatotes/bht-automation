# 1 Corinthians 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone is called as a Jew, they should not try to become uncircumcised like some were doing out of a desire to distance themselves from their Jewish identity. Being a Jew or a Gentile does not determine one's standing in the Christian faith; both are equal before God. The Jewish rites and customs are not binding on Gentile converts, so there is no need for them to be circumcised. The focus is on contentment in one's own calling and recognizing equality within the Christian church.
