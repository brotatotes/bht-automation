# 1 Corinthians 7:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The worth of circumcision or uncircumcision is insignificant when compared to the importance of keeping the commandments of God. The commandments are expressed through faith working by love, which is the main focus for believers. Circumcision, although once a commandment of God, does not hold the same eternal significance as love, which is what truly matters. What matters is being a new creation, an inward or spiritual Jew, and living in obedience to God's commandments. Whether one is circumcised or uncircumcised becomes insignificant in light of faith working by love.
