# 1 Corinthians 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being in the Lord entails being the Lord's freedman, where Christ's service is described as perfect freedom. Even as a slave externally, the believer experiences spiritual freedom from sin, the law, and circumcision. Embracing the role of a servant for Christ does not undermine true liberty, as it is in fact the highest blessing, liberating one from the bondage of sin. Whether a freeman or a slave, obedience to God's laws is paramount, for true liberty aligns with serving the Lord.
