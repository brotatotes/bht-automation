# 1 Corinthians 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Becoming slaves to men and allowing our relationships with society to bring us into bondage and anxiety is something to be avoided. We should remember that we were bought with a price, the blood of Christ, irrespective of our earthly status. Let us not become servants to men, externally or internally, but rather prioritize our relationship with Christ. Instead of defiling ourselves for the sake of others, let us regard ourselves as servants of God in all areas of our lives, even in humble relations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "BECOME NOT SLAVES OF MEN: i.e. â€˜do not allow your relations to human society, whether of freedom or slavery, to bring you into bondage so as to cause you anxiety to change the one or increase the other.â€™"
2. "Chrysostom and others think the precept directed against eye-service, and general regard to menâ€™s opinion. But it is better to restrict it (however it may legitimately be applied generally) to the case in hand."
3. "Others understand it as addressed to the free, and meaning that they are not to sell themselves into slavery: but this is evidently wrong."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Become not servants to men, either externally, or spiritually."
3. "The external and internal conditions, so far as is attainable, should correspond, and the former be subservient to the latter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though you are slaves to people, yet you have been purchased for God by the blood of His Son."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are holy to the Lord, because he has redeemed us: let us, therefore, not defile ourselves for the sake of men, as we do when we are subject to their corrupt desires."
2. "This admonition was very necessary at that time, when servants were driven by threats and stripes, and even fear of death, to obey every kind of command without selection or exception, so that they reckoned the procuring of prostitutes, and other crimes of that nature, to be duties belonging to servants, equally with honorable employmentâ€™s."
3. "Would that this were thoroughly and entirely impressed upon the minds of all! There would not, in that case, be so many that prostitute themselves to the lusts of men, as if exposed for sale."

2. "his meaning is, that since they were redeemed from a vain conversation by the blood of Christ, they should not be servants to the lusts of men, nor obey them in things sinful and wicked, which were contrary to law and Gospel"
3. "The allusion seems to he to a tradition of the Jews, that the Israelites being redeemed out of Egypt were the servants of God, and not of men"
