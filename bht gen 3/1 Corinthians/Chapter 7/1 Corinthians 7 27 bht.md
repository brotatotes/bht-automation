# 1 Corinthians 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The general recommendation here advises against seeking a change in marital status without a pressing need. It is important to understand that this does not conflict with previous teachings on divorce, but rather serves as a caution against seeking release from the marriage bond or pursuing a new marriage. This advice applies to those who are not bound by the marriage tie, whether they have been married before or not. Paul's intention is not to impose his opinion universally, but to offer guidance based on individual circumstances and the gift of continence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The general recommendation here is referable alike to all cases of marriage, and does not touch on the prohibition of ver. 10,â€”only dissuading from a spirit of change in consideration of the instant necessity."
2. "It seems better to take the verse thus, than to regard it as inserted to guard against misunderstanding of the preceding judgment of the Apostle."
3. "Art thou loosed? does not imply previous marriage, but describes all those who are not bound by the marriage tie, whether previously married or not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 27. Illustrating the meaning of
	"so to be," 1 Corinthians 7:26.
	Neither the married (those "bound to a wife") nor the
	unmarried (those "loosed from a wife") are to "seek"
	a change of state (compare 1 Corinthians 7:20;
	1 Corinthians 7:24).


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Art thou bound unto a wife? - Art thou already married?"
2. "Seek not to be loosed - Seek not a 'dissolution' of the connection, either by divorce or by a separation from each other."
3. "Art thou loosed from a wife? - Art thou unmarried? It should have been rendered 'free from' a wife; or art thou single?"

### John Calvin:
1. "It is therefore a restriction upon the preceding statement, lest any one, influenced by his commendation of celibacy, should turn his thoughts to it, and despise marriage, forgetful of his necessity or of his calling."
2. "He does not, then, allow to all the choice of perpetual celibacy, but only to those to whom it is given. Let no one, therefore, who is not constrained by any necessity, rashly ensnare himself, for liberty ought not to be lightly thrown away."
3. "For he ought not to abandon his liberty lightly, without thinking much as to it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Do not be seeking release from the marriage bond."
2. "Do not be seeking a wife."
3. "Paul does not present it as his opinion for all men at all times."

### John Gill:
1. "Marriage is such a bond as cannot be dissolved, but by the death of one of the parties."
2. "Do not depart from her, nor seek to be divorced, nor even desire to be loosed by death."
3. "It is best to continue loosed, for the reason above given, that is, provided the person has the gift of continence, otherwise not."
