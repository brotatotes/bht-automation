# 1 Corinthians 7:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The time is shortened, Christians must keep themselves loose in heart from worldly relationships and possessions, holding them loosely in anticipation of the Lord's return. They should live in the married state but assimilate their present condition to that of those who are not married. The time is short, so we should not be unduly attached to earthly things. Instead of indulging in the flesh, we should focus on the service and worship of God, devoting ourselves to Him as if we had none of the temporal gifts.
