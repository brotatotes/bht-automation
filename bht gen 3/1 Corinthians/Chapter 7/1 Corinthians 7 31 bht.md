- Attempt 1 BHT: We are instructed to use the world, not to indulge in its pursuits as our chief aim, for the form and fashion of this world are already beginning to pass away. While we carry out our duties in this worldly sphere, our desires should revolve around God as the center. It is not so much about denying outward earthly things, but having an inward spirit that is willing to sacrifice all for the sake of Christ.
