# 1 Corinthians 7:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A married man's devotion to God may be hindered by the responsibility of pleasing his wife and the worldly concerns that come with marriage. The apostle warns against the potential dangers of being so consumed by the desires and demands of a spouse that it interferes with one's religious duties. While not all married individuals struggle with this, the general sentiment is that being single allows for greater freedom and opportunity to fully devote oneself to the service of God without the distractions and cares of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle here plainly intimates that there would be danger that the man would be so anxious to gratify his wife, as to interfere with his direct religious duties."
2. "She may demand his 'society and attention' when he ought to be engaged in doing good to others, and endeavoring to advance the kingdom of Christ."
3. "Many a husband has thus been injured by a frivilous, thoughtless, and imprudent wife; and though that wife may be a Christian, yet her course may be such as shall greatly retard his growth in grace, and mar the beauty of his piety."

### John Calvin:
1. "They have one eye directed to the Lord, but in such a way as to have the other directed to their wife; for marriage is like a burden, by which the mind of a pious man is weighed down, so that he does not move God-ward with so much alacrity."
2. "Let us always, however, bear in mind, that these evils do not belong to marriage, but proceed from the depravity of men."
3. "And the Apostle did not intend merely to condemn here those vices by which we contract guilt in the sight of God, but he desires in a general way, that we may be freed from all impediments, so as to be wholly at leisure for the service of God."

### John Gill:
1. "But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world [...] how he may please his wife." 
2. "This also is not to be understood of every individual person in a married state as matter of fact; for, on the one hand, there are some who take no care to please their wives and provide for their families, and are worse than infidels; and, on the other hand, there are others who take a proper care to make a suitable provision for their wives and children, to the satisfaction of both."
3. "Generally speaking, persons in such a state are greatly involved in worldly cares, and have not that leisure, and those opportunities, that single persons have to attend religious exercises; wherefore the single state, on this account, is, in the apostle's opinion, the more preferable."

### John Wesley:
1. "But the married careth for the things of the world â€” And it in his duty so to do, so far as becomes a Christian."
2. "How he may please his wife â€” And provide all things needful for her and his family."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: A married man, though he may have one eye directed towards the Lord, will inevitably have the other turned towards his wife because marriage burdens the mind of a pious man and hinders his eagerness to pursue God. This burden often leads to obstacles in their spiritual growth or the beauty of their piety. Yet, it is important to remember that these challenges do not arise from marriage itself but from the fallen nature of humanity. The apostle's intention here is to encourage believers to be free from all impediments, including the entanglements of marital obligations, in order to fully dedicate themselves to the service of God. Nonetheless, it should be noted that not every married person necessarily struggles with this, as there are those who diligently care for and provide for their families, pleasing both their spouse and God. However, in general, being married tends to involve more worldly cares and less leisure and opportunity for religious devotion than being single, hence why the apostle views singleness as preferable in this regard.

- Attempt 5 BHT: Marriage brings the potential risk of a husband being so preoccupied with pleasing his wife that it hinders his commitment to religious obligations.

While not all married individuals face these hindrances, the general idea is that being single allows for undivided devotion to God and His service.
