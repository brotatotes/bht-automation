### John Calvin:
1. "And here you have two things worthy of observation. The first is, for what purpose celibacy is to be desired ‚Äî not on its own account, nor on the ground of its being a state that is nearer to perfection, but that we may cleave to God without distraction ‚Äî that being the one thing that a Christian man ought exclusively to look to during his whole life."
 
2. "It is well known what grievous errors have been fallen into on both these points. As to the second point, those assuredly have been bolder than Paul, who have not shrunk from passing a law respecting celibacy, with the view of prohibiting the whole of the clergy from matrimony."
3. "Hence, if the Holy Spirit has spoken by the mouth of Paul, Papists cannot clear themselves from the crime of fighting against God, while binding men‚Äôs consciences in a matter in which He designed that they should remain free unless, perhaps, He has since that time adopted a new plan, so as to construct a snare, which he had previously disapproved of."
