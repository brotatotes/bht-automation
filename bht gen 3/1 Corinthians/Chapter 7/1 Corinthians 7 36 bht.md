## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behaveth . . . uncomelyâ€”is not treating his daughter well in leaving her unmarried beyond the flower of her age, and thus debarring her from the lawful gratification of her natural feeling as a marriageable woman."
2. "Need so requireâ€”if the exigencies of the case require it; namely, regard to the feelings and welfare of his daughter."
3. "Let them marryâ€”the daughter and her suitor."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That he behaveth himself uncomely - Acts an unbecoming part, imposes an unnecessary, painful, and improper constraint, crosses her inclinations which are in themselves proper."
2. "If she pass the flower of her age - If she pass the marriageable age and remains unmarried. It is well known that in the east it was regarded as especially dishonorable to remain unmarried; and the authority of a father, therefore, might be the means of involving his daughter in shame and disgrace."
3. "And need so require - And she ought to be allowed to marry. If it will promote her happiness, and if she would be unhappy, and regarded as dishonored, if she remained in a state of celibacy."

2. "Celibacy will be seemly for one, but he must not measure all by his own foot; and others should not attempt to imitate him without taking into view their ability; for it is the imitation of the ape â€” which is at variance with nature."
3. "In this clause I understand him as referring to the girlâ€™s infirmity â€” in the event of her not having the gift of continency; for in that case, necessity constrains her to marry."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The father is advised to consent. Roman and Greek fathers had the control of the marriage of their daughters." 
2. "If need so requireth (ÎºÎ± Î¿Ï…Ï„Ï‰Ï‚ Î¿Ï†ÎµÎ¹Î»Îµ Î³Î¹Î½ÎµÏƒÎ¸Î±). 'And it ought to happen.' Paul has discussed the problem of marriage for virgins on the grounds of expediency." 
3. "The father is advised to consent. Roman and Greek fathers had the control of the marriage of their daughters."

### John Gill:
