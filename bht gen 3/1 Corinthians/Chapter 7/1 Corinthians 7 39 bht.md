### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When it comes to the question of remarriage for widows, there is some flexibility, as we can see in 1 Corinthians 7:39. However, the preference is for them to marry a fellow believer, keeping in mind the importance of being in a marriage that is in the Lord. It is worth noting that the phrase bound by the law may be omitted in some manuscripts. It is also interesting to observe that the expression be dead is a tender way for Paul to refer to the idea of falling asleep. In our modern context, it is crucial to remember the ideal of being married in the Lord and how it affects our relationships with ex-spouses. In any case, the widow is free to remarry, as long as it is within the boundaries of a Christian marriage.
