- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse tells us that someone who remains unmarried is more blessed or happier than those who marry. This doesn't mean that celibacy leads to a higher blessedness in heaven, but rather that being single allows for a greater focus on spiritual matters. The phrase I also think doesn't express doubt, but rather a confident opinion inspired by God. By choosing to remain single, one can have a life that is less distracted, more peaceful, and better able to serve the Lord. Scripture teaches that marriage is honorable and important for the preservation of society, but Paul's counsel in this instance reflects the specific circumstances of the Corinthians at that particular time. It is important to note that Paul claims to have the Spirit of God guiding his judgment and that his opinion carries authority in this matter.
