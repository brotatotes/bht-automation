For those who are unmarried, both men and women, it is good for them to remain unmarried. This does not mean that it is better to be unmarried, but rather that it is their best way.

Paul himself was never married and presents himself as an example to widowers and widows, offering his judgment and advice based on his experiences. Remaining unmarried allows for freedom from the cares of life and more time to serve the Lord.
