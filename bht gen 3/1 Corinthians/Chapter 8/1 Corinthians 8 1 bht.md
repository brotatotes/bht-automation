# 1 Corinthians 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While knowledge may puff us up with pride, it is love that truly builds and edifies. The Corinthians were well aware of their knowledge, but the emphasis here is on how love should not be overshadowed by knowledge. Love should guide our actions and interactions with others, as it is a safer and more fruitful approach. True Christian affection is what bonds believers together and helps them grow, while knowledge alone can lead to division and self-sufficiency. Prioritizing love over mere knowledge is essential for our spiritual growth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Partaking of them was an abomination among the Jews...and was forbidden by the Apostles and elders assembled at Jerusalem...But it also shows, how little such decisions were at that time regarded as lastingly binding on the whole church: and how fully competent it was, even during the lifetime of the Apostles, to Christians to open and question on its own merits, a matter which they had, for a special purpose, once already decided."
2. "It is manifest from verses 4â€“6, which are said in the widest possible reference to the faith of all Christians, that all Christians must be intended here also. But then, ver. 7, he says, 'there is not in all men this knowledge,' obviously pointing at the weak Christian brother. By taking, I believe, the common-sense view of two such statements, which would be, in ordinary preaching or writing, that the first was said of what is professed and confessed,â€”the second of what is actually and practically apprehended by each man."
3. "Knowledge, viz. concerning them...knowledge, 'barely,' to puff up...love, viz. 'towards the brethren'...edifieth, Keep the literal meaning: helps to build up (God's spiritual temple)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We are aware that we all have [speaking generally, and so far as Christian theory goes; for in Acts 21:25- : he speaks of some who practically have not] this knowledge."
2. "Puffing up" is to please self. "Edifying" is to please one's neighbor.
3. "Edifiethâ€”tends to build up the spiritual temple."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Knowledge puffeth up, to fill with pride and self-sufficiency, and to lead you astray. charity or love, as well as knowledge, should be allowed to come in as a guide in such cases, and will be a safer guide than mere knowledge."
2. "Mere knowledge, or science, when the heart is not right, fills with pride; swells a man with vain self-confidence and reliance in his own powers, and very often leads him entirely astray."
3. "Knowledge is not a safe guide, and should not be trusted. love to each other and to God, true Christian affection, will be a safer guide than mere knowledge."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Puffeth up. [...]The contrast is striking between puffing up and building up - a bubble and a building."
2. "We know, to use your own words, that we all have knowledge. The parenthesis thus comes in with an appropriate cautionary force."
3. "The arrangement of the text is in question. Evidently a parenthesis intervenes between the beginning of ver. 1 and ver. 1 Corinthians 8:0:4 It seems best to begin this parenthesis with knowledge puffeth up, and to end it with known of him (ver. 3)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Of what avail is knowledge, that is of such a kind as puffs us up and elates us, while it is the part of love to edify?"
2. "Accursed, then, be that knowledge which makes men proud, and is not regulated by a desire of edifying."
3. "We must, therefore, lay it down as a settled principle, that knowledge is good in itself; but as piety is its only foundation, it becomes empty and useless in wicked men: as love is its true seasoning, where that is wanting it is tasteless."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The knowing are apt to put on an air of superiority to their less knowing brethren, whereas love identifying itself by sympathy with all akin to itself, whether more or less enlightened cements them like stones in one building."
2. "Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth Gr. 'buildeth up.'"
3. "'Ye plead your knowledge; we are at one with you there; but this is a question, not of knowledge, but of love.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By ÎµÎ¹Î´Ï‰Î»Î¿Î¸Ï…Ï„Î± was meant the portion of the flesh left over after the heathen sacrifices."
2. "There was evidently difference of opinion on the subject among the Corinthian Christians."
3. "Paul admits that all Christians have this knowledge (personal experience, Î³Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚), but this problem cannot be solved by knowledge."

### John Gill:
1. "We know that we all have knowledge; said either affirmatively and seriously... had the same knowledge of Christian liberty as they had... yet did not think fit to make use of their knowledge to the grieving and wounding of their fellow Christians."
2. "We are wise folks; you particularly are men of knowledge, and wisdom will die with you... you are very knowing in your own conceits, and very positive as to your knowledge."
3. "Knowledge puffeth up; not true knowledge... not sanctified knowledge, or that which has the grace of God going along with it... a mere show of knowledge, knowledge in conceit, mere notional and speculative knowledge, that which is destitute of charity or love... but charity edifieth."

### John Wesley:
1. "All of us have knowledge â€” A gentle reproof of their self-conceit."
2. "Knowledge without love always puffeth up."
3. "Love alone edifies - Builds us up in holiness."

- Attempt 1 BHT: We all have knowledge, but it is important to recognize that knowledge alone can lead to pride and self-sufficiency. The Corinthians were aware of their knowledge about certain matters, but it had puffed them up, causing division among them. Love, on the other hand, is what truly builds up and edifies others. The apostle Paul emphasizes that knowledge should not be elevated above love, as love is a safer and more fruitful guide in matters of faith and relationships with fellow believers. Knowledge without love lacks the seasoning of true Christian affection and can become empty and useless. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize love and the edification of others over a mere show of knowledge, as love alone builds us up in holiness.
