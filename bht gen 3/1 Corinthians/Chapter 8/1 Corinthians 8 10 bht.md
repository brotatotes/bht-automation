# 1 Corinthians 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When you exercise your knowledge, the weak brother may be emboldened to go against their conscience, building them up towards ruin. By your example, the weak brother is led to do what they believe is wrong, violating their conscience. Instead of building up your brother in good, your actions embolden them to commit idolatry. It is essential to consider the conscience of the weaker brother and show them love and consideration, rather than defiantly flouting your knowledge in idolatrous settings.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When you exercise your knowledge in the presence of a weak brother, they start to look up to you and may feel encouraged to go against their conscience. Instead of building them up in good, your actions embolden them to do what they still believe is wrong. By proudly displaying your knowledge, you unintentionally lead the weak brother astray and embolden them to violate their conscience. This is like building them up towards ruin. Your defiance at the sacrificial banquet, which is inherently idolatrous, further exacerbates the situation. Instead of showing love and consideration, you fling defiance in the face of the unenlightened brother. We must be careful not to cause our weak brothers and sisters to stumble by our actions, as they may be led astray and act against their own conscience.
