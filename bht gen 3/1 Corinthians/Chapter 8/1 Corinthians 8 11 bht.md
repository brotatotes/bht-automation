# 1 Corinthians 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A single act seemingly unimportant may produce everlasting consequences. Even the condemned shall manifest God's love in the great day, in that they too had the offer of God's mercy. Surely it is a poor use to put one's superior knowledge, and ruin follows in the wake of such daredevil knowledge. The appeal to the death of Christ is the central fact that clinches Paul's argument. Whoever is thus the means of leading a Christian brother to violate his conscience is helping so far to destroy his soul.

1. "It is not some slight injury that is done to the person, but even causing him to 'perish'; and this is not said of any person, but a 'brother', to whom the strongest affection, and strictest regard, should be shown; and a 'weak' brother, of whom the greater care should be taken; and therefore it is an instance of cruelty to do damage to such an one."
2. "What aggravates most of all is, that this affects a person for 'whom Christ died'; that he had such a value for as to purchase and redeem with the price of his own blood; and yet these men made so little account of, as by so trifling a thing to risk their good and welfare."
3. "The 'perishing' of this weak brother is to be understood of his peace and comfort, and is explained by 'defiling' his conscience... by wounding it... and making him to offend... through an imprudent use of Christian liberty... and not of his eternal damnation in hell; which could never enter into the apostle's thought, as to be brought about hereby."

1. "And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?" 
2. "And for whom thou wilt not lose a meal's meat, so far from dying for him!"
