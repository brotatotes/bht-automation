# 1 Corinthians 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Smiting the weak, sinning against the brethren, wounds their conscience, just as striking an invalid would. This cruelty is further aggravated by the fact that it is committed against those who share a sympathy with Christ. It is essential to recognize that in sinning against the brethren, they are sinning against Christ Himself. The intimate bond between Christ and His members is such that offending or injuring them is equivalent to offending or injuring Him.

2. "Hence contempt of this kind is an open insult to Christ."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: To smite one who is weak, to wound and sin against the brethren, is like striking an invalid, a cruel act aggravated by the fact that it is committed on the vulnerable. The conscience is sensitive to such a blow, feeling it as a slap in the face. But what they fail to realize is that in sinning against the brethren, they sin against Christ Himself. The bond between Christ and His members is so close that to offend them is to offend Him, to injure them is to injure Him. In disregarding this, they overlook the fact that they are overlooking Christ. The parallel can be drawn to Jesus' words in Matthew 25:40, where he says, ye did it unto me.
