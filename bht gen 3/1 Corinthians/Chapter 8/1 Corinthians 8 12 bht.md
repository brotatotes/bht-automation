# 1 Corinthians 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To sin against the weak brethren is unfeeling and akin to striking an invalidâ€”an open insult to Christ. It violates the law of love and wounds their sensitive conscience, thereby sinning against Christ Himself. Such contempt for Christ's blood price blatantly disregards the deep union and sympathy between Christ and His members. Let us remember that our actions towards others reflect our treatment of Christ Himself, and therefore, let us exercise caution not to wound the conscience of our brethren.

3. "What serves most to enhance the crime and guilt is, ye sin against Christ, who has so loved this weak brother as to die for him; and between whom there is so close an union, as between head and members; and from whence such a sympathy arises, that what is done to or against such a person, Christ takes as done to himself."
