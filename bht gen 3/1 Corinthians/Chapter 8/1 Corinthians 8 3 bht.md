# 1 Corinthians 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who truly love God are known by Him, as it is through love that we come to know and understand God. To love God is to know Him and be known by Him.

When one loves God, their actions are driven by sacred charity, leading to the approval and favor of God. Such love is the source of love for our neighbors and edifies both ourselves and others.
