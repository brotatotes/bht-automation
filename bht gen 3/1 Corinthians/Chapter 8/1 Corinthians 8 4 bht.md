# 1 Corinthians 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Idols, representing false gods, are mere symbols without real existence or divine power. While worshipped by the heathen, those who possess knowledge understand that idols are nothing more than imaginary entities. The worship of Jesus as God's Son and the Holy Spirit does not imply belief in multiple gods, but rather affirms the belief in one God manifested in three persons. The Corinthians were already aware of this truth and the significance of acknowledging the existence of only one God.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Idols may be worshipped by the heathen, but they are mere representations without any real existence or power. These idols do not represent the subtle power that deludes nations, but rather false gods that are simply figments of imagination. The worship of Jesus as God's Son and the Holy Spirit does not imply the recognition of three gods, but rather one God in three persons. The knowledge that idols are nothing and that there is only one God was not foreign to the Corinthians, who held this understanding. Despite the fact that some pagans considered idols as proper objects of worship, those who had knowledge were aware that idols were mere symbols and not living realities. Thus, the concept of there being no other God but one was an important truth to remember.
