# 1 Corinthians 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even if we consider the existence of gods, there are many gods and lords, both known and recognized. Scripture refers to angels and men in authority as gods, exercising a divinely delegated power under God. However, Paul denies the true existence of these so-called gods and asserts that those who worship idols are actually worshipping demons or evil spirits. The emphasis is on the sheer number of gods and their immense influence over their followers. Rendering divine worship to these beings is absurd, as they were created for our use.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For even supposing that beings named gods EXIST (the chief emphasis is on exist, on which the hypothesis turns)... gods many, and lords many." 
2. "The Apostle brings in an acknowledged fact, on which the possibility of the hypothesis restsâ€” 'Even if some of the many gods and many lords, whom we know to exist, be actually identical with the heathen idols...'"
3. "He does not concede this, but only puts it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For even supposing there are (exist) gods so called ( :-), whether in heaven (as the sun, moon, and stars) or in earth (as deified kings, beasts, c.), as there be (a recognized fact, Deuteronomy 10:17 Psalms 135:5; Psalms 136:2) gods many and lords many." 
2. "Angels and men in authority are termed gods in Scripture, as exercising a divinely delegated power under God (compare Exodus 22:9; Exodus 22:28; Psalms 82:1; Psalms 82:6; John 10:34; John 10:35)."
3. "Gods many and lords many."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As there are, in fact, many which are so called or regarded."
2. "The emphasis should be placed on the word 'many;' and the design of the parenthesis is, to show that the number of these that were worshipped was not a few, but was immense; and that they were in fact worshipped as gods, and allowed to have the influence over their minds and lives which they would have if they were real."
3. "This name 'lord' was often given to their idol gods... and means that the laws which they were supposed to give in regard to their worship had control over the minds of their worshippers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Gods - lords. Superhuman beings to whom these titles are given, as Ephesians 6:12; 2 Corinthians 4:4; John 12:31; John 14:30.


### John Calvin:
1. "How very far they are, however, from being entitled to divine honors, Moses shows from this, that they were created for our use. The sun is our servant; the moon is our handmaid. How absurd, therefore, it is to render to them divine honors!"
2. "For, as Pliny observes, those who had deserved well of mankind had their memory consecrated by religion, so as to be worshipped as deities â€” Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Apollo, who were mortal men, but were, after death, exalted to the rank of deities."
3. "They are gods, then, only in name; but Paul says that he does not stop to notice deifications of this sort."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For even if indeed there are" 
2. "Called gods, So-called gods, reputed gods."
3. "Paul denied really the existence of these so-called gods and held that those who worshipped idols (non-entities) in reality worshipped demons or evil spirits, agents of Satan."

### John Gill:
1. "For though there be that are called gods...who are called so in Scripture, as angels and magistrates, or by men..."
2. "[Referring] to the Baalim, or the several idols that went by the name of Baal, or lord..."
3. "as there be gods many: almost without number, as were among the Egyptians, Grecians, Romans, and others; yea, even among the Jews..."

### John Wesley:
1. For though there be that are called gods â€” By the heathens both celestial, (as they style them,) terrestrial, and infernal deities.
