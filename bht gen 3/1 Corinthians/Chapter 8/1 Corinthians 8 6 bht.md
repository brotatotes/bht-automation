# 1 Corinthians 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To us, Christians, there is one God, the Father, from whom all things derive their existence, and we are directed towards Him as our ultimate purpose. There is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things were created, and it is by Him that we are restored through the new creation. This strong affirmation of monotheism stands in contrast to the polytheism prevalent in Corinth, and emphasizes the exclusive worship of the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Christianity discloses the sublime reality underlying the human conviction and emotion that led to the proliferation of false gods.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "TO US... there is ONE GOD, the Father... of Whom are all things." 
2. "one Lord Jesus Christ... by Whom are all things, and we by Him." 
3. "The inference from the foregoing is that, of itself, the eating of meat offered to idols is a thing indifferent, and therefore allowed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

is the end for whom and for whose glory believers live."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We acknowledge but one God, Whatever the pagan worship, we know that there is but one God; and he alone has a right to rule over us."
2. "The word 'Father' here is not used as applicable to the first person of the Trinity, as distinguished from the second, but is applied to God as God; not as the Father in contradistinction from the Son, but to the divine nature as such, without reference to that distinction."
3. "The work of creation is expressly in this passage ascribed to the Lord Jesus. But the work of creation cannot be performed by a creature. There can be no delegated God, and no delegated omnipotence, or delegated infinite wisdom and omnipresence. The work of creation implies divinity; or it is impossible to prove that there is a God; and if the Lord Jesus made 'all things,' he must be God."

### John Calvin:

2. "It might have sufficed for the apostle‚Äôs purpose to say in opposition to the polytheism that reigned at Corinth ‚ÄòTo us Christians there is no divinity, and no object of worship, save the one living and true God.‚Äô"
3. "Now what Christianity does is not to extinguish this conviction and this emotion, out of which the universe came to be thus ignorantly peopled, but to disclose the sublime Reality that underlies all these dreamings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of whom (ŒµŒæ ŒøœÖ). As the source (ŒµŒæ) of the universe (œÑŒ± œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ± as in Romans 11:36; Colossians 1:16) and also our goal is God (ŒµŒπœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ) as in Romans 11:36 where Œ¥Œπ' Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ is added whereas here Œ¥Œπ' ŒøœÖ (through whom) and Œ¥Œπ' Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ (through him) point to Jesus Christ as the intermediate agent in creation as in Colossians 1:15-20; John 1:3."

3. "Yet to us there is one God, the Father (Œ±ŒªŒª' Œ∑ŒºŒπŒΩ ŒµŒπœÇ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÇ Œø œÄŒ±œÑŒ∑œÅ). B omits Œ±ŒªŒª' here, but the sense calls for it anyhow in this apodosis, a strong antithesis to the protasis ( even if at least, Œ∫Œ± ŒµŒπœÄŒµœÅ)."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet to us ‚Äî Christians."
2. "There is but one God ‚Äî This is exclusive, not of the One Lord, as if he were an inferior deity; but only of the idols to which the One God is opposed."
