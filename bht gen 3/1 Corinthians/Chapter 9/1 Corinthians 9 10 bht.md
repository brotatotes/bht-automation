# 1 Corinthians 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Does God say this for our sake? Yes, indeed, for our sakes it was written that he who plows should do so in hope, and the thresher should work with the hope of partaking in the fruit of his labor. The command against muzzling the ox was written on account of us, because just as the plowman and the thresher are entitled to enjoy the crops they work for, so too should the people support their minister and not let them labor without remuneration.

2. "...because the plougher (not literal but spiritual, see below) ought to plough in hope, and the thresher (to thresh) in hope of partaking (of the crop)."
3. "The command (not to muzzle, &c.) was written on account of us (Christian teachers), because we ploughers (in the 'husbandry of God,' ch. iii. 9) ought to plough in hope,‚Äîand we threshers (answering to the 'ox that treadeth out the corn') ought to work in hope of (as the ox) having a share.'"

3. "He that thresheth ‚Äòought‚Äô to partake of his hope;‚Äù that is, of the fruits of his hope, or of the result of his labor. It is fair and right that he should enjoy the fruits of his toil.

Let those who labor in God's husbandry be encouraged by the hope of reaping spiritual and temporal rewards, for what they sow in spiritual things should surely be met with material support from those they serve.
