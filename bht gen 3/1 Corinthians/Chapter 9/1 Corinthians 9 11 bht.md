## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The we (both times strongly emphatic:â€”we need sorely some means of marking in our English Bibles, for ordinary readers, which words have the emphasis)"
2. "It is one of those elaborately antithetical sentences which the great Apostle wields so powerfully in argument."
3. "The first are so called as belonging to the spirit of man (some say, as coming from the Spirit of God: but it is better to keep the antithesis exact and perspicuous), the second as serving for the nourishment of the flesh."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "WE, the same persons who have sown to you the infinitely more precious treasures of the Spirit, may at least claim in return what is the only thing you have to give."
2. "the goods that nourish the flesh"
3. "your carnal things"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We impart blessings of more value than we receive. We receive a supply of our temporal needs. We impart to you, under the divine blessing, the gospel, with all its hopes and consolations."
2. "Ministers, like physicians, lawyers, and farmers, should be allowed to attend mainly to the great business of their lives, and to their appropriate work... No physician, no farmer, no mechanic, could accomplish much, if his attention was constantly turned off from his appropriate business to engage in something else."
3. "It might be added, that society is benefited in a 'pecuniary' way by the service of a faithful minister to a far greater extent than the amount of compensation which he receives... The promotion of order, peace, sobriety, industry, education, and regularity in business, and honesty in contracting and in paying debts, saves much more to the community at large than the cost of the support of the gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though food and clothing are not of the same nature with a ministerâ€™s labors, what injury do you sustain, if you recompense what is inestimable with a thing that is small and contemptible?"
2. "For in proportion to the superiority of the soul above the body, does the word of the Lord excel outward sustenance, inasmuch as it is the food of the soul."
3. "The minister of the word, if he would receive fruit corresponding to his labor, ought to demand nothing that is carnal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is it a great matter? (Î¼ÎµÎ³Î±;). The copula ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½ has to be supplied."
2. "Note two conditions of first class with Îµ, both assumed to be true."
3. "This point comes out sharply also in Galatians 6:6."

### John Gill:
1. "The preachers of the Gospel are compared to sowers of seed; the seed they sow is the word of God, which is like to seed, for its smallness and despicableness in the eyes of carnal men... the Gospel is most choice and excellent to true believers."
2. "sowing requires skill and art, and so preaching the Gospel does, and that more than human; and is constantly in its returning season to be attended to, notwithstanding the winds and clouds."
3. "once more, as the sower, when he has cast his seed into the earth, waits long and with patience for its springing up and increase, so do the faithful dispensers of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "Is it a great matter if we shall reap as much of your carnal things â€” As is needful for our sustenance?" 
2. "Do you give us things of greater value than those you receive from us?"
3. "Do you give us things of greater value than those you receive from us?"
