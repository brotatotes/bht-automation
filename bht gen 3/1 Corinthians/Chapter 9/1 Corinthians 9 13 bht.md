## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "minister about holy things—the Jewish priests and Levites."
2. "The Greek especially applies to the former, the priests offering sacrifices."
3. "partakers with the altar—a part of the victims going to the service of the altar, and the rest being shared by the priests."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument of the apostle here is this: 'As the ministers of religion under the Jewish dispensation were entitled to support by the authority and the law of God, that fact settles a general principle which is applicable also to the gospel, that he intends that the ministers of religion should derive their support in their work.'"
2. "If it was reasonable then, it is reasonable now. If God commanded it then, it is to be presumed that he intends to require it now."
3. "The ministers of religion were entitled to a support from the fact that those who were appointed to offer sacrifice receive a maintenance in their work."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Minister [εργαζομενοι] . Lit, work or perform. Never in classical Greek of being engaged in sacred rites."
2. "Wait [παρεδρευοντες] . Etymologically akin to paredrov sitting beside. See on ch. 1 Corinthians 7:35. Ony here in the New Testament."
3. "Altar [θυσιαστηριω] . See on Acts 17:23."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum is this — 'The Levitical priests were ministers of the Israelitish Church; the Lord appointed them sustenance from their ministry; hence in ministers of the Christian Church the same equity must be observed at the present day.'" 
2. "Hence appears the absurdity of those who apply this comparison, taken from sacrifices, to anything else than the preaching of the gospel."
3. "Nay farther, it may be readily inferred from this passage, that all Popish priests, from the head himself to the lowest member, are guilty of sacrilege, who devour the revenues appointed for true ministers, while they do not in any way discharge their duty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Know ye not that they which minister about sacred things eat of the things of the temple?" 
2. "The Gentile converts are supposed to be aware of this, mixing constantly with their Jewish fellow-converts."
3. "The practice in their own pagan worship was analogous."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sacred things (τα ιερα). Of the temple (του ιερου). Play on the same word ιερου (sacred)." 
2. "They which wait upon the altar (ο τω θυσιαστηριω παρεδρευοντες). Old word παρεδρευω, to sit beside, from παρ--εδρος, like Latin assidere, and so constant attendance."
3. "Locative case θυσιαστηριω, late word found so far only in LXX, Philo, Josephus, N.T., and ecclesiastical writers."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the priests in the temples of the Heathen deities, as the Ethiopic version suggests; but the priests in the temple at Jerusalem..."
2. "and these partook with the altar; some parts the altar devoured, being consumed by fire upon it; but then there were other pieces which by law were reserved for the priests, and upon which they and their families lived..."
3. "hence the distinction of אכילת מזבח, the food of the altar, and אכילת אדם, 'the food of man'; and therefore as it was but just and equitable that persons so employed should be maintained out of the revenues of the temple and altar, it is but right that Gospel ministers should be provided for with a suitable maintenance."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The apostle Paul highlights the support that ministers of religion received in the Jewish dispensation, emphasizing that they eat of the things of the temple, referring to the provisions given to the priests who served at the altar. This illustration reveals that just as the Jewish ministers were entitled to sustenance from their ministry, it is reasonable to presume that the ministers of the gospel should also be supported in their work. The Gentile converts, already familiar with the practice of temple offerings, would understand this analogy. The equity demonstrated here exposes the absurdity of those who misapply this comparison and withhold proper support from Christian ministers.
