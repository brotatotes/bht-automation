# 1 Corinthians 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as the Lord appointed that the preaching of the gospel should be supported by the gospel, there is an analogy between the rights of the sacrificing priests of the law and the preachers of the gospel. The Christian ministry is not sacrificial like the Jewish priesthood, but ministers should be supported by voluntary offerings. The Lord's instructions in Matthew 10:10 and Luke 10:7 establish the argument for the minister's salary, ensuring that those who faithfully bring the good news of salvation are provided with a comfortable livelihood.

2. "Observe, that here the Apostle is establishing an analogy between the rights of the sacrificing priests of the law, and of the preachers of the gospel."
