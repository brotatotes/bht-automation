# 1 Corinthians 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Boasting holds no merit for Paul except for one thing: preaching the gospel free of charge. His mission is not a personal gain, but a solemn duty for which he is held accountable. Obligated by necessity, he has no choice but to heed the call to ministry. Neglecting this calling would be disastrous. All ministers should revere the sacred tie that binds them to their duty, recognizing the consequences of shirking their responsibility to preach the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason why he made so much of this matter of boasting, viz. that his mission itself gave him no advantage this way, being an office entrusted to him, and for which he was solemnly accountable."
2. "But in this thing only had he an advantage to be able to boast of it, that he preached the gospel without charge."
3. "The English reader must beware not to ion 'preach the gospel,' as if it made a distinction between preaching 'the gospel' and preaching something else: it simply represents the word 'evangelize,' i.e. perform the work of a Christian missionary."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If I preach the Gospel, and do so not gratuitously, I have no matter for 'glorying.'"
2. "The sole ground for the latter that I have, is my preaching without charge."
3. "It is my voluntary act for the Gospel's sake."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was such a necessity laid on him in his call to preach the gospel, that his compliance with that call could not be regarded as appropriately connected with reward; and that in his case the circumstance which showed that reward would be proper, was, his denying himself, and making the gospel without charge." 
2. "Their consciences urge them to it. They would be miserable in any other employment. The course of Providence has shut them up to it." 
3. "Their heart is in this work, and in this alone. In this, though amidst circumstances of poverty, persecution, nakedness, cold, peril, sickness, they have comfort. In any other calling, though surrounded by affluence, friends, wealth, honors, pleasures, gaiety, fashion, they would be miserable."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let not the man, then, who has been once called to it, imagine that he is any longer at liberty to withdraw when he chooses, if, perhaps, he is harassed with vexatious occurrences, or weighed down with misfortunes, for he is devoted to the Lord and to the Church, and bound by a sacred tie, which it were criminal to break asunder."
2. "A curse was ready to fall upon him, if he did not preach the gospel... What sort of successors, then, have the Apostles in the Pope and the other mitred bishops, who think that there is nothing that is more unbecoming their station, than the duty of teaching!"
3. "What, as to ministers, is the nature, and what the closeness of the tie that is involved in their calling, and farther, what the pastoral office imports and includes."

1. "To glory in preaching without charge is reasonable enough, but to boast of preaching the Gospel itself were shameful."
2. "For woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel."
3. "Shut up to it by the call of Heaven, it is at my peril if I shrink from it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For necessity is laid upon me... He could do no other and deserves no credit for doing it."
2. "Woe is me... Paul had to heed the call of Christ that he had heard. He had a real call to the ministry."
3. "Would that this were the case with every modern preacher."

### John Gill:
1. "Though he preached the Gospel ever so well, or ever so freely, and might glory before men, and against the false teachers, who insulted him in his character and office; yet not before God... he had nothing to glory of on any of these accounts." 
2. "Necessity is laid upon me... obliged him in duty, love, and gratitude, to attend to it."
3. "Woe is unto me, if I preach not the Gospel... to show what he or any other minister of the Gospel would deserve, at the hand of God, who having abilities to preach, should not make use of them."
