## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words seem inserted rather to put before the reader the true position of a Christian with regard to Godâ€™s law revealed by Christ than merely with an apologetic view, to keep his own character from suffering by the imputation of lawlessness."
2. "This sums up the above, and others not enumerated, in one general rule,â€”and the various occasions of his practising the condescension in one general result."
3. "To all men I am become all things, that by all means I may save some."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Weak in the faith." ALFORD thinks the 'weak' are not Christians at all, for these have been already 'won'; but those outside the Church, who are yet 'without strength' to believe (1 Corinthians 8:7- :)." 
2. "But when 'weak' Christians are by the condescending love of stronger brethren kept from falling from faith, they are well said to be 'gained' or won." 
3. "The gain of even 'some' is worth the expenditure of 'all means.' He conformed himself to the feelings of each in the several classes, that out of them all he might gain some."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul did not do this to gratify himself, or them, but to do them good." 
2. "And Paulâ€™s example should teach us not to make it the main business of life to gratify ourselves, and it should teach us not to lacerate the feelings of others; not to excite their prejudices needlessly; not to offend them where it will do no good."
3. "I am made all things to all men - I become all things; that is, I accommodate myself to them in all things, so far as can be done with a good conscience."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Weak. In faith and christian discernment. Compare ch. 8 7 sqq.; Romans 14:1; Romans 14:1; 1 Thessalonians 5:14.


### John Calvin:
1. "We must accommodate ourselves to the weak, not to the obstinate."
2. "It was only in things indifferent, that are otherwise in our choice, that he accommodated himself to the weak."
3. "Although he might not do good to all, he, nevertheless, had never left off consulting the advantage of at least a few."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak Christians." 
2. "I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means gain some."
3. "Those who are fond of quoting the first part of it are seldom heard quoting the second, which if only kept steadily in view, will never fail to guide straightforward Christians to the proper limits of the principle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He thus brings home his conduct about renouncing pay for preaching as an illustration of love."
2. "That I may save some. This his goal and worth all the cost of adaptation."
3. "In matters of principle Paul was adamant. In matters of expediency he would go half way to win and to hold."

### John Gill:
1. "To the weak became I as weak... and became as one of them, that, rather than offend them, he determined to eat no meat while the world stood." 
2. "I am made all things to all men... but in cases and things of an indifferent nature." 
3. "That I might by all means save some; that is, that he might be the means of saving some of Jews and Gentiles, and of all sorts of men."

### John Wesley:
1. I became as weak â€” As if I had been scrupulous too.
I became all things to all men â€” Accommodating myself to all, so far as I could consistent with truth and sincerity.
