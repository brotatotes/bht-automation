# 1 Corinthians 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To secure the glorious and incorruptible prize, we must run our Christian race diligently, striving not to be rejected at the end. Just as athletes in the Greek games labored and ran towards a single victor's prize, we too must persevere and press towards the prize of our calling. While all who enter the Christian race may not win, we must continue running, fully grasping and holding onto the crown of glory that awaits the faithful. Let us not falter, but instead, keep running until we obtain the imperishable reward.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is my aim in all I do: but inasmuch as many run in a race, many reach the goal, but one only receives the prize,‚ÄîI as an Apostle run my course, and you must so run yours, as each to labour not to be rejected at last, but to gain the glorious and incorruptible prize." 
2. "He was anxious, as an Apostle, to labour more abundantly, more effectually than they all: and hence his condescension to all men, and self-denial: accompanied with which was a humble self-distrust as to the great matter itself of his personal salvation, and an eager anxiety to secure it."
3. "Thus (after this manner‚Äîviz. as they who run all, each endeavoring to be the one who shall receive the prize: not as the one who receives it‚Äîfor the others strive as earnestly as he) run (no contrast is intended between the stadium, where one only can receive the prize, and the Christian race, where all may. Such a contrast would destroy the sense), in order that ye may [fully] obtain (the prize of your calling, see Phil. iii. 14)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If they had done it, for objects so comparatively unimportant as the attainment of an ‚Äúearthly‚Äù garland, assuredly it was proper for him to do it to obtain a crown which should never fade away."
2. "This is one of the most beautiful, appropriate, vigorous, and bold illustrations that can anywhere be found; and is a striking instance of the force with which the most vigorous and self-denying efforts of Christians can be vindicated, and can be urged by a reference to the conduct of people in the affairs of this life."
3. "So run in the Christian race, that you may obtain the prize of glory, the crown incorruptible. So live; so deny yourselves; so make constant exertion, that you may not fail of that prize, the crown of glory, which awaits the righteous in heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In all other New - Testament passages it is used of a measure of length, and is rendered furlong, representing 606.75 English feet." 
2. "At the same time, he would have been familiar with similar scenes in Tarsus, in all the great cities of Asia Minor, especially Ephesus, and even in Jerusalem."
3. "Metaphors and allusions founded upon such spectacles abound in Paul's writings."

### John Calvin:
1. "He states briefly, that what they had hitherto attained was nothing, unless they steadfastly persevered..."
2. "There is...no reason why any one should feel satisfied with himself on the ground of his having once entered upon the race prescribed in the gospel, unless he persevere in it until death."
3. "We must not...stop short in the middle of the race-course, but instead of this, death alone must put a period to our running."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "That ye may obtain."
3. "The aptitude and point of this and the following illustrations will be seen in the fact, that not only were the Grecian games of universal interest and familiar to all his readers, but that the most popular of them all the Isthmian games were celebrated in the immediate neighbourhood of Corinth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The prize (œÑŒø Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒπŒøŒΩ). The victor's prize which only one could receive."
3. "That ye may attain (ŒπŒΩŒ± Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ≤Œ∑œÑŒµ). Grasp and hold."

### John Gill:
1. "The race, or stadium in which they ran, is this world, or this present life; he is only a runner now and here, for no sooner is the time of his departure come, but his course or race is finished."
2. "The act of 'running' is a motion forward, a following on to know the Lord, a going from strength to strength, from one degree of grace to another, a pressing forward toward the mark for the prize."
3. "Once more, as they kept running till they came to the end of their race, so should the saints; there is no time for stopping or looking back; remember Lot's wife."
