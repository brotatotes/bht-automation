# 1 Corinthians 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every Christian must strive in the race of life with self-discipline and moderation, just as athletes in ancient competitions did. Like the Grecian Athletae, who practiced abstinence to attain bodily vigor, we should exercise temperance in all things to obtain a crown that will not fade away. While they received perishable garlands of pine leaves or wild olive, we are promised an incorruptible crown of glory. Therefore, let us willingly give up our rights and desires, knowing that our reward is eternal and far surpasses any fleeting earthly pleasure.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Every Christian should strive in the race of life with the same discipline and self-control as an athlete in a competition. Just as the athletes in the ancient games would train rigorously and deny themselves indulgences to attain a fading laurel crown, we should exercise temperance in all things to obtain a crown that never fades. The world may argue for the benefits of consuming stimulating drinks to enhance physical vigor, but the example of the ancient athletes who achieved greatness through self-restraint and abstinence serves as a convincing counterargument. While they may have received a perishable crown of pine leaves or wild olive, we are promised an incorruptible crown of righteousness, a crown of glory that will never fade away. Therefore, let us not hesitate to relinquish our own rights and desires in the pursuit of an eternal reward.
