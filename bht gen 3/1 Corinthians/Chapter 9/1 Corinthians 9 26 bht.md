## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "so run, as not uncertainly"
2. "so fight I, as not striking the air"
3. "a fight with a real adversary (viz. here, the body) in which the boxer vainly hits into the air, instead of striking his antagonist"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye Corinthians gain no end in your entering idol temples or eating idol meats. But I, for my part, in all my acts, whether in my becoming 'all things to all men,' or in receiving no sustenance from my converts, have a definite end in view, namely, to 'gain the more.'"
2. "He who runs with a clear aim, looks straightforward to the goal, makes it his sole aim, casts away every encumbrance, is indifferent to what the by-standers say, and sometimes even a fall only serves to rouse him the more."
3. "Alluding to the sciamachia or sparring in the school in sham-fight, wherein they struck out into the air as if at an imaginary adversary. The real adversary is Satan acting on us through the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I do not run haphazardly; I do not exert myself for nothing; I know at what I aim, and I keep my eye fixed on the object; I have the goal and the crown in view."
2. "I so live and act that I am 'sure' of obtaining the crown. I make it a great and grand point of my life so to live that there may be no room for doubt or hesitancy about this rustler."
3. "Many an effort of Christians is merely beating the air. The energy is expended for nothing. There is a lack of wisdom, or skill, or perseverance; there is a failure of plan; or there is a mistake in regard to what is to be done, and what should be done."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He runs with a clear perception of his object, and of the true manner and result of his striving."
2. "A boxer might be said to beat the air when practicing without an adversary."
3. "He strikes straight and does not spare."

### John Calvin:
1. "I do not run in vain, nor do I run the risk of losing my labor, for I have the Lord‚Äôs promise, which never deceives."
2. "The Lord exercises us here in the way of running and wrestling, but he sets before us the object at which we ought to aim, and prescribes a sure rule for our wrestling, that we may not weary ourselves in vain."
3. "Those things ought to kindle up and confirm the Christian breast, so as to devote itself with greater alacrity to all the duties of piety; for it is a great matter not to wander in ignorance through uncertain windings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I therefore (for my part) so run, not as uncertainly without definite aim, regardless of what is at stake, and what is required in order to win."
2. "Here the figure changes from running to wrestling, from the speed of the racer to the aggressions of the pugilist as not beating the air who, taking an uncertain or inaccurate aim, misses his antagonist, and strikes only the air: not so do I fight."
3. "I put skill as well as energy into this 'good fight of faith'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His objective is clear, with Christ as the goal."
2. "He kept his eye on Christ as Christ watched him."
3. "A boxer did this when practising without an adversary (cf. doing 'the daily dozen') and this was called 'shadow-fighting'."

### John Gill:
1. "nothing had he more at heart, than to finish his course with joy"
2. "nor did the apostle run, for what, as the Syriac version renders it, ◊û◊ê ◊ô◊ì◊ï◊¢, 'is unknown'"
3. "he did not fight with his own shadow, or a man of straw, or beat the empty air; but gave home blows to real adversaries"

### John Wesley:
1. "I so run, not as uncertainly ‚Äî I look straight to the goal; I run straight toward it." 
2. "I cast away every weight, regard not any that stand by."
3. "I fight not as one that beateth the air ‚Äî This is a proverbial expression for a man's missing his blow, and spending his strength, not on his enemy, but on empty air."
