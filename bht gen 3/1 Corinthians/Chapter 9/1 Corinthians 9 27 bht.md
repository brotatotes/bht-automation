The body is the adversary, the seat of temptations and self-indulgence that can lead Christians to forget their spiritual combat. In order to lay themselves out entirely for the work of salvation, believers must exercise self-denial, keeping their natural self-seeking under control. The body must be made a servant and not a master. For Paul, the prize is not asceticism or physical discipline but the glory of preaching the free gospel. He is determined not to be disqualified or rejected like a defeated boxer.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The body is the adversary, considered as the seat of the temptations of Satan, and especially of that self-indulgence which led the Corinthians to forget their Christian combat."
2. "It is not even of fasting or prayer that he is here speaking, but as the context, vv. 19‚Äì23, shews, of breaking down the pride and obstinacy and self-seeking of the natural man by laying himself entirely out for his great work‚Äîthe salvation of the greatest number."
3. "And this he says with a view to shew them the necessity of more self-denial, and less going to the extreme limit of their Christian liberty."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not ascetic fasts or macerations of the body which are here recommended, but the keeping under of our natural self-seeking, so as, like Paul, to lay ourselves out entirely for the great work."
2. "Unless the soul keep the body under, the body will get above the soul. The body may be made a good servant, but is a bad master."
3. "A castaway - failing shamefully of the prize myself, after I have called others to the contest. Rejected by God, the Judge of the Christian race, notwithstanding my having, by my preaching, led others to be accepted."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We see the great anxiety which Paul had to save souls. This was his grand purpose; and for this he was willing to deny himself and to bear any trial."
2. "We should make an effort to be saved. O if people made such exertions to obtain a corruptible crown, how much greater should we make to obtain one that fadeth not away!"
3. "It will be a solemn and awesome thing for a minister of the gospel, and a 'successful' minister, to go down to hell. What more fearful doom can be conceived, than after having led others in the way to life; after having described to them the glories of heaven; after having conducted them to the 'sweet fields beyond the swelling flood' of death, he should find himself shut out, rejected, and cast down to hell!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The blow of the trained boxer was the more formidable from the use of the cestus, consisting of ox - hide bands covered with knots and nails, and loaded with lead and iron."
2. "A most interesting account is given by Rodolfo Lanziani, 'Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries,' of the exhuming at the foundation of the Temple of the Sun, erected by Aurelian, of a sitting bronze statue of a boxer."
3. "Not of leading the vanquished round the arena (so Godet), a custom of which there is no trace, and which, in most cases, the condition of the vanquished would render impossible."

### John Calvin:
1. "The main thing, however, was wanting in them, for they did not apprehend why it was that the Apostle enjoins this, because they lost sight of another injunction ‚Äî to take no concern for our flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof."
2. "Let us, however, treat the body so as to make a slave of it, that it may not, by its wantonness, keep us back from the duties of piety."
3. "My life ought to be a kind of rule to others. Accordingly, I strive to conduct myself in such a manner, that my character and conduct may not be inconsistent with my doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I buffet (or ‚Äòbeat down‚Äô) my body, and bring it into bondage as a slave into submission to his master." 
2. "Here is a man who elsewhere expresses a confident and joyous assurance of his final salvation, while in this verse he holds forth his final perdition as equally certain, should certain indispensable preventives be neglected." 
3. "Is the estimate of living Christianity here given as inseparable from universal and continuous self-sacrifice, in supreme consecration to the one end for which we were 'bought with a price' realized and acted on by those who have experienced its saving power?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul does not, like the Gnostics, consider his œÉŒ±œÅŒæ or his œÉœâŒºŒ± sinful and evil. But 'it is like the horses in a chariot race, which must be kept well in hand by whip and rein if the prize is to be secured' (Robertson and Plummer)."
2. "The boxers often used boxing gloves (œáŒµœÉœÑœÖœÇ, of ox-hide bands) which gave telling blows. Paul was not willing for his body to be his master."
3. "What is the prize before Paul? Is it that reward (ŒºŒπœÉŒ∏ŒøœÇ) of which he spoke in verse 1 Corinthians 9:18, his glorying of preaching a free gospel? So Edwards argues."

### John Gill:
1. "This is not to be understood by the apostle of his natural body, and of his keeping it under by immoderate watchings, fastings, and labours, or by whipping and scourging, and lying upon the bare ground, and other such practices; but of the body of sin, the corruption of nature, and of that being laid under some restraints."
2. "the apostle's concern is, lest he should do anything that might bring a reproach on the Gospel; lest some corruption of his nature or other should break out, and thereby his ministry be justly blamed, and be brought under contempt; and so he be rejected and disapproved of by men, and become useless as a preacher"
3. "the fears of the saints, their godly jealousies of themselves, and pious care that they be not lost, are not at all inconsistent with the firmness of their election, their security in Christ, and the impossibility of their final and total falling away; but on the contrary are overruled, and made use of by the Spirit of God, for their final perseverance in grace and holiness."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I keep under my body ‚Äî By all kinds of self denial."
2. "The words are strongly figurative, and signify the mortification of the body of sin."
3. "This single text may give us a just notion of the scriptural doctrine of election and reprobation."
