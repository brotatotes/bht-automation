# 1 Corinthians 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do we not have the right to eat and drink at the expense of the churches? This question raised by Paul in his letter to the Corinthians addresses the issue of his authority as an apostle. Paul, along with his fellow laborers, including Barnabas, had the legitimate right to be supported by the churches they served. However, Paul chose to forego this right not because he was unaware of it, but because he saw it as an opportunity to prioritize the welfare of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The plural, we, seems to apply to Paul alone: for though Barnabas is introduced momentarily in ver. 6, there can be no reference to him in ver. 11."
2. "It may perhaps be used as pointing out a matter of right, which any would have had on the same conditions (see ver. 11), and as thus not belonging' personally to Paul, as do the things spoken of in verses 1, 2, 15."
3. "to eat and to drink, i.e. at the cost of the churches."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Have we not powerâ€”Greek, 'right,' or lawful power, equivalent to 'liberty' claimed by the Corinthians." 
2. "The 'we' includes with himself his colleagues in the apostleship."
3. "Paul's not exercising this right was made a plea by his opponents for insinuating that he was himself conscious he was no true apostle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Have we not power [...] yet it was not because they were conscious that they had no such right, but because they chose to forego it for wise and important purposes."
2. "The interrogative mode is often adopted to express the strongest affirmation."
3. "It is not because we have not a right to such support, and it is not because we are conscious that we have no such claim, but it is for a higher purpose. It is because it will do good if we should not urge this right, and enforce this claim."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Eat - drink. At the expense of the churches. Compare Luke 10:7.


### John Calvin:
1. "This, then, was one liberty that he dispensed with."
