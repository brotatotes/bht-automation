# 1 Corinthians 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and Barnabas address their right to marry and have their wives accompany them on their missionary journeys. Paul, however, voluntarily abstains from exercising this right for the sake of Christian expediency, both to save the Church from the cost of supporting his wife and to devote himself more fully to building up the Church. This refutes the Roman Catholic practice of celibacy among clergy, while emphasizing the importance of supporting the preacher's wife and children. Other apostles were either married or had the right to be.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Have we not the power to take about with us (also to be maintained at the cost of the churches, for this, and not the power to marry, is here the matter in question) as a wife, a (believing) sister..."
2. "...who travelled as missionaries, and took their wives with them."
3. "Peter was married, see Matt. viii. 14. A beautiful tradition exists of his encouraging his wife who was led to death, by saying, 'O thou, remember the Lord.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul implies he did not exercise his undoubted right to marry and 'lead about' a believer, for the sake of Christian expediency, as well to save the Church the expense of maintaining her in his wide circuits, as also that he might give himself more undistractedly to building up the Church of Christ."
2. "A confutation of Peter's self-styled followers, the Romanists, who exclude the clergy from marriage."
3. "James, Joses, Simon, and Judas. Probably cousins of Jesus: as cousins were termed by the Jews 'brethren.' ALFORD makes them literally brothers of Jesus by Joseph and Mary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Have we not power? - Have we not a right? The objection here seems to have been, that Paul and Barnabas were unmarried, or at least that they traveled without wives."
2. "But Paul and Barnabas had no families. And the objectors inferred that they were conscious that they had no claim to the apostleship, and no right to support."
3. "Is it not strange that the pretended successor of Peter, the pope of Rome, should forbid marriage when Peter himself was married?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A wife that is a sister on believer. So Rev. Such an one has also the right, like her husband, to be maintained by the Church." (Commentary)
2. "Some of the fathers claimed that not a wife was meant, but a female attendant, serviens mantrona, who contributed to the maintenance of the apostles as certain women ministered to Christ. There is no foundation for this." (Commentary)
3. "Such a practice, however, did grow up in the Church, but was abolished by the Council of Nicaea on account of its abuses." (Commentary)

### John Calvin:
1. "By the brethren of the Lord, he means John and James, who were accounted pillars, as he states elsewhere. (Galatians 2:9.) And, agreeably to what is customary in Scripture, he gives the name of brethren to those who were connected with Him by relationship."
2. "That preeminence, however, was not lordship â€” nay more, it had nothing resembling lordship. For while he was eminent among the others, still he was subject to them as his colleagues."
3. "One thing farther must here be noticed, that the Apostles had no horror of marriage, which the Papal clergy so much abominate, as unbecoming the sanctity of their order."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An absurd interpretation of these words, which found support even among the best of the fathers, when once the ascetic principle had taken possession of the Church, led Christians to regard celibacy as a holier state than marriage, and by degrees threw discredit on the marriage of the clergy." 
2. "But on that view, what is this about 'a wife'? For to translate it 'a woman' here is absurd. But absurd as it is, modern Romanists even Cornelius Ã  Lapide and Estius are obliged to take refuge in it."
3. "Though named hereafter 'the apostles,' it would not necessarily follow that none of these were themselves apostles, for 'Cephas,' one of the apostles, is named immediately after them. At the same time, the mode of expression more naturally suits with their not being apostles, as on other grounds we believe can be established."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is a plea for the support of the preacher's wife and children." 
2. "It was well known that Peter was married (Matthew 8:14)."
3. "All the other apostles were either married or had the right to be."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews called their wives, sisters, not on account of religion, which also is not the meaning here; but because of the common relation that men and women, all mankind, stand in to one another, antecedent to any nearer relation, as that of man and wife."
2. "The act of 'leading', or carrying 'about', is expressive of such a power over them, as cannot be thought to agree with persons of such substance; and whose voluntary act this must be, to go along with them and supply them."
3. "Moreover, though these words clearly imply the lawfulness of a minister's marriage, and suppose it, yet they do not express the act itself, or the lawfulness of entering into such a state, but rather what follows after it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have we not power to lead about with us a sister, a wife â€” And to demand sustenance for her also? As well as the other apostles - Who therefore, it is plain, did this."
2. "Hence we learn, 1. That St. Peter continued to live with his wife after he became an apostle: 2. That he had no rights as an apostle which were not common to St. Paul."
