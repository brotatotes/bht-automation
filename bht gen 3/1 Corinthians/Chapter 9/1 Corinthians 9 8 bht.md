# 1 Corinthians 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do I speak these things merely according to human judgment of what is right, or does the law too not say these things? As a man, I speak not merely according to human judgment, but with the sanction of the divine law also. The question introduces evidence from Scripture.
