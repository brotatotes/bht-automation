# 1 John 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the very beginning, what I declare to you is not hearsay; I bear witness to the literal matter of fact that I have seen with my own eyes, heard with my own ears, and even touched and handled the Word of life. These senses combine to show the reality of Christ's humanity and serve as a strong proof against those who deny it. Jesus Christ, the personal incarnate Son of God, existed before time, and His revelation brings life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That which was (not, â€˜took placeâ€™) from the beginning... sets before us the prior limit, but without meaning strictly to define it as such exclusively."
2. "The seeing as well as the hearing is a finished and abiding possession. The clauses rise in climax: seeing is more than hearing."
3. "These words are not for a moment to be explained away: they are literal matter of fact, and form one of the strongest proofs that what is said, is said of no other than the personal incarnate Son of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seeing is a more convincing proof than hearing; handling, than even seeing."
2. "Contrast the wisest of the heathen feeling after (the same Greek as here; groping after with the hands) if haply they might find God."
3. "Heard is the verb most applying to the purpose of the Epistle, namely the truth which John had heard concerning the Word of life, that is, (Christ) the Word who is the life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever there was respecting the Word of life, or him who is the living Word, the incarnate Son of God, from the very beginning, from the time when he was first manifested in the flesh ... I was permitted to see, and that I declare to you respecting him."
2. "John professes here to have seen enough in this respect to furnish evidence that he was the Son of God. It is not hearsay on which he relies, but he had the testimony of his own eyes in the case."
3. "The evidence that he appeared in the flesh was subjected to more senses than one; to the fact that his voice was heard; that he was seen with the eyes; that the most intense scrutiny had been employed; and, lastly, that he had been actually touched and handled, showing that it could not have been a mere appearance, an assumed form, but that it was a reality."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That about the Word of Life which was from the beginning, that which appealed to sight, to hearing is, to touch."
2. "The Word was already existing when the succession of life began."
3. "The revelation proclaims that which it includes; it has, announces, gives life. In Christ life as the subject, and life as the character of the revelation, were absolutely united."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows, first, that life has been exhibited to us in Christ; which, as it is an incomparable good, ought to rouse and inflame all our powers with a marvelous desire for it, and with the love of it."
2. "But as the greatness of the subject requires that the truth should be certain, and fully proved, this is what is here much dwelt upon."
3. "And, doubtless, no one is a fit teacher in the Church, who has not been the disciple of the Son of God, and rightly instructed in his school, since his authority alone ought to prevail."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The perfect tense (active indicative of Î±ÎºÎ¿Ï…Ï‰) stresses John's equipment to speak on this subject so slowly revealed." 
2. "It is the literary plural unless John associates the elders of Ephesus with himself, the men who certified the authenticity of the Gospel (John 21:24)." 
3. "Three senses are here appealed to (hearing, sight, touch) as combining to show the reality of Christ's humanity against the Docetic Gnostics and the qualification of John by experience to speak."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus Christ is here intended, who in his divine nature was, really existed as a divine person, as the everlasting Jehovah, the eternal I AM, which is, and was, and is to come, and existed 'from the beginning'." 
2. "When the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among men, the apostles heard, and saw, and handled him."
3. "They not only heard a voice from heaven, declaring him to be the Son of God, but they often heard him speak himself, both in private conversation with them, and in his public ministry."

### John Wesley:
1. "That which was... He which was the Word himself; afterwards it means, that which they had heard from him."
2. "From the beginning... properly means from eternity, being equivalent with, 'in the beginning,' John 1:1."
3. "That which we... Have not only heard, but seen with our eyes, which we have beheld - Attentively considered on various occasions."
