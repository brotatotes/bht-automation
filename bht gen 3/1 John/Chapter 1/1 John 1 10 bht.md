# 1 John 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To deny our sinfulness is to reject God's truth, effectively accusing Him of falsehood. When we claim that we have not sinned, we make God out to be a liar, contradicting His revelation that all have sinned and fallen short of His glory. This denial of sin extends not only to past sins but also to present sins committed after conversion. By acknowledging our sins and seeking God's mercy, we demonstrate that His word truly resides within us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If we say that we have not sinned... we make him (God) a liar." 
2. "His word is not in us... It is evident, that to understand the Old Testament by His word, is to miss the connexion."
3. "This final revelation of God includes the Old and New Testament, and all other manifestations of His will to us: and it is this as a whole which we reject and thrust from us if we say at any time that we have not sinned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "we have not sinnedâ€”referring to the commission of actual sins, even after regeneration and conversion... The perfect 'have . . . sinned' brings down the commission of sins to the present time, not merely sins committed before, but since, conversion."
2. "we make Him a liar... by denying His word that all men are sinners"
3. "Our rejection of 'His word' in respect to our being sinners, implies as the consequence our rejection of His word and will revealed in the law and Gospel as a whole; for these throughout rest on the fact that we have sinned, and have sin."

### Albert Barnes:
(1) "The importance of the doctrine of the incarnation of the Son of God, 1 John 1:1-2."
(2) "The intense interest which true piety always takes in this doctrine, 1 John 1:1-2."
(3) "It is an object of ardent desire with true Christians that all others should share their joys, 1 John 1:3-4."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever then tries to escape this charge carries on war with God, and accuses him of falsehood, as though he condemned the undeserving."
2. "We hence learn, that we then only make a due progress in the knowledge of the word of the Lord, when we become really humbled, so as to groan under the burden of our sins and learn to flee to the mercy of God."
3. "Acquiesce in nothing else but in his paternal favor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If we say, the great anti-christian lie is once more repeated, but as usual in a strengthened form, that we have not sinned that we are not in fact sinners, as the result of a life of which sin has been and is the characteristic." 
2. "We contradict the God of holiness; and His revelation, His word of truth, has absolutely no place in us."
3. "Supposing his later testimony concerning the destruction of sin as a principle, and the absence of sin from the regenerate, to be taken in its highest and deepest, that is, in its most natural sense, still all the sanctified avow themselves sinners who need the atonement until probation ends."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is a denial of any specific acts of sin, while in verse 1 John 1:8 we have the denial of the principle of sin." 
2. "The claim to personal perfectionism has two causes, one the stifling of conscience in making God a liar, and the other ignorance of God's word."
3. "God's word is not in us, else we should not make such a claim."

### John Gill:
1. "If we say that we have not sinned,.... Have never sinned, in time past as well as now; deny original sin, and that men are born in sin, but affirm they come into the world pure and holy; and assert that concupiscence is not sin; and so not regarding internal lusts and desires as sinful, only what is external, fancy they have so lived as to have been without sin."
2. "we make him a liar: that is, God, who in his word declares that the wicked are estranged from the womb, and go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies; that his own people are transgressors from the womb; that all have sinned and come short of his glory; and that there is none that does good, no, not one, but all are under sin, under the power and guilt of it, and become filthy by it, and so obnoxious to the wrath of God."
3. "and his word is not in us; either Christ the Word of God, or rather the word of God which declares these things; no regard is had unto it; it 'is not with us', as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it; it is not used and attended to as the rule and standard of truth, but is cast away and despised; at least it has no place in the hearts of such, nor does it work effectually; for, was this the case, they would have other notions of themselves than that of sinless creatures."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet still we are to retain, even to our lives' end, a deep sense of our past sins."
2. "Still if we say, we have not sinned, we make him a liar - Who saith, all have sinned."
3. "And his word is not in us â€” We do not receive it; we give it no place in our hearts."

- Attempt 1 BHT: To deny our own sinfulness is not only a rejection of God's word, but also a denial of His truth and a direct accusation against Him. By claiming that we have not sinned, we make God out to be a liar, contradicting His revelation that all have sinned and fallen short of His glory. This denial of sin extends not only to past sins, but also to present sins committed after conversion. Such a claim displays a stifling of conscience and a lack of understanding of God's perfect word. In truth, we are called to humbly acknowledge our sins and seek the mercy of God, relying solely on His grace for forgiveness. Thus, by aligning ourselves with the truth of God's word and recognizing our need for His forgiveness, we demonstrate that His word is truly within us.
