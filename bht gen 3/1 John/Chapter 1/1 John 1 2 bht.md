# 1 John 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We testify of the vivifying Word, as life has been manifested. The complete divine ideal of life includes impartation, but impartation with a view to the practical development of all that receives it with reference to God as its vivifying, impelling, regulating, and inspiring center. When Christ is preached to us, the kingdom of heaven is opened to us, so that being raised from death we may live the life of God. Jesus Christ is called the Word of life, having everlasting life in himself, the living God.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By the parenthesis John heaps reassurance upon his previous statement of the reality of the Incarnation by the use of εωρακαμεν (as in verse 1 John 1:1) with the assertion of the validity of his 'witness' (μαρτυρουμεν) and 'message' (απαγγελλομεν), both present active indicatives (literary plurals), απαγγελλω being the public proclamation of the great news." 
2. "Taking up ζωη of verse 1 John 1:1, John defines the term by the adjective αιωνιος, used 71 times in the N.T., 44 times with ζωη and 23 in John's Gospel and Epistles (only so used in these books by John). Here it means the divine life which the Logos was and is (John 1:4; 1 John 1:1)." 
3. "Was with the Father (ην προς τον πατερα). Not εγενετο, but ην, and προς with the accusative of intimate fellowship, precisely as in John 1:1 ην προς τον θεον (was with God). Then John closes the parenthesis by repeating εφανερωθη."

### John Gill:
1. "The Word of life, who is life itself, the fountain of life, having it as God, in and of himself, without derivation from, and independent of another, originally and eternally, and who is the cause, author, and giver of life in every sense to others..."
2. "Jesus Christ...so called, because he has everlasting life in himself; as he is the living God, and because he has eternal life for all his people..."
3. "...which phrase is expressive of the eternal existence of Christ, as the Word and Son of God, with his Father, his relation to him, his oneness in nature, and equality with him, and his personal distinction from him..."

### John Wesley:
