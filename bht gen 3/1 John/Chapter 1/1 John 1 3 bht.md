# 1 John 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. Faith realizes what we have not seen as spiritually visible; not till by faith we too have seen, do we know all the excellency of the true Solomon. The true life in man, which comes through the acceptance of Jesus as the Son of God, consists in fellowship with God and with man. This fellowship is a distinguishing mark of Christians rather than something enjoyed by them.
