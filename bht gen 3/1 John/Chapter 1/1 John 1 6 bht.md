# 1 John 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True fellowship with God is only possible for those who walk in the light, avoiding the darkness of sin. This fellowship is the essence of the Christian life, manifesting through both inward and outward actions. Claiming this fellowship while walking in darkness is a lie, for walking in darkness is not doing the truth. Our actions reflect the truth in us, and failing to act truthfully reveals that the truth is not in us. To walk in the light means not only to profess faith in God but to live in accordance with His truth and teachings.

2. "what communion hath light with darkness? or what fellowship can the throne of iniquity, or those in whom sin reigns, have with God? for God is light, and were they partakers of him, or like unto him, or had communion with him, they would consequently be in the light, and not in darkness, and much less walk in it."
