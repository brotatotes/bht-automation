## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice that this walking in the light, as He is in the light, no mere imitation of God, but is an identity in the essential element of our daily walk with the essential element of Godâ€™s eternal being." 
2. "Christian communion is then only real, when it is communion with God."
3. "Whatever sins we may still be betrayed into by the infirmity of our nature and the malice of the devil, from them the Blood of Jesus purifies us day by day."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "WALKING in the light, the element in which God Himself is, constitutes the test of fellowship with Him."
2. "Without having fellowship with God there can be no true and Christian fellowship one with another."
3. "Christ's blood is the cleansing mean, whereby gradually, being already justified and in fellowship with God, we become clean from all sin which would mar our fellowship with God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Walking in the truth; that is, embracing the truth in opposition to all error of paganism and infidelity, and having clear, spiritual views of truth, such as the unrenewed never have." 
2. "The true Christian in his character and feelings resembles God."
3. "There is no stain made by sin so deep that the blood of Christ cannot take it entirely away from the soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We walk, advancing in the light and by means of the light to more light." 
2. "Fellowship with God exhibits and proves itself by fellowship with Christians."
3. "Jesus is the Son of God... Jesus is the Christ... The constituents of the compressed phrase are all used separately by John."

### John Calvin:
1. "It may, however, be asked, 'Who among men can so exhibit the light of God in his life, as that this likeness which John requires should exist; for it would be thus necessary, that he should be wholly pure and free from darkness.' To this I answer, that expressions of this kind are accommodated to the capacities of men; he is therefore said to be like God, who aspires to his likeness, however distant from it he may as yet be." 
2. "For the Apostle here addresses the faithful; as doubtless no man has ever been, nor ever will be, who can otherwise please God, since all are guilty before him; for however strong a desire there may be in us of acting rightly, we always go haltingly to God. Yet what is half done obtains no approval with God. In the meantime, by new sins we continually separate ourselves, as far as we can, from the grace of God. Thus it is, that all the saints have need of the daily forgiveness of sins; for this alone keeps us in the family of God."
3. "The whole of his doctrine has been wickedly perverted by the sophists... For these two things can never harmonize together, to be cleansed by the blood of Christ, and to be cleansed by works: for John assigns not the half, but the whole, to the blood of Christ. The sum of what is said, then, is, that the faithful know of a certainty, that they are accepted by God, because he has been reconciled to them through the sacrifice of the death of Christ. And sacrifice includes cleansing and satisfaction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Walking in the light with God makes possible fellowship with one another and is made possible also by the blood of Jesus."
2. "John is not ashamed to use this word. It is not the mere 'example' of Jesus that 'cleanses' us from sin."
3. "It does cleanse the conscience and life and nothing else does."

### John Gill:
1. "But if we walk in the light...walk on in Christ, the light, by faith, and in the light and truth of the Gospel, and as becomes it...".
2. "This 'as' denotes not equality, but likeness...we all jointly and mutually appear to be like him, and partake of his nature, and have communion with him."
3. "Christ's blood, being applied by the Spirit of God, has been always cleansing from sin...it takes away the sins of believers, and cleanses from them, as fast as the corruption of nature rises, or sins appear."

### John Wesley:
1. "But if we walk in the light...we have fellowship one with another."
2. "We who have seen, and you who have not seen, do alike enjoy that fellowship with God."
3. "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."
