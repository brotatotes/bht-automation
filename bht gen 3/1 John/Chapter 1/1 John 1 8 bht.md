# 1 John 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we confess ourselves as sinners, the truth within us becomes evident, for truth is light itself. This light convicts the darkness, leading us to no longer love or desire to sin, as we experience full forgiveness and purification. Acknowledging our need for cleansing from present sin is a vital part of walking in the light. We cannot deceive God, and to claim that we have no sin is a misguided belief. Instead, we must recognize our sinful nature and our constant need for mercy and forgiveness.
