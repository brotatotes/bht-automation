# 1 John 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The continuance of brotherly love guarantees one's continuance in the light, as the Gospel light not only illuminates the understanding, but also warms the heart into love. In contrast, he who hates his brother is both a stumbling-block to himself and stumbles against everything within and without. Abiding in love means abiding in the light, where there is neither blindness nor occasion of stumbling. Therefore, those who love have an unimpeded path, while those who do not love face both blindness and stumbling.

### John Calvin:
1. "Since love so regards God, that in God it embraces men, there is nothing strange in this, that the Apostle, speaking of love, should refer at one time to God, at another to the brethren."
2. "The whole perfection of life is often said to consist in the love of God; and... the whole law is fulfilled by him who loves his neighbor."

### John Wesley:

2. "And there is no occasion of stumbling in him ‚Äî Whereas he that hates his brother is an occasion of stumbling to himself."
3. "He stumbles against himself, and against all things within and without; while he that loves his brother, has a free, disencumbered journey."
