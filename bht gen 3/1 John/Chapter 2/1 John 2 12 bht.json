This classification aligns with how Jesus referred to His disciples as little sons or dear sons and daughters. The mention of lambs, sheep, sheep in John's Gospel further parallels this classification. The term little children does not refer to age, but rather to the readers in general. They were loyal to the name of Christ and had their sins forgiven. This forgiveness of sins is significant, illustrating the goodness of God and highlighting the importance of training the next generation in the right views of religion. The assurance of forgiveness through Christ is essential, as faith in Him is the foundation of salvation and all blessings. The author writes to the readers, not only conveying the general epistle but also revealing the new commandment of love. It is a reminder that their sins have been forgiven and that this forgiveness extends to all sins.",
