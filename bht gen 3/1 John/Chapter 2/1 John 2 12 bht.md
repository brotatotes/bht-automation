## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He calls ALL to whom he writes, 'little sons' [or] 'dear sons and daughters'; but only in 1 John 2:13; 1 John 2:18 he uses the term 'little children,' or 'infants.'"
2. "Our Lord, whose Spirit John so deeply drank into, used to His disciples (1 John 2:18- :) the term 'little sons,' or dear sons and daughters; but in John 21:5, 'little children.'"
3. "It is an undesigned coincidence with the Epistle here, that in John's Gospel somewhat similarly the classification, 'lambs, sheep, sheep,' occurs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that our past sins are blotted out furnishes a strong reason why we should be holy. That reason is founded on the goodness of God in doing it, and on the obligation under which we are brought by the fact that God has had mercy on us." 
2. "There are reasons in all cases now, as there were then, why this part of a congregation should receive the special attention of a minister of religion. The hopes of a church are in them. Their minds are susceptible to impression. The character of the piety in the next age will depend on their views of religion."
3. "Everything valuable in this world will soon depend on their conduct and character; and who, therefore, can over-estimate the importance of training them up in just views of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "But still we ought ever to take heed, lest the doctrine of faith be smothered, â€” that doctrine which teaches that Christ is the only author of salvation and of all blessings; on the contrary, such moderation ought to be presented, that faith may ever retain its own primacy." 
2. "Without this assurance, religion would not be otherwise than fading and shadowy; nay, they who pass by the free remission of sins, and dwell on other things, build without a foundation."
3. "The material cause is mentioned, lest we should seek other means to reconcile us to God. For it would not be sufficient to know that God forgives us our sins, except we came directly to Christ, and to that price which he paid on the cross for us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were loyal to the name of Christ." 
2. "Are forgiven."
3. "Î¤ÎµÎºÎ½Î¹Î± (little children) probably includes all."

### John Gill:
1. "Now what the apostle says he writes unto them, intends not the epistle in general, but the new commandment of love in particular."
2. "Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake... it reaches to all sins, original and actual, secret and open, past, present, and to come."
3. "It may be, they may be called here 'little children', with a view to their interest in this blessing of grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "I have written to you, beloved children."

3. "Because your sins are forgiven you - As if he had said, This is the sum of what I have now written."
