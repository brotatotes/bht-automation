# 1 John 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To love the world is to hold selfish desires, cherishing avarice or pride, which are contrary to the love of God. It is impossible to genuinely love both the fallen world and God. We are called to flee from the world's temptations and become like Godâ€”holy, just, and wise. By not loving the world, we affirm our love for the Father and reject the lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life that dominate fallen humanity. Seek heavenly things and overcome the world's allurements to find true happiness in loving God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It would seem that the world in both cases is the same, the love is different. In John iii. 16 it is the love of divine compassion and creative and redeeming mercy: here, it is the love of selfish desire, cherishing avarice or pride."
2. "The world is 'man and man's world,' in his and its fall from God."
3. "If any man love the world, the love of the Father (i.e. love to the Father, as opposed to his love to the world) is not in him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Love not the worldâ€”that lieth in the wicked one... carry forward the conquest by not loving it." 
2. "The world" here means "man, and man's world" in his and its state as fallen from God. 
3. "The two, God and the (sinful) world, are so opposed, that both cannot be congenially loved at once."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is only with reference to the word as used in the third sense that the command here can be understood to be applicable, or that the love of the world is forbidden; with reference to the objects sought, the maxims that prevail, the principles that reign in that community that lives for this world as contradistinguished from the world to come."
2. "Neither the things that are in the world - Referred to in the next verse as 'the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.' This explanation shows what John meant by 'the things that are in the world.'"
3. "If, in this sense, a person loves the world, it shows that he has no true religion; that is, if characteristically he loves the world as his portion, and lives for that; if it is the ruling principle of his life to gain and enjoy that, it shows that his heart has never been renewed, and that he has no part with the children of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is impossible for love to the world to coexist with love to God, as it is impossible for light and darkness to coexist."
2. "Evils, Theodorus, can never pass away; for there must always remain something which is antagonist to good."
3. "Wherefore we ought to fly away from earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become like God, as far as this is possible; and to become like Him is to become holy and just and wise."

### John Calvin:
1. "The love of the world is thus severely condemned, because we must necessarily forget God and ourselves when we regard nothing so much as the earth." (68)
2. "Whosoever, then, makes himself thus a slave to earthly lusts, cannot be of God." (68)
3. "What prevail among them are the lusts here mentioned, â€” sensual gratification, avarice, and ambition, the three gods who rule and reign in mankind." (69)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Love not the world... This use of ÎºÎ¿ÏƒÎ¼Î¿Ï‚ is common in John's Gospel and appears also in 1 John 5:19."
2. "The love of the Father... In antithesis to love of the world."
3. "If any man love the world... 'if any keep on loving the world.'"

### John Gill:
1. "This is not their rest, nor dwellingplace, their continuing city, or proper country, that is heaven."
2. "Their evil conversation, and wicked communications, are not to be loved, but abhorred, and their works of darkness are to be reproved."
3. "A man may as soon serve two masters, as serve God and mammon, which he can never do truly, faithfully, and affectionately."

### John Wesley:
1. "Love not the world - Pursue your victory by overcoming the world."
2. "If any man love the world â€” Seek happiness in visible things, he does not love God."
