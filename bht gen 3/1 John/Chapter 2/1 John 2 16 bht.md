# 1 John 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Loving the things of the world and following worldly lusts and pride are not of the Father but of the world. The lust of the flesh involves the indulgence of physical desires, while the lust of the eyes seeks mental pleasure. The pride of life encompasses worldly vainglory and ambition. These three sins encompass all possible sins but originate from the world, not the Father. Worldly desires captivate corrupt hearts like unbridled beasts, enticing individuals away from the purity of the Father's love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Loving the things of the world, he becomes conformed to the world, and following the lusts and pride which are in the world, he himself becomes one of the things in the world." 
2. "Every thing that is in the world...is not of the Father but of the world." 
3. "The inmost kernel of the matter is hereby laid bare, and with it a glimpse is given of the whole process of the love of the world and the love of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Youth is especially liable to fleshly lusts."
2. "The only good of worldly riches to the possessor is the beholding them with the eyes."
3. "The world's awful antitrinity, the 'lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The lust of the flesh - The phrase, 'the lust of the flesh,' here denotes that which pampers the appetites, or all that is connected with the indulgence of the mere animal propensities."
2. "And the lust of the eyes - The object is to refer to the frivolous vanities of this world, the thing on which the eye delights to rest where there is no higher object of life."
3. "And the pride of life - It refers to whatever there is that tends to promote pride, or that is an index of pride, such as the ostentatious display of dress, equipage, furniture, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The lust of the flesh involves the appropriation of the desired object."
2. "It represents a higher type of desire than the desire of the flesh, in that it seeks mental pleasure where the other seeks physical gratification."
3. "The vainglory of life is the vainglory which belongs to the present life."

### John Calvin:
1. "What, then, is the lust or desire of the flesh, but when worldly men, seeking to live softly and delicately, are intent only on their own advantages?"
2. "The lust of the eyes He includes, as I think, libidinous looks as well as the vanity which delights in pomps and empty splendor."
3. "The sum of the whole is, that as soon as the world presents itself, our lusts or desires, when our heart is corrupt, are captivated by it, like unbridled wild beasts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The lust of the flesh" (Œ∑ ŒµœÄŒπŒ∏œÖŒºŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒøœÇ, subjective genitive, lust felt by the flesh) may be illustrated by Mark 4:19; Galatians 5:17. So the genitive with Œ∑ ŒµœÄŒπŒ∏œÖŒºŒπŒ± œÑœâŒΩ ŒøœÜŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒºœâŒΩ (the lust of the eyes) is subjective, lust with the eyes as organs as shown by Jesus in Matthew 5:28. The use of the "movies" today for gain by lustful exhibitions is a case in point."
2. "For Œ±ŒªŒ±Œ∂ŒøŒΩŒµŒπŒ± see on James 4:16, the only other N.T. example. ŒëŒªŒ±Œ∂œâŒΩ (a boaster) occurs in Romans 1:30; 2 Timothy 3:2."
3. "David Smith thinks that, as in the case of Eve (Genesis 3:1-6) and the temptations of Jesus (Matthew 4:1-11), these three sins include all possible sins. But they are all 'of the world' (ŒµŒ∫ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒøœÖ) in origin, in no sense 'of the Father' (ŒµŒ∫ œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒøœÇ)."

### John Gill:
1. "The lust of the flesh; by which is meant, not lust in general, or concupiscence...but some particular one, 'a lust of the body'."
2. "The lust of the eyes: after unlawful objects, and may design unchaste and lascivious looks, eyes full of adultery."
3. "The pride of life...seems to be meant, ambition of honour, of chief places and high titles...or of grand living, for the word signifies not so much life as living."

### John Wesley:
1. "The desire of the flesh ‚Äî Of the pleasure of the outward senses, whether of the taste, smell, or touch."
2. "The desire of the eye ‚Äî Of the pleasures of imagination, to which the eye chiefly is subservient; of that internal sense whereby we relish whatever is grand, new, or beautiful."
3. "The pride of life ‚Äî All that pomp in clothes, houses, furniture, equipage, manner of living, which generally procure honour from the bulk of mankind, and so gratify pride and vanity. It therefore directly includes the desire of praise, and, remotely, covetousness. All these desires are not from God, but from the prince of this world."
