# 1 John 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the time when John wrote, there were antichrists, false teachers who opposed Christ's teachings, indicating it was the last hour. The true nature of these antichrists would be fully revealed when the signs of their coming became clearer. This would occur when the churches needed to recognize them as the ultimate embodiment of the spirit of antichrist. These antichrists represented the ongoing presence of the antichristian principle, concentrated in evil men and evil days, awaiting its consummation in the Antichrists who would personally appear before the Lord's coming.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

(63 words)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The closing period or dispensation; that dispensation in which the affairs of the world are ultimately to be wound up."
2. "[Antichrist] denotes anyone who either was or claimed to be in the place of Christ, or one who, for any cause, was in opposition to him."
3. "The evidence that it was 'the last time,' or the closing dispensation of the world, derived from the appearing of these persons, consists simply in the fact that it was predicted that such persons would appear under the Christian, or the last dispensation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The dominant sense of the expression last days, in the New Testament, is that of a period of suffering and struggle preceding a divine victory."
2. "Antichrist is one who opposes Christ in the guise of Christ."
3. "The prophetic present, equivalent to is about to come."

### John Calvin:
1. "But we see that almost the whole world has been miserably deceived, as though not a word had been said about Antichrist."
2. "The Popes have imagined an Antichrist, who for three years and a half is to harass the Church. All the marks by which the Spirit of God has pointed out Antichrist, clearly appear in the Pope; but the triennial Antichrist lays fast hold on the foolish Papists, so that seeing they do not see."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Each of them uses his own phrases for the distinction: St. Paul speaks of â€˜the present timeâ€™ and â€˜the- coming gloryâ€™ (Romans 8:18), and St. Peter of â€˜the last daysâ€™ or â€˜the last of the days,â€™ and â€˜to be revealed in the last timeâ€™ (1 Peter 1:20; 1 Peter 1:5). St. Johnâ€™s is â€˜the last timeâ€™ here at the beginning of the section, and at the end of it â€˜His appearingâ€™ (1 John 2:28), which closes the â€˜time.â€™"
2. "Our Lord had predicted not one â€˜false Christ,â€™ but â€˜many,â€™ as coming, not immediately before the end of the world only, but from the time of His departure (Matthew 24:4; Matthew 24:24). And St. John pays homage first and pre-eminently to his Masterâ€™s word, referring, however, rather to His â€˜false prophets,â€™ and calling them by a name used only by himself â€˜antichrists,â€™ not as taking the place of Christ, but as opposing Him."
3. "we discern that we are in the last revelation, because side by side go on the development of truth and error concerning the one Person who is the sum of revelation."

2. "The pure apostolic age was now going off, with the doctrines, discipline, and worship of it, which was easy to be discerned by the multitude of antichrists which now appeared."
3. "It may well be thought to be the last time, or near the end of things with us, since almost every heresy is revived among us."
