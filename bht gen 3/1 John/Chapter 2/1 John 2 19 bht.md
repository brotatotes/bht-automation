# 1 John 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These so-called antichrists may have professed to be part of the community of believers, but their departure from the fellowship exposes the falseness of their claims. Just as bad humors are expelled from the body, those who deny the Father and the Son are expelled from true Christian communion. Those who are genuinely called by God will undoubtedly persevere in their faith, while those who fall away demonstrate that they were never truly part of the body of Christ, lacking a genuine and regenerated heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They had not that communion with the Father and the Son in which the communion of Christians with one another really consists, inasmuch as they deny the Father and the Son."
2. "Their very becoming [antichrists] proves the unreality of their Christian profession."
3. "The words set forth an ideal similar to that in [other verses],...neither here can he mean that whoever once inwardly and truly belongs to the communion of believers cannot by any possibility fall from it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are like bad humors in the body of Christ, the Church: when they are vomited out, then the body is relieved; the body of Christ is now still under treatment, and has not yet attained the perfect soundness which it shall have only at the resurrection."
2. "Where God's call is effectual, there will be sure perseverance."
3. "We are either among the members, or else among the bad humors. It is of his own will that each is either an Antichrist, or in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that such persons fall away cannot be adduced to prove that Christians ever fall from grace, for it demonstrates nothing on that point, but proves only that these persons never had any real piety."
2. "The passage before us proves that if any are true Christians they will remain in the church, or will certainly persevere and be saved."
3. "One of the best evidences of true piety is found in the fact of continuing with the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase went out from, may mean either removal or origin." 
2. "His thought rests here rather on fellowship than on the unity of believers as one body." 
3. "They all are not."

### John Calvin:
1. "He, however, denies that they were of them, though they had assumed the name of believers, as chaff though mixed with wheat on the same floor cannot yet be deemed wheat."
2. "To this I answer, that there are three sorts of those who profess the Gospel...the third are those who have the living root of faith, and carry a testimony of their own adoption firmly fixed in their hearts."
3. "He does not then, without reason declare, that where the calling of God is effectual, perseverance would be certain. He, in short, means that they who fall away had never been thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of Christ, but had only a light and a transient taste of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They went out from us, but they were not of us." 
2. "They only declare that such heresy cannot and must not continue in the Christian fellowship." 
3. "The reason of the necessary rejection of heresy is given in the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They went out from our membership... they were not of us in spirit and life." 
2. "If they had been of us... they would have continued with us." 
3. "These antichrists are thus revealed in their true light."

### John Gill:
1. "...there were some persons in the Apostle John's time, who had made a profession of religion, were members of the church, and some of them perhaps preachers, and yet they departed from the faith, and dropped their profession of it, and withdrew themselves from the church..."
2. "...they were of the church, and of the same mind with it, at least in profession, antecedent to their going out...but they were not truly regenerated by the grace of God, and so apparently were not of the number, of God's elect."
3. "...if their hearts had been right with God, they would have remained steadfast to him, his Gospel, truths, and ordinances, and faithful with his saints; for such who are truly regenerate are born of an incorruptible seed..."

### John Wesley:
1. "They were not of us â€” When they went; their hearts were before departed from God, otherwise, they would have continued with us." 
2. "But they went out, that they might be made manifest - That is, this was made manifest by their going out."
