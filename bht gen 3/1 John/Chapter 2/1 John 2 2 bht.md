## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ has...reconciled God and us by nothing else but by His voluntary death as a sacrifice: has by this averted Godâ€™s wrath from us." 
2. "According to the constant usage of Scripture, God is in so far propitious in regard to the sins of men, as He suffers His mercy to prevail instead of his wrath." 
3. "'As broad as the sin extends, so broad the propitiation.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is our all-prevailing Advocate, because He is Himself 'the propitiation'; the propitiatory sacrifice, provided by the Father's love, removing the estrangement, and appeasing the righteous wrath, on God's part, against the sinner." 
2. "Christ's 'advocacy' is limited to believers: His propitiation extends as widely as sin extends."
3. "'The whole world' cannot be restricted to the believing portion of the world. 'Thou, too, art part of the world, so that thine heart cannot deceive itself and think, The Lord died for Peter and Paul, but not for me' [LUTHER]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential thoughts in regard to him... That his will has been disregarded, and his law violated, and that he has reason to be offended with us... That in that condition he cannot... treat us as if we had not done it... That it is proper that, in some way, he should show his displeasure at our conduct... That the means of propitiation come in here... he is reconciled, or appeased, and his anger is turned away."
2. "The amount, then, in regard to the propitiation made for sin is, that it removes all obstacles to reconciliation on the part of God... it removes whatever there was that made it necessary to inflict punishment... it appeases Him, or turns away His anger, or renders Him propitious."
3. "This passage... teaches the following things: That the atonement in its own nature is adapted to all people... it is sufficient in merit for all... it has no special adaptedness to one person or class more than another."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The change from this construction shows, to quote Canon Westcott, 'that the scriptural conception of the verb is not that of appeasing one who is angry, with a personal feeling, against the offender; but of altering the character of that which, from without, occasions a necessary alienation, and interposes an inevitable obstacle to fellowship.'"
2. "The propitiation is as wide as the sin."
3. "It is a patent fact that thou too art a part of the whole world; so that thine heart cannot deceive itself, and think, the Lord died for Peter and Paul, but not for me."

### John Calvin:
1. "The faithful might be assured that the expiation made by Christ extends to all who by faith embrace the gospel."
2. "They who seek to avoid this absurdity have said that Christ suffered sufficiently for the whole world, but efficiently only for the elect."
3. "Then under the word all or whole, he does not include the reprobate, but designates those who should believe as well as those who were then scattered through various parts of the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He himself in his own person, both priest and sacrifice."
2. "Christ himself is the means of propitiation for our sins."
3. "The propitiation by Christ provides for salvation for all if they will only be reconciled with God."

### John Gill:
1. "Not for us only, but for the whole world."
2. "And so it is in this epistle...the sins of the whole world are opposed to our sins."
3. "The design of the apostle in these words is to comfort his 'little children' with the advocacy and propitiatory sacrifice of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he is the propitiation â€” The atoning sacrifice by which the wrath of God is appeased."
2. "For our sins â€” Who believe."
3. "And not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world â€” Just as wide as sin extends, the propitiation extends also."
