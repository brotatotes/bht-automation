# 1 John 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Only those anointed of God in Christ can resist the spirit of Satan, Antichrists, who aim to separate them from the Father and the Son. The Spirit is the token that we are in the Father and in the Son; without it, a man is none of Christ. We can have no share in Him as Jesus unless we become truly Christians and receive the anointing from the Holy One. This anointing is open to all Christians, not just a select few, and is received through Christ, the true sanctuary and our only high priest.
