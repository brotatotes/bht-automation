I wrote to expose the lie and the liar, urging you to act on your knowledge of the truth and not listen to deceivers. No lie is of the truth. I did not write because you are unaware of the truth, but because you already know it. Truth is the index of itself and what is crooked. I have written to confirm your existing knowledge and protect you from the falsehoods spread by these deceivers.
