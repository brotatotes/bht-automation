# 1 John 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Anyone who denies the Son, and thus rejects Christ, also denies the Father. It is through the Son that the Father is made known to us, and only by acknowledging the Son can we have true communion with the Father. The Father has given Himself to us to be enjoyed in Christ, and without accepting the Son, we cannot have the Father. Therefore, confession of Christ is essential for our confession by Christ before the Father. As Calvin reminds us, Our only approach to the Father is by the Son.
