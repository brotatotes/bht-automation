### Albert Barnes:
1. "In maintaining these truths they had the promise of eternal life; in departing from them they had none, for the 'promise' of heaven in our world is made only to those who embrace one class of doctrines or opinions."
2. "The 'promise' of heaven to people is limited to those who repent of their sins, who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and who lead a holy life; and if anyone will base his hope of heaven on a 'promise,' it must be limited to these things."
3. "However people may reason, or conjecture, or hope, the only 'promise' of eternal life is found in the Bible; and the fact that we have such promise should surely be a sufficient inducement to us to hold fast the truth."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of what is said is, that we cannot live otherwise than by nourishing to the end the seed of life sown in our hearts."
2. "John insists much on this point, that not only the beginning of a blessed life is to be found in the knowledge of Christ, but also its perfection."
3. "But no repetition of it can be too much, since it is well known that it has ever been a cause of ruin to men, that being not content with Christ, they have had a hankering to wander beyond the simple doctrine of the gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is the promise...the life eternal." 
2. "Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï‚ ÎµÏ€Î·Î³Î³ÎµÎ¹Î»Î±Ï„Î¿...Î‘Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï‚ is Christ." 
3. "Here 'the promise' is explained to be 'the life eternal'."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the promise that he hath promised us... eternal life." 
2. "Which promise, with all others, was put into the hands of Christ, where, with them, it is yea and amen." 
3. "The sum of the Gospel declaration, that whoever believes in him shall have everlasting life; and this lies in the knowledge of the Father, and of the Son, and in the enjoyment of them, and conformity to them."

### John Wesley:
1. He â€” The Son.
Hath promised us â€” If we abide in him.
