# 1 John 2:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a person does righteousness, it indicates that their source of righteousness is God. This comes from being born again by God, experiencing a new birth that brings forth righteousness. It is important to understand this, as some have mistakenly argued that doing righteousness is the condition for becoming a child of God. Love is a central component of righteousness, and through it, we can perceive that everyone who practices righteousness is born of God. Doing righteousness serves as proof of the new birth and the presence of God's grace within a person.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When therefore a man doeth righteousness, we know, we apprehend, we collect, from our previous knowledge of these truths, that the source of his righteousness is God: that in consequence he has acquired by new birth from God, that righteousness which he had not by nature." 
2. "We argue from his doing righteousness to his having been begotten of God."
3. "The right apprehension of this is the more important because the whole mass of Socinian and Pelagian Commentators have reversed the members of the argument, and made it conclude that doing righteousness is the condition, on our part, of becoming a child of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Love is the grand feature and principle of 'righteousness' selected for discussion."
2. "Ye are already aware that God is righteous, ye must necessarily, thereby, perceive also the consequence of that truth, namely, 'that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of Him.'"
3. "The righteous produceth the righteous. We are never said to be born again of Christ, but of God, with whom Christ is one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Only those who are truly righteous can regard themselves as begotten of Him."
2. "No one who is not, in the proper sense of the term, a righteous man, can have any wellfounded pretensions to being regarded as a child of God."
3. "If we are righteous, in the true and proper sense, doing that which is right toward God and toward people... then we are true Christians."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first argument is, that we are spiritually begotten after the likeness of Christ; it hence follows, that no one is born of Christ but he who lives righteously." 
2. "It is at the same time uncertain whether he means Christ or God... there is nothing inconsistent in the other, that they are born of Christ, who are renewed by his Spirit."
3. "It is the character of Johnâ€™s style that he often passes as it were abruptly from the Son to the Father, and from the Father to the Son... Hence we must conclude that the righteous one spoken of here... is the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He first dilates on its glory as a birth of God; as the design of His love; as including both the privileges and the reality of sonship; as awaiting its full dignity at the revelation of Christ; and as inspiring through hope the energy of personal sanctification." 
2. "By an easy transition he passes to the essential connection between regeneration and brotherly love: showing that the great message to the regenerate was the injunction to love one another; that this involves the abiding difference between the righteous and the unrighteous, between the world and believers, as proved from Cain downwards."
3. "Our love to each other has one supreme standard, the sacrifice of Christ for us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If ye know by intuitive or absolute knowledge that Christ is righteous, then 'ye know' or 'know ye' by experimental knowledge." 
2. "Is begotten, stands begotten, the second birth (regeneration) of John 3:3-8." 
3. "Doing righteousness is proof of the new birth."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, who is righteous as God in his nature and in his works; and as man in his obedience, life, and conversation; and as Mediator, in faithfully discharging the work he undertook." 
2. "Everyone that doeth righteousness... intends such an one who with the heart believes unto righteousness, and lays hold by faith, and lives upon the righteousness of Christ for justification."
3. "Such an one is born of him; either of God, or rather, of Christ; being regenerated by his Spirit, having his grace implanted in him, as appears by his faith in his righteousness and by his works of righteousness, as fruits of faith."

### John Wesley:
1. Every one â€” And none else.
Who practiseth righteousness â€” From a believing, loving heart.
Is born of him â€” For all his children are like himself.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When a person consistently does righteousness, we can know that the source of their righteousness is God. This is because they have been born again by God and possess a righteousness that they did not have by nature. It is important to grasp this truth as there are commentators who mistakenly argue that doing righteousness is the condition for becoming a child of God. Love is the key aspect of righteousness being discussed here, and it is through love that we can perceive that everyone who practices righteousness is born of God. It is noteworthy that we are born again of God, with whom Christ is one, and not directly of Christ. Doing righteousness serves as evidence of the new birth, and those who are truly righteous are the ones who can rightly claim to be begotten of God.
