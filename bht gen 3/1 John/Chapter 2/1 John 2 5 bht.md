### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "There is a gradation: 1 John 2:3, 'know Him'; 1 John 2:5, 'we are in Him'; 1 John 2:6, 'abideth in Him'; respectively, knowledge, fellowship, abiding constancy."

### Albert Barnes:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Divine love in the mission and atoning work of the Son has been exhibited as effecting the forgiveness and sanctification of the soul; but that does not constitute the full knowledge of God in Christ: His love in us attains its perfect operation only when it becomes the full power of a simple and pure obedience to His word; that is its finished work in us." 
2. "By this we know that we are in him: not by spiritual enjoyments; not by ecstatic absorption into the Divine abyss, such as later and degenerate mysticism delighted to describe; but by the power to do His holy will in absolute self-surrender and consecration, do we know that we have union with God." 
3. "The knowledge, the life, the love of Christ is perfected in this, that we live as He lived."

3. "Our love for God, which is realized in absolute obedience."

### John Gill:
1. "In him verily is the love of God perfected... it is to be understood not actively, but passively, of the love wherewith God is loved by his people; and intends not the absolute perfection of it in them, in whom it often waxes cold, and is left, or the fervour of it abated, but the sincerity and reality of it." 
2. "By keeping the word of God, both his truths and his ordinances, it is clearly seen that their love to him is without dissimulation, and is not in tongue only, but in deed and in truth."
3. "Hereby know we that we are in him: in Christ, not merely nominally, or by profession... really, first secretly, through the love of Christ, the election of God, and the covenant of grace, and then openly, in conversion and the effectual calling, through believing in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whoso keepeth his word...is perfected...Hereby we know that we are in him." 
2. "To 'know him,' to be 'in him,' to 'abide in him,' are nearly synonymous terms; only with a gradation,-knowledge, communion, constancy." 
3. "So is the tree known by its fruits."
