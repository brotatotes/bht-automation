3. "New as regards you, because you are newly come from darkness into light: new as regards Him, because He uttered it when He came into the world to lighten every man, and began that shining which even now continues."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The fact that the old commandment is new is true in Him and in us. The fact that the old commandment is new, is true in Him (Christ), since He gave it as a new commandment, and illustrated it by His word and example. It is true in you, since you did not receive it until Christ gave it, and since the person and life of Christ are appealing to you in new lights and with fresh power as your Christian life develops."
3. "The true light is the revelation of God in Christ."

### John Calvin:
