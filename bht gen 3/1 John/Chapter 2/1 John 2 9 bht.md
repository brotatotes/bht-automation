# 1 John 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is a stark contrast between light and darkness, love and hatred, life and death, God and the world. Those who are in fellowship with God walk in the light and in love, while those who are not in fellowship with God walk in darkness and hatred. Love is an essential aspect of the Christian life, especially among brothers and sisters in Christ. Without love for one another, claiming to be in the light is futile. Love is the true rule by which our lives should be formed, and it cannot be separated from the love of God. Therefore, anyone who claims to be in the light but hates their brother is still in darkness, void of Christ and true light.

- Attempt 4 BHT: In the Christian journey, there exists an unmistakable dichotomy between light and darkness, love and hatred, life and death, God and the world. Those who walk in the light and love of God, forming a fellowship with Him, experience a transformation where darkness and hatred are replaced with light and love. The term brother presents a compelling reason to exercise love. However, those who lack fellowship with God and harbor hatred claim to be in the light in vain. This contradiction between their claim and their actions renders them in darkness.
