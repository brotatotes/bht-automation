## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Behold, what manner of love... hath bestowed."
2. "That we should be called children of God... because it did not know Him."
3. "The reality of a believer's sonship of God... are thus necessarily connected together."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All our doing of righteousness is a mere sign that God, of His matchless love, has adopted us as children; it does not save us, but is a proof that we are saved of His grace." 
2. "This love...is not for our works or efforts, but of His grace."
3. "Who so great as God? What nearer relationship than that of sons? The oldest manuscripts add, 'And we ARE SO' really."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Even God could bestow upon us no more valuable token of affection than that we should be adopted into His family, and permitted to regard Him as our Father."
2. "A prince could manifest no higher love for a wandering, ragged, vicious orphan boy, found in the streets, than by adopting him into his own family, and admitting him to the same privileges and honors as his own sons; and yet this would be a trifle compared with the honor which God has bestowed on us."
3. "The people of the world regard us as fanatics or enthusiasts; as foolish in abandoning the pleasures and pursuits which they engage in; as renouncing certain happiness for that which is uncertain; as cherishing false and delusive hopes in regard to the future, and as practicing needless austerities, with nothing to compensate for the pleasures which are abandoned."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Behold [Î¹Î´ÎµÏ„Îµ] . Lit., behold ye. The plural is peculiar... Elsewhere the plural is used of something actually visible."
2. "What manner of [Ï€Î¿Ï„Î±Ï€Î·Î½] . The word is of infrequent occurrence in the New Testament, but is found in all the Synoptists... Originally it means from what country or race; then, of what sort or quality."
3. "The sons [Ï„ÎµÎºÎ½Î±] . Rev., better, children... And such we are [ÎºÎ±Î¹ ÎµÏƒÎ¼ÎµÎ½] . Lit., and we are. Added by Rev., according to the best texts. A parenthetical, reflective comment, characteristic of John."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who acknowledges himself to be one of Godâ€™s children should purify himself."
2. "The more abundantly Godâ€™s goodness has been manifested towards us, the greater are our obligations to him."
3. "Though we may be oppressed by the world, still our salvation remains safe and secure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us: this expression also is peculiar. It is the kind of love that is meant, not its greatness, nor its unmerited goodness." 
2. "The gift of love, nowhere else said to be given, should not be limited in meaning to demonstration or proof or token: it is love itself which is made ours."
3. "The world, not having this gift, understands it not. â€˜The natural man knoweth not the things of the Spirit;â€™ and this secret of regeneration is beyond the search of the unregenerate faculty: life alone understands life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What manner of love (Ï€Î¿Ï„Î±Ï€Î·Î½ Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î·Î½). Qualitative interrogative as in 2 Peter 3:11; Matthew 8:27. Only here in John's writings. Originally of what country or race." 
2. "That we should be called (Î¹Î½Î± ÎºÎ»Î·Î¸Ï‰Î¼ÎµÎ½). Sub-final use of Î¹Î½Î± with the first aorist passive subjunctive of ÎºÎ±Î»ÎµÏ‰, to call or name, as in Matthew 2:23."
3. "Because it knew him not (Î¿Ï„ Î¿Ï…Îº ÎµÎ³Î½Ï‰ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½). Second aorist active indicative of Î³Î¹Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎºÏ‰, precisely the argument in John 15:18."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold what manner of love,.... See, take notice, consider, look by faith, with wonder and astonishment, and observe how great a favour, what an instance of matchless love, what a wonderful blessing of grace..."
2. "the Father hath bestowed upon us: the Father of Christ, and the Father of us in Christ, who hath adopted us into his family, and regenerated us by his grace, and hath freely given us the new name..."
3. "The reason is, because it knew him not; neither the Father, whose sons they are, and who has bestowed the grace upon them; wherefore they know not, and disown and persecute his children..."

### John Wesley:
1. That we should be called â€” That is, should be, the children of God. Therefore the world knoweth us not - They know not what to make of us. We are a mystery to them.
