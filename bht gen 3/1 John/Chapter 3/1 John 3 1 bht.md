# 1 John 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, the kind of love the Father has bestowed upon us. The reality of a believer's sonship of God and the world's ignorance of it are connected. The world's disobedience, rebellion, and hate prevent them from recognizing and loving the children of God. Our righteousness is a sign that God, out of His matchless love, has adopted us. It does not save us, but it is proof that we are saved by His grace. God has given us love itself, not just a gift, by His grace.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Even God could bestow upon us no more valuable token of affection than that we should be adopted into His family, and permitted to regard Him as our Father."
2. "A prince could manifest no higher love for a wandering, ragged, vicious orphan boy, found in the streets, than by adopting him into his own family, and admitting him to the same privileges and honors as his own sons; and yet this would be a trifle compared with the honor which God has bestowed on us."

### John Calvin:
1. "This being so great a favor, the desire for purity ought to be kindled in us, so as to be conformed to his image." 
2. "We are at the same time taught, as I have said, that the adoption of all the godly is gratuitous, and does not depend on any regard to works." 
3. "However, then, we may be oppressed by the world, still our salvation remains safe and secure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold! as an exclamation, and thus standing alone, occurs only here. It is the tranquil expression of adoring wonder."
2. "What manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us: this expression also is peculiar. It is the kind of love that is meant, not its greatness, nor its unmerited goodness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The endowment of the receiver."
3. "An effort to restore the waning enthusiasm of his readers, and to recall them to their first love."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold what manner of love... the Father hath bestowed upon us."
