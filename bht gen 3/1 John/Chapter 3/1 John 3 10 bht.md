# 1 John 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sin of hate is a clear indication of whether one is a child of God or a child of the devil. This distinction is made evident to all by the presence or absence of love for one's brothers and sisters. Love is the distinguishing mark of a child of God, while those who do not love their brothers and sisters show that they belong to the devil. This distinction is apparent in the way one lives their life, and there is no middle ground between the two.
