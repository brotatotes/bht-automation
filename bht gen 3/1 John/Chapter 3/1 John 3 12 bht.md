# 1 John 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Cain's hatred towards his brother Abel was driven by the underlying enmity between the offspring of the woman and the offspring of the serpent. His envy and jealousy over Abel's righteousness led him to commit the act of murder. This revealed Cain's true nature as a child of the devil. The Apostle emphasizes that the only righteousness approved by God is demonstrated through brotherly love, which serves as evidence of our love for God. We should therefore endure patiently when the world unjustly hates us, just as Abel did when he faced hatred for his righteous works.
