# 1 John 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you. Just as Cain hated his own brother to the point of murdering him, the world will hate you in the same way. The world, represented by Cain, feels reproved by your good works and thus reacts with hatred. This hatred is not unusual; it has been this way since the beginning. Therefore, do not be astonished by the world's animosity, but rather embrace it as a common experience for those who live godly lives in Christ Jesus.
