# 1 John 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though the world may hate us, as believers we have a knowledge that surpasses what the world understands. Our love for one another is not the cause but the evidence of our justification and regeneration. Those who lack love reveal that they have not experienced a saving change in their hearts. We, however, have transitioned from spiritual death to life, and our love for the brethren serves as proof of this transformation. Those who do not love their brothers remain in a state of spiritual death and are not born of God.
