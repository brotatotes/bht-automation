# 1 John 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True love is best understood by those who are one with Christ and have felt His love in their own lives. The love of God to us serves as a pattern for brotherly love, and just as Christ laid down His life for us, so we should be willing to do the same for our brothers and sisters. Our lives should not be more precious to us than God's own Son was to Him. Through Christ's sacrifice, we come to know what true love is and should lay down our lives for others.
