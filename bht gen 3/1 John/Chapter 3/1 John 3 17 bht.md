# 1 John 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A person who shuts their heart against their brother's distress cannot possess the love of God. If we are willing to lay down our lives for others, we should also be willing to relieve their smaller distresses. The bowels represent the heart, the seat of compassion. True love for God cannot exist without love for fellow image-bearers. When we assist others, it should be with sympathy and affection, reflecting our love and pity for those in need. How can we claim to love God if we lack compassion for our brethren?

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is then in this unmerciful man not merely the being aware of, but the deliberate contemplation of the distress of his brother."
2. "The fact that a man shuts up his heart against his brother, includes in it the fact that that brother is excluded from the heart thus shut up."

3. "Our superfluities should yield to the necessities; our comforts, and even our necessaries in some measure, should yield to the extreme wants of our brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The general meaning of this verse, in connection with the previous verse, is, that if we ought to be willing to lay down our lives for others, we ought to be willing to make those comparatively smaller sacrifices which are necessary to relieve them in their distresses; and that if we are unwilling to do this, we can have no evidence that the love of God dwells in us."
2. "The bowels, or 'upper viscera,' embracing the heart, and the region of the chest generally, are in the Scriptures represented as the seat of mercy, piety, and compassion, because when the mind feels compassion it is that part which is affected."
3. "How can a man love God who does not love those who bear his image?"

2. "See the vivid picture of a like case in James 2:15." 
3. "It is practical, not speculative, that counts in the hour of need."

### John Gill:
1. "For what a man distributes ought to be his own, and not another's, and in proportion to what he has, or according to his ability."
