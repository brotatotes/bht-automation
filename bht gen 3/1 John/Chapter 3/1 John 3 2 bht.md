# 1 John 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As children of God, though unrecognized by the world, we eagerly await the future revelation of our sonship, which holds an unimaginably glorious inheritance. This manifestation, when we see Christ clearly, will lead to our complete likeness to Him. The vision of Christ has the power to transform us and marks the completion of the glorious process initiated by our new birth. Our present dignity and duty pale in comparison to the indescribable glory that awaits us, where we will be transformed into His image in body, soul, and spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are really sons of God, even now: and we look [this very word ‚Äúnow‚Äù suggesting a future] for an inheritance in virtue of that sonship: it has not been yet manifested of what sort that inheritance shall be: thus much we know"
2. "We know that, if it were manifested (viz. the ‚Äúwhat we shall be;‚Äù this verb takes up again the former one), we shall be like Him"
3. "Because we shall see Him as He is,‚Äîwhich is taken for granted as a Christian axiom,‚Äîit of necessity follows that we shall be entirely like Him: ethically like Him: we shall behold, as Ecumenins says, 'the just, the just One‚Äîthe pure, the pure One.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We now already are really sons, though not recognized as such by the world, and (as the consequence) we look for the visible manifestation of our sonship, which not yet has taken place." 
2. "The 'what' suggests a something inconceivably glorious." 
3. "As the first immortality which Adam lost was to be able not to die, so the last shall be not to be able to die."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Beloved, now are we the sons of God...It is in itself an exalted honor, and may be contemplated as such, whatever may be true in regard to what is to come."
2. "There is enough to animate us with hope, and to sustain us in the trials of life."
3. "To be like Christ is the object of his supreme aim...he wishes to be like the glorified Son of God, and to share his honors and his joys."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In that fact lies the germ of all the possibilities of eternal life." 
2. "The condition of realizing the fact is the manifestation of that glorified state, the revealing of the 'what we shall be'; for that manifestation will bring with it the open vision of the Lord." 
3. "Its brightness is proportioned to the ardor, The ardor to the vision; and the vision Equals what grace it has above its worth."

### John Calvin:
1. "We act very foolishly when we estimate what God has bestowed on us according to the present state of things, but that we ought with undoubting faith to hold to that which does not yet appear."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "we possess this sacred privilege, though the world acknowledge us not; nor look we for anything higher; there can be no greater title in earth or heaven."
2. "‚Äòwe know by certain inference what we know not by actual fact, that, when He appears, our highest hope will be satisfied in our perfect conformity, in body and soul and spirit, to His image."
3. "Lastly, the likeness here spoken of is left indefinite: it is not equality, it is not identification, it is not absorption. It is not the same word which is used concerning the ‚Äòsons of the resurrection ‚Äòwho shall be ‚Äòequal to the angels;‚Äô it is not the same word which is used concerning Christ‚Äôs equality with the Father; but it is the same that is used of His taking the ‚Äòlikeness of man.‚Äô And this most profoundly touches its meaning here. He as a servant was ‚Äòlike as we ARE,‚Äô but He is now glorified. We shall be hereafter ‚Äòlike Him as he is.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We have a present dignity and duty, though there is greater glory to come."
2. "This 'what' suggests something unspeakable, contained in the likeness of God."
3. "The transforming power of this vision of Christ is the consummation of the glorious process begun at the new birth."

### John Gill:
1. "Though they are sons, they do not appear now as such, as they will do, when they shall be introduced into their Father's house, and into the many mansions there prepared for them."
2. "They will then inherit the kingdom prepared for them, and will sit down on a throne of glory, and have a crown of righteousness, life, and glory, put upon them."
3. "This sight, as it is now exceeding desirable, will be unspeakably glorious, delightful, and ravishing, soul satisfying, free from all darkness and error, and interruption; will assimilate and transform into his image and likeness, and be forever."

### John Wesley:
1. "It doth not yet appear ‚Äî Even to ourselves."
2. "What we shall be ‚Äî It is something ineffable, which will raise the children of God to be, in a manner, as God himself."
3. "For we shall see him as he is ‚Äî Manifestly, without a veil. And that sight will transform us into the same likeness."
