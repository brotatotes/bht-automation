# 1 John 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When our own heart condemns us, it serves as a reminder that God, who is greater than our heart and knows all things, also sees our flaws. It is not only the condemning testimony of our conscience but the echo of His voice. We cannot find peace by hiding our sins or hoping for favor from Him. Rather, we must confront our self-accusations and find reassurance in the hands of a God who surpasses us in love, compassion, and understanding.
