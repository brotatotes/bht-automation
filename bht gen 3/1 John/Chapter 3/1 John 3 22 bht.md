## BHT:

The good works of believers are the fruits of the life of Christ in us, recognized and multiplied by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "Not as though our merits earned a hearing for our prayers, but when we are believers in Christ, all our works of faith being the fruit of His Spirit in us, are 'pleasing in God's sight'; and our prayers being the voice of the same Spirit of God in us, naturally and necessarily are answered by Him."

### Albert Barnes:
