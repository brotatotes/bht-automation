This frivolous excuse the Apostle now dissipates, when he defines sin to be a transgression of the divine law; for his object was to produce hatred and horror as to sin.",

It is hence evident, that in the language of John, to do sin, or to sin, means a prevailing or an habitual course of sinning."
