# 1 John 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin is the transgression of God's law and is incompatible with being born again from God. Sin is a missing of the mark, God's will being that mark to be aimed at. It is the violation of the law of our being, the law that encompasses our relationship with God, others, and ourselves. Sin is not just a singular act, but a habit and a course of sinning. All sin, great or small, is ultimately against God himself and is contrary to His law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every one that committeth sin, also committeth transgression-of-law: and sin (abstract and in general) is transgression-of-law." 
2. "The assertion amounts to the identification of the terms, and the is amounts to 'is equivalent to.'"
3. "Every sin whatever then is a transgression of God's law: as indeed its very name in Greek implies: to sin being to miss a mark, and the mark being that will of God which is the law and aim to him who 'doeth the will of God'."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sin is incompatible with birth from God."
2. "Birth from God involves self-purification; where sin is, there is no birth from God."
3. "Sin is a missing of the mark; God's will being that mark to be ever aimed at."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All sin is a violation of the law of God given to man as a rule of life."
2. "The essential idea is, that God has given a law to people to regulate their conduct, and that whatever is a departure from that law in any way is held to be sin."
3. "All law has a penalty; that is, there is some suffering, disadvantage, forfeit of privileges, etc., which the violation of law draws in its train, and which is to be regarded as an expression of the sense which the lawgiver entertains of the value of his law, and of the evil of disobeying it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase to do sin regards sin as something actually realized in its completeness. He that does sin realizes in action the sin that which includes and represents the complete ideal of sin." 
2. "Sin is the violation of the law of our being, the law which includes our threefold relation to God, to the men and things around us, and to ourselves." 
3. "Compare pav oJ aJmartanwn whosoever sinneth (ver. 6). The phrase to do sin regards sin as something actually realized in its completeness."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it is probable that there were then those who extenuated their vices by this kind of flattery, 'It is no wonder if we sin, because we are men; but there is a great difference between sin and iniquity.' This frivolous excuse the Apostle now dissipates, when he defines sin to be a transgression of the divine law; for his object was to produce hatred and horror as to sin."
2. "The import of the passage is, that the perverse life of those who indulge themselves in the liberty of sinning, is hateful to God, and cannot be borne with by him, because it is contrary to his Law."
3. "To do, or to commit, or to work, or to practice, sin, and to sin, are evidently used in the same sense by the Apostle: and to commit or practice sin, according to what he says in his Gospel, (John 8:34,) is the same with being 'the servant of sin.' It is hence evident, that in the language of John, to do sin, or to sin, means a prevailing or an habitual course of sinning."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be pure from sin is to be cleansed from its indwelling; to be righteous is to be conformed to the requirements of law: it is the opposite of â€˜lawlessnessâ€™ here, which contradicts express ordinance, and of â€˜unrighteousnessâ€™ in chap. 1 John 5:17, which is the absence of the internal principle of right." 
2. "The design of the Savior's manifestation was to take away not law, but transgression of law."
3. "The manifestation includes the whole process of Christ upon earth. â€˜In Him is no sin,â€™ of unrighteousness as defined above, which would have prevented His offering from being that of perfect obedience."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sin is lawlessness." 
2. "Doing sin is the converse of doing righteousness."
3. "The present active participle means the habit of doing sin."

### John Gill:
1. "This, in connection with what follows, is true of any sin, great or small, but here designs a course of sinning, a wilful, obstinate, persisting in sin."
2. "Sin is ultimately against God himself."
3. "But then the transgression of what is not the law of God... is no sin, nor should affect the consciences of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever committeth sin...sets his authority at nought."
2. "Thereby transgresseth the holy, just, and good law of God."
3. "For this is implied in the very nature of sin."
