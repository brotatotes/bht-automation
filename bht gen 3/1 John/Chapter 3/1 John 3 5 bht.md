### Henry Alford:
1. "He became incarnate that He might blot it out: He has no stain of it on Himself."
2. "Sin is altogether alien from Christ."
3. "The object of His manifestation is stated not only categorically, but definitively."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "In him is no sin - not 'was,' but 'is,' as in He is righteous and He is pure."
3. "Therefore we are to be so."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument is a clear one, and is perhaps the strongest that can be made to bear on the mind of a true Christian - that the Lord Jesus saw sin to be so great an evil, that he came into our world, and gave himself to the bitter sorrows of death on the cross, to redeem us from it."
2. "The essential argument here is, that the whole work of Christ was designed to deliver us from the dominion of sin, not to furnish us the means of indulgence in it; and that, therefore, we should be deterred from it by all that Christ has done and suffered for us."
3. "An additional consideration to show that we should be holy. As he was perfectly pure and spotless, so should all his followers aim to be; and none can truly pretend to be his who do not desire and design to become like him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Purpose clause with ŒπŒΩŒ± and first aorist active subjunctive of Œ±ŒπœÅœâ as in John 1:29. In Isaiah 53:11 we have Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÜŒµœÅœâ for bearing sins, but Œ±ŒπœÅœâ properly means to lift up and carry away (John 2:16)." 
2. "So in Hebrews 10:4 we find Œ±œÜŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœâ and Hebrews 10:11 œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœâ, to take away sins completely (the complete expiation wrought by Christ on Calvary)." 
3. "And sin (the sinful principle) in him is not."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus Christ, the Word and Son of God, who is here meant, who was with the Father, and lay in his bosom from all eternity, was in the fulness of time made manifest in the flesh, or human nature, by assuming it into union with his divine person."
2. "He did [take away our sins] by taking the sins of his people upon himself, by carrying them up to the cross, and there bearing them, with all the punishment due unto them, in his body; by removing them quite away, and utterly destroying them, finishing and making an end of them."
3. "And this shows that he did not offer himself for any sins of his own, for there were none in him, but for the sins of others; and which consideration, therefore, is a strong dissuasive from sinning, and as such is mentioned by the apostle."

### John Wesley:
1. "To take away our sins ‚Äî To destroy them all, root and branch, and leave none remaining."
2. "And in him is no sin ‚Äî So that he could not suffer on his own account, but to make us as himself."
3. "And ye know that he ‚Äî Christ. Was manifested ‚Äî That he came into the world for this very purpose."
