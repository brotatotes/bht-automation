# 1 John 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly grasp the essence of living in divine communion, we must understand the contrast between the child of God and the child of the devil regarding their attitude towards sin. Sin obstructs our perception and knowledge of Christ, indicating a lack of true spiritual connection. The aim for believers is to abide in Christ, living a sin-free existence. Although believers may still sin, John emphasizes the ideal reality of a life immersed in God's love, where sin and His presence cannot coexist.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nothing short of personal immanence in the personal Christ will satisfy the words: a living because He lives, and as receiving of His fulness."
2. "In the child of God is the hatred of sin; in the child of the devil the love of it; and every act done in virtue of either state or as belonging to either, is done purely on one side or purely on the other."
3. "The cutting off by an act of sin of the sight and knowledge of Christ, shews, and shews in proportion as it prevails, unreality in that sight and knowledge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In so far as he abides in Christ, so far is he free from all sin. The ideal of the Christian. The life of sin and the life of God mutually exclude one another, just as darkness and light." 
2. "All sin as such is at variance with the notion of one regenerated. Not that 'whosoever is betrayed into sins has never seen nor known God'; but in so far as sin exists, in that degree the spiritual intuition and knowledge of God do not exist in him." 
3. "To see spiritually is a further step than to know; for by knowing we come to seeing by vivid realization and experimentally."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It refers to the adherence to the Saviour as a continuous state of mind, or as having permanency; meaning that there is a life of continued faith in him."
2. "He who is born again does not sin habitually, or is not habitually a sinner."
3. "He who is born again will not sin finally, or will not fall away."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To abide in Christ is more than to be in Him, since it represents a condition maintained by communion with God and by the habitual doing of His will." 
2. "John does not teach that believers do not sin, but is speaking of a character, a habit."
3. "Throughout the Epistle he deals with the ideal reality of life in God, in which the love of God and sin exclude each other as light and darkness."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him...except there be newness of life."
2. "Christ is never dormant where he reigns, but the Spirit renders effectual his power."
3. "It may be rightly said of him, that he puts sin to flight, not otherwise than as the sun drives away darkness by its own brightness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "does not keep on sinning."
2. "the one who keeps on sinning" (lives a life of sin, not mere occasional acts of sin as Œ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒ∑œÉŒ±œÇ, aorist active participle, would mean).
3. The habit of sin is proof that one has not the vision or the knowledge (ŒµŒ≥ŒΩœâŒ∫ŒµŒΩ, perfect active also) of Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "Whosoever abideth in him,.... As the branch in the vine, deriving all light, life, grace, holiness, wisdom, strength, joy, peace, and comfort from Christ."
2. "he does not live in sin, nor give up himself to a vicious course of life; for this would be inconsistent with his dwelling in Christ, and enjoying communion with him."
3. "he has never truly and spiritually seen the glory, beauty, fulness, and suitableness of Christ, his need, and the worth of him; he has never seen him so as to enjoy him, and have communion with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever abideth in communion with him, by loving faith, sinneth not - While he so abideth."
2. "Whosoever sinneth certainly seeth him not - The loving eye of his soul is not then fixed upon God."
3. "Neither doth he then experimentally know him - Whatever he did in time past."
