# 1 John 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who practice righteousness show their alignment with God, while those who persist in unrighteousness align themselves with the devil. It is crucial not to be deceived into believing that good works alone justify us before God. Good works are evidence of our righteousness, reflecting the genuineness of our faith. Just as a tree is known by its fruit, a person is known by their good works. Thus, it is important to lead a life that reflects the righteousness we profess, acknowledging it is through God's grace that we are made righteous.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse has absolutely nothing to do with the sense which the Roman-Catholic expositors have endeavoured to extract from it, that good works make us righteous before God."
2. "He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous."
3. "The one man is of God, the other is of the devil."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The tree that bears good fruit is a good tree, and has a living root; not that the fruit makes the tree and its root to be good, but it shows that they are so."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that doeth righteousness is righteous - This is laid down as a great and undeniable principle in religion - a maxim which none could dispute, and as important as it is plain. And it is worthy of all the emphasis which the apostle lays on it."
2. "No matter how any one may claim that he is justified by faith; no matter how he may conform to the external duties and rites of religion; no matter how zealous he may be for orthodoxy... unless he is in fact a righteous man, in the proper sense of the term, he cannot be a child of God."
3. "If he is, in the proper sense of the word, a man who keeps the law of God, and leads a holy life, he is righteous, for that is religion. Such a man, however, will always feel that his claim to be regarded as a righteous man is not to be traced to what he is in himself, but to what he owes to the grace of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Little children."
2. "Doeth righteousness."
3. "He who does what is just and holy cannot be other than just and holy."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle shews here that newness of life is testified by good works; nor does that likeness of which he has spoken, that is between Christ and his members, appear, except by the fruits they bring forth." 
2. "Since it behooves us to be conformed to Christ, the truth and evidence of this must appear in our life."
3. "For many would gladly persuade themselves that they have this righteousness buried in their hearts, while iniquity evidently occupies their feet, and hands, and tongue, and eyes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let no one keep on leading you astray."
2. "He that keeps on doing righteousness."
3. "Christ as in verse 1 John 3:5."

### John Gill:
1. "he that doeth righteousness is he that being convinced of the insufficiency of his own righteousness, and of the excellency and suitableness of Christ's righteousness, renounces his own, and submits to his."
2. "which, though it does not make him righteous in the sight of God, yet it shows him to be righteous in the sight of men, and proves that faith to be right which lays hold on the righteousness of Christ, by which he is truly righteous."
3. "for as a tree is known by its fruits, so is a good man by his good works, and a righteous man by doing righteousness; and as good fruit does not make a good tree, but shows it to be good, so good works do not make a good man, nor a man's own righteousness make him a righteous man, but show him to be so."

### John Wesley:
1. Let no one deceive you â€” Let none persuade you that any man is righteous but he that uniformly practises righteousness; he alone is righteous, after the example of his Lord.
