# 1 John 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who continually sin are children of the devil, for the devil has been sinning continuously since the beginning. The new life of believers, begotten by God through regeneration, is incompatible with sin. Those who imitate the devil become his children through imitation, not by proper birth. On the contrary, Jesus has come to reveal and ultimately destroy the works of the devil. His purpose is to engage in the everlasting battle against Satan, with certain victory in the end. Thus, those who persist in sin reveal their true spiritual lineage and do not belong to God.
