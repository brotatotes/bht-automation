# 1 John 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is not defined by our love for God, but by His love for us. It is not our deserving of love that matters, but rather the historical manifestation of God's love towards us. His ultimate act of love was giving His Son to die for us, even though we were unworthy. This demonstrates the sharp contrast between God's love and our imperfect love. Through this sacrificial love, God reconciled Himself to us and proved His undoubted affection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us."
2. "It is not the nature of our love to God, as contrasted with His to us, of which the clause treats, but the non-existence of the one love as set against the historical manifestation of the other."
3. "His death being therein implied, by which that propitiation was wrought, God's giving His own Son to death for us, being the greatest and crowning act of divine Love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The love was all on God's side, none on ours." 
2. "Not that we loved God‚Äîthough so altogether worthy of love."
3. "He loved us‚Äîthough so altogether unworthy of love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Herein is love - In this great gift is the highest expression of love, as if it had done all that it can do."
2. "Not that we loved God - Not that we were in such a state that we might suppose he would make such a sacrifice for us, but just the opposite."
3. "But that he loved us - Not that he approved our character, but that he desired our welfare. He loved us not with the love of complacency, but with the love of benevolence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Propitiation. See on 2 2.


### John Calvin:
1. "God freely loved us, ‚Äî how so? because he loved us before we were born, and also when, through depravity of nature, we had hearts turned away from him, and influenced by no right and pious feelings."
2. "But the Apostle assumes this as an evident truth, taught in Scripture (of which these profane Sophists are ignorant,) that we are born so corrupt and depraved, that there is in us as it were an innate hatred to God."
3. "We now see that the variety of expressions, which occurs in Scripture, according to different aspects of things, is most appropriate and especially useful with regard to faith. God interposed his own Son to reconcile himself to us, because he loved us; but this love was hid, because we were in the meantime enemies to God, continually provoking his wrath."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sharp contrast as in John 7:22; 2 Corinthians 7:9; Philippians 4:17." 
2. "First aorist active indicative, but B reads Œ∑Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ∑Œ∫Œ±ŒºŒµŒΩ (perfect active, we have loved)." 
3. "Merely predicate accusative in apposition with œÖŒπŒøŒΩ (Son). For the word see 1 John 2:2; Romans 3:25 for ŒπŒªŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ, and for œÄŒµœÅ see also 1 John 2:2."

### John Gill:
1. "Herein it is manifested, as before; this is a clear evidence of it, an undoubted proof, and puts it out of all question."
2. "The love of God is antecedent to the love of his people; it was when theirs was not; when they were without love to him...and therefore was not procured by theirs."
3. "This phrase is expressive of the great love of Christ to his people, and of his substitution in their room and stead; and so it is used among the Jews for a substitution in the room of others."
