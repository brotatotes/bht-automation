# 1 John 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because of God's immense love for us as His children, we have a compelling obligation to love one another. By loving one another, we reflect the same love that we have received from God. This love should not be self-serving or conditional, but rather freely given, just as God's love for us is without limits. We are called to imitate God's love for us and let it motivate us to love our fellow believers and treat them with the same selflessness and compassion that God has shown us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Beloved, if (this if with an indicative, stating a fact, is very difficult to give exactly in English. It is not on the one hand any expression on uncertainty: but neither on the other is it exactly equivalent to 'since,' or 'seeing that.' We may call it a certainty put in the shape of a doubt, that the hearerâ€™s mind may grasp the certainty for itself, not take it from the speaker."
2. "If [it be true that]... is perhaps the nearest English filling up of the sense)"
3. "But on what does the obligation, asserted in we ought, rest? Clearly, on that relation to God and one another implied by being children of God, which runs through all this section of the Epistle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's love to us is the grand motive for our love to one another." 
2. "If we...also...resembling our Father who is love." 
3. "In proportion as we appreciate God's love to us, we love Him and also the brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
2. "Because it is only in this way that we can show that we have his Spirit."
3. "There are much stronger reasons why we should love one another than there were why God should love us; and unless we do this, we can have no evidence that we are his children."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. So [Î¿Ï…Ï„Ï‰Ï‚] . Emphatic. 
We ought. See on 2 6.


### John Calvin:

2. "Our love ought not to be mercenary, when he bids us to love our neighbors as God has loved us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

- Attempt 1 BHT: Because God so loved us, as our Father who is love, we have an obligation to love one another. In fact, it is by loving one another that we show that we have God's Spirit within us. And this love should not be conditional or based on personal gain, but rather it should be freely given, just as God's love for us is freely given. We ought to imitate God's love for us and allow it to influence and engage us to love our fellow Christians and brethren. After all, if God loved them enough to send His Son to die for them, then we too should love them.
