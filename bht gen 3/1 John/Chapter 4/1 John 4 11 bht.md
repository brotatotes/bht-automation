## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Beloved, if (this if with an indicative, stating a fact, is very difficult to give exactly in English. It is not on the one hand any expression on uncertainty: but neither on the other is it exactly equivalent to 'since,' or 'seeing that.' We may call it a certainty put in the shape of a doubt, that the hearerâ€™s mind may grasp the certainty for itself, not take it from the speaker."
2. "If [it be true that]... is perhaps the nearest English filling up of the sense)"
3. "But on what does the obligation, asserted in we ought, rest? Clearly, on that relation to God and one another implied by being children of God, which runs through all this section of the Epistle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "If we...also...resembling our Father who is love." 
3. "In proportion as we appreciate God's love to us, we love Him and also the brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
2. "Because it is only in this way that we can show that we have his Spirit."
3. "There are much stronger reasons why we should love one another than there were why God should love us; and unless we do this, we can have no evidence that we are his children."

### Marvin Vincent:
