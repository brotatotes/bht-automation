### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: If we truly understand and appreciate the magnitude of God's love for us, it will naturally compel us to love one another. The love that comes from God will dwell within us and transform us, prompting us to love our fellow believers. Our understanding of God's love serves as both the motive and measure for our love towards others. As God's children, we are representatives of Him and should reflect His love to the world. Our love for one another should not be conditional or self-seeking, but freely given, just as God's love for us is freely given. Therefore, let us imitate God's love and continuously show love to one another, keeping in mind that we are called to love our neighbors as God has loved us.
