# 1 John 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If it is true that God so loved us, then we ought to love one another. As children begotten of God, His love should be in us, making us love those begotten of Him. Our apprehension of His love to us should be the motive and measure of our love for one another. In proportion to our appreciation of God's love, we love Him and the brethren. Thus, we ought to keep on loving, imitating God's love for us as a way to show that we have His Spirit and that we are His children.
