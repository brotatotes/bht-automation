# 1 John 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If God so loved us, it is only right that we love one another. Our love for others reflects the love of God within us. We are motivated and measured by His love for us. As children of God, we should love our brethren, who represent Him. We ought to imitate His love, which was demonstrated through Christ's sacrifice for us. God's love should inspire us to love one another with the same unmerited and unparalleled love.

- Attempt 1 BHT: If it is true that God so loved us, then it is only fitting that we also love one another. Our love for one another is evidence that we belong to God and have His love within us. It is the love of God, our apprehension of His love for us, that becomes both the motive and measure for our love towards others. Just as God's love towards us is a grand motive for our love towards one another, so should His love be the standard by which we love. The brethren, fellow children of God, serve as representatives of the unseen God. Therefore, if God has loved them to such an extent, even to the point of sending His Son to die for them, then we ought to love them too. It is by imitating God's love, His unmerited and matchless love towards us, that we are prompted and compelled to love one another.
