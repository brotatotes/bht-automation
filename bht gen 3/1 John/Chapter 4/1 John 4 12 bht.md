# 1 John 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love towards one another is the evidence of God's indwelling in us. This love, which is our duty to God, cannot exist without being manifested towards our brethren. By loving one another, we can measure our love for God. When we love one another, God's love is perfected in us and His nature is reflected. If we love one another, it is because of God dwelling in us and the love we bear to the brethren is a token of His love for us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Love one another, I say: for the love to God, which is our duty, is love towards one whom we have never seen, and cannot exist in us unless by and with its lower degrees as manifested towards our brethren whom we have seen."
2. "By our love to them [our brethren] are we to know, how far we have love to Him: if that be present, He dwelleth in us, and 'the love of Him is perfected in us.'"
3. "The love of Him is perfected in us" means that it has reached its full maturity, with loving one another being the token and measure of it.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God, whom no man hath seen at any time, hath appointed His children as the visible recipients of our outward kindness which flows from love to Himself." 
2. "If we love one another, God dwelleth in usâ€”for God is love; and it must have been from Him dwelling in us that we drew the real love we bear to the brethren." 
3. "His loveâ€”rather, 'the love of Him,' that is, 'to Him,' evinced by our love to His representatives, our brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He has never indeed been seen by mortal eyes. We are not, then, to expect to become acquainted with what he is in that way. But there is a method by which we may be assured that we have a true knowledge of him, and that is, by evidence that we love another, and by the presence of his Spirit in our hearts." 
2. "Though we cannot see him, yet there is a way by which we may be assured that he is near us, and that he even dwells in us. That way is by the exercise of love." 
3. "Our love for each other is the proper exponent of love to him reigning in our hearts. Unless it produced this effect, it would be defective or incomplete."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God hath no man ever yet seen."
2. "His love. Not our love to Him, nor His love to us, but the love which is peculiarly His; which answers to His nature."


### John Calvin:
1. "He speaks, however, first of love, when he says, that God dwells in us, if we love one another; for perfected, or really proved to be, in us is then his love; as though he had said, that God shews himself as present, when by his Spirit he forms our hearts so that they entertain brotherly love."
2. "The sum, then, of what is said is, that since love is from the Spirit of God, we cannot truly and with a sincere heart love the brethren, except the Spirit puts forth his power. In this way he testifies that he dwells in us."
3. "On the other hand, whosoever boasts that he has God and loves not the brethren, his falsehood is proved by this one thing, because he separates God from himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The invisibility of God as the object of love."
2. "His invisible indwelling nevertheless."

3. "Mutual love is a sign of the indwelling of God in men."

### John Gill:
1. "No man hath seen God at any time... 
but here the sense is, that whereas God is invisible in his nature, and incomprehensible in his being and perfections, so that there is no coming to him, and seeing of him, and conversing with him in a familiar way, and so not of loving him as he is in himself, and ought to be loved, as one friend sees, converses with, and loves another, and finds his love increased by sight and conversation; then we ought to love the saints and people of God, who are visible..."
2. "...for such who love one another, as they appear to have the Spirit of God, of which that grace is a fruit, so they are by the Spirit built up a fit habitation for God, and by which Spirit he dwells in them; and such may expect the presence of God, for they who live in peace, the God of love and peace shall be with them..."
3. "...but the love with which God is loved is here designed; and it is called his, because he is both the object and the author of it; and this is no effect as to degrees; yea, sometimes, instead of abounding and increasing, it goes back, it is left, and waxes cold; and it will not have its completion till the saints come to heaven, and then it will be in its full perfection and glory..."

### John Wesley:
1. If we love one another, God abideth in us â€” This is treated of, 1 John 4:13-16.
And his love is perfected â€” Has its full effect.
In us â€” This is treated of, 1 John 4:17-19.
