# 1 John 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By giving us His Holy Spirit as a testimony of His presence within us, we can be assured that we are abiding in God and He in us. This gift from God serves as evidence of our fellowship with Him and our dwelling in Him. It is through the Spirit that God dwells in His people, and through faith and love upon Him that we dwell in Him. The Spirit is a shared dwelling among believers, given to us by God in the measure He sees fit, and allows us to experience His love and grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this we know that we are abiding in Him and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit."
2. "Of this fact, when thus loving, we need a token. Him we cannot see: has He given us any testimony of His presence in us? He has given us such a testimony, in making us partakers of His Holy Spirit."
3. "It is obvious that all inferences from the expression 'given us of His Spirit' against the personality of the Holy Ghost are quite beside the purpose."

3. "In Jesus alone the Spirit dwelt without measure."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "one of the clearest evidences which we can have that we are the children of God, is derived from the influences of that Spirit on our hearts."

2. "This gift of God is proof of our fellowship with God."

### John Gill:
