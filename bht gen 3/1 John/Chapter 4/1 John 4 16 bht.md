# 1 John 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True faith is a faith of knowledge and experience, a knowledge of faith. It is an understanding that God is Love. Through this faith, believers become a sphere where the love of God operates, as God dwells in us. Love is inherently connected with faith, as wherever God abides, love ought to be there. Through the same Spirit, we come to know and believe in the all-encompassing love that God has for us.
