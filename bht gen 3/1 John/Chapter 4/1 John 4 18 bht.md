# 1 John 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The perfect, all-encompassing love that we experience when we know God casts out fear entirely. Fear brings torment and apprehension, always revolving around the punishment we may deserve. However, when love is perfected, fear is expelled from the sphere of love's fellowship. This kind of dread is the opposite of the boldness and confidence that love provides. Ultimately, love delivers us from distressing apprehensions, granting us a peaceful calmness that fear can never touch.
