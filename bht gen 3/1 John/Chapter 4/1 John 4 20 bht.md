# 1 John 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How can one claim to love God, whom they have not seen, if they fail to love their brother, whom they see every day? If someone declares, I love God, and yet harbors hatred for their brother, they are lying. For if they do not love their brother, whom they see, how can they possibly love God, whom they cannot see? It is easier for us to love that which is visible to our senses. Yet, the true test of our love for God lies in our love for our fellow human beings.
