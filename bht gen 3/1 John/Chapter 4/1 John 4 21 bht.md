# 1 John 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we claim to love God but hate our brother or sister, we are deceiving ourselves. God has given us the commandment to love Him and our neighbor, and this commandment comes directly from Him. True love for God means willingly doing what He desires, and this includes loving our brothers and sisters. This commandment to love our brother or sister is equally as important as the command to love God. Therefore, we must not only have love for God, but also for our fellow human beings because they too bear the image of God.

- Attempt 1 BHT: If we claim to love God but hate our brother or sister, we are deceiving ourselves. God has given us the commandment to love Him and our neighbor, and this commandment comes directly from Him. True love for God means willingly doing what He desires, and this includes loving our brothers and sisters. Just as Christ asked Saul why he persecuted Him, even though He had ascended into heaven, we are reminded that the way we treat others reflects our love for God. This commandment to love our brother or sister is equally as important as the command to love God. Therefore, we must not only have love for God, but also for our fellow human beings because they too bear the image of God. May we avoid the trap of bigotry, which is a lack of pure and universal love, by loving others not for our own sake, but for the sake of Christ.
