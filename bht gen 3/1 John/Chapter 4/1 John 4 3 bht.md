# 1 John 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not of God and represents the antichrist that has already emerged. This spirit is embodied in false prophets who refuse to confess Jesus in His humanity and all His offices and divinity. It is important to be vigilant as the Church was forewarned about these antichrists. Therefore, it is vital to recognize and reject any doctrine that denies the truth of who Jesus is and what He has accomplished through His obedience, sufferings, and death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If he was not a man, then all that occurred in his life, in Gethsemane, and on the cross, was in 'appearance' only, and was assumed only to delude the senses. There were no real sufferings; there was no shedding of blood; there was no death on the cross; and, of course, there was no atonement." 
2. "A mere show, an appearance assumed, a vision, could not make atonement for sin; and a denial, therefore, of the doctrine that the Son of God had come in the flesh, was in fact a denial of the doctrine of expiation for sin."
3. "John here refers not to an individual who should be known as antichrist, but to a class of persons. This does not, however, forbid the idea that there might be some one individual, or a succession of persons in the church, to whom the name might be applied by way of eminence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Confesseth not Jesus." 
2. "The simple Jesus emphasizes the humanity of our Lord considered in itself."
3. "This non - confession, summed up in all its manifestations."

### John Calvin:

2. "Justly then did they dread the name as something base and ominous."
3. "He means that it was already in the world, because it carried on in secret its iniquity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The prophecy had found fulfilment before the Church had looked for it" (Westcott).
2. "It is a repetition of the point about antichrists made in 1 John 2:18-25."
3. "Many MSS. have here also ŒµŒΩ œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ ŒµŒªŒ∑ŒªœÖŒ∏ŒøœÑŒ± repeated from preceding clause, but not A B Vg Cop. and not genuine."

### John Gill:
1. "And every spirit that confesseth not,.... The proper deity and sonship of Christ, his true and real humanity, and his Messiahship; or any of his offices, doctrines, and ordinances; or his satisfaction and righteousness; or that peace, pardon, justification, life, and salvation, are by him; all which are meant by what follows."
2. "that separates the two natures, human and divine, in him, and makes two persons of them; or denies either of them, either that he is truly God, or really man, or denies him to be Jesus, the Saviour; who, as much as in him lies, destroys his person, office, and work, and makes void his obedience, sufferings, and death."
3. "every doctrine that is calculated against these truths is the spirit and doctrine of antichrist."

### John Wesley:
