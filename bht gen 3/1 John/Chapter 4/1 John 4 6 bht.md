## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He that knoweth (apprehendeth: hath any faculty for the knowledge of. The Apostle sets him that knoweth God in the place of him that is of God, as belonging more immediately to the matter in hand, the hearing, and receiving more knowledge. This knowing God, the apprehension and recognition of God, is the peculiar property of God‚Äôs children, not any natural faculty in which one unrenewed man differs from another) God heareth us."
2. "The Apostle is giving a test to distinguish, not the children of God from those who are not children of God, but the spirit of truth from the spirit of error...It is evident then that these two terms here, 'he that knoweth God,' and 'he that is not of God,' represent two patent, matters of fact,‚Äîtwo classes open and patent to all: one of them identical with the world above: the other consisting of those of whom it is said...Ye know the Father.‚Äù
3. "The passage is in connexion with what went before, but by links at first sight not very apparent...The knoweth God, is and hath been begotten of God, the taking up again of God‚Äôs love to us in Christ...all serve to shew that we are reading no collection of spiritual apophthegms, but a close and connected argument, though not in an ordinary style."

3. "They who do not receive the plain doctrines laid down in the word of God, whatever pretensions they may make to piety, or whatever zeal they may evince in the cause which they have espoused, can have no well-founded claims to the name Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that knoweth [Œø Œ≥ŒπŒΩœâœÉŒ∫œâŒΩ] . Lit., the one knowing : he who is habitually and ever more clearly perceiving and recognizing God as his Christian life unfolds." 
2. "The former marks the residing or consisting of the essence or truth of a thing in something the apprehension of which conveys to us the essential nature of the thing itself."
3. "The spirit of error [œÑŒø œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ œÄŒªŒ±ŒΩŒ∑œÇ] . The phrase occurs nowhere else in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:

2. "To revere God‚Äôs word is the only true evidence that we fear him."
3. "When false spirits pretend the name of God, we must inquire from the Scriptures whether things are so."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is a touch of mysticism here, to be sure, but the heart of Christianity is mysticism (spiritual contact with God in Christ by the Holy Spirit)."
2. "The power of recognition (Œ≥ŒπŒΩœâœÉŒ∫ŒøŒºŒµŒΩ, we know by personal experience) belongs to all believers."
3. "Rejection of the truth may be due also to our not speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15)."

### John Gill:
1. "They were not of the world, and therefore did not speak of the world, nor things suited to worldly men...they spoke the words of God." 
2. "He that knows God...heareth us: not only externally, constantly attending on the ministry of the word, but internally, understanding what is heard, receiving it in love, cordially embracing it, and firmly believing it, and acting according to it."
3. "Spirits, or men pretending to the Spirit of God, may be known in a great measure by their followers...they who have the spirit of truth, and are of God, they are heard and approved of, and embraced by spiritual men, by such who know God in Christ, and have tasted that the Lord is gracious."

### John Wesley:
1. We ‚Äî Apostles.
Are of God ‚Äî Immediately taught, and sent by him.
Hereby we know ‚Äî From what is said, 1 John 4:2-6.
