# 1 John 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love, the sum of righteousness, is the test of our being born of God. All love is from God, especially that embodiment of love in Jesus. The Holy Spirit sheds love as its first fruit in our hearts. True love, not just claimed, but persistent, proves that we have been begotten of God and know Him. However, if we claim to love God but hate our brother, it is a lie. Let us, therefore, show mutual love to one another, as it is the evidence of our regeneration and the true knowledge of God's love.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Love is the ultimate expression of righteousness and a test of our connection to God. It is a divine attribute that flows from God, especially manifested in Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit infuses our hearts with love as its first fruit. Even human love is a reflection of the Divine nature. When we persist in loving others, it demonstrates that we have been born of God and have an intimate relationship with Him. On the other hand, claiming to love God while harboring hatred towards others is a lie. Therefore, let us not only love those who love us in return but also extend mutual love to all believers, for this is the evidence of our regeneration and the true knowledge of God's love working through us.
