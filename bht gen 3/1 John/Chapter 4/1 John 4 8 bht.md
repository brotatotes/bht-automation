# 1 John 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is love. Love is the essence of God, co-essential with Him. He that does not love does not know God because God is love. Those who do not love never knew what love is for God is loving. God's love is not merely an attribute, but His very essence. Those who do not love have no acquaintance with God, never did get acquainted with Him. God is love; it is His darling, His reigning attribute that sheds an amiable glory on all His perfections.

2. "Knoweth not God (Î¿Ï…Îº ÎµÎ³Î½Ï‰ Ï„Î¿Î½ Î¸ÎµÎ¿Î½). Timeless aorist active indicative of Î³Î¹Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎºÏ‰, has no acquaintance with God, never did get acquainted with him."
