# 1 John 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. This is because Jesus is the only true Savior and the Son of God, who reveals the way of salvation to us. If we want to show our love for God, we must also love our brothers and sisters in Christ, because they are born of God just as we are. This love is not merely an intellectual conviction, but a demonstration of our surrender to Jesus as Lord and Savior. Through faith, we are regenerated and adopted as sons and daughters of God, and this love for our fellow believers is the proof of our love for God our Father.

1. "To believe that Jesus is the Christ, or the Messiah, is not barely to give an assent to this truth, or to acknowledge it;...but whereas his work and business, as the Christ of God, was to bring in an everlasting righteousness, to procure the remission of sin, and to make peace and reconciliation for it, and to obtain eternal salvation; true faith in him as the Messiah is a believing with the heart unto righteousness, or a looking to, and trusting in the righteousness of Christ for justification..."

### John Wesley:
1. "The scope and sum of this whole paragraph appears from the conclusion of it... So faith is the first and last point with St. John also."
2. "Every one who loveth â€” God that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him - Hath a natural affection to all his brethren."
