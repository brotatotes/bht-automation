# 1 John 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having the Son is to possess Christ by faith, evidenced by the Spirit, the water, and the blood. It is the present reality and vitality of life in Him. Faith allows believers to say, I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine. Through faith, they possess Christ and the life that accompanies Him, both in the present and in the future. This life is not solely physical but also spiritual, a blessed and eternal union of the soul with God. Those who lack the Son do not have this life.

1. "He that hath the Son, hath the life: he that hath not the Son of God, the life hath he not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To have the Son is to be able to say as the bride, 'I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Son of God. Hath the Son, hath not the Son of God, pointing back to God as the giver of life in His Son."
2. "The verse has two clauses: in the former, of God is not added, because believers know the Son; in the other it is added, that unbelievers may know at length how serious it is not to have Him."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: To possess the Son is to truly have Christ through faith, evidenced by the Spirit, the water, and the blood, while possessing life means to actually experience and possess the vitality and reality of it. It is important to note that this verse does not directly address the question of whether salvation is exclusively limited to those who have heard of Christ, as that requires further consideration. However, having the Son is to be able to claim, like a bride, I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine. Through faith, believers have Christ as a present possession and with Him, they have life in its entirety, both now and in the future. This life is not solely physical, but also spiritual, encompassing the union of the soul with God, and it is an eternal and blessed state. Those who possess the Son have life, but those who lack the Son do not have this life.
