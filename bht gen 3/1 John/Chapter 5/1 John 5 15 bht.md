# 1 John 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We can have full assurance that our prayers are heard and answered according to God's will. When we humbly and trustingly ask for forgiveness for a sin not unto death, it is an expression of our brotherly love, whereas requesting forgiveness for a sin unto death would be presumptuous. Our past prayers offered in faith are not lost, and we can rejoice over them even before they are answered. We can have confidence that our prayers are already answered, even if the precise outcome is not immediately visible.

- Attempt 1 BHT: We can have full assurance that our prayers are heard and answered according to God's will. When we humbly and trustingly ask for forgiveness for a sin not unto death, it is an expression of our brotherly love and alignment with God's desires. However, to request forgiveness for a sin unto death would be presumptuous and outside the scope of our brotherly yearning. Our past prayers offered in faith are not lost but are kept by God, and we can rejoice over them as if granted even before they are answered. We can be confident that our prayers are already answered, even if we may not immediately see the precise outcome we desire. Our prayers are heard, and they will be answered in the way best suited for our good, in God's timing.
