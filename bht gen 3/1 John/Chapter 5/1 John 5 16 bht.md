# 1 John 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believer's intercession obtained its restoration, but should not assume authority in requesting for a sin unto death as it would be presumptuous. Whatever breaks fellowship between the soul and Christ is unto death, for there is no life apart from Christ. While John does not forbid praying for such cases, he does not command it, leaving them to God. The unpardonable sin is hard to define, and we cannot determine with certainty if someone has committed it. We should never despair of the conversion of any through prayer and God's grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The believer's intercession obtained its restoration."
2. "The Christian intercessor for his brethren shall not assume the authority which would be implied in making request for a sinner who has sinned the sin unto death."
3. "To 'request' for a sin unto death [intercede, as it were, authoritatively for it, as though we were more merciful than God] would savor of presumption."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was clearly but one sin that was unpardonable - 'there is a sin unto death;'".
2. "The same thing is true now. It is not easy to define the unpardonable sin, and it is impossible for us to determine in any case with absolute certainty that a man has committed it."
3. "Let us remember the cases of Manasseh, of Saul of Tarsus, of Augustine, of Bunyan, of Newton, of tens of thousands who have been reclaimed from the vilest forms of iniquity, and then let us never despair of the conversion of any, in answer to prayer, who may have gone astray, as long as they are in this world of probation and of hope."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Whatever breaks the fellowship between the soul and Christ, and, by consequence, between the individual and the body of believers, is unto death, for there is no life apart from Christ."
2. "It must be carefully born in mind in the study of the passage, that John is speaking of sinful acts as revelations of character, and not simply in themselves."
3. "Prayer even for this sin unto death is not forbidden, but John says that he does not enjoin it."

### John Calvin:
1. "But the sense will still be the same, that the prayers of the faithful so far avail as to rescue a brother from death." 
2. "For he denies that sins are to death, not only those by which the saints daily offend, but even when it happens that God‚Äôs wrath is grievously provoked by them. For as long as room for pardon is left, death does not wholly retain its dominion."
3. "This, indeed, is what I allow, and what is evident beyond dispute from this passage; but as this very seldom happens, and as God sets before us the infinite riches of his grace, and bids us to be merciful according to his own example, we ought not rashly to conclude that any one has brought on himself the judgment of eternal death; on the contrary, love should dispose us to hope well."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Most sins are not mortal sins, but clearly John conceives of a sin that is deadly enough to be called 'unto death.'" 
2. "This distinction is common in the rabbinic writings and in Numbers 18:22 the LXX has ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒπŒΩ Œ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩ Œ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÑŒ∑œÜŒøœÅŒøŒΩ 'to incur a death-bearing sin' as many crimes then and now bear the death penalty."
3. "John does not forbid praying for such cases; he simply does not command prayer for them. He leaves them to God."

### John Gill:
1. "None of the sins of God's elect are unto death, or issue in death, in fact; which is owing not to any different nature there is in their sins, or to their good works which counterbalance them; but to the grace of God, and to the blood and righteousness of Christ, by which they are pardoned and justified, and freed from obligation to punishment, or eternal death, the just demerits of them." 
2. "How should another man know that a brother's sin is not unto death, when it is of the same nature and kind with another man's? It is known by this, that he does not continue in it; he does not live in the constant commission of it; his life is not a course of iniquity; that sin he sins is not a governing one in him."
3. "There is a sin unto death; which is not only deserving of death, as every other sin is, but which certainly and inevitably issues in death in all that commit it, without exception; and that is the sin against the Holy Ghost, which is neither forgiven in this world nor in that to come, and therefore must be unto death."

### John Wesley:
1. "This extends to things of the greatest importance."
2. "Let him ask, and God will give him life."
3. "There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for that."
