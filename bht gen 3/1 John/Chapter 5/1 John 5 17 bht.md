# 1 John 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin, encompassing all unrighteousness, is a large word that includes both believers' and non-believers' wrongdoings. The sin unto death refers to an act that leads to eternal death, specifically the denial of Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God. Every breach of duty and unrighteous act is a manifestation of sin. The chief sin is the one that destroys faith and love, which are fundamental commandments. However, not all sins are unforgivable; in Christ, weak believers can find forgiveness for their sins.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "SIN is a large word, comprehending all unrighteousness whatever: whether of God's children, or of aliens from Him."
2. "The death and the life of the passage must correspond...this sin unto death being thus a sin leading to eternal death."
3. "The denial that Jesus is the Christ, the incarnate Son of God...is sin unto death. This alone of all the proposed solutions seems to satisfy all the canons above laid down."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every unrighteousness (even that of believers, compare 1 John 1:9; 1 John 3:4. Every coming short of right) is sin."
2. "The sin unto death must be one tending 'towards' death. ALFORD makes it to be an appreciable ACT of sin, namely, the denying Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of God."
3. "The chief commandment is faith and love. Therefore, the chief sin is that by which faith and love are destroyed. In the former case is life; in the latter, death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Everything, he says, which is unrighteous...is to be regarded as sin; but we are not to suppose that all sin of that kind is of such a character that it cannot possibly be forgiven." 
2. "There are many who commit sin who we may hope will be recovered, and for them it is proper to pray."
3. "While there is one such sin, there are multitudes that may be pardoned, and that for them it is our duty unceasingly to pray."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unrighteousness [Œ±Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ±] . This is the character of every offense against that which is right."
2. "Every breach of duty is a manifestation of sin."
3. "Sin is defined as ajnomia lawlessness, and lawlessness as sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though all unrighteousness is sin, yet every sin is not unto death."
2. "As sin is every unrighteousness, hence it follows that every sin is not unto death."
3. "I, however, am more disposed to embrace the first or the second explanation; and as the result is nearly the same, I leave it to the judgment of readers to determine which of the two is the more appropriate."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All unrighteousness is sin (œÄŒ±œÉŒ± Œ±Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ± Œ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ± ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ). Unrighteousness is one manifestation of sin as lawlessness (1 John 3:4) is another (Brooke)."
2. "The world today takes sin too lightly, even jokingly as a mere animal inheritance."
3. "Sin not unto death can be overcome in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "All unrighteousness against God or man is a sin against the law of God, and the wrath of God is revealed against it, and it is deserving of death."
2. "Yet all unrighteousness is not unto death, as the sins of David, which were unrighteousness both to God and man, and yet they were put away, and he died not."
3. "This is added for the relief of weak believers, who hearing of a sin unto death, not to be prayed for, might fear that theirs were of that kind, whereas none of them are; for though they are guilty of many unrighteousnesses, yet God is merciful to them and forgives."

### John Wesley:
1. All deviation from perfect holiness is sin; but all sin is not unpardonable.
