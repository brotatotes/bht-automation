## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We know (see summary above) that we (not emphatic. It is not the object now to bring out a contrast, but to reassert solemnly these great axioms of the Christian life) are of God..."
2. "...the whole world lieth in the wicked one (this second member of the sentence does not depend on the preceding that, but like those of vv. 18, 20, is an independent proposition..."
3. "...the world is the negation of faith in Him, and as such lies in the wicked one, His adversary)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The world lieth in the wicked one, as the resting-place and lord of his slaves."
2. "While the believer has been delivered out of his power, the whole world lieth helpless and motionless still in it."
3. "Including the wise, great, respectable, and all who are not by vital union in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The term 'world' here evidently means not the material world, but the people who dwell on the earth, including all idolaters, and all sinners of every grade and kind."
2. "That this is the meaning of the apostle seems to be clear, because: (1) The corresponding phrase, 1 John 5:20, 'in him that is true,' is evidently to be construed in the masculine, referring to God the Saviour, and meaning 'him that is true,' and not that we are 'in truth.'"
3. "The dominion is complete, and body and soul, individuals and nations, are entirely subject to his will. This striking expression will not unaptly now describe the condition of the pagan world, or of sinners in general."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "While we are from God, implying a birth and a proceeding forth, and a change of state, the kosmos, the world, all the rest of mankind, remains in the hand of the evil one."
2. "The word is stronger than esti is, indicating the passive, unprogressive state in the sphere of Satan's influence."
3. "The expression to lie in has a parallel in Sophocles' 'Antigone': ejn uJmin gar wJv Qew keimeqa tlamonev "

### John Calvin:
1. "The meaning is, that as we have been born of God, we ought to strive to prove by our separation from the world, and by the sanctity of our life, that we have not been in vain called to so great all honor."
2. "Then, in order to be well prepared for the contest, these two things must be borne in mind, that the world is wicked, and that our calling is from God."
3. "The faithful ought to study self-denial; and since nothing is seen in the world but wickedness and corruption, they must necessarily disregard flesh and blood that they may follow God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is a terrible picture of the Graeco-Roman world of the first century A.D., which is confirmed by Paul in Romans 1 and 2 and by Horace, Seneca, Juvenal, Tacitus."
2. "Of God (ŒµŒ∫ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ). See 1 John 3:10; 1 John 4:6 for this idiom."
3. "Lieth in the evil one (ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅœâ Œ∫ŒµŒπœÑŒ±). Present middle indicative of the defective verb Œ∫ŒµŒπŒºŒ±, to lie, as in Luke 2:12. Œ†ŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅœâ is masculine, like Œø œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅŒøœÇ in verse 1 John 5:18."

### John Gill:
1. "The sons of God, and regenerated by him; this is known by the Spirit of God, which witnesses to the spirits of the saints that they are the children of God."
2. "The men of the world, the greater part of the inhabitants of it, who are as they were when they came into it, not being born of God; these are addicted to sin and wickedness."
3. "They are under his (Satan's) influence, and led according to his will, and they are governed by him, and are at his beck and command."

2. "But the whole world...lieth in the wicked one."
3. "In this short expression the horrible state of the world is painted in the most lively colours."
