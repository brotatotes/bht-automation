# 1 John 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our love towards our fellow believers is not only a sign of our love for God, but it is also a necessary condition for our love towards God. The presence of one kind of love implies the presence of the other. Love for our brothers and sisters in Christ is a test and demonstration of our love for God. This love is prior in nature, and its existence is revealed when we exercise love and obedience towards God. Whenever we continue to love God and keep His commandments, we can be assured of our love for His children.
