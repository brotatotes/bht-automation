## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "HE IS HERE‚Äîall is full of Him‚ÄîHis incarnation, work, and abiding
presence, is to us a living fact" [ALFORD].
2. "This Jesus Christ (the last-named Person) is the true God" (identifying Him thus with the Father in His attribute, "the only true God," John 17:3, primarily attributed to the Father).
3. "In believing in Him we believe in the true God, and have eternal life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And we are in him that is true - That is, we are united to him; we belong to him; we are his friends." 
2. "This is the true God - o There has been much difference of opinion in regard to this important passage; whether it refers to the Lord Jesus Christ, the immediate antecedent, or to a more remote antecedent - referring to God, as such."
3. "If John did not mean to affirm this, he has made use of an expression which was liable to be misunderstood, and which, as facts have shown, would be misconstrued by the great portion of those who might read what he had written; and, moreover, an expression that would lead to the very sin against which he endeavors to guard in the next verse - the sin of substituting a creature in the place of God, and rendering to another the honor due to him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God very strangely condescends indeed in making things plain to me, actually assuming for the time the form of a man, that I at my poor level may better see Him."
2. "This incarnation is God making Himself accessible to human thought - God opening to man the possibility of correspondence through Jesus Christ."
3. "The Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we might know Him that is true."

### John Calvin:
1. "For except our faith is really founded on God, we shall never stand firm in the contest." 
2. "And Christ is said to have given us an understanding, not only because he shews us in the gospel what sort of being is the true God, and also illuminates us by his Spirit; but because in Christ himself we have God manifested in the flesh."
3. "When we have Christ, we enjoy the true and eternal God, for nowhere else is he to be sought; and, secondly, that we become thus partakers of eternal life, because it is offered to us in Christ though hid in the Father."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In him that is true (ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ Œ±ŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒπŒΩœâ). In God in contrast with the world 'in the evil one' (verse 1 John 5:19)."
2. "Even in his Son Jesus Christ (ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ œÖŒπœâ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœâ). The Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ refers clearly to ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ Œ±ŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒπŒΩœâ (God). Hence this clause is not in apposition with the preceding, but an explanation as to how we are 'in the True One' by being 'in his Son Jesus Christ.'"
3. "God is eternal life (John 5:26) and he gives it to us through Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "That we may know him that is true; or 'the true God', as the Alexandrian copy and some others, and the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read; that is, God the Father, who is the true God, in opposition to the false gods of the Heathens, though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit."
2. "Now his people are in him; they were secretly in him before the world was, being loved by him, chosen in him, put into his hands, preserved in him, and represented by him; and openly, at conversion, when they are anew created in him, brought to believe in him, and live upon him, and he lives in them, and they are in him as branches in the vine; and this is known by his Spirit being given them, by the communication of his grace unto them, and by the communion they have with him."
3. "Christ is truly and really God, as appears from all the perfections of deity, the fulness of the Godhead being in him; from the divine works of creation and providence being ascribed to him; and from the divine worship that is given him; as well as from the names and titles he goes by, and particularly that of Jehovah, which is incommunicable to a creature; and he is called 'eternal life', because it is in him; and he is the giver of it to his people; and that itself will chiefly consist in the enjoyment and vision of him, and in conformity to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "And we know ‚Äî By all these infallible proofs."
2. "And he hath given us a spiritual understanding, that we may know him, the true one - 'The faithful and true witness.'"
3. "This Jesus is the only living and true God, together with the father and the Spirit, and the original fountain of eternal life."
