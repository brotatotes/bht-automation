The author warns them of the dire consequences of straying from the true God, reminding them that those who do so become a part of the world under the influence of the wicked one. The need for such caution is emphasized, for the early Christians were surrounded by idolaters and ran the risk of compromise. Idolatry was an ever-present danger, and the readers are exhorted to actively guard themselves against anything that would compete with God for their devotion. The author's aim throughout the letter has been to lead the readers to the knowledge and love of God, and this last command to avoid idols is a vital part of that process. Thus, they are urged to hold fast to spiritual worship and to keep far from themselves any temptation to turn to superstition or false worship.",
