# 1 John 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the love of God is this, that we keep His commandments. His commandments are not grievous, impressive, serious, or weighty. It is the way of the transgressor that is hard. What makes them not grievous is faith which overcometh the world. The reason why believers feel any degree of irksomeness in God's commandments is that they do not realize fully by faith the privileges of their spiritual life. Love for God lightens his commands. Those who keep God's commandments show true love to Him.
