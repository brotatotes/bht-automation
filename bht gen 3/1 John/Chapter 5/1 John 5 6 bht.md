## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The water, the baptism of water which the Lord Himself underwent and instituted for His followers,â€”the blood, the baptism of blood which He Himself underwent, and instituted for His followers."
2. "The Holy Spirit is He, who testifies of Christ, who glorifies Him, and shows of the things which belong to Him."
3. "He is the absolute truth, leading into all the truth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These two past facts in the Lord's life are this abiding testimony to us, by virtue of the permanent application to us of their cleansing and atoning power."
2. "We are baptized into His death: the grand point of union between us and Him, and, through Him, between us and God."
3. "The Holy Spirit is an additional witness... to Jesus' Sonship and Messiahship... both in the inspired New Testament Scriptures, and in the hearts of believers, and in the spiritual reception of baptism and the Lord's Supper."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This," says he, "is the same one, the very person, to whom the well-known and important testimony is borne; to him, and him alone, these undisputed things appertain, and not to any other who should claim to be the Messiah and they all agree on the same one point." (1 John 5:6)
2. "It is possible that the mention of the 'water' in his baptism suggested to John also the water which flowed from the side of the Saviour at his death, intermingled with blood; and that though the primary thought in his mind was the fact that Jesus was baptized, and that an important attestation was then given to his Messiahship, yet he 'may' have instantly adverted to the fact that 'water' performed so important a part, and was so important a symbol through all his work..." (1 John 5:6)
3. "The apostle means to say that the blood shed at his death furnished an important evidence or 'witness' of what he was. In what way this was done, see the notes at 1 John 5:8." (1 John 5:6)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Water refers to Christ's baptism at the beginning of His Messianic work, through which He declared His purpose to fulfill all righteousness."
2. "Blood refers to His bloody death upon the cross for the sin of the world."
3. "The true principle of interpretation appears to be...understood of something so real and powerful, as that by them God's testimony is given to believers, and eternal life assured to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "For I doubt not but that he alludes by the words water and blood to the ancient rites of the law."
2. "John then fitly proves that Jesus is the Christ of the Lord formerly promised, because he brought with him that by which he sanctifies us wholly."
3. "He shews in this clause how the faithful know and feel the power of Christ, even because the Spirit renders them certain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He came â€˜byâ€™ them as the accompanying media through which He discharged His ministry and the accompanying seals which authenticated Him: these being first viewed as one, giving unity to the design of His coming into His office." 
2. "Not only was there one stream of life flowing from His death for us, but life under two essential aspects. Eternal life is the removal of the death of condemnation: that is symbolized by the â€˜blood;â€™ for it is the blood of Christ that cleanseth from all sin. Eternal life is also the â€˜well of water springing up within the soul unto everlasting life,â€™ of which the Saviour spoke to the Samaritan woman."
3. "The Supreme Witness of Jesus is the Holy Ghost, to whom the Saviour Himself bore witness as â€˜the Spirit of the truth.â€™ St. John singles out His testimony as the only and abiding one, with express reference to the Lordâ€™s words: â€˜not we, the Baptist, the apostles, but the Spirit.â€™ And the tense is changed: the Son of God â€˜cameâ€™ once in the great ministry of which water and blood were the symbols; but in the Gospels, and in the preached word, and in the sacraments, the Holy Ghost gives abiding testimony."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By water and blood...at the Cross his work reached its culmination."

### John Gill:
Quote 1: "By 'water' is not meant the ablutions or washings of the ceremonial law; Christ came not by these, but to make an end of them."
Quote 2: "but the sense is, that as at baptism, so at his sufferings and death, he was made manifest to be the Son of God."
Quote 3: "The Holy Spirit...bore testimony to Christ, by his descent on him at his baptism, and upon his apostles at the day of Pentecost, and by attending, succeeding, and confirming the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is he â€” St. John here shows the immovable foundation of that faith that Jesus is the Son of God; not only the testimony of man, but the firm, indubitable testimony of God."
2. "And this the Spirit, and the water, and the blood testify."
3. "And against his testimony there can be no exception, because the Spirit is truth - The very God of truth."
