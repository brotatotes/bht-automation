## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Spirit is, of the three, the only living and active witness, properly speaking: besides, the water and the blood are no witnesses without Him, whereas He is independent of them, testifying both in the und out of them."
2. "And this their one testimony is given by the purification in the water of baptism into His name, John iii. 5: by the continual cleansing from all sin which we enjoy in and by His atoning blood: by the inward witness of His Spirit, which He hath given us."
3. "The best conclusion to the whole subject is found in the remark of Bengel himself on another occasion of the practice reprobated, of which he himself furnishes here so striking an instance: 'They exhibit a mischievous zeal in the Lordâ€™s quarrels, who bring themselves to reason thus, â€˜This text is convenient for my doctrine and argument; therefore I will constrain myself to believe it genuine, and will obstinately defend it, and all that can be scraped together on its behalf.â€™ But the Truth needs not false supports, resting much better on itself alone.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To this CYPRIAN, 196, also refers, 'Of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, it is written, 'And these three are one' (a unity).'"
2. "There must be some mystical truth implied in using 'three' (Greek) in the masculine, though the antecedents, 'Spirit, water, and blood,' are neuter."
3. "The triad specified pointing to a still Higher Trinity; as is plain also from :-, 'the witness of GOD,' referring to the Trinity alluded to in the Spirit, water, and blood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no passage of the New Testament which has given rise to so much discussion in regard to its genuineness as this."
2. "The reasons which seem to me to prove that the passage included in brackets is spurious, and should not be regarded as a part of the inspired writings, are briefly the following:"
3. "The removal of this text does nothing to weaken the evidence for the doctrine of the Trinity, or to modify that doctrine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These words are rejected by the general verdict of critical authorities."
2. "To maintain the genuineness of this passage is simply impossible."
3. "If, in spite of all these objections, it be still genuine, no part of Scripture whatsoever can be proved either spurious or genuine."

### John Calvin:
1. "And the meaning would be, that God, in order to confirm most abundantly our faith in Christ, testifies in three ways that we ought to acquiesce in him."
2. "For as our faith acknowledges three persons in the one divine essence, so it is called in so really ways to Christ that it may rest on him."
3. "For the Father, together with his eternal Wisdom and Spirit, declares Jesus to be the Christ as it were authoritatively, then, in this ease, the sole majesty of the deity is to be considered by us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Erasmus did not have it in his first edition, but rashly offered to insert it if a single Greek MS. had it and 34 was produced with the insertion, as if made to order." 
2. "The fact and the doctrine of the Trinity do not depend on this spurious addition."
3. "Some Latin scribe caught up Cyprian's exegesis and wrote it on the margin of his text, and so it got into the Vulgate and finally into the Textus Receptus by the stupidity of Erasmus."

### John Gill:
1. "The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost...are witnesses in heaven, not to the heavenly inhabitants, but to men on earth; they were so called, because they were in heaven, and from thence gave out their testimony."
2. "This passage holds forth and asserts the unity of God, a trinity of persons in the Godhead, the proper deity of each person, and their distinct personality."
3. "The faith of the ancient Jews concerning the doctrine of the Trinity...agrees with the apostle's doctrine in words and language, as well as in matter."

### John Wesley:
1. "For there are three that testify...to intimate that the act of testifying, and the effect of it, are continually present."
