# 1 Peter 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, writes to the elect strangers of the dispersion. These are the chosen ones of God, His adopted family in Christ, forming part of the Israel of God. They are the children of God scattered abroad, yet one whole in Christ who gathers them together. Realizing their election by God's grace, they are motivated to live a holy life. As Peter, or Petros, signifies a rock, Christians are called to see themselves as sojourners in a foreign land, on their way to their heavenly homeland.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peter [œÄŒµœÑœÅŒøœÇ] . See on Matthew 16:18. As Paul in his letters does not call himself by his original name of Saul, so Peter calls himself, not Simon, but Peter, the name most significant and precious both to himself and to his readers, because bestowed by his Lord."
2. "Of all the catholic epistles, Peter's alone puts forward his apostleship in the introduction. He is addressing churches with which he had no immediate connection, and which were distinctively Pauline. Hence he appeals to his apostleship in explanation of his writing to them, and as his warrant for taking Paul 's place."
3. "Persons sojourning for a brief season in a foreign country. Though applied primarily to Hebrews scattered throughout the world, it has here a wider, spiritual sense, contemplating Christians as having their citizenship in heaven."

1. "Peter (Œ†ŒµœÑœÅŒøœÇ). Greek form for the Aramaic (Chaldaic) ŒßŒ∑œÜŒ±œÇ, the nickname given Simon by Jesus when he first saw him (John 1:42) and reaffirmed in the Greek form on his great confession (Matthew 16:18), with an allusion to œÄŒµœÑœÅŒ±, another form for a rock, ledge, or cliff."
2. "The picture in the metaphor here is that heaven is our native country and we are only temporary sojourners here on earth."
3. "The Christian is a pilgrim on his way to the homeland."

### John Gill:
1. "Peter, the same with Cephas, which signifies a rock, or stone; a name given him by Christ at his first conversion, and which respected his after firmness, solidity, resolution, and constancy."
