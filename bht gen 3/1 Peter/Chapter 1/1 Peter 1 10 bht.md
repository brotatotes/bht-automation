## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The omission of the article here gives sublimity to the discourse, for it draws off the reader from the limited consideration of individuals to regard the genus to which they belonged."
2. "The 'things which have been now reported unto you by them that preached the gospel unto you' are the contents of the gospel history, the sufferings and triumphs of Christ."
3. "It embraces further still the excellence of the salvation revealed to us, that angels, for whom it is not designed as for us [Heb. ii. 16], long to pry into its mysteries."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The magnitude of this 'salvation' is proved by the earnestness with which 'prophets' and even 'angels' searched into it."
2. "They did not like us fully see, but they desired to see the one and the same Christ whom we fully see in spirit."
3. "Old Testament believers also possessed the grace of God; they were children of God, but it was as children in their nonage, so as to be like servants; whereas we enjoy the full privileges of adult sons."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were in a condition, in many respects, far superior to that of the prophets. They had the full light of the gospel. The prophets saw it only at a distance and but dimly, and were obliged to search anxiously that they might understand the nature of that system of which they were appointed to furnish the comparatively obscure prophetic intimations."
2. "They perceived that in their communications there were some great and glorious truths which they did not fully comprehend, and that they diligently employed their natural faculties to understand that which they were appointed to impart to succeeding generations."
3. "The mere fact that they were the channels or organs for imparting truth to others would not save them, any more than the fact that a man now preaches truth to others will save himself, or than the fact that a sutler delivers bread to an army will nourish and support his own body."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Have inquired and searched diligently."
2. "The ŒµŒæ in composition has the force of out, searched out, and is rendered by diligently."
3. "Sought. Used of Esau's seeking carefully for a place of repentance, in Hebrews 12:17."

### John Calvin:
1. "He confirms the certainty of salvation by this very antiquity; for from the beginning of the world it had received a plain testimony from the Holy Spirit."
2. "He declares that more has been given to us than to the ancient fathers, in order to amplify by this comparison the grace of the gospel."
3. "What is said afterwards is to be referred to their public office...the prophets ministered to us more abundantly than to their own age, and that this was revealed to them from above."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The salvation here in view is the salvation already introduced first as ‚Äòready to be revealed in the last time,‚Äô and then as a ‚Äòsalvation of souls.‚Äô It is not to be limited either to the completed salvation of the future, or to the partial salvation of the present, but is God‚Äôs salvation generally." [1]
2. "They depict, therefore, the strength and earnestness of the interest with which the prophets gave their minds to the hidden things of this salvation." [2]
3. "The term ‚Äògrace‚Äô here is not to be distinguished (with Huther) from the ‚Äòsalvation,‚Äô as if the latter denoted only the future salvation, and the former covered both the present and the future. It is simply another expression for the salvation dealt with all along, designating it now under the particular aspect of a free gift from God." [3]

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter lingers over the word œÉœâœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒ± (salvation) with something new to say each time (Bigg). Here it is the general sense of the gospel of grace."
2. "Sought (ŒµŒæŒµŒ∂Œ∑œÑŒ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ). First aorist active indicative of ŒµŒ∫Œ∂Œ∑œÑŒµœâ, to seek out (Acts 15:17), late and rare compound, only in LXX and N.T."
3. "Both of these words occur together in I Macc. 9:26."

2. "Inquired ‚Äî Were earnestly inquisitive."
3. "And searched diligently ‚Äî Like miners searching after precious ore, after the meaning of the prophecies which they delivered."
