# 1 Peter 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Old Testament prophets sought to discover the precise period and signs of the times at which the revelation of Gentile inclusion into Israel's grace would be fulfilled. Through the Spirit of Christ, they predicted the sufferings and glories that would follow. These prophecies serve as mirrors, reflecting the image of celestial glory amid afflictions. Afflictions precede glory, as ordained by God's providence. The prophecies remind us that we are not afflicted by chance, but by the infallible providence of God.
