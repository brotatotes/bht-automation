# 1 Peter 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophets of old not only had the future revealed to them, but they also knew that these revelations were not just for themselves, but for our benefit in Gospel times. Despite having the honor of Christ's Spirit speaking in them, their privileges are brought forth by contrast with ours to encourage us to even greater earnestness. Angels long to understand the means by which sinners are transformed; their intense desire to know is seen in their intense interest and inquiry into the things of the Gospel.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was discovered to them that in regard to certain things which the Spirit communicated they were dealing with things meant for others, and this fact (pointing, as it did, to the mystery of a place for the Gentile world sooner or later in Israelâ€™s grace) stimulated their inquiry." 
2. "The things which thus were the subject of prophetic interest and inquiry, are now referred to as having also formed the burden of the preaching of those who carried the Gospel into those Gentile territories, Pontus, Galatia, etc."

3. "things they are highly delighted with, take pleasure in the contemplation of, and desire to have a greater knowledge of, and acquaintance with"
