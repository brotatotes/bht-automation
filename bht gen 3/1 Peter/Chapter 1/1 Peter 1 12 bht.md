# 1 Peter 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophets of old were not only given knowledge about the future but also revealed that these revelations were not for their own benefit but for ours in Gospel times. Despite having the honor of the Spirit of Christ speaking in them, they were eclipsed by the immense privileges we enjoy in the Gospel era. Even the angels, who serve the heirs of salvation, yearn to understand the mystery of redemption and eagerly desire to investigate the work that we now have revealed to us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not only was the future revealed to them, but this also, that these revelations of the future were given them not for themselves, but for our good in Gospel times."
2. "Our immense privileges are thus brought forth by contrast with theirs, notwithstanding that they had the great honor of Christ's Spirit speaking in them; and this, as an incentive to still greater earnestness on our part than even they manifested."
3. "Angels do not any more than ourselves possess an INTUITIVE knowledge of redemption...Their 'ministry to the heirs of salvation' naturally disposes them to wish to penetrate this mystery as reflecting such glory on the love, justice, wisdom, and power of their and our God and Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their ministrations had reference mainly to future times, and that the full benefit of them would be experienced only in distant ages."
2. "They were reaping the benefit of all the labors of the prophets. They were permitted to see truth clearly, which the prophets themselves saw only obscurely."
3. "It is not unreasonable to suppose that there are many things in relation to the divine character and plans, which [the angels] do not yet understand. They know, undoubtedly, much more than we do; but there are plans and purposes of God which are yet made known to none of his creatures."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase illustrates Peter's habitual emphasis upon the testimony of sight."
2. "Bengel acutely notes the hint in para, beside, that the angels contemplate the work of salvation from without, as spectators and not as participants."
3. "Compare Hebrews 2:16; Ephesians 3:10."

### John Calvin:
1. "What else then was this, but that they spread the table, that others might afterwards feed on the provisions laid on it."
2. "But if their patience was so great, surely we shall be twice and thrice ungrateful, if the fruition of the grace denied to them will not sustain us under all the evils which are to be endured."
3. "It is indeed the highest praise to the gospel, that it contains treasures of wisdom, as yet concealed and hidden from angels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The entire sentence is connected closely with the preceding by the simple relative...The question, therefore, is: What is the relation thus intended between the searching of 1 Peter 1:10-11, and the revelation spoken of now?" 
2. "The preachers of the Gospel had their power to preach only by the Holy Ghost...the Spirit who gifted the preachers is described as the Holy Ghost sent from heaven, a designation pointing to the Pentecostal descent of the Spirit, and, therefore, to the superior privilege of the preachers." 
3. "The intensity of this interest is expressed by the strong term desire...Its continuance is indicated by the present tense...it may point at once to the straining interest with which the angelic world as such contemplates the salvation of which even outcast Gentiles are participants."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The connexion between study and inspiration is a great mystery. Surely, but that is no argument for ignorance or obscurantism."
2. "Here is revelation about the revelation already received, revelation after research."
3. "For the interest of angels in the Incarnation see Luke 2:13."

### John Gill:
1. "they were not to have their accomplishment in their times; for though they sometimes speak of them, because of the certainty of them, as if they were already done, yet they knew they were not to be brought about until the last days."
2. "what was written by them, was written for our learning and instruction chiefly and principally, on whom the ends of the world are come."
3. "they are more so to the saints under the Gospel dispensations, who are able to compare prophesies and facts together."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was revealed, that not for themselves, but for us they ministered â€” They did not so much by those predictions serve themselves, or that generation, as they did us, who now enjoy what they saw afar off."
2. "With the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven â€” Confirmed by the inward, powerful testimony of the Holy Ghost, as well as the mighty effusion of his miraculous gifts."
3. "Which things angels desire to look into â€” A beautiful gradation; prophets, righteous men, kings, desired to see and hear what Christ did and taught. What the Holy Ghost taught concerning Christ the very angels long to know."
