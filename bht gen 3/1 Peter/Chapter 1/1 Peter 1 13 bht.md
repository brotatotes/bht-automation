# 1 Peter 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to exercise spiritual sobriety and put a rein on their senses to avoid being intoxicated by the allurements of the world. They are to be earnest and watchful, ready for the imminent revelation of Christ. Like the Easterners who gathered their robes and girded up their loins for action, believers are to have their minds prepared for whatever lies ahead. Their hope should be set perfectly and unchangeably in Christ, eagerly awaiting the grace that will be revealed at His coming.
