# 1 Peter 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to become holy, resembling the One who has called us. Our holiness should not be limited to inward devotion but should be displayed in our outward conduct. By rendering our lives after God's pattern, we reflect His character and align our behavior with His standards. Just as a parent begets an offspring that resembles themselves, we are to imitate and mirror the holiness of our heavenly Father. This likeness can be seen in every aspect of our lives, both in our relationship with God and others.
