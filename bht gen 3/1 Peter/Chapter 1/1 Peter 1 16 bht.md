# 1 Peter 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because it is written in Scripture, Ye shall be holy, because I am holy, we are called to mirror God's holiness in our lives. This command is not only rooted in God's nature as the Holy One, but also serves as a reason for the entire exhortation to pursue holiness. We see this consistent theme throughout the Bible, as it states in Matthew, Ephesians, and 1 John. Scripture is the ultimate authority on matters of doctrine and practice. Just as God is inherently holy, we are called to be sanctified by Him and strive to partake in His holiness.
