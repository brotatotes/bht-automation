## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Knowing that not with corruptible things, silver or gold, were ye redeemed out of your vain behaviour, but with precious blood, as of a lamb blameless and spotless, [even the blood] of Christ."
2. "This consideration is urged through vv. 18-21."
3. "The question, with what particular lamb Christ is here compared, will be found discussed in the main on John i. 29."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We who are bought by the blood of Christ, not heaven."
2. "The blood of Christ is not in Scripture said to buy heaven for us: heaven is the 'inheritance' given to us as sons, by the promise of God."
3. "Holiness is the natural fruit of redemption 'from our vain conversation'; for He by whom we are redeemed is also He for whom we are redeemed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no more effectual way to induce true Christians to consecrate themselves entirely to God, than to refer them to the fact that they are not their own, but have been purchased by the blood of Christ."
2. "The word here means that they were rescued from sin and death by the blood of Christ, as the valuable consideration on account of which it was done."
3. "The idea here is, that a price far more valuable than any amount of silver or gold had been paid for the redemption of the people of God, and that they were under proportionate obligation to devote themselves to his service."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb carries the idea of a ransom - price."
2. "Lit., with silver or gold money; the words meaning, respectively, a small coin of silver or of gold."
3. "Handed down from your fathers."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is hence nothing which ought so much to stimulate us to the practice of holiness, as the memory of this price of our redemption."
2. "For the sake of amplifying he mentions these things in contrast, so that we may know that the whole world, and all things deemed precious by men, are nothing to the excellency and value of this price."
3. "In vain is pretended in this case the authority of the Fathers or an ancient custom. For the Prophet Ezekiel cried to the Jews, 'Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A redemption is in view which is expressed by a verb that is found in the N. T. only in other two passages (Titus 2:14; Luke 24:21), although several terms connected with it occur not unfrequently. It has radically the sense of redeeming by payment of a ransom price."
2. "The terms apply in the New Testament to ransoming from the bondage of evil (Titus 2:14), as well as from the penalty of evil. Here the ransom price is stated first negatively as not â€˜corruptibleâ€™ (or â€˜perishableâ€™) things, not even the most valuable of these, such as silver or gold."
3. "What could set them free from the despotism of a life, poor as the life might be, which not only ran the course of natural inclination, but laid upon them those strong bonds of birth, respect for the past, relationship, habit, example? Nothing but a new moral power, Peter reminds them, which it cost something incalculably more precious than silver or gold to bring in, namely, the sinless life of the Messiah."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The appeal is to an elementary Christian belief, the holiness and justice of God with the added thought of the high cost of redemption."
2. "The ransom is the blood of Christ. Peter here amplifies the language in Isaiah 52:3." 
3. "Slaves were set free by silver and gold."

### John Gill:
1. "The redemption of a soul, which is of more worth than a world, requires a greater price than gold and silver."
2. "Seeing redemption is not obtained by anything corruptible, nothing corrupt in principle, or practice should be indulged."
3. "They (the saints) ought not therefore to be the servants of men, no, not of these fathers, but of God and Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. Your vain conversation â€” Your foolish, sinful way of life.
