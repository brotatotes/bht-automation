# 1 Peter 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blood of Christ, without blemish or spot, is described as precious and exceeding the value of gold or silver. This signifies His purity and perfect suitability as a sacrifice for our redemption from sin. Just as the blood of the paschal lamb brought deliverance for Israel from Egypt, it was through the blood of Christ that we are redeemed. His blood is far more precious than any other, and it is through His sacrifice that we have the fulfillment of the Old Testament symbols and the power to be redeemed from sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "With precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish (in itself) and without spot (contracted by contact with others), (even the blood) of Christ."
2. "Though very man, He remained pure in Himself ('without blemish'), and uninfected by any impression of sin from without ('without spot'), which would have unfitted Him for being our atoning Redeemer."
3. "As Israel's redemption from Egypt required the blood of the paschal lamb, so our redemption from sin and the curse required the blood of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The blood of Christ had a value above silver and gold; it was worth more, to wit: (1) In itself - being a more valuable thing - and, (2) In effecting our redemption. It accomplished what silver and gold could not do."
2. "The universe had nothing more valuable to offer, of which we can conceive, than the blood of the Son of God."

2. "Let us hence learn what benefit the reading of the Law brings us in this respect."
3. "Peter, by applying this to Christ, teaches us that he was a suitable victim, and approved by God, for he was perfect, without any blemish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The point of the statement is not to institute a direct comparison between Christ and a lamb, nor to represent the means by which the redemption was effected as comparable in value to the blood of a stainless lamb, but to exhibit the cost of the redemption from the heathen life of sin as nothing less than the surrender of a life of sinless perfection."
2. "The lamb particularly in Peterâ€™s view here, is variously identified, as e.g. with the Paschal Lamb, with the lamb of Isaiah 53:0, or with the general idea signified by the various lambs of the Old Testament service and realized in Christ."
3. "The expiatory or sacrificial value of Christâ€™s death is no doubt at the basis of the statement, and the idea of ransom from sin as a power is not disconnected from the idea of a ransom from sin as a penalty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The blood of anyone is 'precious' (costly), far above gold or silver, but that of Jesus immeasurably more so."
2. "Peter sees clearly that it was by the blood of Christ that we are redeemed from sin."
3. "Without (alpha privative) spot (Î¼Ï‰Î¼Î¿Ï‚) as the paschal lamb had to be (Leviticus 22:21). So Hebrews 9:14."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was prophesied of as a Redeemer under the Old Testament... and the apostle here attributes [redemption] to the blood of Christ..." 
2. "This blood of Christ... is as of a lamb without spot and blemish... a very fit person to be a sacrifice for sin, and a Redeemer of his people." 
3. "At that time, and in that month, was redemption obtained by the blood of Christ."
