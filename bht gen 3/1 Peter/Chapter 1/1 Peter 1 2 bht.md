# 1 Peter 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's divine action of election is not merely a discovery but a deliberate cause. The Death of Christ not only removes the obstacle of sin but also empowers us to partake in God's salvation. Grace, as the source of peace, ought to be further multiplied. This verse subtly alludes to the mystery of the Trinity and the process of our salvation, involving the Father's foreknowledge, the Son's atonement, and the Spirit's application of Christ's work in sanctification. Believers are sanctified through Christ's offering and demonstrate this through obedience and trust.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God causes election, and does not discover it only."
2. "The Death of Christ is not only, as looking back on the past, a propitiation for sin, thereby removing the obstacle which stood in the way of Godâ€™s gracious purpose towards man, but also, looking forward to the future, a capacitating of us for the participation in Godâ€™s salvation."
3. "Peace is distinguished from grace, as a fruit, or effect, from its cause."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's foreknowledge is not the perception of any ground of action out of Himself; still in it liberty is comprehended, and all absolute constraint debarred."
2. "Believers are 'sanctified through the offering of Christ once for all.' This is the true sanctification of the Spirit, to obey the Gospel, to trust in Christ."
3. "Grace is the source of 'peace' and should be multiplied further than already."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that God has chosen them to salvation."
2. "The original choice was on the part of God, and not on their part."
3. "We become in fact the chosen or elect of God by a work of the Spirit on our hearts making us holy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mystery of the Trinity and the economy of our salvation are intimated in this verse."
2. "The Father foreknowing, the Son atoning, the Spirit applying the Son's work in sanctifying."
3. "Grace and peace. The salutation is peculiar by the addition of be multiplied."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their election is in virtue of this, in pursuance of this, or has this for its norm. The term foreknowledge is distinct at once from allied terms expressing the idea of predestinating or fore-ordaining, and from those expressing the purpose, good pleasure, or counsel of God. It is more, however, than mere foresight. It is not the Divine prescience of the reception to be given to the decree of salvation, as distinguished from that decree itself... It is a recognition which, resting eternally on its objects, embraces them as its own and cares for them as such."
2. "This points to the means by which, or rather to the sphere within which, the election is made good... [It] expresses neither the act nor the process of sanctifying, nor yet the ethical quality of holiness, but that state of separation or consecration into which Godâ€™s Spirit brings Godâ€™s elect."
3. "It will then have not the more limited sense of faith, but the larger sense in which the idea occurs again at 1 Peter 1:14, in which Paul also uses it in Romans 6:16, and which is expressed more specifically in such phrases as obedience to the faith, the obedience of faith, the obedience of Christ, obeying the truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter here presents the Trinity (God the Father, the Spirit, Jesus Christ)."

### John Gill:
1. "and by this his 'foreknowledge' is meant, not his eternal, universal, and infallible knowledge, and which is infinite, and reaches to all things and persons, present, future, or possible, for this has for its objects persons whom God never predestinated and chose"
2. "the sovereign grace, good will, and pleasure of God, or the everlasting love of God the Father, which is the cause of, and has given birth to the act of election, is meant by foreknowledge, joined with affection, delight, and approbation"
3. "which makes it more express, and the sense more clear: he means an enlarged view of interest in the love of God, an increase of grace out of the fulness of it in Christ, and of Gospel light, and of the several gifts of the Spirit"

### John Wesley:
1. "Election, in the scripture sense, is God's doing anything that our merit or power have no part in."
2. "All is free gift; and yet such is the gift, that the final issue depends on our future obedience to the heavenly call."
3. "But the doctrine of predestination is entirely changed from what it formerly was. Now it implies neither faith, peace, nor purity."
