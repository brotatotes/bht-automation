### John Calvin:
1. "It may yet be asked, As Adam did not fall before the creation of the world, how was it that Christ had been appointed the Redeemer? for a remedy is posterior to the disease. My reply is, that this is to be referred to Godâ€™s foreknowledge... herein shines forth more fully the unspeakable goodness of God, that he anticipated our disease by the remedy of his grace." 
2. "Included in these words, as I think, is not only the personal appearance of Christ, but also the proclamation of the Gospel... what he had obscurely indicated to the fathers is now clearly and plainly made known to us by the Gospel."
3. "He does not exclude the fathers, to whom the promise had not been useless; but as God has favored us more than them, he intimates that the greater the amplitude of grace towards us, the more reverence and ardor and care are required of us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The foreknowledge no doubt here, as in 1 Peter 1:2, means not mere prescience, but recognition, and lies near the idea of providing or determining." 
2. "The 'manifested' is in the past, since what is in view is the historical manifestation once for all accomplished." 
3. "The present time, the interval between Christâ€™s two comings, is the end of the times as being the period beyond which there is to be no new revelation of grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Before the foundation of the world... This precise curious phrase occurs in John 17:24 in the Saviour's mouth of his preincarnate state with the Father as here and in Ephesians 1:4." 
2. "The preincarnate Messiah appears in the counsels of God also in 1 Corinthians 2:7; Colossians 1:26; Ephesians 1:9; Ephesians 3:9-11; Romans 16:25; 1 Timothy 1:9."
3. "For your sake. Proof of God's love, not of their desert or worth (Acts 17:30; Hebrews 11:39)."

### John Gill:
1. "The affair of redemption by Christ is no new thing; the scheme of it was drawn in eternity; the persons to be redeemed were fixed on; the Redeemer was appointed in the council and covenant of peace; and even the very Gospel which proclaims it was ordained before the world, for our glory."
2. "A Saviour was provided before sin was committed, and the method of man's recovery was settled before his ruin took place; and which was done without any regard to the works and merits of men, but is wholly owing to the free and sovereign grace of God, and to his everlasting love, both to the Redeemer and the redeemed."
3. "This manifestation of Christ was for the sake of some particular persons, even for all God's elect, whether among Jews or Gentiles."
