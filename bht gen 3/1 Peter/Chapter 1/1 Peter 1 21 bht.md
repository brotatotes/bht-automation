# 1 Peter 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To believe in God is to have an internal trust in Him, going into Him and cleaving to Him. Our faith in God is sustained in His blood, which becomes the proper and abiding place for our faith. Through Christ, we have this new faith and hope, as His resurrection and God's glory given to Him are the sources from which they flow. Our faith and hope find their foundation in God, who raised Jesus and bestowed glory upon Him, leading us to believe, hope, and love in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To believe IN (Greek, 'eis') God" expresses an internal trust: "by believing to love God, going INTO Him, and cleaving to Him, incorporated into His members."
2. "Faith IN (Greek, 'en') His blood" implies that His blood is the element IN which faith has its proper and abiding place.
3. "Your faith flows from His resurrection; your hope from God's having 'given Him glory.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is always a characteristic of true religion that a man has faith in God." 
2. "By raising up the Lord Jesus, and exalting him to heaven, he has laid the foundation of confidence in his promises, and of the hope of eternal life." 
3. "By exalting him at his own right hand in heaven, he [God] has laid the foundation of confidence in his promises, and of the hope of eternal life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Which raised. Compare Romans 4:24. 
That your faith and hope might be in God. Some render, that your faith should also be toward God.


### John Calvin:
1. "For, since God is incomprehensible, faith could never reach to him, except it had an immediate regard to Christ."
2. "Let us, therefore, remember, that Christ is not in vain called the image of the invisible God, but this name is given to him for this reason because God cannot be known except in him."
3. "It is then evident, that faith is something else than to behold the naked majesty of God. And rightly does Peter speak in this manner; for it belongs to faith to penetrate into heaven, that it may find the Father there: how could it do so, except it had Christ as a leader?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And it is ‘through Him,’ as Peter emphatically reminds them, that they have this new faith."
2. "Christ, and only Christ, by all that He had taught and all that He had been on earth, was the means of leading them to this knowledge of God and trust in God."
3. "The fact that these Gentiles, once ‘without God and without hope in the world,’ had been brought through Christ to know God, and rest their faith in Him, is a witness to the truth of Peter’s statement that even they were in God’s view when the Christ, who had been eternally before His mind as Ransom, was manifested in time."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Accusative case in apposition with υμας (you), 'the through him (that is Christ as in 1 Peter 1:8; Acts 3:16) believers (πιστους correct text of A B) in God.'" 
2. "Which raised (τον εγειραντα). Accusative singular articular (agreeing with θεον) first aorist active participle of εγειρω (cf. δι' αναστασεως Ιησου in verse 1 Peter 1:3)." 
3. "So that your faith and hope might be in God (ωστε την πιστιν υμων κα ελπιδα εις θεον). Hωστε with the infinitive (εινα) and the accusative of general reference (πιστιν κα ελπιδα) is used in the N.T. as in the Koine for either purpose (Matthew 10:1) or usually result (Mark 4:37). Hence here result (so that is) is more probable than design."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, who was foreordained from all eternity to be the Redeemer of his people, was manifest in the flesh for their sakes, and to obtain eternal redemption for them..." 
2. "...and which, as here, is usually ascribed to God the Father, though not to the exclusion of Christ himself, who had power to lay down his life, and take it up again; and which is a very great encouragement to faith in God..."
3. "...by raising him from the dead, when his body became a glorious one, being raised, spiritual, powerful, and incorruptible; and by his ascension to heaven, being received up in a cloud, attended by thousands of angels, and triumphing over the powers of darkness..."

### John Wesley:
1. "For all our faith and hope proceed from the power of his resurrection."
2. "Without Christ we should only dread God; whereas through him we believe, hope, and love."
3. "In God that raised Jesus, and gave him glory - At his ascension."
