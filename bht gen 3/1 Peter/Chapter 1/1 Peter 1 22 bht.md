# 1 Peter 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By purifying our souls through obedience to the truth, we cultivate unfeigned brotherly love that comes straight from the heart. This love is our evidence of regeneration and justification by faith, a distinguishing characteristic of true Christianity. The Holy Spirit, as the purifier, grants us the obedience of faith necessary for this purification. It is not enough to merely profess religion, but rather we are called to love one another fervently, with a pure heart, as a result of our obedience to God.
