# 1 Peter 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All flesh is likened to grass, fleeting and withering, while the glory of man, his wisdom, strength, wealth, and righteousness, fades away. In contrast, the word of the Lord is eternal, imperishable, and demands that we earnestly follow the new life implanted in us. Through the grace of the new birth, we are called to embrace the eternal and reject the transitory. Our true glory is found in the revelation of God's promise and the undecaying love it instills in us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The contrast being between the general truth and the particular identification." (p. 24)
3. "And consequently the word preached to you is imperishable and eternal, and demands of you that you earnestly and intently follow up that new life which by it has been implanted in you." (p. 24)

1. "If ye were born again of flesh, corruptible seed, ye must also perish again as the grass; but now that from which you have derived life remains eternally, and so also will render you eternal." 
2. "The glory" is the wisdom, strength, riches, learning, honor, beauty, art, virtue, and righteousness of the NATURAL man (expressed by "flesh"), which all are transitory... the glory of man, in his true ideal realized in the believer, is eternal." 
3. "The grass... withered... fell away... it no sooner is than it is gone. 'The grass' is the flesh: 'the flower' its glory."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "All that man prides himself on - his wealth, rank, talents, beauty, learning, splendor of equipage or apparel."
3. "The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away."

### John Gill:
1. "All men, as born of corruptible seed, are frail, mortal, and perishing; they spring up like grass, and look beautiful for a while, but are very weak and tender, and in a little time they are cut down by death, and wither away." 
2. "All outward things which are in esteem with men, and render them glorious to one another, as riches, honour, wisdom, strength, external righteousness, holiness, and goodness; all which are fading and transitory, like the flower of the field."
3. "The grass withereth, and the flower thereof fadeth away; and so fading are all the above things."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse reminds us that all human beings, and everything they pride themselves on, are transient and withering, comparable to grass that withers and flowers that fall away. The word of the Lord, on the other hand, remains forever. The glory of man, his wisdom, strength, wealth, and righteousness, is fleeting and ultimately falls off. However, through the imperishable and eternal word preached to us, we are called to earnestly pursue a new life that has been implanted within us. We are born again of a seed that is imperishable and will render us eternal, unlike the fading glory of the flesh.
