## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ye rejoice, for a little time at present, if it must be so, having been afflicted in manifold temptations." 
2. "The grief is regarded as passed away and gone." 
3. "Manifold temptations, trials, arising from whatever cause; here, mainly from persecution."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Salvation is realized by faith (1 Peter 1:9) as a thing so actually present as to cause exulting joy in spite of existing afflictions."
2. "Not every believer, nor every sinner, is tried with afflictions."
3. "Because the realized joy of the coming salvation makes the present grief seem as a thing of the past."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That must be a valuable religion which will make people happy in the midst of persecutions and heavy calamities."
2. "Since there is need; though the apostle expresses it more delicately by suggesting the possibility that there might be need of it, instead of saying absolutely that there was need."
3. "The meaning here is, that they now endured many things which were suited to try or test their faith. These might have consisted of poverty, persecution, sickness, or the efforts of others to lead them to renounce their religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye greatly rejoice [Î±Î³Î±Î»Î»Î¹Î±ÏƒÎ¸Îµ]. The word is always employed in the New Testament for great or lively joy."
2. "In heaviness [Î»Ï…Ï€Î·Î¸ÎµÎ½Ï„ÎµÏ‚]. Lit., having been grieved. Rev., ye have been put to grief."
3. "Manifold [Ï€Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¹Î»Î¿Î¹Ï‚]. Literally the word means variegated. It is used to describe the skin of a leopard, the different-colored veinings of marble, or an embroidered robe; and thence passes into the meaning of changeful, diversified, applied to the changing months or the variations of a strain of music."

### John Calvin:
1. "The faithful know by experience, how these things can exist together, much better than can be expressed in words... Thus sorrow does not prevent their joy, but, on the contrary, give place to it."
2. "And hence it appears what true patience is; its beginning, and, as it were, its root, is the knowledge of Godâ€™s blessings, especially of that gratuitous adoption with which he has favored us."
3. "Peter commends the faithful, because they willingly undergo sorrow, and not as though forced by necessity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In all which blessings into which God begat you, ye rejoice." 
2. "The 'temptations' will refer here, whatever else may be included, to the threatenings and slanders which these Christians had to endure from heathen neighbours."
3. "The meaning becomes simply this: 'ye have a present joy, notwithstanding that, if such proves needful, you are made the subjects of some short-lived trouble now.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye greatly rejoice. Present middle indicative (rather than imperative) of Î±Î³Î±Î»Î»Î¹Î±Î¿Î¼Î±, late verb from Î±Î³Î±Î»Î»Î¿Î¼Î±, to rejoice, only in LXX, N.T., and ecclesiastical literature as in Matthew 5:12."
2. "Now for a little while. Accusative case of time (Î¿Î»Î¹Î³Î¿Î½) probably as in Mark 6:31, though it can be used of space (to a small extent) as in Luke 5:3."
3. "In manifold temptations. Just the phrase in James 1:2, which see for discussion. 'Trials' clearly right here as there."

### John Gill:
1. "Regenerated persons rejoice, in that they are the elect of God, according to his everlasting love towards them, and free grace, and good will."
2. "The character of the saints in this world is, that they are as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing, rejoicing even in their tribulations and temptations."
3. "Afflictive dispensations, in whatsoever form, are necessary, by the will of God, who has appointed them, and therefore must be, and ought to be, quietly submitted to, and patiently borne, on that consideration."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye even now greatly rejoice, though now for a little while - Such is our whole life, compared to eternity."
2. "If need be â€” For it is not always needful. If God sees it to be the best means for your spiritual profit."
3. "Ye are in heaviness â€” Or sorrow; but not in darkness; for they still retained both faith, hope, and love; yea, at this very time were rejoicing with joy unspeakable."
