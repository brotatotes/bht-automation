# 1 Peter 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our faith, like gold, is tested and refined through fiery trials. While gold perishes, our faith, being proven for eternity, requires a fiery trial to remove defects and test its genuineness. The aim is for our faith to be found deserving of praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. This comparison highlights the enduring nature of faith, which endures the refining process, and serves as evidence of God's work in our lives. Ultimately, the trial is a means by which our faith is approved by God, the Refiner of hearts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The proof of your faith, more precious than gold which perisheth, yet is proved by fire." 
2. "Gold though perishable yet needs fire to try itâ€”how much more does your faith, which is being proved for eternity, not for mere temporary use, need a fiery trial?"
3. "May be found unto praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That your faith so proved 'may be found (aorist; once for all, as the result of its being proved on the judgment-day) unto (eventuating in) praise,' c., namely, the praise to be bestowed by the Judge."
2. "If gold, though perishing, is yet tried with fire in order to remove dross and test its genuineness, how much more does your faith, which shall never perish, need to pass through a fiery trial to remove whatever is defective, and to test its genuineness and full value?"
3. "At Christ's revelation shall take place also the revelation of the sons of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The testing of [faith], the process of showing whether it was or was not genuine, was a much more important and valuable process than that of testing gold in the fire." 
2. "It is more desirable to test religion than it is gold, because it is more valuable. It pertains to that which is eternal and indestructible, and it is therefore of more importance to show its true quality, and to free it from every improper mixture."
3. "There is much which appears to be gold, which is of no value, as there is much which appears to be religion, which is of no value. The one is worth no more than the other, unless it is genuine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sense here is the result of the contact of faith with trial, and hence the verification of faith. The expression is equivalent to your approved faith." 
2. "The comparison is between the approved faith and the gold; not between the faith and the proof of the gold." 
3. "The verb is used in classical Greek of assaying or testing metals, and means, generally, to approve or sanction upon test."

### John Calvin:
1. "Gold is, indeed, tried twice by fire; first, when it is separated from its dross; and then, when a judgment is to be formed of its purity. Both modes of trial may very suitably be applied to faith." 
2. "For our life is now hidden in Christ, and will remain hidden, and as it were buried, until Christ shall appear from heaven; and the whole course of our life leads to the destruction of the external man, and all the things we suffer are, as it were, the preludes of death." 
3. "For trials as to us are full of reproach and shame, and they become glorious in Christ; but that glory in Christ is not yet plainly seen, for the day of consolation is not yet come."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The term rendered â€˜trialâ€™ in the A. V. is found nowhere else in the N. T. except in James 1:3... so that it means both actively the process of putting to the proof... and passively the proof, the evidence itself... or the attestation, the approvedness resulting from the process." 
2. "The comparison between the probation of character and the testing of metals... has a limited application here... the idea is that, if the former is proved by fire, although itself and the benefits of the process pass speedily away according to their kind, the latter, which, as tested, is seen to be a possession superior to the risks of decay and loss, and more precious than the most valued treasure, may well be subjected to similar action."
3. "The descriptions [praise, honour, glory] are cumulative rather than ascensive, word being added to word in order to convey some faint conception of the gracious reward which is to be found... at last to have been the end in view."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The proof of your faith...the test or touchstone of faith." 
2. "Faith stands the test of fire better than gold, but even gold is refined by fire." 
3. "This is the result of the probation by God as the Refiner of hearts."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of faith is much more precious than gold; since that perisheth by using, but faith does not; and since it is so valuable as not to be obtained by it." 
2. "The trying of faith works patience, and that, experience, and that, hope." 
3. "His faith will be praised for its steadiness and constancy, notwithstanding all persecutions and tribulations; and his good works, the fruits of faith, will be taken notice of by him with commendation."

### John Wesley:
1. "That the trial of your faith â€” That is, your faith which is tried."
2. "Which is much more precious than gold â€” For gold, though it bear the fire, yet will perish with the world."
3. "May be found â€” Though it doth not yet appear. Unto praise â€” From God himself. And honour â€” From men and angels. And glory â€” Assigned by the great Judge."
