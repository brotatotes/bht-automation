# 1 Peter 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Receiving salvation is the ultimate culmination and completion of one's faith. Believers presently receive a taste of salvation, even though its full revelation is yet to come. It is a present reality that the soul of the believer is already saved, serving as evidence of the ongoing receiving of salvation. This spiritual and eternal salvation, obtained through faith and secured by the precious sacrifice of Christ, surpasses the temporal and fleeting nature of earthly life. Its immeasurable worth transcends all worldly pursuits and offers a hope that is beyond compare.
