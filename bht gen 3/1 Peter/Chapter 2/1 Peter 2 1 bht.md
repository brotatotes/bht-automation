# 1 Peter 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Renouncing malice, guile, hypocrisies, envies, and evil-speaking is a necessary step for those who desire the pure love of the brethren, as these behaviors are incompatible with the purification of their souls. Guile is a disposition that gives rise to deceitful acts, which in turn breed envy and malicious defamations against others. The call to lay aside all manner of evil-speaking is a reminder for believers to cultivate transparency, honesty, and kindness, forsaking behaviors that are antithetical to their new life in Christ.
