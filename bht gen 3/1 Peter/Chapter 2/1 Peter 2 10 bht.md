# 1 Peter 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through God's pure mercy and compassion, the Gentiles, who were once despised and unpitied, experienced an incredible transformation. They went from a state of being no people to becoming the people of God. This change was not brought about by their own merits, but by God's graciousness. The Apostle Peter confirms that this prophecy applies not only to Israel but also to the call of the Gentiles to become God's people. In Christ, the Gentiles were united as a true people, chosen and reconciled by God.

2. "who were unpitied (of God: the clauses here and above are not merely negatives, but contraries: not 'who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy,' as A.V., indicating a mere change of time in order of progress, but who were unpitied, objects of aversion and wrath)"
