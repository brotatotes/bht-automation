# 1 Peter 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to walk piously among unbelievers, abstaining from the grosser sins of the flesh. Our souls are caught in a struggle between influences from above and influences from below, and giving in to fleshly lusts weakens our spiritual separation from the world and the flesh. As pilgrims and sojourners in this world, our true home is in heaven. Therefore, let us remain vigilant against these enemies, treating them as our worst adversaries and shunning them with utmost care.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The seldomer our Apostle uses this endearing term, the weightier it is where it does occur as the opening of a hortatory discourse."
2. "These words, 'as sojourners and strangers,' belong, not to 'I beseech you'... but to abstain."
3. "The man’s personal immortal part, as opposed to his body, his members in which the lusts war, is held in suspension between influences from above and influences from beneath: drawn up and saved, or drawn down and ruined."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Walk piously among unbelievers so that they may cease to calumniate Christians and may themselves be converted to Christ."
2. "Not only the gross appetites which we have in common with the brutes, but all the thoughts of the unrenewed mind."
3. "The regenerated soul is besieged by sinful lusts. Like Samson in the lap of Delilah, the believer, the moment that he gives way to fleshly lusts, has the locks of his strength shorn, and ceases to maintain that spiritual separation from the world and the flesh of which the Nazarite vow was the type."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians are not properly citizens of this world, but that their citizenship is in heaven, and that they are here mere sojourners."
2. "Even while engaged here in the necessary callings of life - their studies, their farming, their merchandise - their thoughts and affections should be on other things."
3. "A traveler takes along as few things as possible; and a staff is often all that a pilgrim has. We make the most rapid progress in our journey to our final home when we are least encumbered with the things of this world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beloved [αγαπητοι]. A favorite term with Peter, occurring eight times in the epistles."
2. "Strangers [παροικους]. Rev., sojourners."
3. "Which [αιτινες]. The compound pronoun denotes a class, of that kind which, classifying all fleshly desires in one category."

### John Calvin:
1. "But when we pass as strangers through this life, we are not in bondage to the flesh."
2. "For it is certain that every thought of the flesh, that is, of unrenewed nature, is enmity against God."
3. "He proves our carelessness in this respect, that while we anxiously shun enemies from whom we apprehend danger to the body, we willingly allow enemies hurtful to the soul to destroy us; nay, we as it were stretch forth our neck to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The opening designation occurs no less than eight times in the Epistles of Peter, and in every case except the present the A. V. translates it simply ‘beloved,’ not ‘dearly beloved.’"
2. "They are appealed to in the character of strangers and sojourners; of which terms the latter is the one used in the first designation of the readers, and conveys a somewhat different idea from the ‘pilgrims’ of the A. V., while the former denotes properly residents without the rights of natives."
3. "The ‘lusts’ are, as in 1 Peter 1:14, not merely the fetid sensualities which had attained such monstrous strength in the heathenism of the time, but all inordinate passions and desires, all that would come within Paul’s enumeration of the works of the flesh, or John’s description of ‘the world’s accursed trinity’."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As sojourners and pilgrims...Christians whose fatherland is heaven." 
2. "To abstain from...the grosser sins of the flesh."
3. "War against the soul...this struggle between the flesh and the spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "They were 'strangers,' not to God and Christ, and to the Spirit, to themselves, to the saints, and to all that is good, as they had formerly been, but to the world, the men of it, and the things in it."
2. "They were 'pilgrims'; whose habit is Christ and His righteousness; whose food is Christ and His fulness; whose staff is Christ and the promises; whose guide is the blessed Spirit."
3. "These [fleshly lusts] are enemies to the spiritual peace, comfort, and welfare of the soul; and being of a man's household, and in his heart, are the worst enemies he has; and are to be treated as such, to be shunned and avoided, watched and guarded against."

### John Wesley:
1. "You sojourn in the body; you are pilgrims in this world." 
2. "Abstain from desires of anything in this house, or in this country."
3. "Abstain from desires of anything in this house, or in this country."
