# 1 Peter 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to submit ourselves to every human institution and ordinance of man for the sake of Christ. Our submission reflects the existing rights of power in each case and honors Christ, who was subject to earthly rulers. This obedience demonstrates that we are not anarchists but representatives of Christ on earth. By obeying these earthly authorities, we bring glory to God and refute the accusations of the heathen. Our submission is a testament to God's command and His divine appointment of civil government.
