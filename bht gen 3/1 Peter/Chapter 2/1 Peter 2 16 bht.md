# 1 Peter 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As free children of God, our freedom should not be used as a veil for evil intent, but rather as a means to serve God wholeheartedly. Our well-doing is a natural outflow of our freedom in Christ, where we are liberated from the bondage of sin. Let us not indulge in licentiousness, but fulfill our duty through love and the holy instincts of Christian liberty. True liberty is found in serving God and harmlessly benefiting others, in accordance with the principles of Christian freedom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "and not as having your freedom [for] a veil of your evil intent (of the evil intent which using your freedom as a veil would necessarily presuppose)"

3. "...for they that are free are the servants of God and Christ, and show themselves to be so by submitting to and obeying those that are under them, and ordained by them..."
