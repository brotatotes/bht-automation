## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The intent is, to distinguish the milk spoken of from mere fleshly milk, and to shew that it is spoken figuratively and spiritually: that milk of the soul, not of the body,‚Äîmilk to be imbibed by the mental faculties." 
2. "Guileless...that is without guile, has no by-ends, no one purpose but to nourish benefit the soul." 
3. "The growth is the measure of the fulness of that‚Äînot only rescue from destruction, but‚Äîpositive blessedness, which is implied in salvation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The childlike spirit is indispensable if we would enter heaven."
2. "The believer of himself thirsts after the word of God."
3. "Growth is the measure of the fulness of that, not only rescue from destruction, but positive blessedness, which is implied in salvation."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "That no one might think that infancy, void of understanding and full of fatuity, was commended by him, he in due time meets this objection; so he bids them to desire milk free from guile, and yet mixed with right understanding."
2. "For simplicity and quickness of understanding are two things apparently opposite; but they ought to be mixed together, lest simplicity should become insipid, and lest malicious craftiness should creep in for want of understanding."
3. "But milk, here, is not elementary doctrine, which one perpetually learns; and never comes to the knowledge of the truth, but a mode of living which has the savor of the new birth, when we surrender ourselves to be brought up by God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is difficult to convey the precise sense of the three words which follow."
2. "It expresses a simple fact here, the recency of the Christian life in these converts."
3. "The unflagging spiritual appetite or 'longing' which is spoken of is to be cherished with this in view as its most proper object, their own growth from strength to strength, until they reach the measure of final redemption."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As newborn babes (œâœÇ Œ±œÅœÑŒπŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÑŒ± Œ≤œÅŒµœÜŒ∑)."
2. "Long for (ŒµœÄŒπœÄŒøŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±œÑŒµ)."
3. "The spiritual milk which is without guile (œÑŒø ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫ŒøŒΩ Œ±Œ¥ŒøŒªŒøŒΩ Œ≥Œ±ŒªŒ±)."

### John Gill:
1. "They were as 'babes', not on account of their want of knowledge, or unskilfulness in the word of righteousness; or of nonproficiency in the learning of divine truths, and their great dulness, backwardness, and imperfection; but because of their harmlessness and innocence, meekness and humility."
2. "By 'the sincere milk of the word' is meant the Gospel, even the whole of it, and not, as elsewhere, the more plain and easy truths of it; which is compared to milk for its purity in itself, for every word of God is pure and for its purifying nature, as used by the Spirit of God."
3. "Regenerate persons are not at their full growth at once; they are first children, then young men, and then fathers in Christ; the Gospel is appointed as a means of their spiritual growth, and by the blessing of God becomes so, and which they find to be so by good experience."

### John Wesley:
1. "Desire ‚Äî Always, as earnestly as new born babes do."
2. "The milk of the word ‚Äî That word of God which nourishes the soul as milk does the body, and which is sincere, pure from all guile."
3. "That you may grow thereby ‚Äî In faith, love, holiness, unto the full stature of Christ."
