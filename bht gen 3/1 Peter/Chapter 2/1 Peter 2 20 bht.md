# 1 Peter 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we endure suffering for doing wrong and accept the punishment, there is no true glory in it. On the other hand, if we endure suffering for doing good and still endure it, that is the kind of glory that truly matters. This reminds us of Christ's own sufferings and his silent submission to them. It cautions against pretending to be martyrs and acknowledges that at times, Christians may deserve persecution. Patience becomes a pleasing sacrifice when we bear punishment with a submissive spirit, reflecting God's will and receiving His acceptance.
