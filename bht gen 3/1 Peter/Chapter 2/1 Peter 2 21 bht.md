## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Christ also (the also applies to the words 'suffered for you,' the words for you carrying with them the 'well-doing,' as explained below, ver. 24) suffered for you."
3. "Leaving behind for you a copy (a pattern to write or paint by: technically, these patterns were formul√¶ given by writing-masters to their pupils, containing all the letters of the alphabet) that ye should follow upon (follow close upon, denoting close application to: the word is commonly used of following behind another) His footsteps."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "Peter graphically sets before servants those features especially suited to their case."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For even hereunto were ye called - Such a spirit is required by the very nature of your Christian vocation; you were called into the church in order that you might evince it." 
2. "Because Christ also suffered for us - ... The object is, to hold up the example of Christ to those who were called to suffer, and to say to them that they should bear their trials in the same spirit that he evinced in his." 
3. "Leaving us an example - The apostle does not say that this was the only object for which Christ suffered, but that it was an object, and an important one. ... It means properly 'a writing copy,' such as is set for children; or an outline or sketch for a painter to fill up; and then, in general, an example, a pattern for imitation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leaving [œÖœÄŒøŒªŒπŒºœÄŒ±ŒΩœâŒΩ]. Only here in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "For though his discourse was respecting servants, yet this passage ought not to be confined to that subject. For the Apostle here reminds all the godly in common as to what the condition of Christianity is, as though he had said, that we are called by the Lord for this end, patiently to bear wrongs."
2. "But we must notice the words, Leaving us an example. For as he treats of imitation, it is necessary to know what in Christ is to be our example."
3. "This subject is handled more at large by Paul in Romans 8:29, where he teaches us that all the children of God are foreordained to be made conformable to the image of Christ, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Patient endurance of undeserved suffering should be deemed no strange thing... Painful as it was, it was involved in their Christian vocation." 
2. "The servant cannot expect to be greater than the Master. They are only called to endure as Christ endured."
3. "The idea of an example is conveyed by a term, of which this is the one N. T. instance, and which denotes properly the sketch given to students of art to copy, or trace over and fill in."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were called to suffer without flinching (Hort), if need be."
2. "The fact that Christ suffered (ŒµœÄŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒΩ) lifts their suffering to a new plane."
3. "Peter does not mean that Christ suffered only as an example (1 Peter 1:18), but he did leave us his example for our copying (1 John 2:6)."

### John Gill:
1. "For even hereunto were ye called,.... Both to well doing, of which none but those who are called with an holy and effectual calling are capable...and to patience in suffering for it..." 
2. "because Christ also suffered for us; in our room and stead, to fulfil the law, satisfy the justice of God, and make reconciliation for sin; and not only for our good, or merely as a martyr, to confirm the truth of his doctrine, or barely as an example to us, though this also is true..."
3.
