### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is the affirmation of a freedom not only from open but also from hidden sin, a sinlessness not in deed only, but also in word, and indeed."
2. "The language, as Bengel suggests, is peculiarly pertinent to the case of slaves with their strong temptations to practise deception."
3. "The statement is given, too, with the direct and positive force of simple historical tenses, which may imply (as Alford puts it) that in no instance did He ever do the wrong deed, or say the guileful word."

2. "There was no deceit in his lips, no falsehood in his doctrine, any more than there was immorality in his conversation."
3. "Since Christ suffered, who had no sin, nor did any, nor could any be found in him, charged upon him, and proved against him; and which sufferings of his he bore with patience; then how much must it become sinful men to bear their sufferings patiently?"
