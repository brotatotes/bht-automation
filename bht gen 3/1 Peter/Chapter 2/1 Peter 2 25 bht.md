3. "Shepherd and Bishopâ€”The designation of the pastors and elders of the Church belongs in its fullest sense to the great Head of the Church, 'the good Shepherd.' As the 'bishop' oversees (as the Greek term means), so 'the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous' ( :-). He gives us His spirit and feeds and guides us by His word."

3. "There is then no cause to fear, but that he will faithfully watch over the safety of those who are in his fold and under his care."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The readers are compared simply to sheep, not to wandering sheep. That is to say, they are said themselves to have been once wanderers, and in that state of estrangement from God to have been like sheep, helpless, foolish, and heedless." 
2. "On the ground of such instances...it seems necessary to give the verb the middle sense here, although it might seem more in harmony with the context to render it 'are returned,' so as to bring out more clearly what had been done for them."
3. "The title â€˜Shepherd,â€™ indeed, is used of God in the Old Testament...But it is also applied to Messiah there, while in the New Testament it is not only claimed for Himself by Christ, but is given to Him again by Peter."

### John Gill:
1. "God's elect are sheep before conversion; not that they have the agreeable properties of sheep, as to be meek, harmless, innocent, clean, and profitable, for they are the reverse of all this."
2. "Saints are passive, and not active in first conversion; they are turned, not by the power of their own free will, but by the power of God's free grace."
3. "He is the 'Bishop' or 'Overseer' of the souls of his people, though not to the exclusion of their bodies: he has took the oversight of them willingly, and looks well to his flock, inspects into their cases, and often visits them, and never forsakes them; nor will he leave them till they receive the end of their faith, the salvation of their souls."

### John Wesley:
1. The bishop â€” The kind observer, inspector, or overseer of your souls.
