# 1 Peter 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The necessary condition of this exhortation is assumed in the readers, as the first tastes of God's goodness are followed by fuller experiences. Whosoever has not tasted the word, to him it is not sweet, but to those who have experienced it, who with the heart believe that Christ has been sent for me and is become my own, it tastes sweet. The taste of God's goodness excites the appetite and should allure us to find rest in Him.
