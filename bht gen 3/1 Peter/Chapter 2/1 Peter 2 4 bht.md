## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To whom (i.e. the Lord) approaching...the Christian closely realizes the presence and seeks the communion of his Lord." 
2. "Observe that this Apostle lays hold on the metaphor...and teaches us all to become living stones after His example."
3. "Living...points not only to the figure being realized in a higher department of being than its natural one, but also to the fact of the Lord being alive from the dead."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ is positively termed the 'living stone'; living, as having life in Himself from the beginning, and as raised from the dead to live evermore after His rejection by men, and so the source of life to us." 
2. "Like no earthly rock, He lives and gives life." 
3. "Many are alienated from the Gospel, because it is not everywhere in favor, but is on the contrary rejected by most men. Peter answers that, though rejected by men, Christ is peculiarly the stone of salvation honored by God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Salvation is often represented as corning to Christ."
2. "He occupied the same place in regard to the church which a foundation-stone does to the edifice that is reared upon it."
3. "It was all a living temple - a temple composed of living materials - from the foundation to the top."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Coming [œÄœÅŒøœÉŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπ] . Indicating a close [œÄœÅŒøœÇ] and an habitual (present participle) approach and an intimate association."
2. "A living stone [ŒªŒπŒ∏ŒøŒΩ Œ∂œâŒΩœÑŒ±] . Omit as unto. So Rev. The words are in apposition with whom (Christ)."
3. "Precious [ŒµŒΩœÑŒπŒºŒøŒΩ] . At ch. 1 19 (precious blood) another word is used [œÑŒπŒºŒπŒøœÇ] , denoting essential preciousness. The word here indicates the preciousness as recognized or held in honor."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let it then be noticed, that Peter connects an access to God with the taste of his goodness."
2. "For as the human mind necessarily dreads and shuns God, as long as it regards him as rigid and severe; so, as soon as he makes known his paternal love to the faithful, it immediately follows that they disregard all things and even forget themselves and hasten to him."
3. "But Peter forbids us to esteem Christ the less, however despised he may be by the world, because he, notwithstanding, retains his own worth and honor before God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If the Church, too, is to increase into that which God means it to be, its members must not only feed upon the Word, but come constantly to Christ Himself."
2. "The upbuilding of the Church on Christ the foundation can be made good only in so far as we, the builders, are ourselves ever coming into close personal union with the same Christ."
3. "There is no reference here to the Jews as distinguished from others. There is simply a broad contrast drawn between two kinds of treatment accorded to the 'living stone,' one on the side of men, and another on the side of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is apparent an intentional contradiction between 'living' and 'stone.'"
2. "But with God."
3. "Elect...meaning far more in God's sight."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ here, as often elsewhere, is compared to a 'stone'; and Peter, by the use of this metaphor, shows that he is not the rock, but Christ is the rock on which the church is built."
2. "and it is chiefly with respect to the usefulness of a stone in building, that Christ is compared to one, who is the foundation and cornerstone."
3. "and they are encouraged to come to him under the above considerations, as a stone, a foundation stone; believing that he is laid as a foundation, and that he is the only foundation, and therefore they lay the whole stress of their salvation, and build all their hopes of happiness on him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Living from eternity; alive from the dead."
2. "There is a wonderful beauty and energy in these expressions."
3. "But chosen of God ‚Äî From all eternity, to be the foundation of his church."
