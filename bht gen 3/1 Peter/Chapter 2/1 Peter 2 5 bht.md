## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Being God's spiritual temple, they form a holy priesthood to Him, approaching and serving before Him in virtue of that Living and Holy One, whose mystic Body they are."
2. "Nowhere is this more clearly declared by inference, than here."
3. "The one, once-for-all devotion of the body, as in Rom. xii. 1, to God as His...acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is 'THE SON,' 'High Priest,' 'King,' 'Lamb'; they, 'sons,' 'priests,' 'kings,' 'sheep,' 'lambs.'" 
2. "All believers alike, and not merely ministers, are now the dwelling of God and priests unto God."
3. "Our sacrifices are those of prayer, praise, and self-denying services in the cause of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The purpose of the apostle here is to compare the church to a beautiful temple - such as the temple in Jerusalem, and to show that it is complete in all its parts, as that was."
2. "The special abode of God on the earth was now removed from that temple to the Christian church."
3. "Our prayers and praises are in themselves so imperfect, and proceed from such polluted lips and hearts, that they can be acceptable only through him as our intercessor before the throne of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The metaphor of a house built of living stones is violent, and sufficiently characteristic of Peter; yet it pictures, in a very striking way, the union of stability, growth, and activity in the ideal church." 
2. "But, as Salmond remarks, 'In Paul we have even bolder instances of apparent confusion of metaphors.'"
3. "The force of ajna, up, appears in the fact of the altar being raised. The word is often used of carrying from a lower to a higher place."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must further observe, that he constructs one house from the whole number of the faithful...all ought to be so fitted together, that they may form one universal temple."
2. "For by how much the more excellent is the reality than the types, by so much the more all things excel in the kingdom of Christ."
3. "Then Peter here obviates that want of faith which we may have respecting the acceptableness of our works, when he says, that they are accepted, not for the merit of their own excellency, but through Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The one thing it affirms is that all Christians as such, and without distinction, constitute a priestly fraternity corresponding to the community of priests established under the Law, and realizing the complete idea of a priesthood which the former college, with its limitation in numbers, and its sharp separation from the people, and its ritual service, imperfectly and distantly exhibited." 
2. "Their service is to offer ‚Äòsacrifices,‚Äô and these, in conformity with the service itself, must be not material but ‚Äòspiritual.‚Äô"
3. "To Him to whom we owe our first consecration as priests to God, we owe also the continued acceptance of all that we offer in our priestly ministry."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter just carried it a bit farther and Paul uses a temple for believers in one place (1 Corinthians 3:16) and for the kingdom of God in general (Ephesians 2:22), as does the author of Hebrews (Hebrews 3:6). This "spiritual house" includes believers in the five Roman provinces of 1 Peter 1:1 and shows clearly how Peter understood the metaphor of Christ in Matthew 16:18 to be not a local church, but the church general (the kingdom of Christ)." 
2. "At any rate, Peter has the same idea of Revelation 1:6 (ŒπŒµœÅŒµŒπœÇ, priests) that all believers are priests (Hebrews 4:16) and can approach God directly."
3. "Only these are 'spiritual' (œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œ±œÇ) as pictured also in Hebrews 13:15."

### John Gill:
1. "Saints likewise are compared to stones; they lie in the same quarry, and are the same by nature as the rest of mankind, till dug out and separated from thence by the powerful and efficacious grace of God."
2. "These living stones being laid, and cemented together, in a Gospel church state, become the house of God in a spiritual sense, in distinction from the material house of the tabernacle, and temple of old."
3. "Now such...are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; through whom they are offered up; for it is through him the saints have access to God, present themselves to him, and their services; and both persons and services are only accepted in Christ, and for his sake, and in virtue of his sacrifice, which is always of a sweet smelling savour to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye ‚Äî Believers. As living stones ‚Äî Alive to God through him."
2. "Are built up ‚Äî In union with each other. A spiritual house ‚Äî Being spiritual yourselves, and an habitation of God through the Spirit."
3. "An holy priesthood ‚Äî Consecrated to God, and 'holy as he is holy.' To offer up - Your souls and bodies, with all your thoughts, words, and actions, as spiritual sacrifices to God."
