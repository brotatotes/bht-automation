# 1 Peter 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The stumbling of those who are disobedient to the word is not mere mental offense, but rather, it is the eternal disgrace and ruin they face as they reject Christ, the corner-stone. The disbelieving hurt themselves by stumbling over Christ, who becomes a stumbling block to them. On the contrary, the saved attribute all the merit of their salvation to God's electing love and grace. The preaching of Christ crucified has always been a stumbling block to those who reject Him, resulting in their own downfall and eternal destruction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This stumbling is not mere mental offence, which e.g. they take at the preaching of the Cross; but the 'stumbling upon the dark mountains' of Jer. xiii. 16: see Prov. iv. 19; Dan. xi. 19:‚Äîthe eternal disgrace and ruin which forms the contrast to 'honour' above." 
2. "See, on the 'rock of offence,' Matt. xvi. 23: where we find that the very expression carries a reminiscence of Peter's own days of unbelief when he was an offence,‚Äîhe, the stone, petros,‚Äîto his Lord."
3. "who stumble, being disobedient to the word (thus, and not as A.V., is the construction), for which (thing, fact, viz., their whole moral course of delinquency and the stumbling at the end of it) they were also (besides that they reach it, there is another consideration) appointed (set where they are, or were; viz. by Him who set above [it is the same word in the original] the stone of stumbling)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They hurt themselves in stumbling over the corner-stone, as 'stumble' means in Jeremiah 13:16; Daniel 11:19." 
2. "God appoints the ungodly to be given up unto sin, and a reprobate mind, and its necessary penalty." 
3. "The lost shall lay all the blame of their ruin on their own sinful perversity, not on God's decree; the saved shall ascribe all the merit of their salvation to God's electing love and grace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The rejection of the Saviour becomes the means of their ruin."
2. "What might have been, therefore, the means of their salvation, is made the cause of their deeper condemnation."
3. "Their stumbling and falling was not a matter of chance, or a result which was not contemplated, but entered into the original arrangement."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here Peter intimates that all who receive not Christ as revealed in the Gospel, are adversaries to God, and resist his word."
2. "Hence Peter, in order to set forth the character of the conflict, said that they were the unbelieving."
3. "But the other sense is equally suitable, that they had been appointed to unbelief; as Pharaoh is said to have been set up for this end, that he might resist God, and all the reprobate are destined for the same purpose."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The terms, too, denote not what the disbelieving feel Christ to be (so Luther, etc.), or the offence which they take at Him, but what He in point of fact must prove objectively to them."
2. "Christ is what He is declared to be to a certain class, when or because they disobey the Word. He is made a stone of stumbling only to those who, by rejecting that Word, in point of fact turn God‚Äôs grace in Christ to their own hurt."
3. "Just as it is said in 1 Peter 2:6, ‚ÄòBehold, I lay (or, set) in Zion a chief corner-stone,‚Äô so it is said here (for the verbs are the same) that they ‚Äòwere appointed (or, set).'"+

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To the disbelieving, Christ was indeed 'a stone of stumbling and rock of offence,'... both make one fall." (about 1 Peter 2:8)
2. "Too much distinction need not be made between ŒªŒπŒ∏ŒøœÇ and œÄŒµœÑœÅŒ±." (about 1 Peter 2:8)
3. "Their disobedience is not ordained, the penalty of their disobedience is." (about 1 Peter 2:8)

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle alludes to Isaiah 8:14 and which is a prophecy of the Messiah."
2. "The preaching of Christ crucified always was, and still is, a stumbling block unto them."
3. "This is the source and cause of their stumbling at Christ and his Gospel: it is worth while to compare this with the paraphrase of Isaiah 8:14 which passage is here referred to."

### John Wesley:
1. "They who believe not, stumble, and fall, and perish for ever."
2. "God having appointed from all eternity, 'he that believeth not shall be damned.'"
3. "God having appointed from all eternity, 'he that believeth not shall be damned.'"
