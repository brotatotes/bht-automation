# 1 Peter 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let him turn away from evil and actively do good; let him search for peace as something hidden and pursue it as something elusive. It is not enough to shun evil when it presents itself; we must also actively avoid its influence in our lives. Seek peace in every aspect of life, even when it seems to flee from us. Embrace blamelessness and kindness in both our words and deeds, and let our pursuit of peace be an unwavering determination.
