## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sanctify Christ as Lord." 
2. "This verse does not impose an obligation to bring forward a learned proof and logical defense of revelation. But as believers deny themselves, crucify the world, and brave persecution, they must be buoyed up by some strong 'hope'; men of the world, having no such hope themselves, are moved by curiosity to ask the secret of this hope; the believer must be ready to give an experimental account 'how this hope arose in him, what it contains, and on what it rests' [STEIGER]."
3. "Be ready, but with 'meekness.' Not pertly and arrogantly. Fearâ€”due respect towards man, and reverence towards God, remembering His cause does not need man's hot temper to uphold it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the midst of dangers, be not intimidated; dread not what man can do, but evince proper reliance on a holy God, and flee to him with the confidence which is due to one so glorious."
2. "The sentiment of the passage then is, that the sanctifying of the Lord God in our hearts, or proper confidence in him as a holy and righteous God, will deliver us from fear."
3. "The fear of the Lord...â€˜as greatest, overtops and nullifies all lesser fears: the heart possessed with this fear hath no room for the other.â€™"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sanctify Christ (the Christ) as Lord."
2. "Lit., ready for an answer. Answer is our word apology, not in the popular sense of excuse, but in the more radical sense of defence."
3. "Meekness."

### John Calvin:
1. "But Peter does not expressly bid us to assert and proclaim what has been given us by the Lord everywhere, and always and among all indiscriminately, for the Lord gives his people the spirit of discretion, so that they may know when and how far and to whom it is expedient to speak." 
2. "Then Peter had in view no other thing, than that Christians should make it evident to unbelievers that they truly worshipped God, and had a holy and good religion."
3. "And hence we learn how all those abuse the name of Christians, who understand nothing certain respecting their faith, and have nothing to give as an answer for it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ takes the place of the Jehovah of hosts, who is presented in the prophecy as the object of sanctification, and the words â€˜in your heartsâ€™ are added in order to express the fact that this sanctification is not to be of a formal or external order, but to rest in the deepest seat of feeling."
2. "The inward homage to Him does not absolve from responsibility to others, or justify disregard of their inquiries. What it implies is neither on the one hand the reticence which fear or indifference may prompt, nor on the other the propensity to dispute about our hope, but a readiness to give an account of it, wherever it may be necessary or helpful to do so."
3. "Having its roots in the Christian consciousness of sin, [meekness] is first of all a grace with a Godward aspect, â€˜the temper of spirit in which we accept His dealings with us as good, and therefore without disputing or resisting.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sanctify... This instead of being afraid."
2. "Being ready always. No participle in the Greek, old adjective."
3. "Yet with meekness and fear. Of God, not of man."

### John Gill:
1. "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts,.... Still referring to Isaiah 8:13 not by making him holy, which need not, nor cannot be, he being essentially, infinitely, and perfectly holy; but by declaring and proclaiming his holiness..."
2. "in the exercise of the grace of fear upon him... and in the exercise of faith upon him... whereby glory is given to him, a witness borne to his truth, and he is sanctified."
3. "a 'reason' of this is to be given; not that they are to account for the Gospel, upon the foot of carnal reason... but that he should be well acquainted with the ground and foundation of the Christian religion; at least, with the first principles of the oracles of God, and be conversant with the Scriptures..."

### John Wesley:
1. "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts â€” Have an holy fear, and a full trust in his wise providence."
2. "The hope â€” Of eternal life."
3. "And fear â€” A filial fear of offending God, and a jealousy over yourselves, lest ye speak amiss."
