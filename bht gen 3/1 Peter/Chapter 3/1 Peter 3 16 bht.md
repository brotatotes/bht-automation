# 1 Peter 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A profession of faith must be accompanied by a good conscience, as words without practice have but small weight. This good conscience is the secret spring of readiness to give account of our hope. As Christians, our whole life, in Christ, as its element, should be characterized by a good conscience. This good conscience enables us to give an account of our hope with meekness. Through our good conversation in Christ, even our adversaries may be put to shame, acknowledging the genuineness of our faith.
