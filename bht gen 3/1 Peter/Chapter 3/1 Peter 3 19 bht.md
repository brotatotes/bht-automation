## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The same 'Spirit' which was efficacious in restoring him to life, after he was put to death, was that by which he preached to the spirits in prison."
2. "The idea is, that to those spirits who were then in prison who had formerly lived in the days of Noah, the message had been in fact delivered."
3. "There is no evidence in the fair interpretation of the passage that any message is borne to them while in prison."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By which [ŒµŒΩ œâ] . Wrong. Rev., correctly, in which : in the spiritual form of life; in the disembodied spirit."
2. "Went and preached [œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµŒπœÇ ŒµŒ∫Œ∑œÅœÖŒæŒµŒΩ] . The word went, employed as usual of a personal act; and preached, in its ordinary New - Testament sense of proclaiming the Gospel."
3. "To the spirits [œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ] . As in Hebrews 12:23, of disembodied spirits, though the word yucai, souls, is used elsewhere (Revelation 6:9; Revelation 20:4)."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then says, that Christ did not rise only for himself, but that he made known to others the same power of his Spirit, so that it penetrated to the dead. It hence follows, that we shall not less feel it in vivifying whatever is mortal in us." 
2. "I therefore have no doubt but Peter speaks generally, that the manifestation of Christ‚Äôs grace was made to godly spirits, and that they were thus endued with the vital power of the Spirit. Hence there is no reason to fear that it will not flow to us." 
3. "It seems to me that œÜœÖŒªŒ±Œ∫·Ω¥ rather means a watchtower in which watchmen stand for the purpose of watching, or the very act of watching, for it is often so taken by Greek authors; and the meaning would be very appropriate, that godly souls were watching in hope of the salvation promised them, as though they saw it afar off."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The verb 'preached' is used absolutely here...of Christ's earthly ministry of preaching, which was a message of grace." 
2. "The word 'spirits' is used here...in the sense of disembodied spirits."
3. "The phrase 'in prison' has the definite force which it has in...and is not to be explained away as merely equivalent to 'in safe-keeping,' or 'in the world of the dead' generally."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luther admits that he does not know what Peter means."
2. "One can only say that it is a slim hope for those who neglect or reject Christ in this life to gamble with a possible second chance after death which rests on very precarious exegesis of a most difficult passage in Peter's Epistle."
3. "The language is plain enough except that it does not make it clear whether Jesus did the preaching to spirits in prison at the time or to people whose spirits are now in prison, the point of doubt already discussed."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, by his Spirit, by which he was quickened, went in the ministry of Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and preached both by words and deeds, by the personal ministry of Noah, and by the building of the ark, to that generation who was then in being..."
2. "Christ neither went into this prison, nor preached in it, nor to spirits that were then in it when he preached, but to persons alive in the days of Noah, and who being disobedient, when they died, their separate souls were put into prison, and there they were when the apostle wrote..."
3. "From whence we learn, that Christ was, that he existed in his divine nature before he was incarnate, he was before Abraham, he was in the days of Noah; and that Christ also, under the Old Testament, acted the part of a Mediator, in his divine nature, and by his Spirit discharged that branch of it, his prophetic office, before he appeared in human nature; and that the Gospel was preached in those early times, as unto Abraham, so before him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through the ministry of Noah."
2. "The unholy men before the flood, who were then reserved by the justice of God, as in a prison."
3. "Reserved to the judgment of the great day."
