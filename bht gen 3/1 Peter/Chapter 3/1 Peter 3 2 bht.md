### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word chaste here (Î±Ì”Î³Î½Î·Ì€Î½ hagneÌ„n) referâ€™s to purity of conduct in all respects, and not merely to chastity properly so called. It includes that, but it also embraces much more."
2. "A wife may be strictly chaste, and yet there may be many other things in her conduct and temper which would mar the beauty of her piety, and prevent any happy influence on the mind of her husband."
3. "Leighton suggests that the word fear here relates particularly to the other duty enjoined - that of chaste conversation - 'fearing the least stain of chastity, or the very appearance of anything not suiting with it. It is a delicate, timorous grace, afraid of the least air, or shadow of anything that hath but a resemblance of wronging it, in carriage, or speech, or apparel.'"

2. "It is further defined by a couple of words which mean literally 'in fear,' but are happily paraphrased by our A. V., 'coupled with fear,' after Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan."
3. "Nothing could better express what is meant by this 'fear,' therefore, than Leightonâ€™s well-known description of it as 'a delicate and timorous grace, afraid of the least air or shadow of anything that hath but a resemblance of wronging it, in courage, or speech, or apparel.'"
