# 1 Peter 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parallel between baptism and the destruction of unbelievers is exemplified in Noah's ark and the flood. The water that brought death to the unbelievers also brought salvation to Noah and his family. This serves as a reminder that believers should not be discouraged by the multitude of unbelievers in the world, for God has the power to protect and save the faithful few amidst the wickedness. Noah's faithfulness and God's longsuffering are both sources of encouragement for believers enduring hardships and trials.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The ark and the destroying flood answer respectively to 'baptism' and the coming destruction of unbelievers by fire." 
2. "Noah's days are selected, as the ark and the destroying flood answer respectively to 'baptism' and the coming destruction of unbelievers by fire."
3. "The same water which drowned the unbelieving, buoyed up the ark in which the eight were saved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that they did not obey the command of God when he called them to repentance by the preaching of Noah."
2. "God waited on that guilty race for 120 years, Genesis 6:3, a period sufficiently protracted to evince his long-suffering toward one generation."
3. "Though the great mass of any one generation may be wicked, God can protect and save the few who are faithful."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By water [Î´Î¹Î±] . Rev., through. Some take this as instrumental, by means of water; other as local, by passing through the water, or being brought safely through the water into the ark." 
2. "A pregnant construction; into which they were gathered, and in which they were saved." 
3. "Rev., in margin, were brought safely through water."

### John Calvin:
1. "He meets, as I think, a doubt, which might have harassed the faithful of that day. They saw almost the whole world filled with unbelievers, that they enjoyed all authority, and that life was in their power. This trial might have shaken the confidence of those who were shut up, as it were, under the sentence of death. Therefore Peter reminds them, that the condition of the fathers was not different, and that though the multitude of the ungodly then covered the whole earth, their life was yet preserved in safety by the power of God." 
2. "The sum of what is said is this, that the world has always been full of unbelievers, but that the godly ought not to be terrified by their vast number; for though Noah was surrounded on every side by the ungodly, and had very few as his friends, he was not yet drawn aside from the right course of his faith."
3. "When God deferred his vengeance and did not immediately execute it, the ungodly boldly disregarded all threatenings; but Noah, on the contrary, being warned by God, had the deluge for a long time before his eyes. Hence his assiduity in building the ark; for being terrified by Godâ€™s judgment, he shook off all torpidity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The clause may describe the 'spirits' according to the conduct which made them spirits 'in prison.'" 
2. "The 'waiting' is given in the imperfect tense to bring out its lengthened continuance. It is expressed, too, by a verb for which Paul has a particular fondness, and which conveys the idea of the intenseness or patience of the waiting."
3. "All that he has in view is...that it was by means of water that the few entering the ark which floated thereon were preserved."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These spirits now in prison once upon a time were disobedient (typical rebels, Hart calls them)."
2. "A hundred years apparently after the warning Noah was preparing the ark and Noah as a preacher of righteousness forewarned the people, who disregarded it."
3. "They came through the water in the ark and so were saved by the water in spite of the flood around them."

### John Gill:
1. "The ark was a type of Christ, into whom whoever enters by faith, or in whom whoever believes, shall be saved; but as they that entered into the ark were but few, so are those that enter in at the strait gate, or believe in Christ; and they that went into the ark were saved by the water bearing up the ark, even by that by which others were destroyed; as the very same thing, for different reasons, is the cause or means of destruction and salvation." 
2. "Christ is set, for the fall and rising of many, is a stumblingblock to some, and the power and wisdom of God to others; and the Gospel, and the ministers of it, are the savour of life unto life to some, and the savour of death unto death to others."
3. "This instance of the dispensation of the providence of God to the old world is very appropriately, though by way of digression, introduced by the apostle; showing, that in times past, as then, God's usual method has been to afford the outward means to ungodly men, and to bear with them long, and then bring down his vengeance upon them, and save his own people; and this suffering saints might depend upon would be their case, and therefore should bear their afflictions patiently."

### John Wesley:
1. "When the longsuffering of God waited." 
2. "For an hundred and twenty years; all the time the ark was preparing."
3. "During which Noah warned them all to flee from the wrath to come."
