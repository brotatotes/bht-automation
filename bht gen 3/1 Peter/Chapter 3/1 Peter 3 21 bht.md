# 1 Peter 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Baptism saves us, not through mere water, but through its spiritual significance. Like Noah's deliverance from the flood, baptism symbolizes our transfer from the old world to the new, from destruction to probation, and from separation to communion with God. Through repentance and faith, baptism becomes a means of salvation, purifying our conscience and uniting us with Christ and His Spirit-filled Church. It is through this spiritual baptism that we find acceptance and grace, for our salvation lies not in the water alone, but in the power of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Water saves in both cases. It saved them, being to them a means of floating their ark and bearing them harmless: it saves us, becoming to us baptism: and that baptism not material, but spiritual." 
2. "Not fleshly putting away of filth, but enquiry of a good conscience after God." 
3. "By means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, it is, that in baptism the prayer for a good conscience is directed to God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The flood was for Noah a baptism, as the passage through the Red Sea was for the Israelites; by baptism in the flood he and his family were transferred from the old world to the new: from immediate destruction to lengthened probation; from the companionship of the wicked to communion with God; from the severing of all bonds between the creature and the Creator to the privileges of the covenant: so we by spiritual baptism." 
2. "The antitypical water, namely, baptism, saves you also not of itself, nor the mere material water, but the spiritual thing conjoined with it, repentance and faith, of which it is the sign and seal." 
3. "It is the ark (Christ and His Spirit-filled Church), not the water, which is the instrument of salvation: the water only flowed round the ark so not the mere water baptism, but the water when accompanied with the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense is, that baptism, including all that is properly meant by baptism as a religious rite - that is, baptism administered in connection with true repentance, and true faith in the Lord Jesus, and when it is properly a symbol of the putting away of sin, and of the renewing influences of the Holy Spirit, and an act of unreserved dedication to God - now saves us." 
2. "No outward ablution or purifying saves us, but that which pertains to the conscience."
3. "The application of water is, in fact, but an emblem or symbol of that grace in the heart, and is to be administered as denoting that. It does not convey grace to the soul by any physical efficacy of the water. It is a symbol of the purifying influences of religion, and is made a means of grace in the same way as obedience to any other of the commands of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs only once elsewhere, Hebrews 9:24: 'the figures of the true.'"
2. "The meaning here is much disputed, and can hardly be settled satisfactorily. The rendering answer has no warrant."
3. "Now is laid the solid foundation for a good conscience. The conscience is not only purified from its guilt, but it receives new vital power by means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "As Noah, then, obtained life through death, when in the ark, he was enclosed not otherwise than as it were in the grave, and when the whole world perished, he was preserved together with his small family; so at this day, the death which is set forth in baptism, is to us an entrance into life, nor can salvation be hoped for, except we be separated from the world."
2. "We must at the same time beware of another evil, such as prevails among the Papists; for as they distinguish not as they ought between the thing and the sign, they stop at the outward element, and on that fix their hope of salvation. Therefore the sight of the water takes away their thoughts from the blood of Christ and the power of the Spirit."
3. "For in these words he teaches us that baptism in its main part is spiritual, and then that it includes the remission of sins and renovation of the old man; for how can there be a good and pure conscience until our old man is reformed, and we be renewed in the righteousness of God? and how can we answer before God, unless we rely on and are sustained by a gratuitous pardon of our sins?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The comparison, therefore, is not between the Flood and Baptism, but simply between water in one service and water in another."
2. "The saving efficacy is not of a material kind like that exerted by water in the case of the Ark and its eight."
3. "Peter intends seems to be to explain that, when he speaks of baptism as having a saving efficacy, he does not mean a mere ceremonial washing, but one which carries a moral value with it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Water in baptism now as an anti-type of Noah's deliverance by water."
2. "The saving by baptism which Peter here mentions is only symbolic."
3. "Baptism, Peter explains, does not wash away the filth of the flesh either in a literal sense, as a bath for the body, or in a metaphorical sense of the filth of the soul."

### John Gill:
1. "Baptism was the antitype of that; or there is something in these which correspond, and answer to, and bear a resemblance to each other."
2. "It saves not as a cause, for it has no causal influence on, nor is it essential to salvation."
3. "Then is baptism rightly performed, and its end answered, when a person, conscious to himself of its being an ordinance of Christ, and of his duty to submit to it, does so upon profession of his faith in Christ, in obedience to his command, and 'with' a view to his glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through the water of baptism we are saved from the sin which overwhelms the world as a flood."
  
2. "Not, indeed, the bare outward sign, but the inward grace; a divine consciousness that both our persons and our actions are accepted through him who died and rose again for us."
3. "A divine consciousness that both our persons and our actions are accepted through him who died and rose again for us."
