## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole heavenly hierarchy, as in Col. ii. 10â€“15, being subjected to Him." 
2. "And thus is announced the glorious completion of the result of Christ's voluntary and innocent sufferings: glorious for Himself, and glorious for us, who are by baptism united to Him." 
3. "And now the practical inference for us follows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Proving against rationalists an actual material ascension."
3. "Who is on the right hand of God, having swallowed up death that we may become heirs of everlasting life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Lord Jesus was in like manner persecuted. He was reviled, and rejected, and put to death. Yet he ultimately triumphed. He was raised from the dead, and was exalted to the highest place of honor in the universe. Even so they, if they did not faint, might hope to come off in the end triumphant."
2. "Those who have impenitent husbands and friends should be encouraged in seeking their conversion... We should never despair of the conversion of a friend as long as life lasts, however far he may be from the path of virtue and piety."
3. "It is mainly by a pure life; by a holy walk; by a consistent example... that we are to hope to secure the conversion and salvation of impenitent friends. This is to be so, because most persons form their notions of religion from what they see in the lives of its professed friends."
