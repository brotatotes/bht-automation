# 1 Peter 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A meek and quiet spirit, changed and lovely with Christian affections, is of great price in the sight of God. Singularity mostly comes from pride and hinders religion in the way of others. Even under costly attire, there may be a humble mind. The hidden man of the heart, adorned with a meek and quiet spirit, is an incorruptible apparel. Women should focus on the adornment of the soul, seeking the beauty and ornament of internal grace that is far more valuable than outward appearance.
