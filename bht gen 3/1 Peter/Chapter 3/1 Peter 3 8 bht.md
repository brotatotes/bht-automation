## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Finally, all [being] of one mind, sympathizing, loving the brethren, compassionate, humble-minded." 
2. "(the meaning is not, as in A.V., confined to cases of sorrow: the 'rejoicing with them that do rejoice' is also included)"
3. "humility being essential both to true gentleness of love and to true patience under injuries"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Having compassion one of another—Greek, 'sympathizing' in the joy and sorrow of others."
2. "Love as brethren—Greek, 'loving the brethren.'"
3. "Courteous—genuine Christian politeness; not the tinsel of the world's politeness; stamped with unfeigned love on one side, and humility on the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be ye all of one mind - See the notes at Romans 12:16. The word used here (ὁμόφρων homophrōn) does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means, of the same mind; like-minded; and the object is to secure harmony in their views and feelings."
2. "Having compassion one of another - 'Sympathizing,' (συμπαθεῖς sumpatheis;) entering into one another’s feelings, and evincing a regard for each other’s welfare."
3. "Love as brethren - Margin, 'loving to the;' that is, the brethren. The Greek word (φιλάδελφος philadelphos) does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means loving one’s brethren; that is, loving each other as Christian brethren - Robinson, Lexicon."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Indicating unity of thought and feeling."
2. "Interchange of fellow - feeling in joy or sorrow."
3. "The nobler entrails, which are regarded as the seat of the affections, and hence equivalent to our popular use of heart."

### John Calvin:
1. "Sympathy (συμπάθεια) extends to all our faculties, when concord exists between us; so that every one condoles with us in adversity as well as rejoices with us in prosperity, so that every one not only cares for himself, but also regards the benefit of others." 
2. "In what follows there are two readings in Greek; but what seems to me the most probable is the one I have put as the text; for we know that it is the chief bond to preserve friendship, when every one thinks modestly and humbly of himself; as there is nothing on the other hand which produces more discords than when we think too highly of ourselves."
3. "Wisely then does Peter bid us to be humble-minded (ταπεινόφρονες,) lest pride and haughtiness should lead us to despise our neighbors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The unity of mind and the unity of feeling are associated again in Romans 12:15-16, and Philippians 2:1-2." 
2. "In classical Greek the adjective and the cognate noun (the former being rare) have either a purely physical sense or denote stout-heartedness. They owe to Christianity their delicate ethical tone, and the sense of the kinship of man with man which softens and enriches them." 
3. "Humble-mindedness' occurs in no Greek writer prior to the Christian era. In Christianity it becomes a grace, contrasted with the heathen virtue of 'high-mindedness,' and born of the sense of unworthiness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Likeminded (ομοφρονες). Old compound (ομοσ, φρην), here only in N.T."
2. "Compassionate (συμπαθεις). Old adjective (συν, πασχω), in N.T. only here and Romans 12:15. Our 'sympathetic' in original sense."
3. "Humble minded (ταπεινοφρονες). Late compound (ταπεινοσ, φρην), in Plutarch, Proverbs 29:23, here only in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "Be ye all of one mind; whatever difference there might be in their natural and civil relation and character; and which is to be understood not of the sameness of affection to one another, or of an humble and condescending spirit, disposition, and carriage to each other, for these are expressed in some following exhortations; but of sameness of judgment with respect to the doctrines and ordinances of the Gospel."
2. "Love as brethren; not in a natural and civil, but in a spiritual relation, being children of God, and brethren of Christ, and in a Gospel church state; and whose love to each other ought to be universal, fervent, without dissimulation, and as Christ has loved them."
3. "Be pitiful; to those that are in distress; put on bowels of mercy, and relieve and succour them, distributing cheerfully to their necessities."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sympathizing — Rejoicing and sorrowing together. Love all believers as brethren." 
2. "Be pitiful - Toward the afflicted." 
3. "Be courteous — To all men. Courtesy is such a behaviour toward equals and inferiors as shows respect mixed with love."
