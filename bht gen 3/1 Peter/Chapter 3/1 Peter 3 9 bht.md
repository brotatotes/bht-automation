# 1 Peter 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we are called to respond differently to evil and reviling. Instead of returning in kind, we are to bless others, not seeking a return blessing, but because our portion is blessing. No amount of railing or reproach can harm us, for we are already experiencing the first fruits of God's eternal blessing. By imitating God and blessing even those who harm us, we reflect His love and grace, demonstrating our sincere well-wishing for others.

1. Rendering evil, etc. See Romans 12:17. 
Blessing [ÎµÏ…Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Ï…Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚] . Not a noun governed by rendering, but a participle. Be not rendering evil, but be blessing.


### John Calvin:
1. "In order to preserve love, we must bear with many things."
2. "Nor is it indeed enough to abstain from revenge; but Peter requires also that we should pray for those who reproach us; for to bless here means to pray."
3. "He shews how much would be the gain of patience; for if we submissively bear injuries, the Lord will bestow on us his blessing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An undue esteem of ourselves is inconsistent either with the oneness of mind and feeling which makes genuine brotherliness, or with the Christian law of overcoming evil with good." 
2. "The return which we are to render for injury done us, whether in the form of the evil deed or the reviling word, is to desire and pray for the good of the injurers."
3. "The point is a still deeper one namely, that it is Godâ€™s purpose, indeed, that Christians should have good, but in order to have good, they must be good; hence He called them to be good in order that the heritage which is designed for them might come to be theirs actually, and theirs as a heritage of blessing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not rendering evil for evil."
2. "Reviling for reviling."
3. "But contrariwise blessing."

### John Gill:
1. "Doing an ill thing in return to one that has done ill to you, and in a way of revenge for it... which is contrary... and which is to be overcome of evil." 
2. "Returning ill language to such as have given it, but rather should imitate Christ... and whose advice is, instead of returning injuries, blows, or words, to turn to him that smites on the right check the other also and to bless them that curse, do good to them that hate, and pray for them that persecute."
3. "But contrariwise blessing; praying for a blessing on them... much more our fellow Christians who may do us an injury or speak evil of us, or to us."

### John Wesley:
1. Ye are called to inherit a blessing â€” Therefore their railing cannot hurt you; and, by blessing them, you imitate God, who blesses you.
