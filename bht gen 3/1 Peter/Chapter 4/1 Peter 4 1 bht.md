# 1 Peter 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are called to arm ourselves with the same mindset as Christ, who suffered in the flesh and obtained a cessation from sin. This mindset involves willingly embracing the suffering that God allows in our lives, being patient and willing to endure what comes our way. By doing so, we become dead to sin and are no longer associated with it. Temptation loses its power over us, as we are focused on doing good and walking in righteousness, following the example of Christ's suffering.

3. "That as he suffered in the flesh taken from us, so the whole of our flesh ought to be crucified."
