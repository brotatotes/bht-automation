# 1 Peter 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As stewards of the various grace of God, Christians are entrusted with the gifts of the Spirit to minister to one another. These gifts are meant for the common good, not for selfish use. By seeking the good of others, we also promote our own good. Let us remember that our gifts are graciously bestowed upon us by God and be willing to share them with others as needed. In doing so, we fulfill our role as stewards of God's manifold grace.
