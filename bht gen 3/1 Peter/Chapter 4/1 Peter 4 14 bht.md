## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He makes mention of reproaches because they bring with them more bitterness than loss of goods, or even torments and pains of the body; there being nothing which so much breaks noble minds."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Reproach affects noble minds more than loss of goods, or even bodily sufferings."
2. "The Spirit of glory" is His Spirit, for He is the "Lord of glory." Believers may well overcome the "reproach," seeing that "the Spirit of glory" rests upon them, as upon Him.
3. "Evil spoken of," literally, "blasphemed" not merely do they "speak against you," but blasphemously mock Christ and Christianity itself.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It would be a blessed condition, because it would be like that of their Saviour; would show that they were his friends; would be accompanied with rich spiritual influences in the present world; and would be followed by the rewards of heaven."
2. "If they were called to suffer in the cause of the Redeemer, they would not be left or forsaken. They might hope that God would impart his Spirit to them in proportion to their sufferings in behalf of religion, and that they would have augmented joy and peace."
3. "In sickness, bereavement, loss of property, disappointment in their worldly plans, and death itself, they may hope that larger measures of the Spiritâ€™s influences will rest upon them. Hence, it is often gain to the believer to suffer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The repetition of the article identifies the spirit of God with the spirit of glory."
2. "The spirit of glory, and therefore the spirit of God: who is none other than the spirit of God himself."
3. "Resteth... where the word is used in the active voice, to give rest or refreshment."

### John Calvin:
1. "To obviate this evil, Peter pronounces those blessed, according to what Christ says, (Mark 8:35,) who are reproached for the sake of the Gospel." (32 words)
2. "So, what seems to the flesh a paradox, the Spirit of God makes consistent by a sure perception in their minds." (22 words)
3. "But he sets the hidden perception of faith, which Godâ€™s children possess in their own hearts, in opposition to their presumption and insolence." (28 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase 'in the name of Christ,' which is paraphrased by both the A. V. and the R. V. as 'for the name of Christ,' is best interpreted, as is done by most, in the light of Christâ€™s own explanation in Mark 9:41, 'in my name, because ye belong to Christ.'" 
2. "The sentence, however, is understood by most to contain two titles...of the same Spirit. He is first described as the Spirit of glory, i.e to whom glory belong whose nature is glory, and whose gilt, therefore, is also glory; as God also has the titles 'the God of glory' and 'the Father of glory'." 
3. "They whom the Spirit thus visits, though the shame of the Cross in heathen eyes may be theirs, have glory already with them; for He is the Spirit whose nature glory is, and where He enters, there the earnest of all glory is."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For the name of Christ." 
2. "The Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God. "
3. "He rests upon the Christian as the Shechinah rested upon the tabernacle."

### John Gill:
1. "happy are ye; some supply it, 'shall ye be', as the Vulgate Latin version; that is, in the other world, because the kingdom of heaven, the crown of life and glory, belongs to such persons; they will be happy at death, in judgment, and to all eternity."
2. "for the Spirit of glory, and of God, resteth upon you; alluding to Isaiah 11:2 that is, the glorious Spirit of God, as the Syriac version renders it; who is glorious in himself, in the perfections of his nature, being possessed of the same glorious divine essence with the Father and Son; and in his works both of nature, being equally concerned with the other Persons in the Godhead in the works of creation and providence, and also of grace, especially the latter; and in all his gifts and graces with which he adorns the saints, and makes them glorious."
3. "on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified: on the part of the revilers, the person, office, work, and grace, the operations and influences of the Spirit are blasphemed and ridiculed; the power of the Spirit, with which the saints speak, the experiences of grace they express, the comforts of the Spirit they declare that they enjoy under suffering circumstances, as well as their courage, patience, and cheerfulness he gives them, are generally bantered by persecutors; and indeed all the reproaches they cast upon the people of God fall upon the Spirit of God, by whom they are animated and influenced."

### John Wesley:
1. "Reproaches and cruel mockings were always one part of their sufferings."
2. "The Spirit of glory, conquering all reproach and shame, and the Spirit of God, whose Son, Jesus Christ is."
3. "While they are blaspheming Christ, you glorify him in the midst of your sufferings."
