### Albert Barnes:
1. "That judgment must begin - The word 'judgment' here (Œ∫œÅŒπÃÅŒºŒ± krima) seems to mean 'the severe trial which would determine character.' It refers to such calamities as would settle the question whether there was any religion, or would test the value of that which was professed." 
2. "And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? - If God brings such trials upon us who have obeyed his gospel, what have we not reason to suppose he will bring upon those who are yet in their sins?"
3. "The punishment of the wicked is merely delayed. It begins at the house of God. Christians are tried, and are recalled from their wanderings, and are prepared by discipline for the heavenly world.

### John Calvin:
1. "For except we desire to be blotted out from the number of the faithful, we must submit our backs to the scourges of God."

3. "God so regulates his judgments in this world, that he fattens the wicked for the day of slaughter. He therefore passes by their many sins, and, as it were, connives at them. In the meantime, he restores by corrections his own children, for whom he has a care, to the right way, whenever they depart from it."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "There is no speaking of it: a curtain is drawn; silent wonder expresses it best, telling it cannot be expressed."

2. "And if it begin first at us, End of them that obey not the gospel of God." 
3. "Of those disobeying the gospel of God."

### John Gill:
1. "By judgment is meant, not punishment for sin, strictly speaking, because Christ has endured this in the room and stead of his church and people, and therefore in justice cannot be inflicted on them; but afflictions and persecutions, and which are fatherly chastisements, and different from God's judgment on the world, and condemnation with it."
2. "The first times of Christianity, or of the preaching of the Gospel, were times of trouble and distress; for as it was necessary the Gospel should be confirmed by signs and wonders, so that it should be tried and proved by the sufferings of the saints for it."
3. "What shall the end of such be? in this world wrath came upon them to the uttermost, ruin upon their nation, city, and temple; and in the world to come everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and eternal vengeance in flames of fire."

### John Wesley:
1. "The time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God...both in justice and mercy."
2. "How terribly will he visit them! The judgments which are milder at the beginning, grow more and more severe."
3. "But good men, having already sustained their part, are only spectators of the miseries of the wicked."
