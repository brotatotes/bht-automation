# 1 Peter 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the righteous, who is saved by faith in Christ, is only just saved and faces difficulty in doing so, then where shall the ungodly and sinner appear? The righteous experience trials and tribulations, but their entrance into the kingdom is abundant and certain through the righteousness of Christ and God's everlasting covenant. The ungodly and sinner, on the other hand, are in a wrong relation to the Judge and will find themselves among the damned. The salvation of the righteous, although certain, is not without its obstacles and challenges, while the fate of the ungodly is even more dreadful.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "if the righteous is (is being: or rather perhaps the present spoken of that which is to be) with difficulty saved, the ungodly and sinner, where shall he appear?"
2. "if we be righteous by faith in Christ, our salvation, however difficult and apparently impossible, is as certain as Christâ€™s own triumph"
3. "the absence of a second article, and the singular verb, both show that the same person is meant by both"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The righteous man has always more or less of trial, but the issue is certain, and the entrance into the kingdom abundant at last." 
2. "The 'scarcely' marks the severity of the ordeal, and the unlikelihood (in a mere human point of view) of the righteous sustaining it; but the righteousness of Christ and God's everlasting covenant make it all sure."
3. "The same man is at once God-forgetting and sin-loving."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word implies that there is some difficulty, or obstruction, so that the thing came very near not to happen, or so that there was much risk about it."
2. "They would indeed be saved, but it would be in such a manner as to show that the circumstances were such as to render it, to human appearances, doubtful and problematical."
3. "It is no small matter to rescue a soul from the dominion of Satan, and to bring it to heaven, so that it shall be eternally safe."

### John Calvin:
1. "The design of what he says, as I have already stated, is to shew that the children of God should not faint under the bitterness of present evils, but that they ought, on the contrary, calmly to bear their afflictions for a short time, as the issue will be salvation, while the ungodly will have to exchange a fading and fleeting prosperity for eternal perdition."
2. "But the argument is from the less to the greater; for if God spares not his own children whom he loves and who obey him, how dreadful will be his severity against enemies and such as are rebellious! There is, then, nothing better than to obey the Gospel, so that God may kindly correct us by his paternal hand for our salvation."
3. "But when he says, that a righteous man is scarcely saved, he refers to the difficulties of the present life, for our course in the world is like a dangerous sailing between many rocks, and exposed to many storms and tempests; and thus no one arrives at the port, except he who has escaped from [a] thousand deaths."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And if that is so, how shall it be with the man who, as being both careless of God and in practice a sinner, is in a wrong relation to the Judge?" 
2. "The utmost emphasis is given to the description of the person, by putting the words 'the ungodly and sinner' before the interrogative 'where.'"
3. "Interrogations like these are hard indeed to square with the idea that in Peterâ€™s view the end of the despisers of grace was to be restoration."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And if the righteous is scarcely saved... But the Christian is not saved by his own righteousness."
2. "For Î¼Î¿Î»Î¹Ï‚ see Acts 14:18 and for Î±ÏƒÎµÎ²Î·Ï‚ (ungodly, without reverence) see Romans 4:5; 2 Peter 2:5."
3. "Will appear... For the question see Mark 10:24-26."

### John Gill:
1. "And if the righteous scarcely be saved,...."
2. "...for though their salvation is certain and complete, being finished by Christ, yet their enjoyment of it is attended with many difficulties..."
3. "where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?...but at Christ's left hand, and in hell, and among the devils and damned there."

### John Wesley:
1. "If the righteous scarcely be saved â€” Escape with the utmost difficulty."
2. "Where shall the ungodly â€” The man who knows not God. And the open sinner appear - In that day of vengeance."
3. "The salvation here primarily spoken of is of a temporal nature. But we may apply the words to eternal things, and then they are still more awful."
