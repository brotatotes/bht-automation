# 1 Peter 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to no longer live their lives driven by the sinful desires of men, but rather to be guided by the will of God, which holds even greater majesty by not being emphasized alongside human desires. The reference to the rest of your time in the flesh indicates that this instruction applies to believers, whose remaining time is limited for glorifying God. Through their union with Christ, believers have been set free from the influence of worldly desires and are now called to conform wholly to the will of God. This involves renouncing the covetings of men and dedicating their lives to living according to God's will. The standard for their conduct is to be God's will alone, which remains constant amidst the ever-changing and varied lusts of men. With the limited time they have left, believers are to strive to live soberly, righteously, and godly, with a conscience that is clear of offense towards both God and men. It is through this way of life that believers truly live, as they have been made alive in Christ.
