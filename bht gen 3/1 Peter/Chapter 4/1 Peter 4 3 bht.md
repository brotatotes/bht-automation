2. "The 'abominable' of the A. V. and R. V. scarcely conveys the point of the adjective. It describes the idolatries as unlawful, outside the pale of Divine law" (Commentary).
3. "This mention of 'idolatries' as the last and worst of the things after which the 'desire of the Gentiles' ran, clearly indicates the Gentile extraction of Peter‚Äôs readers" (Commentary).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "May suffice (Œ±œÅŒ∫ŒµœÑŒøœÇ). No copula in the Greek, probably ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ (is) rather than Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±œÑŒ± (can)."

### John Wesley:
1. "Revellings, banquetings ‚Äî Have these words any meaning now? They had, seventeen hundred years ago."
2. "Then the former meant, meetings to eat; meetings, the direct end of which was, to please the taste: the latter, meetings to drink."
