# 1 Peter 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Above all, let your love for one another be intense, as it has the power to cover a multitude of sins. Love does not harshly condemn or expose faults, but bears the burdens of others, forgiving and forgetting past offenses. Through fervent love, we pray for one another, seeking to have their sins covered by God. This mutual and warm charity should think no ill and put the best construction on the words and actions of fellow Christians. Love truly covers a multitude of sins, always seeking forgiveness and restoration.

### John Calvin:
1. "And above all things He commends charity or love as the first thing, for it is the bond of perfection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The preference which is given to brotherly love is not given as if it were superior to prayer and the other virtues, or as if these were to be subordinated to the interests of that, but because without it nothing else can make the inner life of the Church what it should be." 
2. "Love works for concord, throwing a covering over sins, forgiving them, excusing them, making as little of them as possible, while the genius of hatred is the opposite."

### John Gill:
1. "This love ought to be mutual and reciprocal, and to be warm and fervent, and not lukewarm and indifferent, as it too often is."
2. "Charity, or true love, thinks no ill, but puts the best constructions upon the words and actions of fellow Christians, and does not take them up, and improve and exaggerate them, but lets them lie buried in oblivion."
3. "It takes no notice of injuries, offenses, and affronts, but overlooks them, bears with them, and forgives them, so that they are never raked up, and seen any more; which prevents much scandal, strife, and trouble."
