# 1 Peter 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hospitality goes beyond mere courtesy; it involves sincerely welcoming and providing for those in need, especially those facing persecution due to their faith. By extending hospitality, we treat them as representatives of Christ with open-hearted sincerity, free from speaking against or resenting them. This authentic expression of Christian love should be offered to all, without murmurs or complaints. It is through this kind of hospitality that we demonstrate our love for strangers, ensuring that they are uplifted rather than burdened by our acts of kindness.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Using hospitality (œÜŒπŒªŒøŒæŒµŒΩŒø). 'Friendly to strangers,' old word (from œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉ, ŒæŒµŒΩŒøœÇ), in N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 3:2; Titus 1:8." 
2. "Without murmuring (Œ±ŒΩŒµœÖ Œ≥ŒøŒ≥Œ≥œÖœÉŒºŒøœÖ). Like œáœâœÅŒπœÇ Œ≥ŒøŒ≥Œ≥œÖœÉŒºœâŒΩ in Philippians 2:14. Complaint spoils hospitality." 
3. "Hospitality made mission work possible (3 John 1:5)."

### John Gill:
1. "Be lovers of strangers... and these are to be loved: and love is to be shown them, both negatively, by not vexing them, and making them uneasy in body or mind; by not oppressing them by violence and injustice, and making any exorbitant demands upon them; or by not perverting judgment with respect to them; and positively, by directing, counselling, and advising them, and if need be, by giving them food, and raiment, and lodging." 
2. "And it is what men have been led to by the very light of nature... and is what God enjoined the Israelites by divers laws... and various are the exhortations to it in the New Testament... and is what is highly regarded and commended by Christ." 
3. "Food, raiment, and lodging, or what they want, whether direction or advice, thinking it no trouble to give them either; or without murmurings, as it may be rendered, as if they were burdensome, and they were too chargeable to them, and their stay too long; and without complaints of them, finding fault, and picking quarrels with them, and laying charges against them, in order to get rid of them."

### John Wesley:
1. One to another ‚Äî Ye that are of different towns or countries.
Without murmuring ‚Äî With all cheerfulness. Proverbs 10:12.
