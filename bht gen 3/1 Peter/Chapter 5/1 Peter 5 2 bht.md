## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The dignity is marked by the term 'elder'; the duties of the office, to tend or oversee, by 'bishop.'" 
2. "He is a true presbyter and minister of the counsel of God who doeth and teacheth the things of the Lord." 
3. "The flock is Christ's."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Feed the flock of God - Discharge the duties of a shepherd toward the flock."
2. "Go cheerfully to your duty as a work which you love, and act like a freeman in it, and not as a slave."
3. "We are to labor in this work, not under the influence of the desire of gain, but from the promptings of love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Feed [ποιμανατε]. Better, Rev., tend, since the verb denotes all that is included in the office of a shepherd - guiding, guarding, folding, no less than feeding, which latter is expressed by boskw."
2. "The word filthy is intended to convey the idea which lies in aijscrov, base or dishonorable; becoming such if it is made the motive of the minister 's service."
3. "Willingly [προθυμως]. Not strong enough. The word is compounded of pro, forward, and qumov, heart or spirit. Hence Rev., with a ready mind; a forward spirit; denoting not mere willingness, but zeal."

### John Calvin:
1. "The flock of Christ cannot be fed except with pure doctrine, which is alone our spiritual food."
2. "Pastors are not mute hypocrites, nor those who spread their own figments, which, like deadly poison, destroy the souls of men."
3. "He then shews how they were rightly to perform the pastoral office, though the word ἐπισκοπεῖν generally means to preside or to oversee."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The charge reminds us also of Paul’s counsel to the Ephesian elders (Acts 20:28). In the oldest of the classical writers the relations of ruler to people are familiarly described as the relations of shepherd to flock."
2. "The designation ‘the flock of God’ expresses both the unity of the Church and the fact that it is God’s possession, not that of the elders."
3. "This first definition describes the elder’s duty as one which is not to be taken up like an unwelcome burden imposed on one, or a task from which one cannot retreat. In such circumstances there will be, as Calvin suggests, a dull and frigid discharge of the work."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
- 1. "Tend (ποιμανατε)... Jesus used this very word to Peter in the interview by the Sea of Galilee (John 21:16) and Peter doubtless has this fact in mind here."
- 2. "Not by constraint (μη αναγκαστως)... But willingly (αλλα εκουσιως). By contrast. Old adverb, in N.T. only here and Hebrews 10:26."
- 3. "Nor yet for filthy lucre (μηδε αισχροκερδως)... But of a ready mind (αλλα προθυμως). Old adverb from προθυμος (Matthew 26:41), here only in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "Feed the flock of God...which was committed to their care...for which they should have a particular regard."
2. "Feeding includes the whole of the pastor's work...the ministry of the word, the administration of ordinances, and the rule and government of the church."
3. "They should be induced to it by no other necessity than what Christ has laid upon them...and should engage and continue in it by no other constraint than that of his love."

### John Wesley:
1. "Feed the flock — Both by doctrine and discipline."
2. "Not by constraint — Unwillingly, as a burden."
3. "Not for filthy gain — Which, if it be the motive of acting, is filthy beyond expression."
