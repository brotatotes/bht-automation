## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our crown is distinguished from theirs in that it is 'incorruptible' and 'fadeth not away,' as the leaves of theirs soon did." 
2. "'The crown of life.' Not a kingly 'crown' (a different Greek word, diadema): the prerogative of the Lord Jesus." 
3. "That fadeth not awayâ€”Greek, 'amaranthine'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Peter, in the passage above, ranks himself with the elders; here he ranks Christ himself with the pastors" - Benson.
2. "Ye shall receive a crown of glory - A glorious crown or diadem."
3. "That fadeth not away - This is essentially the same word, though somewhat different in form, which occurs in 1 Peter 1:4."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The last thing Peter could have dreamed of as possible would be its misapplication to himself or his so - called successors" (Cook).
2. "Ye shall receive."
3. "The crown of thorns woven for Jesus is called stefanov, with reference rather to its being twined than to its being a caricature of a kingly crown."

### John Calvin:
1. "Lest, then, the faithful servant of Christ should be broken down, there is for him one and only one remedy, â€” to turn his eyes to the coming of Christ."
2. "Thus it will be, that he, who seems to derive no encouragement from men, will assiduously go on in his labors, knowing that a great reward is prepared for him by the Lord."
3. "An unfading crown of glory, he says, awaits you."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The title 'Chief Shepherd' is nowhere else given to Christ. It is appropriate here, where the duties and rewards of those are dealt with who are called to act the Shepherd's part of tending Christ's flock for Him on earth."
2. "Glory itself, and nothing less than that, will crown the heads of the elders as their reward for the meek discharge of their vocation."
3. "The 'crown' is further described by an adjective which differs but slightly from the one already applied to the 'inheritance' in chap. 1 Peter 1:4. It may be translated, therefore, simply unwithering. It seems, however, rather to be formed immediately from the noun which denotes the flower known as the 'amaranth.' We should translate it, therefore, amaranthine, the figure being that of a wreath constructed of immortelles, which change neither in contour nor in colour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The crown of glory that fadeth not away."
2. "In all these passages it is the crown of victory as it is here."
3. "Composed of amaranth or amarantine, the amarantine (unfading) crown of glory."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the chief Shepherd, in the dignity of his person, he being God over all, blessed for ever; in his qualifications for his office, having all power, grace, and wisdom in him, to protect his flock, supply their wants, guide and direct them."
2. "the eternal glory and happiness, which is here meant by a crown of glory, or a glorious crown, never fades away, but ever shines in its full lustre"
3. "they will enter into the joy of their Lord, and shine as the stars for ever and ever; they shall reign with Christ, as kings, on a throne of glory, wearing a crown of glory, and enjoying a kingdom and glory to all eternity."
