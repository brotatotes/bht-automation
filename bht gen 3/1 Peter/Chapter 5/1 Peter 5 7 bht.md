# 1 Peter 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Exemption from care goes along with humble submission to God. Care is a burden which faith casts off the man on his God. The fact that God retains a loving concern for us is our reason for rolling the burden of our anxieties upon Him. Where there is the disposition to humble ourselves beneath God‚Äôs hand, there the disposition to trust Him will also appear. We ought the more to dwell on this thought, that God cares for us, in order, first, that we may have peace within; and, secondly, that we may be humble and meek towards men.
