# 1 Peter 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To stand firm against the devil, we must have a sober and self-restrained mind, being watchful for his attacks. The devil, like a roaring lion, is hungry for our destruction, continuously seeking to satisfy his insatiable appetite. However, Christ, our Advocate, has fulfilled the demands of justice on our behalf, making our redemption consistent with God's righteousness. Therefore, we should not be intoxicated by anxieties but trust in God's provision and remain watchful against the adversary's relentless pursuit of our destruction.

2. "Satan opposes man in his best interests. He resists his efforts to do good; his purposes to return to God; his attempts to secure his own salvation."

1. "Be sober; see on chap. 1 Peter 1:13, where sobriety is noticed as a condition to the highest type of Christian hope."
2. "The verb rendered ‚Äòvigilant‚Äô here, and in 1 Thessalonians 5:10 ‚Äòwake,‚Äô is elsewhere (in some twenty-one occurrences) always rendered ‚Äòwatch‚Äô by the A. V. Its use here perhaps indicates painful, personal recollection on the writer‚Äôs part."
