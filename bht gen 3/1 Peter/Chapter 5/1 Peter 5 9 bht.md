## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Withstand is, moreover, the more accurate rendering; as the verb means rather to be firm against onset than to strive against it." 
2. "Steadfast is Anglo - Saxon, stede, a place, and faest, fast; and hence means firm in its place; but stereoi conveys also the sense of compactness, compact solidity, and is appropriate, since a number of individuals are addressed and exhorted to withstand the onset of Satan as one compacted body."
3. "The same afflictions [œÑŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒ± œÑœâŒΩ œÄŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÑœâŒΩ] . Rev., better, sufferings. A very peculiar construction, occurring nowhere else in the New Testament. Lit., the same things of sufferings, emphasizing the idea of identity."

1. "Only he who is strong in the faith which makes him a Christian, is strong enough to vanquish this foe in the assaults which he makes with the engine of persecution." 
2. "Their courage in withstanding, with a firm faith, the devil‚Äôs attempts to seduce them through their sufferings, should be helped by the consideration that they occupied no singular position. They suffered only as the whole Christian brotherhood suffered."
3. "The same dispensation of tribulation was fulfilling itself in them and in the brotherhood, the same tribute of suffering was being paid by them and by the brotherhood, and for the same reason."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Steadfast in your faith (œÉœÑŒµœÅŒµŒø œÑŒ∑ œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµ)."
3. "The same sufferings (œÑŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒ± œÑœâŒΩ œÄŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÑœâŒΩ). An unusual construction with the genitive rather than the usual œÑŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒ± œÄŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±, perhaps as Hofmann suggests, "the same tax of sufferings" ("the same things in sufferings")."

### John Gill:
1. "Oppose him, and stand against his wiles, his cunning and his power."
