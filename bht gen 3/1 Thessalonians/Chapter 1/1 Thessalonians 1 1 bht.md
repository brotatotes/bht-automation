### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The address of the first Epistle is shorter than that of any of the Pauline letters."

### John Calvin:
1. "The brevity of the inscription clearly shows that Paul‚Äôs doctrine had been received with reverence among the Thessalonians, and that without controversy they all rendered to him the honor that he deserved."
2. "The ministers of Satan, it is true, had endeavored to trouble this Church also, but it is evident that their machinations were fruitless."
3. "We may... infer from it, that a Church is to be sought for only where God presides, and where Christ reigns, and that, in short, there is no Church but what is founded upon God, is gathered under the auspices of Christ, and is united in his name."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The omission of the official title Apostle can scarcely be accounted for by supposing that Paul had not yet assumed it, but is due to the affection subsisting between him and his Thessalonian converts, which did not require that he should urge his apostolic authority." 
2. "In God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. At this early period the ‚ÄòChurch‚Äô needed some such distinguishing appellation.

In indicates living union and fellowship."
3. "Grace unto you, and peace. A Christian adaptation and blending of the ordinary Greek and Hebrew salutation. Paul wishes them a participation in God‚Äôs undeserved favour, the grace that has brought salvation to men; and in that peace which the Lord bequeathed to His followers, the restored harmony with God and conscience, the equanimity and confidence of God‚Äôs children."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "They were in fellowship with God the Father, and they were drawn by the efficacy of his grace to himself and to his Son, and were gathered together and embodied in a church state under his direction and influence; he was the author of them as a church, and they were plants of Christ's heavenly Father's planting, not to be plucked up..."
3. "This is the apostle's usual salutation and wish in all his epistles to the churches; 1 Thessalonians 1:4- :..."
