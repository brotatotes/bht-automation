## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Silvanus is placed before Timothy... as being one 'chief among the brethren' and a prophet."
2. "He does not name himself an Apostle, probably because his Apostleship needed not any substantiation to the Thessalonians."
3. "'Grace and peace from God be unto you, that you who are deprived of human favour and secular peace, may have both these with God.' Anselm."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "An undesigned propriety in the Epistles, evincing genuineness."
2. "So realizing was their Christian faith, that they were able hourly to look for the Lord Jesus."
3. "Grace be unto you, and peace‚Äîthat ye may have in God that favor and peace which men withhold [ANSELM]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who are united to the true God and to the Redeemer; or who sustain an intimate relation to the Father and the Lord Jesus."
2. "This is strong language, denoting, that they were a true church."
3. "Grace be unto you."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The address of the first Epistle is shorter than that of any of the Pauline letters."
2. "Paul does not confine the name of apostle to the twelve."
3. "The phrase 'the church in God' is peculiar to the Thessalonian Epistles."

### John Calvin:
1. "The brevity of the inscription clearly shews that Paul‚Äôs doctrine had been received with reverence among the Thessalonians."
2. "He simply makes use of his own name without any title of honor, is an evidence that those to whom he writes voluntarily acknowledged him to be such as he was."
3. "A Church is to be sought for only where God presides, and where Christ reigns, and that, in short, there is no Church but what is founded upon God, is gathered under the auspices of Christ, and is united in his name."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The omission of the official title Apostle can scarcely be accounted for by supposing that Paul had not yet assumed it, but is due to the affection subsisting between him and his Thessalonian converts." 
2. "In God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. At this early period the 'Church' needed some such distinguishing appellation. The former predicate 'in God the Father,' distinguishes it from the Gentile assemblies; the latter, 'in the Lord Jesus Christ,' from the Jewish congregation. In indicates living union and fellowship."
3. "Grace unto you, and peace. A Christian adaptation and blending of the ordinary Greek and Hebrew salutation. Paul wishes them a participation in God‚Äôs undeserved favour, the grace that has brought salvation to men; and in that peace which the Lord bequeathed to His followers, the restored harmony with God and conscience, the equanimity and confidence of God‚Äôs children."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The only superscription in the oldest Greek manuscripts (Aleph B A) is Œ†œÅŒøœÇ ŒòŒµœÉœÉŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒµŒπœÇ Œë (To the Thessalonians First). But probably Paul wrote no superscription and certainly he would not write A to it before he had written II Thessalonians (B)."
2. "In the very beginning of this first Epistle of Paul we meet his Christology. He at once uses the full title, 'Lord Jesus Christ,' with all the theological content of each word."
3. "These words, common in Paul's Epistles, bear 'the stamp of Paul's experience' (Milligan). They are not commonplace salutations, but the old words 'deepened and spiritualised' (Frame)."

### John Gill:
1. "Paul was the inspired writer of it, and who is called by his bare name, without any additional epithet to it, as elsewhere in his other epistles..."
2. "...they were well known by the church, who would be glad to hear of their welfare; as also to show their continued harmony and consent in the doctrines of the Gospel..."
3. "They [the Thessalonians] were interested in his [God the Father's] love and free favour, as appears by their election of God... and they were drawn by the efficacy of his grace to himself and to his Son, and were gathered together and embodied in a church state under his direction and influence..."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is a peculiar sweetness in this epistle..." 
2. "...unmixed with any sharpness or reproof..."
3. "...those evils which the apostles afterward reproved having not yet crept into the church."
