## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We give thanks, coming so immediately after the mention of Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, can hardly be here understood of the Apostle alone..."
2. "For undoubted as it is that he often... uses the plural of himself alone, yet it is as undoubted that he uses it also of himself and his fellow-labourers..."
3. "Such a formula would naturally repeat itself, as far as specifications of this kind are concerned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The structure of the sentences in this and the following verses, each successive sentence repeating with greater fulness the preceding, characteristically marks Paul's abounding love and thankfulness in respect to his converts."
2. "As if he were seeking by words heaped on words to convey some idea of his exuberant feelings towards them."
3. "'Without ceasing,' in the second clause, answers in parallelism to 'always,' in the first."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We give thanks to God always for you all..." 
2. "Making mention of you in our prayers..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The thanksgiving is omitted only in Galatians." 
2. "The more general term, and limited to prayer to God; while dehsiv petitionary prayer, supplication, may be addressed to man." 
3. "In classical Greek the word does not occur in the sense of prayer. It is found in later Greek, meaning a place for prayer, in which sense it appears in Acts 16:13, Acts 16:16."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it is no small excitement to eagerness of pursuit, when we reflect that God has adorned us with signal endowments, that he may finish what he has begun, and that we have, under his guidance and direction, advanced in the right course, in order that we may reach the goal."
2. "For as a vain confidence in those virtues, which mankind foolishly arrogate to themselves, puffs them up with pride, and makes them careless and indolent for the time to come, so a recognition of the gifts of God humbles pious minds, and stirs them up to anxious concern."
3. "Hence, instead of congratulations, he makes use of thanksgivings, that he may put them in mind, that everything in them that he declares to be worthy of praise, is a kindness from God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Give thanks to God...It is always a pleasure to him to praise, to recognise merit, to fan the smoking flax."
2. "Always for all of you. 'Forgetting none; such is our never-failing habit' (Jowett)."
3. "We...probably refers, as in 1Th 2:18 , 1 Thessalonians 3:1, to Paul himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The plural implies that all three missionaries prayed together" (Moffatt).
2. "Moffatt takes it to mean 'whenever Paul was at his prayers.' Of course, he did not make audible prayer always, but he was always in the spirit of prayer, 'a constant attitude' (Milligan), 'in tune with the Infinite.'"
3. "Paul 'encircled (œÄŒµœÅ, around) them all,' including every one of them and the church as a whole. Distance lends enchantment to the memory of slight drawbacks. Paul is fond of this phrase 'you all,' particularly in Phil."

### John Gill:
1. "We give thanks to God always for you all... for their being a church, for the gifts bestowed on them, for the graces hereafter mentioned that were wrought in them and exercised by them."
2. "The apostle ascribes nothing to their free will, previous dispositions and qualifications, diligence and industry; nor does he attribute anything to himself and to his companions, who were only ministers by whom these believed; but he refers all to God, to his grace and goodness."
3. "And he returned thanks to him for it, and that 'always'; whenever he thought of it, made mention of it, or was at the throne of grace, as follows, making mention of you in our prayers."
