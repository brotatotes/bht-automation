## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We give thanks, coming so immediately after the mention of Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, can hardly be here understood of the Apostle alone, as it is by many Commentators."
2. "For undoubted as it is that he often, e.g. ch. iii. 1, 2, where see note, uses the plural of himself alone, yet it is as undoubted that he uses it also of himself and of his fellow-labourers."
3. "Such a formula would naturally repeat itself, as far as specifications of this kind are concerned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The structure of the sentences in this and the following verses, each successive sentence repeating with greater fulness the preceding, characteristically marks Paul's abounding love and thankfulness in respect to his converts."
2. "as if he were seeking by words heaped on words to convey some idea of his exuberant feelings towards them."

1. "We give thanks to God always for you all... Making mention of you in our prayers." 
2. "The apostle was in the habit of constant prayer."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The verb eujcaristein occurs only in later Greek, and there but rarely... The meaning to give thanks is late." 
3. "In we give thanks, it is not easy to decide whether Paul uses we as plural, or in the sense of i... Abundant illustrations of this may be seen in Romans 6:0 and 8."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it is no small excitement to eagerness of pursuit, when we reflect that God has adorned us with signal endowments, that he may finish what he has begun."
2. "As a vain confidence in those virtues, which mankind foolishly arrogate to themselves, puffs them up with pride, and makes them careless and indolent for the time to come, so a recognition of the gifts of God humbles pious minds, and stirs them up to anxious concern."
3. "He also turns immediately to the future, in making mention of his prayers. We thus see for what purpose he commends their previous life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He welcomes the tidings brought him by Timothy, and subjects him to no cynical cross examination."

### John Gill:
1. "We give thanks to God always for you all...the glory of all...is given to God." 
2. "The apostle ascribes nothing to their free will...nor does he attribute anything to himself and his companions...but he refers all to God, to his grace and goodness."
