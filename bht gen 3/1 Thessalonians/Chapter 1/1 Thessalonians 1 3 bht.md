# 1 Thessalonians 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The three great Christian graces - faith, love, and hope - are not just superficial, but sincere and active virtues. Faith is not a mere assent, but a realizing and working faith, while love is a labor that gladly bears troublesome toil. Hope is accompanied by patience, enduring trials and waiting for the unseen things. These virtues work together harmoniously, with faith maintaining our relationship with God, love maintaining our relationship with others, and hope guiding and uplifting our lives.
