# 1 Thessalonians 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For we know that your election unto life is not based on your own merits, but it is a result of God's choosing and love for you. This divine election is not a predetermined number of people chosen for salvation, but rather a selection of individual believers by God. The Thessalonians have been chosen as members of the Christian church, and their conduct is evidence of this election. Believers can come to understand and know their own election through faith and the evidence of God's work in their lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Knowing refers back to remembering, in that we knowâ€”or, for we know."
2. "The words by God belong to 'beloved,' as in 2 Thess. ii. 13, see also Rom. i. 7: not, as A.V., to 'your election,' which is an ungrammatical rendering."
3. "The word election must not be softened down: it is the election unto life of individual believers by God, so commonly adduced by St. Paul."
 

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Knowingâ€”Forasmuch as we know."
2. "Your election of Godâ€”The Greek is rather, 'beloved by God'."
3. "'Your election' means that God has elected you as individual believers to eternal life."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "A true church owes what it has to the 'election of God'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This, and the kindred words, ejklegein to choose, and ejklektov chosen or elect, are used of God's selection of men or agencies for special missions or attainments."
2. "Neither here nor elsewhere in the N. T. is there any warrant for the revolting doctrine that God has predestined a definite number of mankind to eternal life, and the rest to eternal destruction."

### John Calvin:
1. "I prefer to follow Chrysostom, who understands it of Paul and his colleagues, for it is (as it appears to me) a more ample confirmation of the foregoing statement."
2. "Paul touches upon their calling, and as there had appeared in it no common marks of Godâ€™s power, he infers from this that they had been specially called with evidences of a sure election."
3. "As, however, the secret counsel of God is a labyrinth to those who disregard his calling, so those act perversely who, under pretext of faith and calling, darken this first grace, from which faith itself flows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beloved by God...Paul is not content with the use of Î±Î´ÎµÎ»Ï†Î¿ here (often in this Epistle as 1 Thessalonians 2:1; 1 Thessalonians 2:14; 1 Thessalonians 2:17; 1 Thessalonians 3:7; 1 Thessalonians 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 4:10), but adds this affectionate phrase nowhere else in the N.T. in this form (cf. Jude 1:3) though in Sirach 45:1 and on the Rosetta Stone."
2. "Your election (Ï„Î·Î½ ÎµÎºÎ»Î¿Î³Î·Î½ Ï…Î¼Ï‰Î½). That is the election of you by God. It is an old word from ÎµÎºÎ»ÎµÎ³Î¿Î¼Î± used by Jesus of his choice of the twelve disciples (John 15:16) and by Paul of God's eternal selection (Ephesians 1:4)."
3. "The divine ÎµÎºÎ»Î¿Î³Î· was manifested in the Christian qualities of verse 1 Thessalonians 1:3 (Moffatt)."

### John Gill:
1. "This is of God, an act of God the Father, made in Christ Jesus before the world began, and which springs from his sovereign will, and is the effect of his pure love and free favour."
2. "This choice does not arise from the merits of men, or any conditions in them, or from the foresight of their faith, holiness, and good works, but from the free grace and good pleasure of God."
3. "This knowledge they had of this was not what the Thessalonians themselves had, though they might have, and doubtless had the knowledge of this grace, and which may be concluded with certainty from the effectual calling; and is a privilege which many particular believers may, and do arrive unto the knowledge of, without any extraordinary revelation made unto them."

### John Wesley:
1. Knowing your election â€” Which is through faith, by these plain proofs.
