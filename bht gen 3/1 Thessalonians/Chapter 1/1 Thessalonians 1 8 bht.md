# 1 Thessalonians 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your ready reception and faith as it were sounded forth the word of the Lord, the Gospel message, loudly and clearly, through all parts. The report being already rife, we found no occasion to speak of your faith, or in your praise. In 'sounded,' the image is that of a trumpet filling with its clear-sounding echo all the surrounding places. Your faith was so lively that it did, as it were, by its sound, arouse other nations. The Gospel, regarded either as the message proceeding from the Lord, or concerning him, had been distinctly heard and proclaimed by others.
