1. Was not in vain [Î¿Ï… ÎºÎµÎ½Î· Î³ÎµÎ³Î¿Î½ÎµÎ½] . More accurately, hath not proved vain. Kenh is empty. Mataia, also rendered vain, is fruitless.


### John Calvin:
1. "He says, therefore, that his entering in unto them had not been vain, as ambitious persons manifest much show, while they have nothing of solidity; for he employs the word vain here as contrasted with efficacious."
2. "It was therefore an evidence of a Divine work that Paul, after having been subjected to evils of various kinds and to ignominy, did, as if in a perfectly sound state, shew no hesitation in making an attempt upon a large and opulent city, with the view of subjecting the inhabitants of it to Christ."
3. "In the mean time he stood firm and undaunted, from which it appears that he was held up (521) by the hand of God; for this is what he means when he says that he was emboldened."

1. "For yourselves are my witnesses."

2. "Non inanis, sed plena virtutis." 
3. "One easily leads to the other."

### John Gill:
1. "It was not a vain show with outward pomp and splendour, as the public entrances of ambassadors into cities usually are; but with great meanness, poverty, reproach, and persecution."
2. "The message they came with, from the King of kings, was not a vain, light, empty, and trifling one; but solid and substantial, and of the greatest importance."
3. "The word did not return void and empty; but was powerful and efficacious to the conversion of many souls."

### John Wesley:
1. What was proposed, 1 Thessalonians 1:5,6, is now more largely treated of: concerning Paul and his fellowlabourers, 1 Thessalonians 2:1-12; concerning the Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 2:13-16.
