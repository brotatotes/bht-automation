2. "Behold,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúthe virtues for which they deserve praise among the good and pious! ‚Äî they killed their own prophets and at last the Son of God."
3. "They have persecuted me his servant, they wage war with God, they are detested by the whole world, they are hostile to the salvation of the Gentiles; in fine, they are destined to everlasting destruction."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Who killed both the Lord Jesus."
2. "Contrary to all men jealous that salvation should be for the world and not for themselves only."
