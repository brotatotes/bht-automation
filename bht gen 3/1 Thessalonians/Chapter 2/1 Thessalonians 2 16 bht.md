# 1 Thessalonians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, in their opposition to God and men, were bringing their sins to the prescribed point where divine wrath would come upon them. Their hindrance of the Gospel preaching to the Gentiles was the last measure added to their accumulating iniquity, making them fully ripe for vengeance. The divine wrath had reached its full extent, even to the finishing stroke. The Gentiles had hope in Christ alone, as the Jews filled up their sins, their blindness and stubbornness leading to their inevitable destruction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "To the uttermost (to the end of it, i.e. the wrath: so that it shall exhaust all its force on them)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "The 'wrath of God' may be said to have come upon a man when he abandons him, even though there may not be as yet any external expressions of his indignation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Once in LXX of filling up of sins, Genesis 14:16. Always blind and stubborn, the Jews filled up the measure of their sins by their treatment of Christ and his apostles."
2. "At all times - before Christ, in Christ's time, now - the Jews by their resistance to the divine word fill up their 'sins."

2. "In the beginning of sin and evil it seems as if men were free agents...But as the crisis of their late approaches, they are bound under a curse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was the only hope of the Gentiles, Christ alone and not the mystery-religions offered any real hope."
2. "Another example of ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø and the infinitive as in verse 1 Thessalonians 2:12. It may either be God's conceived plan to allow the Jews to go on and fill up (Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÄŒªŒ∑œÅœâœÉŒ±, note Œ±ŒΩŒ±, fill up full, old verb) or it may be the natural result from the continual (œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøœÑŒµ) sins of the Jews."
3. "But the wrath has come upon them at last."

### John Gill:
1. "Speaking or preaching the Gospel is the ordinary means of saving souls...now though the Jews disbelieved the Gospel, and despised the ministry of it...such was their envy at the Gentiles, and their hatred of them, that could they have believed it to be the means of salvation, they would have forbidden the preaching of it to them, as they now did."
2. "The Jews should do all that in them lay to hinder the entrance and spread of the Gospel among them...if a Gentile studies in the law, he is guilty of death."
