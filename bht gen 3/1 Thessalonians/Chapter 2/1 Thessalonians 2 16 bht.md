# 1 Thessalonians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exclusiveness of the Jews, arising from their strict monotheism and legal purity, caused them to hinder the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles, resulting in the filling up of their sins and the coming of divine wrath upon them. This wrath, already initiated, signifies the final judgment and the complete expression of God's indignation. The Jews, who were always blind and stubborn, sealed their fate by rejecting Christ and persecuting the apostles. Their envy towards the salvation freely offered to all fueled their ongoing hostility towards Paul and ultimately led to their own downfall.

2. "In the beginning of sin and evil it seems as if men were free agents and had the power of going on or retreating. But as the crisis of their late approaches, they are bound under a curse; and the form in which their destiny presents itself to our minds, is as though it were certain, and only a question of time now soon it is to be fulfilled" (Jowett).
3. "The result of their conduct is contrasted with their intention...the state of JudÃ¦a at any time during the last thirty years before the destruction of the city, would have been sufficient to justify the expression, 'wrath is come upon them to the uttermost'" (Jowett).

- Attempt 1 BHT: Throughout history, the Jews have been known for their strict monotheism and legal purity. However, their exclusiveness led them to hinder the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles, thereby filling up the measure of their sins and bringing about divine wrath upon themselves. This wrath, which has already begun, signifies the final judgment and the uttermost expression of God's indignation. Although the Jews were always blind and stubborn, their rejection of Christ and persecution of the apostles ultimately solidified their hopeless state and sealed their fate. Their hostility towards Paul and the Gentiles stems from their envy, as they realize that salvation is offered freely to all, regardless of their Jewish heritage. This attitude of hate, demonstrated repeatedly by the Jews, would ultimately result in their own destruction.
