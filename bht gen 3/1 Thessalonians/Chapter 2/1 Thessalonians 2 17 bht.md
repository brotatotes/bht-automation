# 1 Thessalonians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Separated from you but for a short time, our longing to be with you again was all the more intense. The pain of separation and the desire to return to you were vivid in our hearts. It was as if we had become like bereaved parents, severed from their children. Our temporary absence only served to intensify our love and zeal for you; our hearts were still with you, even though we were physically apart. We longed to be reunited with you, and our affection for you grew even stronger during our separation.
