# 1 Thessalonians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul desired to visit the Thessalonians, but Satan hindered him, possibly through opposition from wicked men or a direct attack. While this does not prove the existence of a personal devil, it does show that Satan can use various means to oppose the Church. We should recognize that hindrances in doing good may be the work of Satan, who continually seeks to hinder the preaching of the Gospel and the edification of the Church. Yet, we can trust that Satan cannot ultimately hinder God's will.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Satan hindered usâ€”On a different occasion 'the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Jesus' (so the oldest manuscripts read), Acts 16:6; Acts 16:7, forbad or hindered them in a missionary design; here it is Satan, acting perhaps by wicked men, some of whom had already driven him out of Thessalonica (Acts 17:13; Acts 17:14; compare John 13:27), or else by some more direct 'messenger of Satanâ€”a thorn in the flesh'. In any event, the Holy Ghost and the providence of God overruled Satan's opposition to further His own purpose." 
2. "We cannot, in each case, define whence hindrances in good undertakings arise; Paul in this case, by inspiration, was enabled to say; the hindrance was from Satan."
3. "The Greek for 'hindered' is literally, 'to cut a trench between one's self and an advancing foe, to prevent his progress'; so Satan opposing the progress of the missionaries."

2. "Satan appears as the personal spirit of evil - the same who is called the devil, the wicked one, the prince of the power of the air, the prince of this world, the serpent, the God of this world, the tempter."
3. "It is clear that Paul here as elsewhere employs the word in a personal sense; but any attempt to base the doctrine of a personal devil on this and similar passages is unsafe."

### John Calvin:
1. "For, whenever the wicked molest us, they fight under Satanâ€™s banner, and are his instruments for harassing us."
2. "When our endeavors are directed to the work of the Lord, it is certain that everything that hinders proceeds from Satan."

2. "Indeed he can do nothing but by divine permission, nor can he hinder the will of God, and the execution of that, though he often hinders the will of man, or man from doing his will."
3. "he hindered the apostle from doing what he willed and purposed, but he did not hinder the will of God, which was that Paul should be employed in other work elsewhere."
