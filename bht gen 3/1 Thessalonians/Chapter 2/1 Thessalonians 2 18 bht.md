2. "In the obstacles, therefore, to the performance of our duty, and in the hindrances of our enjoyment, it is not improper to trace the hand of the great enemy of good."
3. "The hindrances which we meet with in our efforts to do good, when the providence of God seems to favor us, and his word and Spirit seem to call us to a particular duty, often look very much like the work of Satan."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From the more general conception of an adversary, there is, in the O. T., a gradual development toward that of an evil personality." 
2. "Satan appears as the personal spirit of evil - the same who is called the devil, the wicked one, the prince of the power of the air, the prince of this world, the serpent, the God of this world, the tempter."

3. "How Satan did so, whether by stirring up the Jews in Thessalonica so that Paul dared not return, or by causing troubles which required Paulâ€™s presence elsewhere, or by the infliction of sickness, we do not know.
