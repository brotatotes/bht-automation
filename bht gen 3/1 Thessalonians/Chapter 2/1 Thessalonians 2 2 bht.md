# 1 Thessalonians 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite facing conflicts and suffering before, we were bold in our God to speak the Gospel of God with much contention. This boldness stemmed from our confidence and trust in God as our God. The insults and mistreatment we endured in Philippi did not silence us, but rather fueled our determination and courage. It was not fanaticism, but a firm reliance on God that empowered us to continue preaching fearlessly in Thessalonica. Our sufferings and endurance served as proof that our cause was just and worth fighting for, and that the message we proclaimed came directly from God himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our God, because all true confidence is in God as our God."
2. "This word reproduces the feeling with which Paul and Silas opened their ministry among them."
3. "in (amidst) much conflict, viz. under outward circumstances conflicting much with our work: and therefore that work could be no empty thing, which was thus maintained."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The shame of the treatment consisted in the fact that it was wholly undeserved; that it was contrary to the laws; and that it was accompanied with circumstances designed to make their punishment as ignominious as possible."
2. "It is not wrong to call things by their right names, and when we have been abused, it is not necessary that we should attempt to smooth the matter over by saying that it was not so."
3. "Paul evidently appeals to this in order to show them that they were not impostors, and that they were not influenced by the hope of ease or of selfish gains."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "More than the bodily suffering it was the personal indignity that had been offered to him as a Roman citizen" (Milligan), for which account see Acts 16:16-40, an interesting example of how Acts and the Epistles throw light on each other.
2. The insult in Philippi did not close Paul's mouth, but had precisely the opposite effect "in our God." It was not wild fanaticism, but determined courage and confidence in God that spurred Paul to still greater boldness in Thessalonica.
3. This figure of the athletic games (Œ±Œ≥œâŒΩ) may refer to outward conflict like Philippians 1:30 or inward anxiety (Colossians 2:1). He had both in Thessalonica.

### John Gill:
1. "But even after that we had suffered before,.... Before they came to Thessalonica, which they would not have done, had their ministry been a light and empty one in itself, and unprofitable to others; and especially had this been the case, they would never have rashly engaged in it again, and exposed themselves to fresh sufferings and dangers, as they did..." 
2. "we were bold in our God to speak unto you the Gospel of God with much contention: and which still made it more manifestly appear, that the errand they came upon was a matter of importance, and that they did not proceed on a slight foundation..."
3. "The Syriac version renders it the 'Gospel of Christ'; see Romans 1:16 and it being so, they 'were bold to speak it'; or they spoke it both with liberty of mind, the Spirit of God being with them, and with freedom of speech, a door of utterance being opened for them..."

### John Wesley:
1. We had suffered ‚Äî In several places.
We are bold ‚Äî Notwithstanding.
With much contention ‚Äî Notwithstanding both inward and outward conflicts of all kinds.
