## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The glory which they sought was not at all to come out of human sources." 
2. "The words are separated from the mention of covetousness by the new idea beginning at ver. 6, to which, and not to the former clause, this is subordinated."
3. "They are equivalent to, when we might have stood on our dignity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Many teach heretical novelties, though not for fain, yet for 'glory.' Paul and his associates were free even from this motive." 
2. "Translate, 'when we might have borne heavily upon you,' by pressing you with the weight of self-glorifying authority, and with the burden of our sustenance." 
3. "ALFORD'S translation, which excludes reference to his right of claiming maintenance ('when we might have stood on our dignity'), seems to me disproved by 1 Thessalonians 2:9, which uses the same Greek word unequivocally for 'chargeable'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The love of applause was not that which influenced them."
2. "Though they had uncommon advantages, as the apostles of Christ, for setting up a dominion or securing an ascendancy over others, yet they had not availed themselves of it."

2. "From this it appears how far removed he was from haughtiness."
3. "He had refrained from all show of dignity, as though he had been some minister of the common rank."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nor of men sought we glory."
2. "We might have stood upon the dignity of our office."
3. "He might have allowed respect to be shown him in the form of providing for his daily wants; but he did not seek such or any glory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Upon the repudiation of covetousness follows naturally the repudiation of worldly ambition."
2. "He widens the negation to include those outside of the church circles."
3. "They were entitled to pay as 'Christ's apostles,' though they had not asked for it."

### John Gill:
