## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression our own lives... shews beyond doubt that he is including here Silas and Timothy with himself."
2. "The comparison is exceedingly tender and beautiful: as the nursing-mother, cherishing her children, joys to give not only her milk, but her life, for them,â€”so we, bringing up you as spiritual children, delighted in giving, not only the milk of the word but even (and here it was matter of fact) our own lives, for your nourishment in Christ."
3. "And that, because ye became very dear unto us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As a nursing mother is ready to impart not only her milk to them, but her life for them, so we not only imparted gladly the spiritual milk of the word to you, but risked our own lives for your spiritual nourishment." 
2. "Imitating Him who laid down His life for His friends, the greatest proof of love."
3. "Ye were become, as having become our spiritual children, dear, dearly beloved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense here is, that Paul was so strongly attached to them that he would have been willing to lay down his life for them."
2. "We show strong interest for one who is in danger, when we tell him of a way of escape, or for one who is sick, when we tell him of a medicine that will restore him; but we manifest a much higher love when we tell a lost and ruined sinner of the way in which he may be saved."
3. "His object seems to be to assure them that he did not leave them from any want of love to them, or from the fear of being put to death. It was done from the strong conviction of duty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The figure of the nursing mother is continued. She is not satisfied with nursing the child, but interests herself affectionately in all that concerns it."
2. "We were pleased. Imperfect tense: we continued to entertain and manifest our affectionate solicitude."
3. "Better lives."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "So genuine and cordial was the love of Paul and his companions for the Thessalonians, that they did not merely deliver their message as officials seeking to discharge a responsibility laid upon them, but they were willing to sacrifice their lives for them." 
2. "This willingness manifested itself in the self-denying and excessive toil of which Paul proceeds to speak."
3. "They were willing to sacrifice their lives for them, if need were."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We were well pleased (Î·Ï…Î´Î¿ÎºÎ¿Ï…Î¼ÎµÎ½). Imperfect active of ÎµÏ…Î´Î¿ÎºÎµÏ‰, common verb in later Greek and in N.T., picturing Paul's idea of their attitude while in Thessalonica." 
2. "Paul often has it with the infinitive as here."
3. "Paul and his associates held nothing back."

### John Gill:
1. "Not of theirs but them; not of glory from them, nor a maintenance by them, but of their spiritual and eternal welfare."
2. "To have imparted unto you, not the Gospel of God only; the sincere milk of the word, which they did freely, fully, and for their spiritual good and profit, without any regard to any advantage of their own."
3. "Because ye were dear unto us; both because they were loved by God, redeemed by Christ, regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, and had the image of Christ stamped upon them."

### John Wesley:
1. To impart our own souls â€” To lay down our lives for your sake.
