## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression our own lives, as remarked above, shews beyond doubt that he is including here Silas and Timothy with himself."

"As a nursing mother is ready to impart not only her milk to them, but her life for them, so we not only imparted gladly the spiritual milk of the word to you, but risked our own lives for your spiritual nourishment, imitating Him who laid down His life for His friends, the greatest proof of love."
2. "The Greek implies, literally, to connect one's self with another to be closely attached to another."
