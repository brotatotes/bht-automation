2. "Himself then is in contrast with ourselves, who have once and again tried to come to you, but have been hindered by Satan."

3. "Journey is not to be taken without the will of God, without seeking to know it, without submission to it, and dependence on it; nor is there any prosperous one, but by it."

### John Wesley:
1. Direct our way ‚Äî This prayer is addressed to Christ, as well as to the Father.
