## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the Lord may refer either to the Father, or to Christ. I should rather understand it of the Father" 
2. "make you to increase: enlarge you—not merely in numbers, but in richness of gifts and largeness of faith and knowledge—fill up your defects"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The Greek for 'increase' has a more positive force, that for 'abound' a more comparative force, 'make you full and even abound.'"
3. "The Lord may here be the Holy Spirit...so the Holy Ghost is called 'the Lord.' 'Love' is the fruit of the Spirit, and His office is 'to stablish in holiness.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'Lord' here probably refers to the Lord Jesus, as this is the name by which he is commonly designated in the New Testament." 
2. "If this be so, then this is a petition to the Lord Jesus as the fountain of all grace and goodness." 
3. "The Lord make you to increase and abound in love."

### John Calvin:
1. "And from this again we learn in what the perfection of the Christian life consists — in love and pure holiness of heart, flowing from faith."
2. "He prays that the love of the Thessalonians may be perfected by God, intimating that its increase, no less than its commencement, was from God alone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Lord (ο Κυριος). The Lord Jesus. Paul prays to Christ."
2. "Make you to increase (υμας πλεονασα). First aorist active optative (wish for future) of πλεοναζω, late verb from πλεον (more), to superabound."
3. "And abound (περισσευσα). First aorist active optative (wish for future) of περισσευω from περισσος, old verb, to be over (common in N.T.). It is hard to see much difference between the two verbs."

### John Gill:
1. "The request is, that he would cause these saints to increase in number, as the first churches greatly did: and in the gifts of the Spirit, which he divides to men severally as he will; and in his graces, as in faith, in hope, in holiness, in humility, in knowledge, in spiritual joy and strength, an increase in all which is from him."
2. "For though they were taught of God to love one another, and did do so, and the apostle had had good tidings of their love; yet it was not perfect, there was room for a further exercise of it."
3. "And yet they were to love them as men, and pray for them, and do them all the good that lay in their power."
