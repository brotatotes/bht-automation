3. "Paul, accordingly, means that they ought to be fortified by his example, so as not to give way under their afflictions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression 'fellow-labourer with God' is supported by 1 Corinthians 3:9."
2. "Paul bestows these commendatory titles on Timothy partly from his affection for his young assistant, partly to illustrate still further his love for the Thessalonians."
3. "Timothy was sent in the interest of their faith, to explain to them that the troubles in which they were involved were no proof that their faith was foolish, and to encourage them to maintain it."

### John Gill:
1. "One that laboured in the word and doctrine, that studied to show himself a workman, that gave himself wholly to meditation, reading, exhortation, and doctrine, and preached the word in season and out of season." 
2. "The doctrines of the Gospel are calculated for that purpose, and the ministers of it should be Barnabases, sons of consolation."
3. "These saints might be in some doubt about the grace of faith, whether it was right or not, or about the doctrine of faith they had received; and therefore Timothy is sent to comfort them under their afflictions, which might have created these doubts, and to remove them, by showing them that their faith was like precious faith with the apostles."
