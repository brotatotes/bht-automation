# 1 Thessalonians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one should be disquieted or shaken by afflictions, for we Christians know that a true religion from God would present such trying prospects. In the midst of calamities, we are often tempted and allured by flattering hopes of a more pleasant life to abandon our duty, but we must have strong faith to overcome these temptations. Tribulations are appointed for us and we must resist being moved by them. These afflictions are not new or unusual, but rather the condition that God has assigned to us as Christians.
