# 1 Thessalonians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because I know that tribulation has begun among you, I am anxiously awaiting news of your faith. I fear that the tempter, who never ceases to lay snares for us, may have tempted you and caused our labor to be in vain. Therefore, I sent Timothy to you, in order to know the state of your faith, whether it is standing firm or if it has been shaken by these afflictions. Let us be on our guard and watchful against the wiles of the enemy, lest he gain an advantage over us.
