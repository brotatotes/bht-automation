3. "The Thessalonians were walking as Paul had directed them; but he knew the tendency there is to be content with a half-completed course, to allow some sin to remain because much has been cast out, to weary before the whole work is accomplished, and therefore be is bent upon having them 'abound yet more.'"

3. "Be more and more in the exercise of every grace, and in the discharge of every duty, making advances in holiness of life, and perfecting it in the fear of God."

### John Wesley:
1. More and more ‚Äî It is not enough to have faith, even so as to please God, unless we abound more and more therein.
