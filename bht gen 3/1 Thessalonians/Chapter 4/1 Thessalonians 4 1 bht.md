## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Furthermore has no reference to time, ... and implying the close of the Epistle."
2. "we exhort you in ... the Lord Jesus, that as ye received ... how ye ought to walk and to please God ... even as also ye are walking."
3. "that ye abound yet more (viz. in thus walking)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Furthermore‚ÄîGreek, 'As to what remains.' Generally used towards the close of his Epistles (Ephesians 6:10; Philippians 4:8)."
2. "beseech‚Äî'ask' as if it were a personal favor."
3. "walk and . . . please God‚Äîthat is, 'and so please God,' namely, by your walk; in contrast to the Jews who 'please not God' (1 Thessalonians 2:15)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase is a formula appropriate to the end of an argument or discourse."
2. "Kind exhortation usually accomplishes more than a command."
3. "[They should] follow the directions which they had received more and more fully."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Furthermore [ŒªŒøŒπœÄŒøŒΩ]."
2. "Rev. not so well, finally."
3. "The formula is often used by Paul where he attaches, in a somewhat loose way."

### John Calvin:
1. "As, says he, ye have been taught. Lest, however, he should seem to take away from them what he had previously assigned them, he does not simply exhort them to walk in such a manner, but to abound more and more."
2. "The sum is this, that they should be more especially careful to make progress in the doctrine which they had received, and this Paul places in contrast with frivolous and vain pursuits."
3. "Now, there is a law that is here enjoined upon us ‚Äî that, forgetting the things that are behind, we always aim at farther progress, and pastors ought also to make this their endeavor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Only as the organ of the Lord does Paul presume to exhort them."
2. "Many persons, like the son in the parable, seem to think that their knowledge of duty, and recognition of it in conscience, is some sort of compensation for their non-performance of it."
3. "He knew the tendency there is to be content with a half-completed course, to allow some sin to remain because much has been cast out, to weary before the whole work is accomplished."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Finally (ŒªŒøŒπœÄŒøŒΩ)... It does not mean actual conclusion, but merely a colloquial expression pointing towards the end."
2. "We beseech (ŒµœÅœâœÑœâŒºŒµŒΩ). Not 'question' as in ancient Greek, but as often in N.T. ... to make urgent request of one."
3. "That ye abound (ŒπŒΩŒ± œÄŒµœÅŒπœÉœÉŒµœÖŒ∑œÑŒµ). Loose construction of the ŒπŒΩŒ± clause with present subjunctive after two subordinate clauses with Œ∫Œ±Œ∏œâœÇ (as, even as) to be connected with 'beseech and exhort.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle does not lay his commands upon them as he might have done, and sometimes does, but endeavors to work upon them by way of entreaty, and which he doubtless thought the most effectual method to win upon them, and gain them."
2. "The walk of believers is twofold, either internal or external. Their internal walk is by faith, which is the going out of the soul by faith to Christ for every supply of grace. Their external walk is not as it was before conversion, according to the course of this world, or as other Gentiles walk, but in a holy religious life and conversation."
3. "Now when the apostle, and those that were with him, were at Thessalonica, they gave these saints directions and instructions about their walk and conversation, to order it in such a manner as might 'please God'; which is not to be understood of rendering their persons acceptable to God hereby, for the saints' acceptance with God is only in Christ the beloved; but of doing those things, and in such a way God approves of."

### John Wesley:
1. More and more ‚Äî It is not enough to have faith, even so as to please God, unless we abound more and more therein.
