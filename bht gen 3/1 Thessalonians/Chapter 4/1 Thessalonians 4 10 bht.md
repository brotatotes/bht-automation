# 1 Thessalonians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Thessalonians were commended for their love towards one another, but they were encouraged to increase their efforts even more. It seems that there was a lack of harmony and diligence among them, which prompted this exhortation. While one party zealously ministered to the needy, the others neglected their own duties. The apostle praises their love but urges them to strive for improvement. This could be achieved by not only administering to others in practical and spiritual ways but also by bearing one another's burdens, forgiving, admonishing, and building each other up.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There does not seem any reason, with Jowett, to ascribe the want of quietness, here implied, to their uneasiness about the state of the dead: much rather [as he also states: see below] to their mistaken anticipations of the immediate coming of the Lord." 
2. "It would seem as if, notwithstanding their liberality to those without, there were some defect of diligence and harmony within which prompted this exhortation."
3. "For the state of things was, that one party zealously ministered charity to the needy, and that the latter on account of this zealous ministration neglected their own duties: he naturally therefore praised the one and gave fitting advice to the others."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 10. And indeedâ€”Greek,
	"For even."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "And indeed ye do it... But we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more..." 
2. "Here, as elsewhere, the apostle makes the fact that they deserved commendation for what they had done, a stimulus to arouse them to still higher attainments." 
3. "Bloomfield."

### John Calvin:
1. "And, unquestionably, whatever appears in us in a high state of excellence, we must still desire that it may become better."
2. "For after having admonished them to increase in love, he recommends to them a sacred emulation, that they may strive among themselves in mutual affection, or at least he enjoins that each one strive to conquer himself."
3. "This is the best emulation, when each one strives to overcome himself in doing good."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For indeed ye do it. Proof of the preceding clause."
2. "All the brethren who are in all Macedonia."
3. "'Which implies a lively intercourse with the Christians in Philippi, BerÅ“a, and perhaps at small scattered stations, offshoots from the central churches.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Ye do it (Ï€Î¿Î¹ÎµÎ¹Ï„Îµ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿). The Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿ refers to Ï„Î¿ Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î±Î¹Î½ Î±Î»Î»Î·Î»Î¿Ï…Ï‚ (to love one another). Delicate praise. 


### John Gill:
1. "They exercised this grace of love without respect of persons, to all, and not only to all the brethren in the particular community at Thessalonica, but which are in all Macedonia." 
2. "That ye increase more and more in showing love to the brethren; which may be done both by administering to them in things temporal, by assisting them in distress, by sympathizing with them, and by giving them counsel and advice; and in things spiritual, by bearing their burdens, forbearing with them, and forgiving them; by admonishing them in love, by stirring them up to love and good works, by praying with them and for them, and by instructing and building them up in their most holy faith."
3. "This shows that though brotherly love was much practiced by these saints, yet it was not perfect; nor is any grace perfect as to degrees; nor is any saint perfect in the discharge of duty in this life."
