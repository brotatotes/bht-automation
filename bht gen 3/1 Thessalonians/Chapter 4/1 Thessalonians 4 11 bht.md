# 1 Thessalonians 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Christian life, our ambition should be to live a quiet, industrious, and holy existence, focusing on our own work and avoiding idleness and interference in others' affairs. The Thessalonian believers were urged to work diligently with their own hands, emphasizing the significance of honest and dedicated labor. Our ambition should differ from the world's pursuit of attention and busyness; rather, it should be centered on doing good and cultivating a peaceful lifestyle. While waiting for the Lord's return, we must not neglect our daily responsibilities but instead find fulfillment in our diligent and devoted service.

1. "Study [Ï†Î¹Î»Î¿Ï„Î¹Î¼ÎµÎ¹ÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹]. P o. Make it your aim. Comp. Romans 14:20 (see note); 2 Corinthians 5:9. Often in Class. Lit. to be fond of honor: hence to strive for honor, to be ambitious." 
2. "To be quiet [Î·ÏƒÏ…Ï‡Î±Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½]. Note the paradox, strive to be quiet. For similar instances see Romans 1:20, unseen things clearly seen: Romans 1:22, wise, be fooled: 2 Corinthians 8:2, poverty abounded unto riches: 2 Corinthians 7:10, repentance, not to be repented of."

3. "For nothing is more unseemly than a man that is idle and good for nothing, who profits neither himself nor others, and seems born only to eat and drink."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Make it your ambition to be quiet."
2. "Let your ambition lead you not to a flighty, excited, bustling, indolent life, assuming to be superior to, but in reality dependent on, the labour of other men, but to a tranquil, steady, unostentatious engagement in your own ordinary occupations."
3. "Work with your own hands."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The notion of ambition appears in each of the three N.T. examples (1 Thessalonians 4:11; 2 Corinthians 5:9; Romans 5:20), but it is ambition to do good, not evil."
2. "A preacher devoid of ambition lacks power."
