# 1 Thessalonians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Thessalonians were grieving with no hope, which was based on the pagan view that denied the resurrection. However, Christians have a different hope - the hope of the resurrection. The glory and chief hope of the Church are not realized at death but at the Lord's coming. Christians are to avoid excessive grief and sorrow with no hope, as the Christian hope involves the resurrection and being reunited with the Lord. The knowledge of the resurrection of the body gives believers a clear and steadfast hope of immortality and a future life.
