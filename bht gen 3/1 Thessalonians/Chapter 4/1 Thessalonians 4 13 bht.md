# 1 Thessalonians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul advises the Thessalonians against mourning excessively without hope, as pagans do, viewing death as a permanent separation from loved ones. He reminds them that the hope of the Church is not fulfilled at death, but rather at the coming of Jesus when all believers will be glorified together. Unlike the uncertain and vacillating notions of a future life in pagan beliefs, the Christian hope of resurrection assures the Thessalonians of being reunited with their departed brethren and having fellowship with the Lord.

### Henry Alford:
1. "that ye may not sorrow...He forbids mourning altogether."
2. "It was mourning for them: not mourning for our loss in their absence, but for theirs, and in so far, for ours also."
3. "This shews of what kind their mourning was: viz. a grief whose ground was unbelief in a resurrection: which regarded the dead as altogether cut off from Christâ€™s heavenly kingdom."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The glory and chief hope of the Church are not to be realized at death, but at the Lord's coming; one is not to anticipate the other, but all are to be glorified together at Christ's coming."
2. "Death affects the mere individual; but the coming of Jesus the whole Church; at death our souls are invisibly and individually with the Lord; at Christ's coming the whole Church, with all its members, in body and soul, shall be visibly and collectively with Him."
3. "Not all natural mourning for dead friends is forbidden: for the Lord Jesus and Paul sinlessly gave way to it; but sorrow as though there were 'no hope,' which indeed the heathen had not: the Christian hope here meant is that of the resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I would not have you to be ignorant [Î¿Ï… Î¸ÎµÎ»Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½ Ï…Î¼Î±Ï‚ Î±Î³Î½Î¿ÎµÎ¹Î½]. A formula often used by Paul to call special attention to what he is about to say."
2. "The Thessalonians were plainly distressed at the thought of separation from their departed brethren, and had partially lost sight of the elements of the Christian hope - reunion with them and fellowship with the Lord."
3. "Only believers have hope of life after death. The speculations and surmisings of pagan philosophy do not amount to a hope."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the sum of the whole is this â€” that we must not bewail the dead beyond due bounds, inasmuch as we are all to be raised up again." 
2. "He forbids them to grieve in the manner of unbelievers, who give loose reins to their grief, because they look upon death as final destruction."
3. "Let, therefore, the grief of the pious be mixed with consolation, which may train them to patience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Death is called sleep by Pagan as well as by Christian writers, and it is therefore probable that the euphemism was first suggested by the stillness and repose, and cessation of intercourse with outward things, which characterize both conditions."
2. "No sleep lasts for ever, else it is not sleep; a waking follows every sleep. And so death is called a sleep, to remind us that it is not a final cessation of life, even in the case of the body, but only a transitory state out of which body and soul shall together arise."
3. "Here and there an individual among the heathen speaks of death as the 'interruption, not the extinction of life,' or is driven by the death of a noble friend to hope for a life beyond, but at the best that future life is shadowy, colourless, cold, and unattractive. The fact is, that without the knowledge of the resurrection of the body, the hope of immortality and the notions of a future life must be dim, perplexed, and vacillating."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No advantage in ignorance of itself."
2. "Present tense gives idea of repetition, from time to time fall asleep."
3. "This picture of the hopelessness of the pagan world about the future life is amply illustrated in ancient writings and particularly by inscriptions on tombs."

### John Gill:
1. "It was in common use among the Eastern nations, when they spoke of their dead, to say they were asleep."
2. "The apostle's view is not to encourage and establish a stoical apathy, a stupid indolence, and a brutal insensibility, which are contrary to the make of human nature, to the practice of the saints, and even of Christ and his apostles, and our apostle himself; but to forbid excessive and immoderate sorrow."
3. "They are called Î¿Î¹ Î»Î¿Î¹Ï€Î¿Î¹, 'the rest'; and the Syriac version renders it, 'other men'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Herein the efficacy of Christianity greatly appears."
2. "It neither takes away nor embitters."
3. "It sweetly tempers, that most refined of all affections, our desire of or love to the dead."
