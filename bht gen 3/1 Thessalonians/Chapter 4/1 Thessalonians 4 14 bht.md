# 1 Thessalonians 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The term 'sleep' is used to describe the state of believers who have departed, indicating that they are resting until the day of resurrection. Just as Christ rose again, believers will be raised through Him when He returns. The souls of the departed are not mentioned, but rather it is emphasized that God will bring the believers with Jesus at His coming. Jesus is the agent of resurrection, connecting those who have fallen asleep with their future resurrection. The belief in the resurrection of Christ assures the resurrection of His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle here, as always, uses the direct term 'died' in reference to our Lord, to obviate all possible misconception: in reference to the faithful he appropriately uses the consolatory term 'sleep.'" 
2. "In this they resemble: but in the expressed particulars here, they differ. Christ‚Äôs was simply 'rose again:' theirs shall be a resurrection through Him, at His coming."
3. "Of their disembodied souls there is here no mention: nor is the meaning, as often understood, that God will bring them (their disembodied souls, to be joined to their raised bodies) with Him: but the bringing them with Jesus, i.e. their being raised when Jesus appears."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Believers are laid in sleep by Jesus, and so will be brought back from sleep with Jesus in His train when He comes."
2. "The facts of Christ's experience are repeated in the believer's. He died and then rose: so believers shall die and then rise with Him."
3. "The same Hand that shall raise them is that which laid them to sleep."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine of the resurrection of the saints so certainly follows from that of the resurrection of Christ, that, if the one is believed, the other ought to be also."
2. "They sleep in Jesus, and are bless‚Äôd, How kind their slumbers are; From sufferings and from sin released, And freed from every snare."
3. "As the head was raised, so will all the members be. As God brought Christ from the grave, so will he bring them; that is, his resurrection made it certain that they would rise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Them also that are fallen asleep will God through Jesus bring with him." 
2. "Dia tou Ihsou can by no possibility be rendered in Jesus, which would be ejn Ihsou: see 1 Corinthians 14:18; 1 Thessalonians 4:16. It must mean through or by means of Jesus."
3. "Jesus is thus represented as the agent of the resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if we believe. He assumes this axiom of our faith, that Christ was raised up from the dead, that we might be partakers of the same resurrection: from this he infers, that we shall live with him eternally."
2. "To sleep in Christ, is to retain in death the connection that we have with Christ, for those that are by faith ingrafted into Christ, have death in common with him, that they may be partakers with him of life."
3. "For he did not design to terrify the wicked, but to correct the immoderate grief of the pious, and to cure it, as he does, by the medicine of consolation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The argument is more fully drawn out in 1 Corinthians 15:0, in which passage, as here, Paul proceeds upon the fact of Christ‚Äôs resurrection, and from it infers the certainty of that of His people."
2. "In this argument is involved the important principle that Jesus Christ is the Head and Representative of His people, in such a sense that in His human history we see the history and experience of each Christian acted out in all its essential parts."
3. "He does so because between the death of Christ and that of His people there was an essential difference; the one being an endurance of the curse, the other being exempt from this sting. Christ ‚Äòtasted death for every man‚Äô and by the infallible chemistry of His love drew out of each man‚Äôs cup the poison, so that it became a sleeping draught."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For if we believe (Œµ Œ≥Œ±œÅ œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœÖŒøŒºŒµŒΩ). Condition of first class, assuming the death and resurrection of Jesus to be true."
2. "In Jesus (Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖ). Literally, through or by means of Jesus."
3. "Jesus is the connecting link (Œ¥ŒπŒ±) for those that sleep (Œ∫ŒøŒπŒºŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ first aorist passive, but with middle sense) and their resurrection."

### John Gill:
1. "nothing is more certain or more comfortable, and more firmly to be believed, than that Christ died for the sins of his people, and rose again for their justification"
2. "To represent death as a sleep makes it very easy and familiar; but it is more so, when it is considered as sleeping in Jesus, in the arms of Jesus; and such as are asleep in him must needs be at rest, and in safety"
3. "the bodies of the saints will be raised at the last day: so that there may be the strongest assurance, that such will God bring with him"

### John Wesley:
1. So ‚Äî As God raised him.
With him ‚Äî With their living head.
