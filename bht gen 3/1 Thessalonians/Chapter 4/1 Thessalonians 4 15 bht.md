# 1 Thessalonians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hope of the Thessalonians, and all believers, rests not on mere conjecture, but on the sure foundation of the word of the Lord. Through Christ Himself, we have learned that the living shall not precede the dead in Christ at His glorious coming. Each generation, represented by the plural we, bears witness to this blessed hope, anticipating the resurrection of the saints and the joy of being caught up together to meet the Lord. Let us therefore eagerly await His return, not fearing death, but eagerly longing for the coming of our Lord.
