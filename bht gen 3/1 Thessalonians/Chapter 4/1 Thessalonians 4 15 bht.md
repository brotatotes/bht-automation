# 1 Thessalonians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through a direct revelation from the Lord, Paul confirms that both he and the Thessalonians expected to be alive at the Lord's coming. The early Christians did not perceive their departed brethren as preceding them in entering glory, but needed assurance that the living believers would not precede those who have fallen asleep. The Spirit intended believers in every age to live in continued expectation of the Lord's coming and strive not to prioritize death over the return of our Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Confirmation of last verse by direct revelation from the Lord. this‚Äîthis which follows: taken up by that. in (virtue of: an assertion made within the sphere and element of that certainty, which the word of the Lord gives) the word of the Lord,‚Äîi. e. by direct revelation from Him made te me." 
2. "Then beyond question, he himself expected to be alive, together with the majority of those to whom he was writing, at the Lord‚Äôs coming." 
3. "At the same time it must be borne in mind, that this inclusion of himself and his hearers among the 'living and remaining behind' does not in any way enter into the fact revealed and here announced, which is respecting that class of persons only as they are, and must be, one portion of the faithful at the Lord‚Äôs coming."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So far were the early Christians from regarding their departed brethren as anticipating them in entering glory, that they needed to be assured that those who remain to the coming of the Lord 'will not anticipate them that are asleep." 
2. "The Spirit designed that believers in each successive age should live in continued expectation of the Lord's coming, not knowing but that they should be among those found alive at His coming."
3. "It is a sad fall from this blessed hope, that death is looked for by most men, rather than the coming of our Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul means that the Lord Jesus had made a special communication to him on the subject."
2. "From this expression, it would seem, that some of the Thessalonians supposed that Paul meant to teach that he himself, and many of the living, would survive until the coming of the Lord Jesus."
3. "The object seems to be to correct an opinion which prevailed among the Thessalonians that they who should survive to the coming of the Lord Jesus would have great advantages over those who had died."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By the word of the Lord... We do not say this on our own authority." 
2. "The plural we indicates that Paul himself expected to be alive at the parousia." 
3. "The living shall not share the blessings of the advent sooner than the dead in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are not the first witnesses of the resurrection, but instead of this the Master himself declared it."
2. "We shall accordingly not rise without them."
3. "He means by this to arouse the Thessalonians to wait for it, nay more, to hold all believers in suspense, that they may not promise themselves some particular time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The account of the Lord‚Äôs Second Advent which follows is one of those revelations which human reasoning could not even help the apostle to predict."
2. "The 'we' embraces along with the apostle all the Christian Thessalonians at that time alive; if, therefore, the expression implies that Paul expected that he would live till the reappearance of Christ, it equally implies that he expected that all the Thessalonians would survive till that time; which no one is hardy enough to maintain."
3. "The beginning of the following chapter shows that Paul was unwilling to speak definitely of the times and seasons; and the Second Epistle shows that the one point on which he was confident was that other events must occur before the second coming."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By the word of the Lord (ŒµŒΩ ŒªŒøŒ≥œâ ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒøœÖ). We do not know to what word of the Lord Jesus Paul refers, probably Paul meaning only the point in the teaching of Christ rather than a quotation." 
2. "Ye that are alive (Œ∑ŒºŒµŒπœÇ Œø Œ∂œâŒΩœÑŒµœÇ). Paul here includes himself, but this by no means shows that Paul knew that he would be alive at the Parousia of Christ. He was alive, not dead, when he wrote." 
3. "Shall in no wise precede (ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑ œÜŒ∏Œ±œÉœâŒºŒµŒΩ). Second aorist active subjunctive of œÜŒ∏Œ±ŒΩœâ, to come before, to anticipate. This strong negative with ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑ (double negative) and the subjunctive is the regular idiom (Robertson, Grammar, p. 929). Hence there was no ground for uneasiness about the dead in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "...what he was about to say, was not a fancy and conjecture of his own, the fruit and produce of his own brain, but what he could assert upon a sure foundation, upon the best and greatest authority, even the word of the Lord..." 
2. "...he speaks of himself and others in the first person plural, by way of instance and example, for illustration sake; that supposing he and others should be then in being, the following would be the case..."
3. "...from hence it appears, that there will be saints alive at Christ's second coming; he will have a seed to serve him till he comes again; he always had in the worst of times, and will have..."

### John Wesley:
1. "By the word of the Lord ‚Äî By a particular revelation."
2. "We who are left ‚Äî This intimates the fewness of those who will be then alive, compared to the multitude of the dead."
3. "Believers of all ages and nations make up, as it were, one body; in consideration of which, the believers of that age might put themselves in the place, and speak in the person, of them who were to live till the coming of the Lord."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The apostle Paul, through a direct revelation from the Lord, confirms that he and the majority of the Thessalonians, to whom he is writing, expect to be alive at the coming of the Lord. However, it is important to note that this inclusion of themselves does not overshadow the fact that this revelation pertains to all faithful believers who will be present at the coming of the Lord. The early Christians did not view their departed brethren as anticipating them in entering glory, but rather needed assurance that those who remain until the Lord's coming would not precede those who have fallen asleep. The Spirit intended for believers in every age to live in continued expectation of the Lord's coming, without knowing whether they would be among the living at that time. Thus, it is crucial for believers to not lose sight of this blessed hope and instead eagerly anticipate the return of our Lord.
