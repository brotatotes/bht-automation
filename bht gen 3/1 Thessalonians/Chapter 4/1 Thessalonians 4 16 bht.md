## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Because the Lord Himself (said for solemnity‚Äôs sake, and to shew that it will not be a mere gathering to Him, but HE HIMSELF will descend, and we all shall be summoned before Him) with (literally, ‚Äòin, as the element,‚Äîthe accompanying circumstance) a signal-shout..."
2. "Then we who are living, who remain behind (as above), shall be caught up (the great change spoken of, 1 Cor. xv. 52, having first suddenly taken place) all together, with them, in (the) clouds, to meet the Lord (as He descends."
3. "That he advances no further in the prophetic description, but breaks off at our union in Christ‚Äôs presence, is accounted for, by his purpose being accomplished, in having shewn that they who have died in Christ, shall not be thereby deprived of any advantage at His coming."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus is represented as a victorious King, giving the word of command to the hosts of heaven in His train for the last onslaught, at His final triumph over sin, death, and Satan."
2. "Michael is perhaps meant, to whom especially is committed the guardianship of the people of God."
3. "The trumpet blast...to summon God's elect together, preparatory to their glorification with Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "With a shout - The word here used (Œ∫ŒµÃÅŒªŒµœÖœÉŒºŒ± keleusma), does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It properly means a 'cry‚Äô of excitement, or of arging on; an outcry, clamor, or shout."
2. "The names of three only of the seven are mentioned in the Jewish writings: Michael, the patron of the Jewish nation... Gabriel... Raphael."
3. "It is implied in all this description, that the interval between their resurrection and the change which will occur to the living, will be brief, or that the one will rapidly succeed the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The following description of the Lord's descent from heaven is intended to emphasise the fact that the reunion of dead and living believers will be accomplished by the Lord in person."
2. "With a shout [ŒµŒΩ Œ∫ŒµŒªŒµœÖœÉŒºŒ±œÑŒπ]. N. T. o. Once in LXX, Proverbs 24:6 Proverbs 24:2 (English Bib 30:27). From keleuein to summon. Often in Class. Lit. a shout of command, as of a general to his army, an admiral to his oarsmen, or a charioteer to his horses."
3. "With the trumpet of God [ŒµŒΩ œÉŒ±ŒªœÄŒπŒ≥Œ≥Œπ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ]. For the trumpet heralding great manifestations of God, see Exodus 19:13, Exodus 19:16; Psalms 47:5; Isaiah 27:13; Zechariah 9:14; Zephaniah 1:16; Joel 2:1; Matthew 24:31; 1 Corinthians 14:52; Revelation 1:10; Revelation 4:1."

### John Calvin:
1. "He appoints one in the foremost place to take the lead of the others."
2. "The dead who are in Christ... will rise first."
3. "A sudden change will be like death. Ordinary death, it is true, is the separation of the soul from the body; but this does not hinder that the Lord may in a moment destroy this corruptible nature, so as to create it anew by his power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven... the first intimation of His coming shall be the signals given not to the living but to the dead." 
2. "The word here rendered 'shout' is literally 'word of command,' being the common and technical term for the military word of command... The whole representation, the angelic host with their archangelic leader, the trumpet 'sounding louder and louder,' the descent of the Lord Himself, finds its original in the descent of God upon Mount Sinai."
3. "The dead in Christ... shall rise first. Before anything else transpires, and especially before the living are gathered to the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ will come as Conqueror."
2. "The only archangel mentioned in N.T. is Michael in Jude 1:9. But note absence of article with both œÜœâŒΩŒ∑ and Œ±œÅœáŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÖ. The reference may be thus indefinite."
3. "First here refers plainly to the fact that, so far from the dead in Christ having no share in the Parousia, they will rise before those still alive are changed."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ will now appear as the King of kings, and Lord of lords, as the Judge of the whole earth, attended with the host, or armies of heaven, and the shout of a king will be among them."
2. "Christ shall descend from heaven with a voice, or shall then utter such a voice, as will show him to be the archangel."
3. "Christ will come; but the wicked will not rise till the evening of that day, or till the close of the thousand years."

### John Wesley:
1. With a shout ‚Äî Properly, a proclamation made to a great multitude. Above this is, the voice of the archangel; above both, the trumpet of God; the voice of God, somewhat analogous to the sound of a trumpet.
