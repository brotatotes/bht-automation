# 1 Thessalonians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul speaks of believers being caught up to meet the Lord in the air, he is describing the future event of Christ's second coming. Just as Jesus was taken up in the clouds at His ascension, the rapture of the saints is a glorious moment where they will be swiftly and irresistibly caught up to be with the Lord. This is the ultimate hope of every believer, as it signifies a time of no more separation and an eternal residence with Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "we," recommending thus the expression to Christians of all ages, each generation bequeathing to the succeeding one a continually increasing obligation to look for the coming of the Lord.
2. The same honor is conferred on them as on their Lord. As He was taken in a cloud at His ascension, so at His return with clouds, they shall be caught up in clouds. The clouds are His and their triumphal chariot.

2. "The word here used implies that there will be the application of external force or power by which this will be done."
3. "It is, indeed, nowhere said that the transactions of the judgment will occur upon the earth. The world would not be spacious enough to contain all the assembled living and dead, and hence the throne of judgment will be fixed in the ample space above it."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "We must observe also what he says - we shall be, for he means that we profitably entertain a hope of eternal life, only when we hope that it has been expressly appointed for us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This Ascension of the Church to her Lord presupposes the â€˜changeâ€™ spoken of by Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:52. The bodily ascent will be a token of the new conditions into which the body has passed..." 
2. "The general idea of a gathering to the Lord is conveyed, but a literal representation of all the details here mentioned would fail to furnish us with an accurate picture of what will actually take place." 
3. "The restoration to lost friends is much, but is enhanced by the introduction to Christ and everlasting residence with Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The next step, not the identical time, but immediately afterwards."
2. "This rapture of the saints (both risen and changed) is a glorious climax to Paul's argument of consolation."

### John Gill:
1. "By the power of Christ, and by the ministry and means of the holy angels; and to which rapture will contribute, the agility which the bodies both of the raised and changed saints will have..." 
2. "These will be the chariots, in which they will be carried up to him; and thus, as at our Lord's ascension a cloud received him, and in it he was carried up out of the sight of men, so at this time will all the saints ride up in the clouds of heaven."
3. "The resurrection by the Mahometans is called 'a meeting of God', or a going to meet God: and so shall we ever be with the Lord; now the saints are with him at times, and have communion with him, but not always; but then they shall be ever with him..."

### John Wesley:
1. Together â€” In the same moment.
In the air â€” The wicked will remain beneath, while the righteous, being absolved, shall be assessors with their Lord in the judgment.
With the Lord â€” In heaven.
