# 1 Thessalonians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The will of God is revealed through the commandments of the Lord Jesus, and it is His desire that we be sanctified. This sanctification extends to every aspect of our lives and includes abstaining from fornication, a sin that was prevalent and even condoned among the Gentiles. The emphasis on holiness and purity is essential because converts from heathenism were heavily influenced by licentious customs and pagan practices. Thus, it is imperative that as Christians, we pursue sanctification and reject immoral behavior, as it aligns with the will of God for our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words the will of God serve to take up again the preceding assertion that the commandments were given 'by the Lord Jesus.'" 
2. "Your sanctification is in apposition with the will of God, as a matter patent to all, the will of God respecting us being known to be, our sanctification."
3. "Sanctification must be taken in the most general sense, and that which is afterwards introduced, as forming a part of our sanctification."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "This text...is a proof only that he requires holiness."
3. "Sanctification consists in two things: (1) In 'ceasing to do evil;' and, (2) In 'learning to do well.'"

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "This is his approving will, or what is well pleasing in his sight, being agreeable to his nature, and divine perfections, particularly his holiness, in which he is glorious."
3. "Abstinence from [fornication] being a branch of external holiness; and because that this sin was common among the Gentiles, and not esteemed a sin by them."
