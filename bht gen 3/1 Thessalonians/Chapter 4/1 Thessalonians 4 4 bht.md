## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sanctification has been explained to consist in abstaining from fornication. And now this fornication comes to be specified, wherein it consists, and how it may be guarded against: viz. in carrying on the divinely-appointed commerce of the sexes in holiness and honour."
2. "Thus the context would be satisfied, and the emphatic position of his own...and acquire would retain its proper meaning: that each of you should know how to acquire his own vessel (for this purpose) in sanctification and honour."
3. "This interpretation is that of some of the principal among the ancients, including Augustine, and of many of the principal moderns."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "knowâ€”by moral self-control." 
2. "how to acquire (get for himself) his own vessel" 
3. "in sanctification"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'vessel' here probably refers to the body... because it is that which contains the soul, or in which the soul is lodged."
2. "The word vessel... was used by the latter Hebrews to denote a wife, as the vessel of her husband."
3. "The injunction then is, that we should preserve the body pure... that we should honor it as a noble work of God, to be employed for pure purposes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel...render, that every one of you treat his own wife honorably." 
2. "Neither in LXX nor Class. does it mean body...Here, metaphorically, for wife."
3. "On the contrary, let each one treat honorably his own wife."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Each was to possess a wife of his own. As to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 7:2), Paul says, â€˜To avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife.â€™"
2. "Let every man get a wife of his own, that thus neither the public prostitute nor another manâ€™s spouse may be a temptation to him."
3. "Impurity and shame are always connected with ill-regulated appetites and lawless passions; men are therefore to marry that they may be pure and without shame."

2. "The man shall acquire his own wife 'in sanctification and honour.'"
3. "When the husband comes to the marriage bed, he should come as a chaste man to a chaste wife."

### John Gill:
1. "Now for a man to possess his vessel in this sense, is to enjoy his wife, and to use that power he has over her in a becoming manner."
2. "For marriage is honourable when the bed is kept undefiled; and which may be defiled, not only by taking another into it, and which is not possessing the wife in sanctification and honour, it is the reverse, for it is a breaking through the rules of chastity and honour."
3. "For, by fornication, a man sins against his own body; and by adultery he gets a wound, and a dishonour, and a reproach that will not be wiped away; and by sodomy, and such like unnatural lusts, men dishonour their own bodies between themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. "That every one know â€” For this requires knowledge, as well as chastity."
2. "To possess his vessel â€” His wife."
3. "Remembering, marriage is not designed to inflame, but to conquer, natural desires."
