# 1 Thessalonians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ignorance of true religion breeds unchastity, as a people's morals mirror their deities. The call, here, is to resist the lust of concupiscence and avaricious greed. This goes beyond sensual desire, encompassing all worldly yearnings. The heathen worshipped licentious gods, while lacking knowledge of the true God. Sadly, the revival of paganism today stems from the desire for freedom from God's inhibitions against licentiousness. Thus, believers are urged to live honorably and purely within marriage, cognizant of the fact that those who do not know God lack the same standard of holiness.
