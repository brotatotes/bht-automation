## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I cannot help regarding it as most unnatural, to interpret this verse of a new subject introduced, viz. the not wronging one another in the business of life."
2. "To say that more than one kind of sin must be mentioned because he speaks of 'all these things' is mere trifling: this expression merely generalizes from the sin mentioned to a wider range."
3. "I understand the verse, with Chrysostom, and most of the ancients and moderns, to refer to the sins of uncleanness, and continue vv. 4, 5:‚Äîthat he should not... go beyond and overreach his brother in... acquiring his own vessel‚Äîthat there should be among you no strifes on account of the lusts of carnal desire."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Go beyond - transgress the bounds of rectitude in respect to his 'brother'." 
2. "Avenger - the Righter."
3. "Testified - constantly testified."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That no man go beyond - œÖÃîœÄŒµœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒπÃÅŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ huperbainein. This word means, 'to make to go over,' as, e. g., a wall or mountain; then, to overpass, to wit, certain limits, to transgress; and then to go too far, i. e., to go beyond right - hence to cheat or defraud."
2. "And defraud - œÄŒªŒµŒøŒΩŒµŒ∫œÑŒµŒπÕÇŒΩ pleonektein Margin, 'oppress,' or 'overreach.' This word properly means, to have more than another; then to have an advantage; and then to take advantage of any one, to circumvent, defraud, cheat."
3. "In any matter... It is a general command not to defraud; in no way to take advantage of another; in no way to deprive him of his rights."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Pursue your business as holy men: do not overreach or defraud." 
2. "It is the overstepping of the line between mine and thine."
3. "The sense is the business in hand, whatever it be."

### John Calvin:
1. "God has it in view to sanctify us, that no man may do injury to his brother."
2. "Paul teaches that conducting ourselves righteously and harmlessly towards our neighbors is a department of holiness."
3. "We must observe, however, what he says ‚Äî we have solemnly testified; for such is the sluggishness of mankind, that, unless they are wounded to the quick, they are touched with no apprehension of God‚Äôs judgment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This is at once manifest when the proper rendering is given to the words ‚Äòin the matter.‚Äô It is the matter of which Paul has been speaking, to which he still refers, the matter of unchastity; and as he has said of this, that they are to abstain from fornication, and chastely use its natural remedy, so now he denounces adultery." 
2. "The first of these terms denotes a contemptuous neglect of the rights of other men; the other, a greedy overreaching of others for our own pleasure or advantage, both of which elements enter into the sin of adultery."
3. "In all such matters God is the avenger. Men may not be able to vindicate their own rights, or inflict the just and righteous punishment for irreparable injury; but the Lord has an eye on every such case, and will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and cause the offender to feel that it is himself he has befooled."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That no man transgress...And wrong his brother." 
2. "To take more, to overreach, to take advantage of, to defraud."
3. "Modern men and women need to remember that God is the avenger for sexual wrongs both in this life and the next."

### John Gill:
1. "This is commonly understood of transgressing the bounds of justice and equity between men and men; and of cheating and defrauding in trade and business."
2. "The matter, or business referred to, is not trade, but the subject of chastity or uncleanness the apostle is speaking of."
3. "The Lord avenges, either in this life, by the hand of the civil magistrate, who is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that does evil; or by a violent death, as in the case of Zimri and Cozbi, and twenty four thousand more at the same time; or by some awful judgment from heaven, as in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah; or in the world to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "The things forbidden, here are three: fornication, the passion of desire, or inordinate affection in the married state, and the breach of the marriage contract." 
2. "By violating his bed."
3. "In this matter."
