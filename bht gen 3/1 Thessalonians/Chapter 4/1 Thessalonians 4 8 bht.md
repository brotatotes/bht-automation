# 1 Thessalonians 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who reject or despise the limitations and rules set by God are rejecting the very nature of God Himself, the one who has given them His Holy Spirit. These commands are not mere human instructions, but divine mandates communicated by the Spirit of God. Believers have been bestowed with the Holy Spirit so that they can reflect the holiness of God. Disregarding these commands is not to be taken lightly, as it signifies a rejection of God's authority and a disregard for the precious gift of the Holy Spirit bestowed upon believers.
