# 1 Thessalonians 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone rejects the limitations and rules set by God, they commit the fearful sin of disregarding God Himself and the Holy Spirit, who is given to bring forth holiness. By despising these commandments, one rejects not only man but also the Spirit of God that is speaking through them. Therefore, we must realize that these commandments are not just the words of men, but the inspired and authoritative commands of God Himself, aimed at guiding us towards sanctification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Hence, the sin of (rejecting) setting at nought such limitations and rules is a fearful one‚Äîno less than that of setting at nought God the giver of the Holy Spirit."
2. "He that despiseth simply describes him who commits the act of despising, the despiser‚Äîwhat he despises, is not to be supplied in the construction, but is clear from the context‚Äîviz. his brother."
3. "his Spirit, which is holy... to bring out the holiness of the Spirit, as connected with sanctification preceding."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who doth so, 'sets at naught not man (as for instance his brother), but God.'"
2. "His own Spirit, the Holy (One)"; thus emphatically marking "holiness" as the end for which the Holy (One) is being given.
3. "'Giveth' implies that sanctification is not merely a work once for all accomplished in the past, but a present progressive work."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He therefore that despiseth... is really rejecting and disobeying God."
2. "The apostle assures them in the most solemn manner, that, though communicated to them by man, yet they were really the commands of God."
3. "This is a claim to inspiration. Paul did not give these commands as his own, but as taught by the Spirit of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Despiseth [Œ±Œ∏ŒµœÑœâŒΩ]. Better, rejecteth. Setteth aside." 
2. "His Holy Spirit [œÑŒø œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ œÑŒø Œ±Œ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ]. Solemn and emphatic: His Spirit, the holy."
3. "Similarly, Acts 14:8, Acts 14:28; Acts 19:6; Acts 20:23; Ephesians 1:13; Ephesians 4:30."

### John Calvin:
1. "He reminds them that they had been endowed with the Spirit of God, first, in order that they may distinguish what proceeds from God."
2. "With heavenly authority, they may pronounce judgment against all manner of unchastity ‚Äî such as will fall upon their own heads, unless they keep aloof from contagion."
3. "It is not from human perception that they condemn unchastity, but they pronounce from the authority of God what has been suggested to them by his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that rejecteth, i.e. he who contemptuously or negligently refuses to listen to these injunctions and warnings."
2. "Not man. Not me, the apostle who conveys this message to you. I do not deliver these moral precepts on my own authority. They are the commandments of God."
3. "Sins of the flesh are specially antagonistic to the Spirit‚Äôs work; they mock all a man‚Äôs nobler aspirations, and make indulgence the end of life, and whatever refinement and apparent susceptibility to what is good they leave on the surface, underneath the whole nature is rotten, feeble, coarse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Therefore." This old triple compound particle (œÑŒøŒπ, Œ≥Œ±œÅ, ŒøœÖŒΩ) is in the N.T. only here and Hebrews 12:1. Paul applies the logic of the case.
2. "He that rejecteth." This late verb (Polybius and LXX) is from Œ±-Œ∏ŒµœÑŒøœÇ (Œ± privative and verbal of œÑŒπŒ∏Œ∑Œº, to proscribe a thing, to annul it.
3. "But God." Paul sees this clearly and modern atheists see it also. In order to justify their licentiousness they do not hesitate to set aside God.

### John Gill:
1. "he that rejects these things with contempt, takes no notice of them, and acts not according to them, despiseth not man; not men only, the apostles of Christ, and ministers of the Gospel; but God."
2. "to slight them, was to slight Jesus Christ himself; and, by the way, this is a proof of the true and proper deity of Christ."
3. "despising them, was despising the Spirit of God that spake by them."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that despiseth ‚Äî The commandments we gave. Despiseth God ‚Äî Himself." 
2. "What naked majesty of words! How oratorical, and yet with what great simplicity!" 
3. "A simplicity that does not impair, but improve, the understanding to the utmost; that, like the rays of heat through a glass, collects all the powers of reason into one orderly point, from being scattered abroad in utter confusion."
