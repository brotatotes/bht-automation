# 1 Thessalonians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Thessalonians had already been taught about the coming of the Lord Jesus and the events associated with it, so Paul found no need to further elaborate on the subject. The terms times and seasons refer to general chronological periods and opportune times respectively, with the plural form suggesting various incidents at different times. Paul distinguishes between kairos (suitable time) and chronos (time measured by duration). Speculating about the precise times of these events would be unnecessary and a mere indulgence of vain curiosity.

### Marvin Vincent:

1. "He speaks, however, by way of anticipation, saying, that they have no need that he should write as to those things which the curious desire to know."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Thessalonians were already well-informed about the coming of the Lord Jesus and the events surrounding his advent, so there was no need for Paul to reiterate what he had already taught them. The term times refers to general chronological periods, while seasons denotes opportune times. The plural usage here indicates that Paul is referring to various incidents leading up to the second coming which will occur at different times. The distinction between kairos (juncture, occasion) and chronos (extended period) is significant, as the former refers to a suitable and measured time, while the latter denotes duration. It is unnecessary for Paul to write about the precise times of these events, as it would indulge a vain curiosity and detract from the true message of comfort and hope in Christ's return.
