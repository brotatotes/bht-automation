# 1 Thessalonians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers in Thessalonica had already been taught extensively about the times and seasons of Christ's second coming, so there was no need for St. Paul to write to them about it.

The distinction between chronos (extended period) and kairos (definite space of time) is significant, emphasizing the specific timing and opportune moments. Ultimately, the pious believers do not require detailed knowledge beyond what God has permitted them to learn.
