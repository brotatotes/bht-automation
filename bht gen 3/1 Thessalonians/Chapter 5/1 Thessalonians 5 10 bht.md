3. "The word rendered 'together' (Œ±ÃîŒºŒ± hama) is not to be regarded as connected with the phrase 'with him' - as meaning that he and they would be 'together,' but it refers to those who 'wake and those who sleep' - those who are alive and those who are dead - meaning that they would be 'together' or would be with the Lord 'at the same time'; there would be no priority or precedence."
