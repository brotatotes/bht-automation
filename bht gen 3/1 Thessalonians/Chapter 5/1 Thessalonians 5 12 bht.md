### Henry Alford:
1. "to know: i.e. favourably and honourably to recognize."
2. "The persons indicated by them which labour... preside... admonish..., are the same, viz. the presbyters or bishops."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here, 'we beseech you,' as if it were a personal favor (Paul making the cause of the Thessalonian presbyters, as it were, his own)."
2. "Recognize their office, and treat them accordingly with reverence and with liberality in supplying their needs."
3. "'Admonish you,' one of their leading functions; the Greek is 'put in mind,' implying not arbitrary authority, but gentle, though faithful, admonition."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word ‚Äòknow‚Äô seems to mean that they were not to make themselves strangers to them - to be cold and distant toward them - to be ignorant of their needs, or to be indifferent to them."
2. "They should so far understand his circumstances as to know what is requisite to make him comfortable, and should be on such terms that they may readily and cheerfully furnish what he needs."
3. "It is a part of the duty of a minister to put his people in mind of the truth; to warn them of danger; to exhort them to perform their duty; to admonish them if they go astray."

1. "Recognize them for what they are, and as entitled to respect because of their office."
2. "The ecclesiastical nomenclature of the Pauline Epistles is unsettled, corresponding with the fact that the primitive church was not a homogeneous body throughout christendom."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must observe, however, with what titles of distinction he honors pastors...Farther, he expresses the kind of labor when he adds, those that admonish, or instruct, you. It is to no purpose, therefore, that any, that do not discharge the office of an instructor, glory in the name of pastors."
2. "Paul would have such as devote themselves to teaching, and preside with no other end in view than that of serving the Church, be held in no ordinary esteem...we must observe the reason that he adds immediately afterwards ‚Äî on account of their work. Now, this work is the edification of the Church, the everlasting salvation of souls, the restoration of the world, and, in fine, the kingdom of God and Christ."
3. "For he says literally ‚Äî let them be more than abundantly honored, and not without good ground, for we must observe the reason that he adds immediately afterwards ‚Äî on account of their work. Now, this work is the edification of the Church, the everlasting salvation of souls, the restoration of the world, and, in fine, the kingdom of God and Christ."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Them that labour among you (œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ∫ŒøœÄŒπœâŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ ŒµŒΩ œÖŒºŒπŒΩ). Old word for toil even if weary."
2. "And are over you in the Lord (Œ∫Œ± œÄœÅŒøŒπœÉœÑŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÖœÇ œÖŒºœâŒΩ ŒµŒΩ ŒöœÖœÅŒπœâ). Same article with this participle. Literally, those who stand in front of you, your leaders in the Lord, the presbyters or bishops and deacons. Get acquainted with them and follow them."
3. "And admonish you (Œ∫Œ± ŒΩŒøœÖŒ∏ŒµœÑŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ œÖŒºŒ±œÇ). Old verb from ŒΩŒøœÖŒ∏ŒµœÑŒ∑œÇ and this from ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ (mind) and œÑŒπŒ∏Œ∑Œº, to put. Putting sense into the heads of people. A thankless, but a necessary, task. The same article connects all three participles, different functions of the same leaders in the church."

### John Gill:
1. "They laboured in the word and doctrine; gave up themselves to meditation, reading, and prayer; laboured hard in private, to find out the meaning of the word of God; and studied to show themselves workmen, that need not be ashamed; and preached the word in season and out of season."

1. "Know ‚Äî See, mark, take knowledge of them and their work."

3. "But O, what a misery is it when a man undertakes this whole work without either gifts or graces for any part of it!"
