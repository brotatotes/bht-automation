## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To know: i.e. favourably and honourably to recognize."
2. "The persons indicated by them which labour... preside... admonish..., are the same, viz. the presbyters or bishops."
3. "In the Lord, as the element in which, the matter with regard to which, their presidency takes place: 'in divine things.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Exhort" is the expression in 1 Thessalonians 5:14; here, "we beseech you," as if it were a personal favor (Paul making the cause of the Thessalonian presbyters, as it were, his own).
2. Recognize their office, and treat them accordingly with reverence and with liberality in supplying their needs.
3. Their presidency over you is in divine things; not in worldly affairs, but in things appertaining to the Lord.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'know' seems to mean that they were not to make themselves strangers to them - to be cold and distant toward them - to be ignorant of their needs, or to be indifferent to them."
2. "They should seek to be personally acquainted with him, and make him their confidant and counselor in their spiritual troubles."
3. "It is a part of the duty of a minister to put his people in mind of the truth; to warn them of danger; to exhort them to perform their duty; to admonish them if they go astray."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Recognize them for what they are, and as entitled to respect because of their office."
2. "The ecclesiastical nomenclature of the Pauline Epistles is unsettled, corresponding with the fact that the primitive church was not a homogeneous body throughout christendom."
3. "The congregation exercised discipline and gave judgment."

### John Calvin:
1. "And it is for this reason that Paul is so careful to recommend them. To acknowledge means here to have regard or respect; but Paul intimates that the reason why less honor is shown to teachers themselves than is befitting, is because their labor is not ordinarily taken into consideration."
2. "Paul would have such as devote themselves to teaching, and preside with no other end in view than that of serving the Church, be held in no ordinary esteem... we must observe the reason that he adds immediately afterwards â€” on account of their work. Now, this work is the edification of the Church, the everlasting salvation of souls, the restoration of the world, and, in fine, the kingdom of God and Christ."
3. "Preside in the Lord... those that govern the Church in the name and by the commandment of Christ, are for this reason spoken of particularly as presiding in the Lord. We may, however, infer from this, how very remote those are from the rank of pastors and prelates who exercise a tyranny altogether opposed to Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To know. â€˜That is, to appreciate, not to be unaware of their real workâ€™ (Vaughan)."
2. "Those who labour among you, and preside over you and admonish you. All three functions belong to the same office. Those who presided over them were the same persons who instructed them: ruling and teaching were the two grand divisions of ecclesiastical labour."
3. "But if not in Thessalonica, in other churches, symptoms soon appeared of a separation of the ruling from the teaching elders. See 1 Timothy 5:17."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Those who stand in front of you, your leaders in the Lord, the presbyters or bishops and deacons."
2. "Get acquainted with them and follow them."
3. "Putting sense into the heads of people. A thankless, but a necessary, task."

### John Gill:
1. "laboured in the word and doctrine; gave up themselves to meditation, reading, and prayer; laboured hard in private, to find out the meaning of the word of God; and studied to show themselves workmen, that need not be ashamed" 
2. "that they would make themselves known to them, and converse freely and familiarly with them, that so they might know the state of their souls, and be better able to speak a word in season to them"
3. "they were over them, yet under Christ, and in subjection to him, as their Lord and King; governing not in an arbitrary and tyrannical way, lording it over God's heritage, usurping a dominion over the faith of men"

### John Wesley:
1. "Know them that, 1. Labour among you: 2. Are over you in the Lord: 3. Admonish you." 
2. "Sometimes the same person may both labour, that is, preach; be over, or govern; and admonish the flock by particular application to each: sometimes two or more different persons, according as God variously dispenses his gifts."
3. "But O, what a misery is it when a man undertakes this whole work without either gifts or graces for any part of it!"
