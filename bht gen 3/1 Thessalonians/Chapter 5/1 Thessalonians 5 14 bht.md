## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This, as ch. iv. 11, 2 Thess. iii. 6, 11, certainly implies that there was reason to complain of this disorder in the Thessalonian church." 
2. "The original word is especially said of the soldier who does not remain in his rank: hence disorderly."
3. "The weak must, be understood of the spiritually weak, not the literally sick."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This exhortation to 'warm the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded,' applies to all clergy and laity alike, though primarily the duty of the clergy."
2. "Paul practiced what he preached."
3. "There is no believer who needs not the exercise of patience 'toward' him; there is none to whom a believer ought not to show it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The duties here enjoined are such as pertain to all Christians in their appropriate spheres, and should not be left to be performed by ministers only."
2. "One reason why there is so little piety in the church, and why so many professors of religion go astray, is, that the great mass of church members feel no responsibility on this subject."
3. "Every Christian - especially every one who has been long in the service of his Master - has a fund of experience which is the property of the church, and which may be of incalculable value to those who are struggling now amidst many embarrassments along the Christian way."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Those who are out of line."
2. "Those of little heart."
3. "The primary sense is, keeping one's self directly opposite to another so as to sustain him."

### John Calvin:
1. "He commands, therefore, that the unruly (607) be admonished, that is, those who live dissolutely. The term admonition, also, is employed to mean sharp reproof, such as may bring them back into the right way, for they are deserving of greater severity, and they cannot be brought to repentance by any other remedy."
2. "On the other hand, he commands that the unruly should be admonished sharply, in order that the weak may be treated with kindness and humanity, and that the faint-hearted may receive consolation. It is therefore to no purpose that those that are obstinate and intractable demand that they be soothingly caressed, inasmuch as remedies must be adapted to diseases."
3. "He recommends, however, patience towards all, for severity must be tempered with some degree of lenity, even in dealing with the unruly. This patience, however, is, properly speaking, contrasted with a feeling of irksomeness, (608) for nothing are we more prone to than to feel wearied out when we set ourselves to cure the diseases of our brethren."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The feeble-minded. Those timid persons who were dismayed by the persecutions which had overtaken the young Church, or who were downcast by the loss of friends through death."
2. "Support the weak. Undoubtedly this means the weak in soul, â€˜whether through defect of faith, bondage of conscience, or instability of principle.â€™"
3. "How are we to treat the scrupulous, conscientiously bigoted, slow, obstructive, little-minded members? Are we to leave them out of account and override their prejudices? We are to support, or, as the word means, hold to them. We are to befriend and consider them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Admonish the disorderly. Put sense into the unruly mob who break ranks. This is a challenging task for any leader."
2. "Encourage the fainthearted. These must be held in line."
3. "Support the weak. The weak are those tempted to sin. Be long-suffering toward all. What a wonderful ideal Paul here holds up for church leaders!"

### John Gill:
1. "Warn them that are unruly; or disorderly, idle persons, working not at all, busying themselves with other men's matters, and living upon the church's stock...rebuke these, and exhort them to fill up their places, to abide by the church, and the ordinances of Christ."
2. "Comfort the feebleminded: such as are not able to bear the loss of near and dear relations...speak a comfortable word to them, encourage them with the doctrines of grace, and the promises of the Gospel."
3. "Support the weak; who are weak in faith and knowledge, strengthen them, hold them up...bear their infirmities...be patient towards all men; towards the unruly, the feebleminded, and the weak as well as to believers; exercise longsuffering and forbearance with fellow creatures and fellow Christians."

### John Wesley:
1. "Warn the disorderly â€” Them that stand, as it were, out of their rank in the spiritual warfare." 
2. "Some such were even in that church."
3. "The feeble-minded â€” Literally, them of little soul; such as have no spiritual courage."
