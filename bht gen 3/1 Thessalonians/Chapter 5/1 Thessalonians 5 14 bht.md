## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This, as ch. iv. 11, 2 Thess. iii. 6, 11, certainly implies that there was reason to complain of this disorder in the Thessalonian church." 
2. "The original word is especially said of the soldier who does not remain in his rank: hence disorderly."
3. "the weak must, be understood of the spiritually weak, not the literally sick."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "comfort the feeble-minded (the faint-hearted, who are ready to sink 'without hope' in afflictions, 2 Thessalonians 3:11- :, and temptations)"
2. "the weakâ€”spiritually. Paul practiced what he preached (2 Thessalonians 3:11- :)"
3. "There is no believer who needs not the exercise of patience 'toward' him; there is none to whom a believer ought not to show it; many show it more to strangers than to their own families, more to the great than to the humble; but we ought to show it 'toward all men' [BENGEL]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The duties here enjoined are such as pertain to all Christians in their appropriate spheres, and should not be left to be performed by ministers only."
2. "One reason why there is so little piety in the church, and why so many professors of religion go astray, is, that the great mass of church members feel no responsibility on this subject."
3. "Every Christian - especially every one who has been long in the service of his Master - has a fund of experience which is the property of the church, and which may be of incalculable value to those who are struggling now amidst many embarrassments along the Christian way."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Those who are out of line."
2. "Those of little heart."
3. "The primary sense is, keeping one's self directly opposite to another so as to sustain him."

### John Calvin:
1. "He commands, therefore, that the unruly be admonished, that is, those who live dissolutely. The term admonition, also, is employed to mean sharp reproof, such as may bring them back into the right way, for they are deserving of greater severity, and they cannot be brought to repentance by any other remedy."
2. "It is therefore to no purpose that those that are obstinate and intractable demand that they be soothingly caressed, inasmuch as remedies must be adapted to diseases."
3. "Paul had in view to bridle impatience of this nature, by recommending to us moderation towards all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The counsels of this verse are addressed not to the ministers alone, nor to the people alone, but to all."
2. "We are to support, or, as the word means, hold to them. We are to befriend and consider them."
3. "To them, as to all, we are to be patient, or long-suffering, putting up with much provoking narrowness and obstinacy and misapprehension of Christian principle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Admonish the disorderly. Put sense into the unruly mob who break ranks. This is a challenging task for any leader."
2. "Encourage the fainthearted. Local conditions often cause some to lose heart and wish to drop out, be quitters. These must be held in line."
3. "Support the weak. The weak are those tempted to sin (immorality, for instance)."

### John Gill:
1. "Warn them that are unruly; ...reprove them for their sloth, exhort them to work with their own hands, to do their own business." 
2. "Comfort the feebleminded: ...speak a comfortable word to them, encourage them with the doctrines of grace, and the promises of the Gospel."
3. "Support the weak; ...strengthen them, hold them up; or... 'take the burden of the weak' and carry it, bear their infirmities."

### John Wesley:
1. "Warn the disorderly â€” Them that stand, as it were, out of their rank in the spiritual warfare."
2. "Some such were even in that church."
3. "The feeble-minded â€” Literally, them of little soul; such as have no spiritual courage."
