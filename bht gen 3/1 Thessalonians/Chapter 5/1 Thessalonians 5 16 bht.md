## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When we have such a disposition as to hurt no one but to do good to all, whence can the sting of grief enter?" 
2. "He who so joys in being injured as to requite his injurer by good offices, whence shall he receive annoyance for the future?"
3. "For one accustomed to converse with God and to give thanks to Him for all that happens, as good for him, will clearly possess unbroken joy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In order to 'rejoice evermore,' we must 'pray without ceasing.' He who is wont to thank God for all things as happening for the best, will have continuous joy." 
2. "Rejoice in the Lord... by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving." 
3. "Rejoice... in the Holy Ghost, in hope, in being counted worthy to suffer shame for Christ's name, in falling into divers temptations."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Rejoice evermore - See the notes on Philippians 3:1; Philippians 4:4.


### John Calvin:
1. "Rejoice always. I refer this to moderation of spirit, when the mind keeps itself in calmness under adversity, and does not give indulgence to grief."
2. "He prescribes the remedy â€” that by prayer we disburden our anxieties, as it were, into his bosom."
3. "For many pray in such a manner, as at the same time to murmur against God, and fret themselves if he does not immediately gratify their wishes. But, on the contrary, it is befitting that our desires should be restrained in such a manner that, contented with what is given us, we always mingle thanksgiving with our desires."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is a scandalous misprision, vulgarly admitted, concerning religion, that it is altogether sullen and sour, requiring a dull, lumpish, morose kind of life, barring all delight, all mirth, all good humour; whereas, on the contrary, it alone is the never-failing source of true, pure, steady joy."
2. "This precept supposes that it is possible for us to obey it. To know that it is Godâ€™s will that we should always rejoice, that we should resemble Himself in this as in all that inward purity which causes joy, goes far to fill us with the happiness here enjoined."
3. "â€˜all spiritual sorrows, of what nature soever, are turned into spiritual joy: that is the proper end of them; they have a natural tendency that way.â€™"

### John Gill:
1. "Rejoice evermore. Not in a carnal, but in a spiritual way, with joy in the Holy Ghost."
2. "Rejoice...in the Lord Jesus Christ, in the greatness, fitness, fulness, and glory of his person, in his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice."
3. "There is always reason, and ever a firm ground and foundation for rejoicing with believers, let their circumstances or their frames be what they will."

### John Wesley:
1. "Rejoice evermore â€” In uninterrupted happiness in God."
2. "Pray without ceasing â€” Which is the fruit of always rejoicing in the Lord."
3. "In everything give thanks â€” Which is the fruit of both the former. This is Christian perfection."
