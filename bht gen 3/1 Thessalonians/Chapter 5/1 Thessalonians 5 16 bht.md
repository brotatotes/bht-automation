# 1 Thessalonians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we have such a disposition as to hurt no one but to do good to all, it becomes difficult for grief to enter our hearts. If we rejoice in being injured and respond with kindness, any future annoyance is avoided. By constantly conversing with God and giving thanks for all that happens, we are able to possess unbroken joy. To rejoice evermore, we must also pray without ceasing, continually thanking God for the best in all circumstances. This joy can be found in the Lord, in hope, and even in facing various temptations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When we have such a disposition as to hurt no one but to do good to all, whence can the sting of grief enter?" 
2. "He who so joys in being injured as to requite his injurer by good offices, whence shall he receive annoyance for the future?" 
3. "For one accustomed to converse with God and to give thanks to Him for all that happens, as good for him, will clearly possess unbroken joy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In order to 'rejoice evermore,' we must 'pray without ceasing.' He who is wont to thank God for all things as happening for the best, will have continuous joy." 
2. "Rejoice in the Lord . . . by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving."
3. "Rejoice in the Holy Ghost, in hope, in being counted worthy to suffer shame for Christ's name; in falling into divers temptations."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Rejoice evermore - See the notes on Philippians 3:1; Philippians 4:4.


### John Calvin:
1. "I refer this to moderation of spirit, when the mind keeps itself in calmness under adversity, and does not give indulgence to grief."
2. "And, unquestionably, if we consider what Christ has conferred upon us, there will be no bitterness of grief so intense as may not be alleviated, and give way to spiritual joy."
3. "For many pray in such a manner, as at the same time to murmur against God, and fret themselves if he does not immediately gratify their wishes. But, on the contrary, it is befitting that our desires should be restrained in such a manner that, contented with what is given us, we always mingle thanksgiving with our desires."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is a scandalous misprision, vulgarly admitted, concerning religion, that it is altogether sullen and sour, requiring a dull, lumpish, morose kind of life, barring all delight, all mirth, all good humour."
2. "It alone is the never-failing source of true, pure, steady joy; such as is deeply rooted in the heart, immoveably founded in the reason of things, permanent like the immortal spirit wherein it dwelleth, and like the eternal objects whereon it is fixed."
3. "All spiritual sorrows, of what nature soever, are turned into spiritual joy: that is the proper end of them; they have a natural tendency that way."

### John Gill:
1. "Rejoice evermore. Not in a carnal, but in a spiritual way, with joy in the Holy Ghost"
2. "but in the Lord Jesus Christ, in the greatness, fitness, fulness, and glory of his person, in his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice"
3. "there is always reason, and ever a firm ground and foundation for rejoicing with believers, let their circumstances or their frames be what they will"

### John Wesley:
1. "Rejoice evermore â€” In uninterrupted happiness in God."
2. "Pray without ceasing â€” Which is the fruit of always rejoicing in the Lord."
3. "In everything give thanks â€” Which is the fruit of both the former. This is Christian perfection."
