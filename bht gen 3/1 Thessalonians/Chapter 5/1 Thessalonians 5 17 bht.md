# 1 Thessalonians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to pray without ceasing, in direct supplication to God, maintaining a constant spirit of prayer that fills our hearts and communes with Him. This means praying without intermission, without allowing prayerless gaps to interrupt our times of prayer. We must be diligent in our prayers, not neglecting them or ceasing from them due to sin, discouragement, or carelessness. The reason for this constant and frequent prayer is because believers are always in need, constantly seeking God's mercy and grace to help them in their daily lives.
