# 1 Thessalonians 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not throw cold water on those who, under extraordinary inspiration of the Spirit, stand up to speak with tongues, or reveal mysteries, or pray in the congregation. Some were trying to put out the fire of the Holy Spirit, probably the special gifts of the Holy Spirit. But even so, the exercise of these special gifts was to be decently and in order and for edification. The caution was needed, not to receive 'all' pretended revelations as divine, without 'proving' them. Today, as then, there are two extremes about spiritual gifts; it is not hard to put out the fire of spiritual fervor and power.
