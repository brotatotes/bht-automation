# 1 Thessalonians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The day of the Lord is the sudden and terrible coming of the Lord, compared to a thief in the night. It is the quiet unconcern associated with the night and the thief's precaution to remain unnoticed that emphasize the unexpectedness of this day. While signs will precede the coming, its actual occurrence will be sudden. In the Old Testament, the phrase day of the Lord denotes a time when God manifests His power and justice. We should accurately know our own ignorance regarding the timing of this day, and be watchful for its sudden and unexpected arrival.
