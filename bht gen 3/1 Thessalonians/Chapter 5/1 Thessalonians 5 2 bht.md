# 1 Thessalonians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The day of the Lord is not the destruction of Jerusalem or the day of each man's death, but the day of the Lord's coming. It is described as sudden and terrible, like a thief in the night. The night signifies a state of quiet unconcern, yet the thief takes precautions to remain unnoticed. Signs may precede the coming, but the moment of arrival will be unexpected. We must be watchful, as this day is anticipated soon, and be prepared for its unforeseen arrival.
