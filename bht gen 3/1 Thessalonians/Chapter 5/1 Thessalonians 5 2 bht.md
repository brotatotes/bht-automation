# 1 Thessalonians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The day of the Lord does not refer to the destruction of Jerusalem or the day of each person's death. Rather, it signifies the day of the Lord's coming, which is characterized by suddenness and terribleness. It is compared to a thief in the night, who gives no warning and takes precautions to go unnoticed. Signs may precede this coming, but the event itself will be sudden. It is a time when God will manifest His power and justice. Believers should accurately acknowledge their own ignorance about the times and remain watchful for the Lord's return.

3. "He intends that his coming to this world shall be sudden and unexpected, 'like that of a thief in the night'; that there shall be no such indications of his approach that it shall not be sudden and unexpected; and that no warning of it shall be given so that people may know the time of his appearing."

3. "Cometh (ŒµœÅœáŒµœÑŒ±). Prophetic or futuristic present tense."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse speaks of the day of the Lord, which is not the destruction of Jerusalem or the day of each person's death, but rather the day of the Lord's coming. It emphasizes the suddenness and terribleness of this day, comparing it to a thief in the night. Just as a thief gives no notice of his approach and takes precautions to remain unnoticed, so too will the Lord's coming be sudden and unexpected. While signs may precede the coming, the actual event will be sudden at last. It is a time when God will manifest His power and justice. Attempts to interpret this as the day of death or the gradual advance toward perfection after death are forced. The analogy of a thief in the night is significant, as many gospel lessons on watchfulness are associated with a nighttime visit. The verse calls for believers to accurately know their own ignorance about the times and seasons, remaining watchful for the Lord's sudden return.
