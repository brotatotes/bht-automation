# 1 Thessalonians 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gift of prophecy should not be despised, as it is considered greater than tongues, which may appear more miraculous. The prophet, being withdrawn from earthly matters, receives the truth and is focused on the spiritual world. Prophecy works in harmony with the spiritual, moral intelligence, and speech of the prophet. We should not dismiss or demean prophecy, but rather value and esteem it. Similarly, preaching should not be underestimated, as it is God's means of converting the world. Neglecting or despising any means of grace, including prophecy, can quench the Spirit.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The gift of prophecy must not be despised or regarded as insignificant compared to the more showy gift of tongues. While tongues may seem more miraculous, prophecy is the greater gift. The prophet receives the truth into their own spirit, being withdrawn from earthly things and focused on the spiritual world. This gift works in harmony with their higher, spiritual part, moral intelligence, and speech. Prophecy should not be confused with mystical ecstasy or seen as a lesser form of communication. Instead, it is the chief of the spiritual gifts and should not be devalued. The prophecies of the Old Testament still hold usefulness and can strengthen faith in the Gospel. Therefore, we should not disregard or demean private prophecies, but rather value and esteem them. Let us not despise preaching, for it is God's great ordinance for converting the world and should not be underestimated or neglected. To despise any means of grace, including prophecy, is to quench the Spirit.
