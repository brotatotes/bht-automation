# 1 Thessalonians 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To abstain from every form of evil is to recognize the distinction between the highest part of our being, the immortal and responsible soul, and the lower animal soul that contains passions and desires shared with animals. The context, however, speaks not of abstaining from evil appearances within ourselves but rather from evil appearances in others. We must hold ourselves aloof from every evil appearance or form, even those that may seem good at first glance. Evil has a way of showing itself even in spiritual gifts, including prophecy. Therefore, we must be cautious and abstain from everything that even looks like evil, for appearances can be deceiving.
