# 1 Thessalonians 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are urged to abstain from every form of evil, not only within ourselves but also from evil appearances in others. While there may be cases where we do not need to abstain from what appears to be evil but is actually good, we must exercise caution and distance ourselves from any evil appearance. This includes being discerning about prophetic words and spiritual gifts, as evil can manifest even in these areas. By being attentive and avoiding anything that carries the appearance of evil, we can prevent stumbling and offense.
