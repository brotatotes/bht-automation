### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is always proper to pray that God would make his people entirely holy. A prayer for perfect sanctification, however, should not be adduced as a proof that it is in fact attained in the present life."
2. "The distinction between the animal life and the mind of man...was often made by the ancient philosophers...Whether the apostle meant to sanction this view, or merely to speak in common and popular language, may indeed be questioned, but there seems to be a foundation for the language in the nature of man."
3. "By his praying that the 'body and the soul' - meaning here the animal nature, the seat of the affections and passions - might be kept holy, there is reference to the fact that, connected as they are with a rational and accountable soul, they may be the occasion of sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase God of peace only in Paul and Hebrews. See Romans 14:33; Romans 16:20; Philippians 4:9; Hebrews 13:20. The meaning is, God who is the source and giver of peace."
3. "Peace, in the Pauline sense, is not mere calm or tranquillity. It is always conceived as based upon reconciliation with God."
2. "God is the God of peace only to those who have ceased to be at war with him, and are at one with him. God's peace is not sentimental but moral."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul desires that God would perfect what is remaining. From this we infer, that we must, during our whole life, make progress in the pursuit of holiness."
2. "When he says, sanctify you wholly, he makes him the sole Author of the entire work."
3. "For then is the man pure and entire, when he thinks nothing in his mind, desires nothing in his heart, does nothing with his body, except what is approved by God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The God of peace."
2. "It called them to holiness, a sanctity of conduct from which no part of their life might be exempted, a sanctity of person in which their whole nature must partake."
3. "Language thus used should not be too closely analyzed. His words may be compared to similar expressions among ourselves, e.g., 'with my heart and soul.' Who would distinguish between the two?'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The believer has the Holy Spirit of God, the renewed spirit of man."
3. "There is to be no deficiency in any part. Î¤ÎµÎ»ÎµÎ¹Î¿Ï‚ means final perfection."

### John Gill:
1. "wherefore he applies to the throne of grace, and addresses God as 'the God of peace'; so called, because of the concern he has in peace and reconciliation made by the blood of Christ, and because he is the giver of peace of conscience, and the author of peace, concord, and unity among the saints, and of all happiness and prosperity, both in this world, and in that which is to come" 
2. "The apostle prays may be preserved blameless; not that he thought they could be kept from sinning entirely in thought, word, or deed; but that they might be preserved in purity and chastity from the gross enormities of life, and be kept from a total and final falling away, the work of grace be at last completed on the soul and spirit, and the body be raised in incorruption, and glory; and both at the coming of Christ be presented faultless, and without blame"
3. "Sanctification is a progressive, gradual work, it is like seed cast into the earth, which springs up, first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear, and is as light, which shines more and more to the perfect day."

### John Wesley:
1. "And may the God of peace sanctify you â€” By the peace he works in you, which is a great means of sanctification."
2. "The word signifies wholly and perfectly; every part and all that concerns you; all that is of or about you."
3. "Just before he said you; now he denominates them from their spiritual state."
