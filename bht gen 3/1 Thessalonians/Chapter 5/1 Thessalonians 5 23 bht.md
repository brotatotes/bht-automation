## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the God of peace Himself"; who can do for you by His own power what I cannot do by all my monitions, nor you by all your efforts..."
2. "(so that you should be) perfect in every respect."
3. "the prayer shows what the title 'God of peace' implies."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A prayer for perfect sanctification, however, should not be adduced as a proof that it is in fact attained in the present life."
2. "By his praying that the 'body and the soul' - meaning here the animal nature, the seat of the affections and passions - might be kept holy, there is reference to the fact that, connected as they are with a rational and accountable soul, they may be the occasion of sin."
3. "For a cur to snarl and growl; for a lion to roar and rage; for a hyena to be fierce and untameable; for a serpent to hiss and bite, and for the ostrich to leave her eggs without concern... involves no blame, no guilt for them, for they are not accountable; but for man to evince the same temper, and the same want of affection, does involve guilt."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peace, in the Pauline sense, is not mere calm or tranquillity. It is always conceived as based upon reconciliation with God." 
2. "God is the God of peace only to those who have ceased to be at war with him, and are at one with him." 
3. "The God of peace is the sanctifier. 'Peace' is habitually used, both in the Old and New Testaments, in connection with the messianic salvation."

### John Calvin:
1. "From this we infer, that we must, during our whole life, make progress in the pursuit of holiness."
2. "When he is kept entire, or pure, and unpolluted, in spirit, soul, and body, until the day of Christ."
3. "For then is the man pure and entire, when he thinks nothing in his mind, desires nothing in his heart, does nothing with his body, except what is approved by God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Perhaps the title varies slightly in meaning according to the context in which it is found; sometimes pointing rather to the inward peace which the all-seeing and self-reliant God ever enjoys, sometimes again rather to the communication of this quality to His creatures by bringing them into harmony with Himself and with one another."
2. "The members of the Thessalonian Church were not to suppose that this new religion they professed consisted merely or mainly in certain rites or observances. It called them to holiness, a sanctity of conduct from which no part of their life might be exempted, a sanctity of person in which their whole nature must partake."
3. "'Had he a distinct thought attached to each of these words? Probably not. He is not writing a treatise on the soul, but pouring forth from the fulness of his heart a prayer for his converts. Language thus used should not be too closely analyzed. His words may be compared to similar expressions among ourselves, e.g., 'with my heart and soul.' Who would distinguish between the two?'(Jowett)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The God of peace... gladly bestows [peace]." 
2. "Here alone in N.T. Here it means the whole of each of you, every part of each of you, 'through and through.'" 
3. "The believer has the Holy Spirit of God, the renewed spirit of man... Be preserved entire... complete in all its parts."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle prays them: â€˜God would sanctify them wholly; or "all of you"â€™. These persons were sanctified by the Spirit of God, but not perfectly; the Gospel was come to them in power, and had wrought effectually in them, and they were turned from idols to serve the living God, and had true faith, hope, and love, implanted in them, and which they were enabled to exercise in a very comfortable and commendable manner; but yet this work of grace and sanctification begun in them was far from being perfect".
2. "Sanctified persons are first as newborn babes, and then they grow up to be young men, and at last become fathers in Christ; and this work being begun, is carried on, and will be performed, fulfilled, and made perfect: and it is God's work to do it; he begins, and he carries it on, and he will finish it; and therefore the apostle prays to him to do it".
3. "The apostle prays that they may be 'preserved blameless; not that he thought they could be kept from sinning entirely in thought, word, or deed; but that they might be preserved in purity and chastity from the gross enormities of life, and be kept from a total and final falling away, the work of grace be at last completed on the soul and spirit, and the body be raised in incorruption, and glory; and both at the coming of Christ be presented faultless, and without blame, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, first to himself, and then to his Father".

### John Wesley:
1. "And may the God of peace sanctify you â€” By the peace he works in you, which is a great means of sanctification."
2. "Wholly â€” The word signifies wholly and perfectly; every part and all that concerns you; all that is of or about you."
3. "And may the whole of you, the spirit and the soul and the body â€” Just before he said you; now he denominates them from their spiritual state."
