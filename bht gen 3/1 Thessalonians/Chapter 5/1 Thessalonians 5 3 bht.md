# 1 Thessalonians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sudden destruction which will come upon the unbelievers can be likened to the unexpected pain of labor that a woman experiences. Just as labor pains cannot be escaped, the unbelievers will in no way escape this judgment. When they are saying peace and safety, the destruction will come upon them suddenly and without warning. The vividness of this comparison serves as a warning to not become complacent and to be prepared, for the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night, catching them by surprise with no chance of escape.
