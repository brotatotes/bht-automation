# 1 Thessalonians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The coming day of the Lord will take the wicked by surprise, like a thief arriving when people are asleep. However, for those who eagerly watch and long for Him, His coming will not be a surprise; it will be anticipated, longed for, and welcome. Those who have accepted Christ's teachings and have faith in Him are not in darkness, but are children of light. They are awake, prepared, and will not be caught off guard when the day of the Lord comes.

2. "We, on the other hand, on whom Christ has shone by the faith of his gospel, differ much from them, for that saying of Isaiah is truly accomplished in us, that while darkness covers the earth, the Lord arises upon us, and his glory is seen in us."
3. "He calls them children of light, in accordance with the Hebrew idiom, as meaning â€” furnished with light; as also children of the day, meaning â€” those who enjoy the light of day."

3. "Those are â€˜in darknessâ€™ who have not accepted what Christ, the Light of the world, taught; who do not accept His life as their example, nor believe in those principles which it exemplifies."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  As a thief (Ï‰Ï‚ ÎºÎ»ÎµÏ€Ï„Î·Ï‚). As in verse 1 Thessalonians 5:2, but A B Bohairic have ÎºÎ»ÎµÏ€Ï„Î±Ï‚ (thieves), turning the metaphor round. 


### John Gill:
1. "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness... they were not in the dark, but in the light, and so could see when the day of the Lord came..."
2. "that that day should overtake you as a thief... would not be surprised with it, as a man is seized with terror and fright, when laid hold on by a thief..."
