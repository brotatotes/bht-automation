# 1 Thessalonians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The distinction between darkness and light, which represents ignorance and moral slumber, is vividly depicted. Unbelievers are in darkness, whereas believers are not. In contrast to those in darkness, the enlightened believers understand the meaning of the day and await the day of the Lord's coming. Unpreparedness is likened to being caught off guard by a thief, while the faithful are to be on their watch, fully aware and hastening to the coming of the day of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in darkness refers back to 'in the night' aboveâ€”in the ignorance and moral slumber of the world which knows not God." 
2. "The DAYâ€”the meaning of the day as distinguished from the darkness being brought out, and the day being put in the place of emphasis accordingly." 
3. "That this is so, is plain from what follows, ver. 5."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not in darknessâ€”not in darkness of understanding (that is, spiritual ignorance) or of the moral nature (that is, a state of sin)." 
2. "That dayâ€”the day of the Lord, in contrast to 'darkness.'"
3. "Overtakeâ€”unexpectedly, as (the daylight overtakes) thieves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief." 
2. "So, says the apostle, the Lord will come to the wicked. They are like those who are asleep when the thief comes upon them." 
3. "They could see his approach, and could prepare for it, so that it would not take them by surprise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A thief." Tischendorf, Weiss, and Rev. T. retain this reading.
2. "Westcott and Hort read kleptav thieves, but with klepthv in margin."

### John Calvin:
1. "No darkness is more dense than ignorance of God."
2. "It were an unseemly thing that we should be caught by Christ asleep, as it were, or seeing nothing, while the full blaze of light is shining forth upon us."
3. "We have not been enlightened by the Lord with a view to our walking in darkness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is nothing appalling to the Christian, in the suddenness of the Lordâ€™s coming, for to those who are waiting and longing for Him, He cannot come as a thief and find them unprepared."
2. "Those are â€˜in darknessâ€™ who have not accepted what Christ, the Light of the world, taught; who do not accept His life as their example, nor believe in those principles which it exemplifies."
3. "And as he needs and counts on this darkness for the fulfilment of all his schemes and hopes, the return of Christ to enforce the principles He revealed in His first coming is distasteful, unreckoned on, destructive."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  As a thief (Ï‰Ï‚ ÎºÎ»ÎµÏ€Ï„Î·Ï‚). As in verse 1 Thessalonians 5:2, but A B Bohairic have ÎºÎ»ÎµÏ€Ï„Î±Ï‚ (thieves), turning the metaphor round. 


### John Gill:
1. "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness...and therefore knew that the day of the Lord comes as above described..." 
2. "but these saints were not in the dark, but in the light, and so could see when the day of the Lord came..." 
3. "since they would be, or at least should be on their watch, and be looking out for, and hasting to the coming of the day of God."

### John Wesley:
