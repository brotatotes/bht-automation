# 1 Thessalonians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we have no reason to fear or be surprised by the coming of the day of the Lord. We are sons of light and day, having our origin from the light and belonging to it in character. We are not of night nor darkness. Therefore, we should always be wakeful and active, expecting the coming of the Redeemer so that we will not be caught off guard. We are the children of light, produced by the light and living in it as our element.
