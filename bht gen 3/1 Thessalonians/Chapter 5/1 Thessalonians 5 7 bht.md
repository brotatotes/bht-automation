# 1 Thessalonians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, our conduct should be in the open and not require the veil of night. Sleeping during the day and being drunk during the day are signs of indolence and shamelessness, unfit for those who profess to be day people. Nighttime is when drunken revelries occur, but as children of the day, we should not partake in such behavior. Instead, we should be watchful and productive, fulfilling our duties in the light of day, letting our actions bear scrutiny.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: As Christians, we are called to be day people, not night people. Our conduct should always be such that it can be seen in the light of day, without the need for the cover of darkness. Sleeping during the day implies laziness, while being drunk during the day implies shamelessness. Both of these behaviors are not fitting for those who belong to the day and the light. Nighttime is when people typically engage in drunken revelries, but as Christians, we should not partake in such activities. We should be awake and alert, ready to fulfill our duties in the light of day. Let us not be found asleep or unfit for any duty, but instead, let us be watchful and productive, honoring the call to be children of the day and the light, and not of the night and darkness.
