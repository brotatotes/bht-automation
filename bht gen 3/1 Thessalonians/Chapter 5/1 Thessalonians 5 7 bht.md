# 1 Thessalonians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, our conduct should reflect the light of day and not be associated with the darkness of night. We should not engage in behaviors like drunkenness that are works of darkness and signify indulgence and shamelessness. Instead, we are called to be awake, alert, and actively involved in actions that honor and glorify God. Nighttime is typically the time for sleep and drunken revelries, but as children of the light, our actions should be exemplary and worthy of being seen and scrutinized by all.
