## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice, that these arms are defensive only, as against a sudden attackâ€”and belong therefore not so much to the Christianâ€™s conflict with evil, as (from the context) to his guard against being surprised by the day of the Lord as a thief in the night." 
2. "The best defences against such a surprise are the three great Christian graces, Faith, Hope, Love,â€”which are accordingly here enumerated."
3. "We must not perhaps press minutely the meaning of each part of the armour, in the presence of such variation in the two passages."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith, as the motive within, and love, exhibited in outward acts, constitute the perfection of righteousness."
2. "In Ephesians 6:17 the helmet is 'salvation'; here, 'the hope of salvation.'"
3. "Our Head primarily wore the 'breastplate of righteousness' and 'helmet of salvation,' that we might, by union with Him, receive both."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But let us, who are of the day, be sober - Temperate, as people usually are in the daytime."
