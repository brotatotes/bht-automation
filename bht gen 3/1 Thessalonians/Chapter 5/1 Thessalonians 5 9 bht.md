## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For God set us not to wrath, but to acquisition of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "Who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live, &c."
3. "Our Lord died for us, that whether we watch or sleep we should live."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "set" (Acts 13:47), in His everlasting purpose of love (1 Thessalonians 3:3; 2 Timothy 1:9). Contrast Romans 9:22; Judges 1:4.
2. "to the acquisition of salvation"; said, according to BENGEL, Of One saved out of a general wreck, when all things else have been lost: so of the elect saved out of the multitude of the lost (2 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Thessalonians 2:14).
3. The fact of God's "appointment" of His grace "through Jesus Christ" (Ephesians 1:5), takes away the notion of our being able to "acquire" salvation of ourselves. Christ "acquired (so the Greek for 'purchased') the Church (and its salvation) with His own blood" (Ephesians 1:5- :); each member is said to be appointed by God to the "acquiring of salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The wish of God is to save us, and therefore we should watch and be sober; we should take to ourselves the whole of the Christian armor, and strive for victory."
2. "The hope of a final triumph should animate us in our efforts, and cheer us in our struggles with our foes."
3. "If we are Christians, we know that he intends our salvation, and that victory will be ours; if we are willing to become Christians, we know that the Almighty arm will be stretched out to aid us, and that the 'gates of hell' cannot prevent it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Special emphasis is laid on the hope of salvation."
2. "The exhortation to put it on is enforced by the fact that God's appointment is to salvation and not to wrath."
3. "The meaning here is that we might obtain."

### John Calvin:
1. "The passage...might be explained...that we must put on the helmet of salvation, because God wills not that we should perish, but rather that we should be saved...but...he has in view something farther."
2. "Paul, undoubtedly, does not mean that God has called us, that we may procure salvation for ourselves, but that we may obtain it, as it has been acquired for us by Christ."
3. "Paul, however, encourages believers to fight strenuously, setting before them the certainty of victory; for the man who fights timidly and hesitatingly is half-conquered."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God hath not appointed us to wrath." 
2. "The 'wrath' spoken of is the manifestation of the Divine anger against sin in the coming and judgment of Christ."
3. "To obtain salvation. Other passages extend the meaning of 'salvation,' but here the leading idea in the apostle's mind is escape from the destruction with which the unbelieving world was to be visited; though this involves, as he immediately shows, life with Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We are to keep awake so as to fulfil God's purpose in calling us." 
2. "That is our hope of final victory (salvation in this sense)."

### John Gill:
1. "For God hath not appointed us to wrath,.... To destruction and ruin, the effect of wrath; though there are some that are vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction, of old ordained to condemnation, and who are reserved for the day of evil; but there are others who are equally children of wrath, as deserving of the wrath of God in themselves as others, who are not appointed to it; which is an instance of wonderful and distinguishing grace to them."
2. "salvation is alone by Christ, he alone has wrought it out; it is in him, and in no other; he was appointed to this work, was called and sent, and came to do it, and has done it"
3. "and God's elect, who were chosen in him, are appointed in the counsel and purpose of God, to obtain, possess, and enjoy this salvation; and which, as this appointment may be known, as it was by these Thessalonians; the Gospel having come to them, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as it is an encouragement to faith and hope, so it excites to sobriety and watchfulness, and the discharge of every duty."

### John Wesley:
1. God hath not appointed us to wrath â€” As he hath the obstinately impenitent.
