## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No stealing of a man's goods can equal in atrocity the stealing of a man's liberty."
2. "Slavery is not directly assailed in the New Testament to have done so would have been to revolutionize violently the existing order of things."
3. "Gospel grace is the only true means of sanctification as well as of justification."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It properly means one who steals another for the purpose of making him a slave - a kidnapper. This is the common way in which people are made slaves... None become slaves voluntarily, and consequently the whole process of making slaves partakes of the nature of theft of the worst kind."
2. "The guilt of manstealing is incurred essentially by those who purchase those who are thus stolen - as the purchaser of a stolen horse, knowing it to be so, participates in the crime. A measure of that criminality also adheres to all who own slaves, and who thus maintain the system - for it is a system known to have been originated by theft."
3. "If there is anything else that is opposed to the instruction which the law of God gives."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Menstealers [Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒπœÉœÑŒ±ŒπœÇ] . N. T. o. Once in LXX Ellicott remarks that this is a repulsive and exaggerated violation of the eighth commandment, as ajrsenokoitein is of the seventh." 
2. "To be sound in the faith is, practically, to follow [œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏ŒµŒπŒΩ] sound teaching or the truth."
3. "The contents of this sound teaching which is according to godliness are not theoretical or dogmatic truth, but Christian ethics, with faith and love."

### John Calvin:
1. "First, he speaks of violence as manifested by manslayers and murderers of parents; secondly, he describes shameful uncleanness; and thirdly, he comes down to dishonesty and other crimes."
2. "Sound doctrine is contrasted with frivolous questions about which he says (1 Timothy 6:3) that foolish teachers are in an unhealthy condition and which, on account of the effect produced by them, are called diseased."
3. "For inquisitive and ambitious persons are always in a diseased state; they have no health in them they are like those unhappy patients who have lost their appetite, and who suck and lick, but cannot receive any nourishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sins against the seventh commandment, recognising the true division of natural and unnatural vices ('defilers of themselves with males'), came first..."
2. "It is significant that no reference is made (as in Romans 13:9) to the tenth commandment. The apostle prefers resting his case upon concrete evil acts, and does not enter on the less tangible region of desires."
3. "What it marks out is the tendency of the true doctrine to a healthy spiritual state, of all departure from the truth to a state morbid and unhealthy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By the use of this word Paul deals a blow at the slave-trade."
2. "Liars... False swearers."
3. "The healthful teaching."

### John Gill:
1. "For whoremongers,.... Fornicators and adulterers, who were transgressors of the seventh command, these God will judge..."
2. "for them that defile themselves with mankind; who are guilty of sodomy...the wrath of God was revealed from heaven in a very visible and remarkable manner against this abomination..."
3. "...whatever is repugnant to the Gospel is liable to be punished by the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "Manstealers - The worst of all thieves, in comparison of whom, highwaymen and housebreakers are innocent." 
2. "What then are most traders in negroes, procurers of servants for America, and all who list soldiers by lies, tricks, or enticements?"
