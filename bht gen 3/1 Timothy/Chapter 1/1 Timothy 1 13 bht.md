2. "Because I did it ignorantly. From one point of view St. Paul looked upon his past state as one in which he had been as ‚Äòthe chief of sinners.‚Äô Yet, on the other hand, his eyes had not been opened, he had not sinned wilfully against a light clearly seen, and so the sin was one of ignorance leading to unbelief; and thus mercy, though he could not claim it as deserved, was still possible."
3. "And the view which he thus took of God‚Äôs dealings with himself enlarged his sympathies and made him more hopeful for others. We cannot fail to hear the echoes of his own experience when he speaks of ‚Äòthe times of ignorance which God winked at.‚Äô
