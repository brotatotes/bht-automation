# 1 Timothy 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If one's religion better not his morals, his moral deficiencies will corrupt his religion. The rain which falls pure from heaven will not continue pure if it be received in an unclean vessel. Though the apostles had the power of excommunication, accompanied with bodily inflictions, it does not follow that fallible ministers now have any power, save that of excluding from church fellowship notorious bad livers. This severe discipline of apostolic authority, apparently exclusion and more than mere abandonment, was to teach them not to blaspheme.

3. "That being chastised, corrected, or disciplined, they might not blaspheme, as they had before done; either by words, contradicting, reviling, and scoffing at the doctrine of the resurrection; or by their unbecoming lives and conversations, giving themselves great liberty in sinning."

### John Wesley:
1. "I have delivere to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."

- Attempt 1 BHT: If one's religion fails to improve their morals, their moral deficiencies will corrupt their religion. Just as rain that is pure from heaven will not remain pure if received in an unclean vessel, so too will faith become tainted when held by those who engage in sinful behavior. While the apostles possessed the power of excommunication and bodily inflictions, this does not imply that fallible ministers today hold the same authority. However, they do possess the power to exclude notorious wrongdoers from church fellowship. In the case at hand, the individuals mentioned were the chief wreckers of faith in Ephesus. This severe discipline, possibly including exclusion and abandonment, was meant to teach them not to blaspheme. Blasphemous teachings and impure lives undermined the faith and were seen as reproachful to God. It is crucial to hold views about God that are not offensive to Him, as even unexpressed thoughts can lead to blasphemy in the heart.
