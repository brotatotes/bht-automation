## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Listen to his kind consideration, how he does not make use of the force of a master, but rather of a servant: he says not ‚ÄòI enjoined, nor ‚ÄòI commanded,‚Äô nor ‚ÄòI recommended,‚Äô but ‚ÄòI besought thee.‚Äô"
2. "The indefinite pronoun is more probably slightly contemptuous: see Jude 4, and Gal. ii, 12."
3. "The sentence begins As I exhorted thee, &c., but in his negligence of writing, the Apostle does not finish the construction."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Timothy's superintendence of the Church at Ephesus was as locum tenens for the apostle, and so was temporary."
2. "If, then, as the balance of arguments seems to favor, this Epistle was written subsequently to Paul's first imprisonment, the apparent discrepancy between his prophecy and the event may be reconciled."
3. "The indefinite pronoun is slightly contemptuous as to them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus...Paul had been compelled to leave before he had completed what he had designed to do there."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "That they teach no other doctrine [ŒºŒ∑ ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ±œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒµŒπŒΩ] . Better, not to teach a different doctrine. For eterov different, see on Galatians 1:6."

### John Calvin:
1. "To keep what has been gained is not a smaller virtue than to make new acquisitions."
2. "He wishes to arm him with power to restrain others."

3. "Not to teach a different doctrine (ŒºŒ∑ ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ±œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒµŒπŒΩ). Earliest known use of this compound."

### John Gill:

2. "The apostle perhaps by other doctrine chiefly respects the doctrine of justification by the works of the law." 
3. "It seems as if there were some teachers in this place the apostle was suspicious of, or he had heard that they began to innovate in the doctrine of faith; wherefore he desires Timothy to continue a while, in order to be a check on these persons, and to charge them not to introduce any new doctrine."

### John Wesley:
