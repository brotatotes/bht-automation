## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Listen to his kind consideration, how he does not make use of the force of a master, but rather of a servant: he says not ‚ÄòI enjoined, nor ‚ÄòI commanded,‚Äô nor ‚ÄòI recommended,‚Äô but ‚ÄòI besought thee.‚Äô"
2. "The indefinite pronoun is more probably slightly contemptuous: see Jude 4, and Gal. ii, 12."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The first title of these overseers seems to have been 'angels'." 
2. "I cannot think with BIRKS, that this verse is compatible with his theory, that Paul did not actually visit Ephesus, though in its immediate neighborhood." 
3. "I besought‚Äîa mild word, instead of authoritative command, to Timothy, as a fellow helper."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word charge here - œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒπŒªŒ∑œÇ parangeileÃÑs - seems to mean more than is commonly implied by the word as used by us."
2. "Paul expected soon to return to him again, and then they would proceed unitedly with their work."
3. "He was not to take the charge of a 'diocese,' or to ordain ministers of the 'second rank,' or to administer the rite of confirmation, or to perform acts of discipline."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An awkward construction, there being nothing to answer to kaqwv." 
2. "The charge is not to teach anything contrary to the sound teaching or irreconcilable with it." 
3. "The expression is contemptuous. It is assumed that Timothy knows who they are."

### John Calvin:
1. "To keep what has been gained is not a smaller virtue than to make new acquisitions."
2. "The word forbid denotes power; for Paul wishes to arm him with power to restrain others."
3. "For, as the truth of God is one, so is there but one plain manner of teaching it, which is free from false ornament, and which partakes more of the majesty of the Spirit than of the parade of human eloquence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To teach no other doctrine. Better 'no different (or strange) doctrine.' The first part of the word implies (as in 2 Corinthians 6:14) 'unequally yoked,' something discordant and out of harmony."
2. "That thou shouldest charge some. The undefined way in which St. Paul usually speaks of his Judaizing opponents and others whom he condemns."
3. "Hymen√¶us, Alexander, Philetus, are afterwards singled out for special mention."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To tarry (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒºŒµŒπŒΩŒ±). First aorist active infinitive of œÄœÅŒøœÉŒºŒµŒΩœâ, old verb, attributed by Luke to Paul in Acts 13:43."
2. "That thou mightest charge (ŒπŒΩŒ± œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒπŒªŒ∑ŒπœÇ). Subfinal clause with ŒπŒΩŒ± and the first aorist active subjunctive of œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒªœâ, old verb, to transmit a message along (œÄŒ±œÅŒ±) from one to another."
3. "Certain men (œÑŒπœÉŒπŒΩ). Dative case. Expressly vague (no names as in 1 Timothy 1:20), though Paul doubtless has certain persons in Ephesus in mind."

### John Gill:
1. "than the doctrine of Christ and his apostles; than what had been preached by the apostle at Ephesus, and the saints there had received; than what was agreeably to the Scriptures of truth, and was according to godliness..."
2. "nor would he have them teach in another way, in new words, but hold fast the form of sound words; for new words often produce new doctrines..."
3. "It seems as if there were some teachers in this place the apostle was suspicious of, or he had heard that they began to innovate in the doctrine of faith; wherefore he desires Timothy to continue a while, in order to be a check on these persons, and to charge them not to introduce any new doctrine..."

### John Wesley:
1. Charge some to teach no other doctrine ‚Äî Than I have taught. Let them put nothing in the place of it, add nothing to it.
