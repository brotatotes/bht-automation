# 1 Timothy 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The aim of the commandment is love, which arises from a pure heart‚Äîthe central point of life. It is not the feigned faith of the hypocrite, but true faith that works through love. Love is the sum and fulfillment of the law and the Gospel, and it requires a good conscience coupled with sincere faith. The goal of the commandment, then, is to cultivate love that springs from a heart purified by faith and is always accompanied by a good conscience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The end (purpose, aim) of the commandment is Love."
2. "Love... arising, springing from, as its place of birth‚Äîthe heart being the central point of life."

3. "A good conscience is joined with sound faith; a bad conscience with unsoundness in the faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The love which is genuine must proceed from a holy heart. The commandment was not designed to secure merely the outward expressions of love, but that which had its seat in the heart."
2. "Of course there can be no genuine love to God where the dictates of conscience are constantly violated, or where a man knows that he is continually doing wrong."
3. "All true love to God, such as this law would produce, must be based on confidence in him. Faith, then, is as necessary under the law as it is under the gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "The defense set up by them was not unlike that which is pleaded by those who, in the present day, subject the word of God to torture."
2. "If the law must be directed to this object, that we may be instructed in love, which proceeds from faith and a good conscience, it follows, on the other hand, that they who turn the teaching of it into curious questions are wicked expounders of the law."
3. "From this passage we also learn that there is no true love where there is not fear of God and uprightness of conscience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sum and substance to which all that 'charge' converged was not 'questioning' but love."
2. "We have here, as it were, the genesis of love, the three elements out of which it springs."
3. "The faith, which is not the hypocritical assent to a dogma, the unreal profession of a religion, but true trust in God as loving all men, and which therefore leads us in our turn to love all because He loves them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The end (œÑŒø œÑŒµŒªŒøœÇ). See Romans 6:21; Romans 10:4 for œÑŒµŒªŒøœÇ (the good aimed at, reached, result, end)." 
2. "Love (Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ∑). Not 'questionings.' Romans 13:9. 'Three conditions for the growth of love' (Parry): 'Out of a pure heart' (ŒµŒ∫ Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ¥ŒπŒ±œÇ, O.T. conception), 'and a good conscience' (Œ∫Œ± œÉœÖŒΩŒµŒπŒ¥Œ∑œÉŒµœâœÇ Œ±Œ≥Œ±Œ∏Œ∑œÇ, for which see Romans 2:25), 'and faith unfeigned' (Œ∫Œ± œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ Œ±ŒΩœÖœÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒπœÑŒøœÖ, late compound verbal in 2 Corinthians 6:6; Romans 12:9)."
