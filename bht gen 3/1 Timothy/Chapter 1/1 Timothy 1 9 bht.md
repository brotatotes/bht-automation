# 1 Timothy 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reason why the ten commandments have no power to condemn the Christian is not that they have no authority over him, but because Christ has fulfilled them as our surety. From the law comes ungodly and sinners, unholy and profane, murderers, manslayers. The purpose of the law was not to fetter the minds of the righteous, but to restrain the wicked from sin. No good man feels himself manacled by wholesome laws, and the law would not be needed but for the lawless element in men which needs correction.

3. "Esau is called bebhlov in Hebrews 12:16, as one who did not regard his birthright as sacred, but as something to be sold in order to supply a common need."

### John Calvin:
1. "A remarkable and striking instance of this is found in those who maintain the righteousness of works and defend free-will. They have continually in their mouth these words, 'Perfect holiness, merits, satisfactions;' but their whole life cries out against them, that they are outrageously wicked and ungodly, that they provoke in every possible way the wrath of God, and fearlessly set his judgment at naught."
2. "He takes for granted the well-known sentiment, that 'from bad manners have sprung good laws,' and maintains that the law of God was given in order to restrain the licentiousness of wicked men; because they who are good of their own accord do not need the authoritative injunction of the law."
3. "He therefore wished to repress the impudence of adversaries, who armed themselves with the name of 'the law' against godly men, whose whole life exhibits the actual role of the law, since they had very great need of the law, and yet did not care much about it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law would not be needed but for the lawless element in men which needs correction."
2. "The next four words, while expressing different shades of evil, have this in common, that they all speak of evil in its relation to God."
3. "In the strong words chosen to indicate the sins of deepest dye in each case, we may probably trace a righteous indignation at the sins of the Heathen world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is not made for (ŒøœÖ Œ∫ŒµŒπœÑŒ±). The use of Œ∫ŒµŒπœÑŒ± for œÑŒµŒ∏ŒµŒπœÑŒ± (perfect passive of œÑŒπŒ∏Œ∑Œº) is a common enough idiom." 
2. "Unruly (Œ±ŒΩœÖœÄŒøœÑŒ±Œ∫œÑŒøŒπœÇ). Dative (like all these words) of the late verbal (Œ± privative and œÖœÄŒøœÑŒ±œÉœÉœâ)."

### John Gill:

2. "it never was made with any such view as to obtain righteousness by it; for, a righteous man...need it not for such a purpose, because they are already righteous..."
3. "But for the lawless and disobedient...the law lies upon, and against such persons, as an accusing, terrifying, cursing, and condemning law."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law doth not lie against a righteous man."

3. "Against the ungodly and sinners, the unholy and profane."
