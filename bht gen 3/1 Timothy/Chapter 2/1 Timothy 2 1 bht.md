# 1 Timothy 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The duty of praying for all people, for Christ died for all, is emphasized in this passage. As the destruction of Jerusalem approached, some Jews blasphemed God's name by speaking evil of dignities, while others looked down on non-Christians. However, Paul urges us to pray for all, as the scope of prayer is universal. We are called to make supplications, prayers, intercessions, and give thanks for all kinds of sinners and saints. Prayer for the salvation of the whole world should not be regarded as secondary; it is a fundamental duty grounded in the merit of Jesus Christ.

"(1) entreaties rising out of want, danger, or distress; (2) requests for spiritual blessings; (3) intercessions on behalf of we desolate and oppressed, with an implied prayer against the wickedness of the oppressor; (4) thanksgiving, implying a prayer for the continuance of the blessing for which we give thanks."
