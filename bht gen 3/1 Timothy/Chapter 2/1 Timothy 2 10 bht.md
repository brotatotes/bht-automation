# 1 Timothy 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christian women should prioritize good works over outward adornment. The apostle Paul emphasizes that women should not use extravagant hair, jewelry, or expensive clothing to define their identity, but rather their godliness through good works. Modesty, self-control, and a sincere devotion to God should be the focus of their attire. Beyond just dressing appropriately, women should exemplify godliness through acts of kindness, charity, and humility. This combination of inner and outer adornment is what truly becomes women who profess godliness.
