# 1 Timothy 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Women must not usurp authority or act as autocrats over men, for Paul firmly speaks against it. While some aspects of this matter may not be fully expressed, it is clear that women should not exercise dominion over men. The question arises on whether this precept is universally applicable or subject to societal norms. However, women can still engage in teaching within their own homes and families, yet teaching in the church would be an act of authority that women should refrain from.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Women should not usurp authority over men or be autocrats, as Paul speaks authoritatively against this. Although there may be some unclear aspects, it is clear that women should not exercise dominance over men. It is important to note that the idea of suffering or allowing women to teach may vary depending on societal norms and what is considered appropriate. The argument for the precept being of permanent obligation is not strong, as it is based on what is considered becoming in society. However, women are still called to be teachers within their own homes and families. Ultimately, women teaching in the church would be an act of power and authority, which is reserved for those in superior roles. Women should not take on this authority but can teach in private settings.
