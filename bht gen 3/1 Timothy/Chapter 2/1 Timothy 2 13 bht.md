# 1 Timothy 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Adam was first made, then Eve. This precept is based on the original order of creation. Adam was first in comparison with Eve, who was created for him. The woman's subjection to man is according to the laws of nature and creation. The eternal and inviolable appointment of God is strikingly displayed in this order. Thus, woman was originally the inferior, and this subordination would have existed even if the fall had never occurred.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Adam being first in comparison with Eve is based on the original order of creation, with Adam being created before Eve. The first-tier commentary emphasizes that Adam was formed before Eve, pointing out that the Greek word used suggests molding or shaping, much like a potter working with clay. This order is not simply because of Adam's priority of existence but is supported by the circumstances of creation detailed in the book of Genesis. It is clear that the woman was created for the sake of the man and designed to occupy a subordinate role. The second-tier commentary underscores the importance of recognizing this order and not attempting to set it aside. The third-tier commentary further explains that the subjection of women to men is in line with the laws of nature and creation, existing even before the fall of humanity. Ultimately, it is evident that woman was originally created as the inferior to man.
