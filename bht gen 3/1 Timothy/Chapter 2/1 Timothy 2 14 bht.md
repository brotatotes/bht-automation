# 1 Timothy 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman, being last in being, was first in sin‚Äîindeed, she alone was deceived. The present state of transgression in which the woman, by sin, is constituted, arose from her originally having been seduced by deceit. She more easily deceives due to her vulnerability to being deceived. The woman's subjection is regarded as a consequence of her being deceived. Adam, on the other hand, was not deceived and willingly partook in the transgression. This highlights the woman's susceptibility to deception and her role in influencing others to sin.
