# 1 Timothy 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In spite of the trial of childbearing which she passes through, she shall be saved. The curse on women is transformed into a condition favorable to her salvation as she faithfully fulfills her role in childbearing and home duties. Though the specific saving virtue of childbearing is unclear, it is evident that a woman's unique function, with its own glory and dignity, plays a meaningful role in her salvation. She is not saved by means of childbearing, but in this particular function, by the grace of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The curse on the woman for her transgression was, 'In sorrow shalt thou bear children' [Gen. iii. 16]. Her childbearing is that in which the curse finds its operation."
2. "What then is here promised her? Not only exemption from that curse in its worst and heaviest effects: not merely that she shall safely bear children: but the Apostle uses the words 'shall be saved' purposely for their higher meaning."
3. "Just as that man should be saved through, as passing through, fire which is his trial, his hindrance in his way, in spite of which he escapes,â€”so she shall be saved, through, as passing through, her childbearing, which is her trial, her curse, her (not means of salvation, but) hindrance in the way of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In spite of the trial of childbearing which she passes through (as her portion of the curse, 'in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children'), she shall be saved."
2. "Moreover, I think it is implied indirectly that the very curse will be turned into a condition favorable to her salvation, by her faithfully performing her part in doing and suffering what God has assigned to her, namely, child-bearing and home duties, her sphere, as distinguished from public teaching, which is not hers, but man's."
3. "This may be an ulterior reference of the Holy Spirit in this verse; but the primary reference required by the context is the one above given. 'She shall be saved ([though] with childbearing),' that is, though suffering her part of the primeval curse in childbearing; just as a man shall be saved, though having to bear his part, namely, the sweat of the brow."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was necessary for him to state, and for her to know, that her place was secondary and subordinate, and he wished this truth ever to be kept in memory among Christians."
2. "Paul, then, would speak to her the language of consolation, and while he would have her occupy her proper place, he would have her feel that 'God was her Friend.'"
3. "The object of the apostle seems to be to guard against a possible construction which might be put on his words, that he did not regard the woman as in circumstances as favorable for salvation as those of man, or as if he thought that salvation for her was more difficult, or perhaps that she could not be saved at all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "She shall be saved is set over against hath fallen into transgression."
2. "It is difficult to see what is the peculiar saving virtue of childbearing."
3. "Sanctification. A Pauline word; but the triad, faith, love, sanctification, is unique in N. T."

### John Calvin:
1. "For these reasons he modifies what he had said by adding a consolation; for the Spirit of God does not accuse or reproach us, in order to triumph over us, when we are covered with shame, but, when we have been cast down, immediately raises us up."
2. "It is proper to observe that the good effect of this consolation is twofold. First, by the hope of salvation held out to them, they are prevented from falling into despair through alarm at the mention of their guilt. Secondly, they become accustomed to endure calmly and patiently the necessity of servitude, so as to submit willingly to their husbands, when they are informed that this kind of obedience is both profitable to themselves and acceptable to God."
3. "Even 'child-bearing' is obedience acceptable to God, only so far as it proceeds from faith and love. To these two he adds sanctification, which includes all the purity of life which becomes Christian women. Lastly follows sobriety, which he formerly mentioned, while he was speaking about dress; but now he extends it more widely to the other parts of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She shall be saved by the childbirth," i.e. by the seed of the woman, the incarnate Christ. It is scarcely credible that St. Paul, if he meant this, would have expressed it so obscurely."
2. "We may, I believe, see in this a kind of bold Luther-like way of stating that home life rather than public life, the functions of a mother rather than of a teacher, are appointed for her."
3. "The other graces, excellent as they are, require, each and all, to be coupled with the self-reverence, as contrasted with self-assertion, on which St. Paul is insisting."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Through the child-bearing... it is not clear that Paul does not have mostly in mind that child-bearing, not public teaching, is the peculiar function of woman with a glory and dignity all its own."
2. "That child-bearing... is the peculiar function of woman with a glory and dignity all its own."
3. "'She will be saved' in this function, not by means of it."

### John Gill:
1. "Notwithstanding she shall be saved....Not Eve, though no doubt she is saved...But rather any woman, particularly such as profess godliness, who shall be saved in childbearing." 
2. "and which must give an uneasy reflection to maidens, and women that never bore any; but rather the meaning is, that good women shall be saved, notwithstanding their bearing and bringing forth children in pain and sorrow, according to the original curse..." 
3. "The meaning of the words is, that there is salvation through the incarnate Messiah, for all sorts of persons; for all men and women who believe in him, with that faith which works by love, and shows itself in holiness and sobriety; provided that they continue herein."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet she â€” That is, women in general, who were all involved with Eve in the sentence pronounced." 
2. "Shall be saved in childbearing â€” Carried safe through the pain and danger which that sentence entails upon them for the transgression."
3. "Yea, and finally saved, if they continue in loving faith and holy wisdom."
