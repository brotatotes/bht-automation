## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Imitate God. If He willed all men to be saved, why then we ought to pray for all mankind. If He willeth all to be saved, do thou will it too; and if thou willest it, pray. For prayer is the utterance of the will."
2. "God willeth all men to be saved: to accept the offered salvation. On this even Godâ€™s predestination is contingent."
3. "This realization of the truth is in fact identical with salvation, not only as that salvation is a rescue from life in untruth, but in its deepest and widest sense of salvation, here and hereafter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Since He wishes that all should be saved, do you also wish it; and if you wish it, pray for it. For prayer is the instrument of effecting such things." 
2. "Paul does not say, 'He wishes to save all'; for then he would have saved all in matter of fact; but 'will have all men to be saved,' implies the possibility of man's accepting it or rejecting it." 
3. "Our prayers ought to include all, as God's grace included all."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God wills that all people should be saved. It would be in accordance with his benevolent nature. He has made ample provision for it."
2. "This verse proves that salvation is provided for all - for if God wished all people to be saved, he would undoubtedly make provision for their salvation."
3. "If God wishes it, and has made provision for it, and they are not saved, the sin must be their own - and it is a great sin, for there is no greater crime which a man can commit than to destroy his own soul, and to make himself the eternal enemy of his Maker."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prayer to God for all is acceptable to him because he wills the salvation of all." 
2. "Epignwsiv [knowledge] signifies advanced or full knowledge, always of the knowledge of things ethical or divine, and never ascribed to God." 
3. "The logical relation in the writer's mind between salvation and the knowledge of the truth is not quite clear. Knowledge of the truth may be regarded as the means of salvation, or it may be the ideal goal of the whole saving work."

### John Calvin:
1. "Lastly, he demonstrates that God has at heart the salvation of all, because he invites all to the acknowledgment of his truth."
2. "In short, as the calling is a proof of the secret election, so they whom God makes partakers of his gospel are admitted by him to possess salvation."
3. "Now the duty arising out of that love which we owe to our neighbor is, to be solicitous and to do our endeavor for the salvation of all whom God includes in his calling, and to testify this by godly prayers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No assertion of the universal love of God can be more clear than this."
2. "Men were tempted to draw a line of demarcation in their prayers, and could hardly bring themselves to pray for a Nero or a Tigellinus."
3. "The nature of the 'salvation' is expressed in the words that stand as in opposition with it. It is found in the 'knowledge' mil and deep, more than the mere gnosis of the understanding, of the truth which is eternal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God's wish and will in so far as he can influence men." 
2. "The full knowledge" 
3. "Paul is anxious as in Colossians and Ephesians that the Gnostics may not lead the people astray."

### John Gill:
1. "The will of God, that all men should be saved, is not a conditional will, or what depends on the will of man, or on anything to be performed by him, for then none might be saved; and if any should, it would be of him that willeth, contrary to the express words of Scripture; but it is an absolute and unconditional will respecting their salvation, and which infallibly secures it."
2. "The will of God, the sovereign and unfrustrable will of God, has the governing sway and influence in the salvation of men; it rises from it, and is according to it; and all who are saved God wills they should be saved; nor are any saved, but whom he wills they should be saved."
3. "God would have all men, or all sorts of men, saved; and particularly the Gentiles may be designed, who are sometimes called the world, the whole world, and every creature; whom God would have saved, as well as the Jews, and therefore Heathens, and Heathen magistrates, were to be prayed for as well as Jewish ones."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who willeth seriously all men - Not a part only, much less the smallest part." 
2. "To be saved â€” Eternally."
3. "To the knowledge of the truth â€” Which brings salvation."
