# 1 Timothy 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the unity of God, we can understand the acceptableness of prayer for all men. The one God is common to all, and through the one Mediator, Christ Jesus, we have access to God. He is the only go-between, serving as a middle person between God and men. As the man Christ Jesus, He took on our human nature and became the second Head of humanity, offering His mediation for the whole human race. In Him, we are reconciled to the Father and can approach God with confidence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (further grounding of the acceptableness of prayer for all men,‚Äîin the UNITY of God. But this verse is joined by the for directly to the preceding, not to ver. 1... He is ONE in essence and one in purpose‚Äînot of different minds to different nations or individuals, but of one mind towards all."
2. "ONE Mediator... the only go-between, in whatever sense... if one only goes between, then that One must be for all."
3. "Christ Jesus [himself] man... He gathered up all our human nature into Himself, becoming its second Head, So that the assertion that He is man, in fact carries with it the very strongest proof of that which he is maintaining."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For there is one God‚ÄîGod's unity in essence and purpose is a proof of His comprehending all His human children alike in His offer of grace." 
2. "The one God is common to all. The one Mediator is mediator between God and all men potentially." 
3. "They who have not this one God by one Mediator, have none: literally, a 'go-between.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever love there was in giving the Mediator at all, was love for all the race; whatever can be argued from that about the interest which God has in man, is proof of his interest in the race at large." 
2. "There is not one for kings and another for their subjects; one for the rich and another for the poor; one for the master and another for the slave. All are on the same level, and the servant may feel that, in the gift of a Mediator, God regarded him with the same interest that he did his master."
3. "Prayer offered to the 'saints,' or to the 'Virgin,' is idolatry, and at the same time removes the one great Mediator from the office which he alone holds, of making intercession with God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The universality of the grace is grounded in the unity of God." 
2. "One divine purpose for all implies one God who purposes." 
3. "The man Christ Jesus. The phrase only here."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is one God who justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith."
2. "Since... he expressly mentions the Mediator, through whom they that were afar off now approach."
3. "The man Christ... who gently invites us, and takes us, as it were, by the hand, in order that the Father... may be reconciled by him and rendered friendly to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is one God...the Unity of the Godhead implies oneness of purpose, unchanging and unvarying."
2. "The thought that 'God is one' suggests that of a Mediator...the New Covenant also has a 'Mediator,' one who is identified with both parties."
3. "If one only, and that as being 'a man,' then his mediation must be for all humanity, and the whole human race has been redeemed by him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One God (ŒµŒπœÇ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÇ). Regular Pauline argument for a universal gospel (Galatians 3:20; Romans 3:30; Ephesians 4:6)."
2. "One mediator (ŒµŒπœÇ ŒºŒµœÉŒπœÑŒ∑œÇ). Late word (Polybius, Philo) from ŒºŒµœÉŒøœÇ (middle), a middle man. In N.T. only here, Galatians 3:20; Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:15; Hebrews 12:24."
3. "Between God and men (Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ± Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄœâŒΩ). Ablative case (though objective genitive may explain it) after ŒºŒµœÉŒπœÑŒ∑œÇ (notion of separation) as in Romans 10:12; Hebrews 5:14."

### John Gill:
1. "There is but one God, who is the Creator of all men, and who, in a providential way, is the Saviour of all men; and in a way of special grace is the one God, the one covenant God of all sorts of men, of Jews and Gentiles."
2. "Christ stands as a middle person, a daysman between [God and his elect], and lays his hands upon them both; has to do with things pertaining to the glory of God, and makes reconciliation for the sins of the people; brings them that were afar off nigh to God, and makes peace for them by the blood of his cross."
3. "He who is the Mediator between God and man, has assumed a nature which is common to them all: and this Mediator is said to be one, not so much in opposition to other mediators, angels or saints departed, though it is a truth, and stands full against them, but with respect to men."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is one God ‚Äî And they who have not him, through the one Mediator, have no God."
2. "One mediator also ‚Äî We could not rejoice that there is a God, were there not a mediator also; one who stands between God and men, to reconcile man to God, and to transact the whole affair of our salvation."
3. "The man ‚Äî Therefore all men are to apply to this mediator, 'who gave himself for all.'"
