## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I will then that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands."
2. "Those hands are holy, which have not surrendered themselves as instruments of evil desire."
3. "Without wrath and disputation, i.e. in tranquillity and mutual peace."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The emphasis, however, is not on this, but on the precept of praying."
2. "The early Christians turned up their palms towards heaven, as those craving help do."
3. "This (or at least the contrite desire to be so) is a needful qualification for effectual prayer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not merely in the temple, or in other sacred places, but in all places...Christianity teaches that God may be worshipped in any place, and that we are at all times equally near him." 
2. "When men approach God they should do it in a pure and holy manner."
3. "Prayer was to be offered in a calm, serious, sober state of mind, and they who engaged in polemical strife, or in warm contention of any kind, are little fitted to unite in the solemn act of addressing God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul's word is 'I will'." 
2. "The phrase is unique in N. T. o LXX among Orientals the lifting up of the hands accompanied taking an oath, blessing, and prayer."
3. "Prayer, according to our writer, is to be without the element of sceptical criticism, whether of God's character and dealings, or of the character and behavior of those for whom prayer is offered."

### John Calvin:
1. "In every place... there is now no difference between Gentile and Jew, between Greek and barbarian, because all in common have God as their Father; and in Christ is now fulfilled what Malachi had foretold, that not only in Judea, but throughout the whole world, pure sacrifices are offered."
2. "Let us therefore learn that the attitude is in accordance with true godliness, provided that it be attended by the corresponding truth which is represented by it, namely, that, having been informed that we ought to seek God in heaven, first, we should form no conception of Him that is earthly or carnal; and, secondly, that we should lay aside carnal affections, so that nothing may prevent our hearts from rising above the world."
3. "For my part, I acknowledge that both of these views are just; but when I take into consideration the context of this passage, I have no doubt that Paul had his eye on the disputes which arose out of the indignation of the Jews at having the Gentiles made equal to themselves, in consequence of which they raised a controversy about the calling of the Gentiles, and went so far as to reject and exclude them from the participation of grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The â€˜prayingâ€™ spoken of is not a mental act, but part of the public worship of the Church, and is therefore limited to the men." (Quote 1)
2. "It would seem as if the older attitude of prayer both among Jews and Greeks still obtained in the Christian Church. Men stood (as in Luke 18:11) and prayed with outstretched hands. Those hands were to be â€˜holy,â€™ uplifted in adoration, not in the vehemence of passion." (Quote 2)
3. "Stress is laid, not, as in James 1:6, on the necessity of faith in prayer, but on the inconsistency of the spirit of strife and debate with true worship." (Quote 3)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I desire (Î²Î¿Ï…Î»Î¿Î¼Î±). So Philippians 1:12."
2. "The men in contrast to 'women' (Î³Ï…Î½Î±Î¹ÎºÎ±Ï‚) in 1 Timothy 2:9."
3. "The point here is that only men should lead in public prayer who can lift up 'clean hands' (morally and spiritually clean)."

### John Gill:
1. "In this declaration of the apostle's will concerning prayer, he only takes notice of 'men'; not but that it is both the duty and privilege of women, as well as men, to pray in their houses and closets; but because he is speaking of public prayer in the church, which only belongs to men, he speaks only of them."
2. "And these hands must be holy and pure; there must be purity of heart, and cleanness of hands, or a freedom from any governing sin, which renders prayer unacceptable unto God."
3. "Without wrath and doubting; or reasoning, or disputation in a contentious way...both that and doubting, or disputation, may have regard to those heats and contentions that were between the Jews and Gentiles, which the apostle would have laid aside, and they join together in prayer, and in other parts of public worship, in love and peace."

### John Wesley:
1. "That men pray in every place â€” Public and private. Wherever men are, there prayer should be."
2. "Lifting up holy hands â€” Pure from all known sin."
3. "And every temper or motion of our soul that is not according to love is wrath. And doubting - Which is contrary to faith. And wrath, or unholy actions, or want of faith in him we call upon, are the three grand hinderances of God's hearing our petitions."
