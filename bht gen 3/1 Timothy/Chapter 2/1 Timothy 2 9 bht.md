## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In like manner also, I will that women adorn themselves in orderly apparel with shamefastness and self-restraint." 
2. "To change this into 'shamefaced' is to allow all the meaning and force of the word to run to the surface, to leave us ethically a far inferior word."
3. "The adorning which results from good works is brought about by their practice, not displayed by appearing to be invested with them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The context requires that we understand these directions as to women, in relation to their deportment in public worship, though the rules will hold good on other occasions also."
2. "Shamefacedness... that which is made fast by an honorable shame."
3. "Sobriety... the well-balanced state of mind arising from habitual self-restraint."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Religion does not forbid true adorning. It differs from the world only on the question what 'is' true ornament."
2. "There is no religion in a negligent mode of apparel, or in inattention to personal appearance - anymore than there is in wearing gold and pearls."
3. "The true idea here is, that her attention to her appearance should be such that she will be offensive to no class of persons; such as to show that her mind is supremely fixed on higher and more important things, and such as to interfere with no duty which she owes, and no good which she can do..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In modest apparel [ÎµÎ½ ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±ÏƒÏˆÎ¿Î»Î· ÎºÎ¿ÏƒÎ¼Î¹Ï‰] . Katastolh N. T. o. Once in LXX, Isaiah 61:3. Opinions differ as to the meaning. Some apparel, others guise or deportment = katasthma demeanour, Titus 2:3. There seems, on the whole, to be no sufficient reason for departing from the rendering of A. V. and Rev. 97 Kosmiw modest, seemly."
2. "Aidwv N. T. o. (aijdouv in Hebrews 12:28 is an incorrect reading)... It is the feeling of a suppliant or an unfortunate in the presence of those from whom he seeks aid; of a younger man toward an older and wiser one... Let the man who is restrained by aijscunh alone be insured against the outward disgrace which he fears his act will entail,. and he will refrain from it no longer."
3. "The words with shamefastness and sobriety may either be taken directly with adorn themselves, or better perhaps, as indicating moral qualities accompanying (meta with) the modest apparel. Let them adorn themselves in modest apparel, having along with this shamefastness and sobermindedness."

### John Calvin:
1. "That vice is â€” excessive eagerness and desire to be richly dressed." 
2. "He wishes therefore that their dress should be regulated by modesty and sobriety; for luxury and immoderate expense arise from a desire to make a display either for the sake of pride or of departure from chastity." 
3. "It would be great baseness to deny the appropriateness of modesty as the peculiar and constant ornament of virtuous and chaste women, or the duty of all to observe moderation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The rule is analogous to that of 1 Corinthians 11:5."
2. "The ethical habit expressed is that formed by acts of self-control over desire till the effort of control is no longer needed."
3. "A fashion was growing up of coming to the meetings of the disciples with all the outward tokens of wealth that belonged, as they thought, to their social status."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Adorn themselves... in modest apparel... with shamefastness... Sobriety."
2. "Not with braided hair... and gold... Or pearls... Or costly raiment."
3. "Old word... Old adjective... Old word, in N.T. only here, verse 1 Timothy 2:15, and Acts 26:15."

### John Gill:
1. "that women adorn themselves in modest apparel: the word rendered 'apparel' signifies a long robe, which reaches down to the feet; and the word translated 'modest' signifies that which is clean, neat, and decent, yea, beautiful and ornamental"
2. "it is right and proper, when dress is consistent with chastity, when it is not immodest and impudent, and more like the attire of a harlot than of a woman professing godliness; and when it is moderate as well as modest, and suitable to a person's age and station"
3. "such a dress may be justifiable at other seasons, the apostle judged it very improper at the time of public prayer, or at the time of public worship; seeing it might swell the heart of the wearer with pride, so as to forget herself and the business she was come about"

### John Wesley:
1. "With sobriety â€” Which, in St. Paul's sense, is the virtue which governs our whole life according to true wisdom."
2. "Not with curled hair, not with gold â€” Worn by way of ornament."
3. "Not with pearls â€” Jewels of any kind: a part is put for the whole."
