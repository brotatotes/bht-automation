## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It behoves then a bishop to be irreproachable, husband of one wife. He requires of them pre-eminent chastity, and abstinence from a licence which is allowed to other Christians."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faithful is the saying." A needful preface to what follows: for the office of a bishop or overseer in Paul's day, attended as it was with hardship and often persecution, would not seem to the world generally a desirable and 'good work.'"
2. "Desire‚Äîliterally, 'stretch one's self forward to grasp'; 'aim at': a distinct Greek verb from that for 'desireth.' What one does voluntarily is more esteemed than what he does when asked."
3. "Good work‚Äîliterally, 'honorable work.' Not the honor associated with it, but the work, is the prominent thought. He who aims at the office must remember the high qualifications needed for the due discharge of its functions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If a man desire - Implying that there would be those who would wish to be put into the ministry. The Lord, undoubtedly, by his Spirit, often excites an earnest and irrepressible desire to preach the gospel - a desire so strong, that he in whom it exists can be satisfied in no other calling."  
2. "The word rendered 'desire' here (ŒøÃìœÅŒµÃÅŒ≥œâ oregoÃÑ), denotes properly, 'to reach' or 'stretch out' - and hence to reach after anything, to long after, to try to obtain; Hebrews 11:16." 
3. "To apply the term to a pretended superior order of clergy, as designating their special office, is wholly to depart from the use of the word as it occurs in the Bible."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faithful is the saying."
2. "The word implies eagerness, but not of an immoderate or unchristian character."
3. "The fundamental idea of the sword is overseeing."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let these words, therefore, be received as a preface intended to point out the importance of the subject; for Paul now begins a new discourse about ordaining pastors, and appointing the government of the Church."
2. "But Paul speaks of a godly desire, by which holy men wish to employ that knowledge of doctrine which they possess for the edification of the Church."
3. "And if it turn out that, according to the lawful order; they are not called, let them know that such was the will of God, and let them not take it in that others have been preferred to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A true saying."
2. "The office of a bishop, or overseer, was not likely, at the time when St. Paul wrote, to be an object of worldly ambition."
3. "Hence the stimulus of a new motive was needed, and was found in the half-proverbial maxim which named the office, with all its labour and risk, as a goodly and noble work for a man to aim at."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Faithful is the saying (œÄŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ Œø ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ)."
2. "If a man seeketh (Œµ œÑŒπœÇ ŒøœÅŒµŒ≥ŒµœÑŒ±)."
3. "The office of a bishop (ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒ∑œÇ)."

### John Gill:
1. "The office of a bishop, elder, or pastor of a church, 'is a work', and a very laborious one; wherefore such are called labourers in the word and doctrine: it is not a mere title of honour, and a place of profit, but it is a business of labour and care; yet a good one, a famous and excellent one."
2. "It being an employment in things of the greatest excellency in themselves, and of the greatest usefulness for the good of men, and the honour of God; as the doctrines, ordinances, and discipline of the Gospel."
3. "And so must be excellently, honestly, pleasantly, and profitably a good work."

### John Wesley:
1. He desireth a good work ‚Äî An excellent, but laborious, employment.
