"there were doubtless deaconesses at Ephesus, such as Phoeligbe was at Cenchrea (Romans 16:1, "servant," Greek, "deaconess"), yet no mention is made of them in this Epistle if not here; whereas, supposing them to be meant here, the third chapter embraces in due proportion all the persons in the service of the Church."

2. "Not slanderers. The word so translated is that which commonly appears as the name of the devil, as the great slanderer and accuser of man and God."
