## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The women in like manner...are deaconesses...must be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."
2. "Slander being the vice to which the female sex is more addicted."
3. "Trusty in the distribution of the alms committed to them, and in all other ministrations."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Moreover, if the wives of the deacons were meant, there seems no reason for the omission of 'their' (not in the Greek)."
2. "Thus it appears he requires the same qualifications in female deacons as in deacons, only with such modifications as the difference of sex suggested."
3. "Faithful in all thingsâ€”of life as well as faith. Trustworthy in respect to the alms committed to them and their other functions, answering to 'not greedy of filthy lucre' in the case of the deacons."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason assigned for supposing that it does not refer to the wives of deacons, as such, is, that nothing is said of the qualifications of the wives of bishops - a matter of as much importance as that of the character of the wife of a deacon."
2. "No one can doubt that the character of a woman may be such, that it is not desirable that her husband should be an officer in the church. A bad woman ought not to be entrusted with any additional power or influence."
3. "Here it means that they should not be women who were in the habit of calumniating others, or aspersing their character. Mingling as they would with the church, and having an opportunity to claim acquaintance with many, it would be in their power, if they chose, to do great injury to the character of others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A Deacon whose wife is wanting in the qualities required in him, is not to be chosen."
2. "She would sustain an active relation to his office, and by her ministries would increase his efficiency."
3. "By frivolity, slander, or intemperance, [the wife] would bring him and his office into disrepute."

### John Calvin:
1. "Likewise the wives... must be aids to their husbands in their office; which cannot be, unless their behavior excel that of others." 
2. "Wives... must be aids to their husbands in their office." 
3. "Their behavior [as wives] must excel that of others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The absence alike of the article and the pronoun in the Greek, and the obvious parallelism with 1 Timothy 3:8 make it far more probable that St. Paul is speaking of the women who had a like work, the deaconesses of the Apostolic Church." 
2. "The functions of these deaconesses were probably analogous to those of their male colleagues: the distribution of alms to their own sex, caring for the sick, nursing orphan children, instructing female converts, and helping in the administration of their baptism." 
3. "The word translated as 'not slanderers' is that which commonly appears as the name of the devil, as the great slanderer and accuser of man and God. The Pastoral Epistles are the only part of the New Testament in which it appears in its generic sense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Women apparently 'women as deacons' and not women in general or just 'wives of deacons.'"
2. "Not slanderers. 'She-devils' in reality."
3. "Faithful in all things. Perhaps as almoners the deaconesses had special temptations."

### John Gill:
1. "Their business it was to visit the poor and sick sisters of the church, and take care of things belonging to them." 
2. "They must be...grave in speech, gesture, and dress, of an honest report, a good behaviour, and chaste conversation."
3. "As in the marriage bed, so with whatsoever else they are entrusted with in the family, and civil concerns of their husbands."

### John Wesley:
1. Faithful in all things â€” Both to God, their husbands, and the poor.
