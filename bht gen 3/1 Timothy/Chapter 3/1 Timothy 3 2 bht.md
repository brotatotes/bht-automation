## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Episcopacy was adopted in apostolic times as the most expedient form of government, being most nearly in accordance with Jewish institutions, and so offering the less obstruction through Jewish prejudices to the progress of Christianity."
2. "Though the Jews practiced polygamy, yet as he is writing as to a Gentile Church, and as polygamy was never allowed among even laymen in the Church, the ancient interpretation that the prohibition here is against polygamy in a candidate bishop is not correct. It must, therefore, mean that, though laymen might lawfully marry again, candidates for the episcopate or presbytery were better to have been married only once."
3. "The new man bears somewhat of a sacred festival character, incompatible with all confusion, disorder, excess, violence, laxity, assumption, harshness, and meanness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His conduct should be irreprehensible or irreproachable. Undoubtedly it means that if 'any' charge could be brought against him implying moral obliquity, he is not fit for the office."
2. "The marriage of a second wife, after the death of the first, is nowhere spoken of in the Scriptures as wrong... Marriage is as honorable for a minister of the gospel as for any other man."
3. "A minister of the gospel should be a finished gentleman in his manners, and there is no excuse for him if he is not... He should be an example and a pattern in all that goes to promote the welfare of mankind, and there are few things so easily acquired that are suited to do this, as refinement and gentility of manners."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Blameless [Î±Î½ÎµÏ€Î¹Î»Î·Î¼Ï€Ï„Î¿Î½] . Or without reproach : one who cannot be laid hold of [Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î±Î½ÎµÎ¹Î½] : who gives no ground for accusation."
2. "The last is probably meant. Much of the difficulty arises from the assumption that the Pastorals were written by Paul."
3. "The opposition to second marriage became very strong in the latter part of the second century. It was elevated into an article of faith by the Montanists."

### John Calvin:
1. "He wishes a bishop to be blameless...that he must not be marked by any infamy that would lessen his authority." 
2. "The only true exposition, therefore, is that of Chrysostom, that in a bishop he expressly condemns polygamy."
3. "In this way, he would not demand it as a thing necessary for them, but would only praise it as not inconsistent with the dignity of the office."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A bishop most be blameless. Literally, â€˜giving no handle to reproach, unassailable.â€™" 
2. "The husband of one wife." 
3. "Given to hospitality. The stress laid on this virtue here and in Titus 1:8, 1 Peter 4:9, Romans 12:13, Hebrews 13:2, rested mainly on the special trials to which the state of society exposed the early converts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The bishop (Ï„Î¿Î½ ÎµÏ€Î¹ÏƒÎºÎ¿Ï€Î¿Î½). The overseer...does not In the N.T. have the monarchical sense found in Ignatius of a bishop over elders."
2. "Without reproach (Î±Î½ÎµÏ€Î¹Î»Î·Î¼Ï€Ï„Î¿Î½)...irreproachable."
3. "Given to hospitality (Ï†Î¹Î»Î¿Î¾ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½)...in N.T. only here, Titus 1:8; 1 Peter 4:9."

### John Gill:
1. "A bishop then must be blameless" - He should be one without any notorious or flagitious crime, having a good reputation before men.
2. "The husband of one wife" - If married, he should have but one wife at a time, excluding polygamists or those who have divorced and remarried without valid reasons.
3. "Apt to teach" - Capable of interpreting the Scripture for the edification of others, communicating the truths of the Gospel effectively, and having a gift of elocution.

### John Wesley:
1. "Must be blameless â€” Without fault or just suspicion."
2. "The husband of one wife â€” This neither means that a bishop must be married, nor that he may not marry a second wife; which it is just as lawful for him to do as to marry a first, and may in some cases be his bounden duty."
3. "Vigilant, prudent â€” Lively and zealous, yet calm and wise."
