## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In like manner, the deacons must be grave, not of double speech, not addicted to much wine, not greedy of gain, holding the mystery of the faith in pure conscience." 
2. "That great objective truth which man of himself knows not, but which the Spirit of God reveals to the faithful."
3. "That revelation of the Person of Christ, their faith's mystery, they are to hold in pure conscience."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The deacons were chosen by the voice of the people. CYPRIAN [Epistle, 2.5] says that good bishops never departed from the old custom of consulting the people." 
2. "The deacons answer to the chazzan of the synagogue: the attendant ministers, or subordinate coadjutors of the presbyter... Their duty was to read the Scriptures in the Church, to instruct the catechumens in Christian truths, to assist the presbyters at the sacraments, to receive oblations, and to preach and instruct." 
3. "All gain is filthy (literally, 'base') which is set before a man as a by-end in his work for God... The deacon's office of collecting and distributing alms would render this a necessary qualification."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They should be men who by their serious deportment will inspire respect."
2. "They should be men who can be relied on for the exact truth of what they say, and for the exact fulfillment of their promises."
3. "Shall a minister of the gospel be less holy than they? Shall he have a feebler sense of the purity of his vocation?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Rare in Paul (Romans 8:26; 1 Corinthians 11:25). Frequent in Pastorals."
2. "Grave [σεμνους] . In Paul only Philippians 4:8."
3. "Double - tongued [διλογους] . N. T. o. o LXX, o Class. Saying one thing and meaning another, and making different representations to different people about the same thing."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is certain that the Apostle speaks of those who hold a public office in the Church; and this refutes the opinion of those who think that domestic servants are here meant."
2. "It ought to be carefully observed that he advises them not to be double-tongued; because it is a vice which it is difficult to avoid in the discharge of that office, and yet ought, more than anything else, to be kept at a distance from it."
3. "That the term bishop was common to all presbyters, and that there is no difference between presbyter and bishop."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The absence of that order, as contrasted with the recognition of the three grades in the Ignatian Epistles, is, so far as it goes, evidence of the early date of the Pastoral Epistles."
2. "There is a certain touch of inferiority in the conditions named for the deacons, as compared with those for the Episcopate."
3. "The danger of intemperance is expressed in stronger terms; the evil of the love of base and fraudulent gain, the special temptation of those who had the charge of the Church’s alms, is more prominent."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Grave (σεμνους). See Philippians 4:8. Repeated in verse 1 Timothy 3:11; Titus 2:2."
2. "Not double-tongued (μη διλογους). Rare word (δισ, λεγω) saying same thing twice."
3. "Not given to much wine (μη οινω πολλω προσεχοντας). 'Not holding the mind (τον νουν understood as usual with προσεχω, 1 Timothy 1:4) on much wine' (οινω, dative case)."

### John Gill:
1. "Their characters are, that they be 'grave'; in their speech, gesture, and dress; honest, and of good report among men; and chaste in their words and actions."
2. "Not doubletongued; whose hearts and tongues do not agree together; and who... say one thing to one, and another to the other; which to do is of bad consequence."
3. "Not given to much wine; which impairs the health, stupefies the mind, and so renders unfit for any such office, as well as wastes the temporal estate; and may lead them to embezzle and consume the church's stock."

### John Wesley:
1. "Likewise the deacons must he serious — Men of a grave, decent, venerable behaviour."
2. "But where are presbyters? Were this order essentially distinct from that of bishops, could the apostle have passed it over in silence?"
3. "All that is gained (above food and raiment) by ministering in holy things is filthy gain indeed; far more filthy than what is honestly gained by raking kennels, or emptying common sewers."
