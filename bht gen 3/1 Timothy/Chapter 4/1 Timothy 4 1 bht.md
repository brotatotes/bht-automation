## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons."
2. "Hypocrisy of those who speak lies; of men branded on their own conscience."
3. "Forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from meats."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These are the forerunners of 'the last days.'"
2. "The apostasy was to be within the Church, the faithful one becoming the harlot."
3. "The spirit of error, opposed to 'the spirit of truth,' 'the Spirit' which 'speaketh' in the true prophets against them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not by mere hints, and symbols, and shadowy images of the future; it was in an open and plain manner - in so many words." 
2. "The meaning is, that they would 'apostatize' from the belief of the truths of the gospel. It does not mean that, as individuals, they would have been true Christians; but that there would be a departure from the great doctrines which constitute the Christian faith."
3. "The characteristic here referred to by the apostle, therefore, is one that applies precisely to the Roman Catholic communion, and cannot be applied with the same fitness to any other association calling itself Christian on earth. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the Holy Spirit designed to designate that apostate church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not the same as ejn ejscataiv in the last days, 2 Timothy 3:1, which denotes the peliod closing the present aeon, and immediately preceding the parousia; while this signifies merely a time that is future to the writer."

### John Calvin:
1. "Men being by nature inclined to hypocrisy, Satan easily persuades them that God is worshipped aright by ceremonies and outward discipline."
2. "This warning was advantageous in the age of the Apostle Paul, that both pastors and others might give earnest attention to pure doctrine, and not suffer themselves to be deceived."
3. "The controversy is not about flesh or fish, or about a black or ashy color, or about Friday or Wednesday, but about the mad superstitions of men, who wish to appease God by such trifles, and, by contriving a carnal worship of him, contrive for themselves an idol instead of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Spirit speaketh expressly. The reference is clearly not to Old Testament prophecies, which would have been cited in terms, and quoted as Scripture, nor to our Lord‚Äôs words in Matthew 24:11, which if known to St. Paul, would have been assigned to Him, but to the direct teaching of the Spirit at or about the period at which St. Paul wrote." 
2. "The apostle here distinctly recognises a preternatural element in the workings of evil in the Church... they all lead astray."
3. "‚ÄòThe doctrines of devils‚Äô or ‚Äòdemons‚Äô are not doctrines about demons, as some have contended, pressing the text into the controversy against the Romish doctrine of the worship of the departed spirits of the saints, but‚Äô doctrines that came from demons,‚Äô the frenzied ravings as of men possessed by a nature more evil than their own."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In later times (ŒµŒΩ œÖœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅŒøŒπœÇ). Relative time from the prediction, now coming true (a present danger)."
2. "Some shall fall away (Œ±œÄŒøœÉœÑŒ∑œÉŒøŒΩœÑŒ± œÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ). Future middle of Œ±œÜŒπœÉœÑŒ∑Œº, intransitive use, shall stand off from, to fall away, apostatize."
3. "Seducing spirits (œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ œÄŒªŒ±ŒΩŒøŒπœÇ). Probably some heathen or the worst of the Gnostics."

### John Gill:
1. "From the true grace of faith there can be no final and total apostasy, such as is here designed; for that can never be lost. It is of an incorruptible nature, and therefore more precious than gold that perishes."
2. "And now this defection was to be 'in the latter times'; either of the apostolic age, which John, the last of the apostles, lived to see... or to some later times under the Gospel dispensation."
3. "The means by which this apostasy will obtain and prevail will be through men's giving heed to seducing spirits... and doctrines of devils; such as are devised by devils, as all damnable doctrines be."

### John Wesley:
1. "But the Spirit saith ‚Äî By St. Paul himself to the Thessalonians, and probably by other contemporary prophets."
2. "That in the latter times ‚Äî These extend from our Lord's ascension till his coming to judgment."
3. "Will depart from the faith ‚Äî The doctrine once delivered to the saints."
