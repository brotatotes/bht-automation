### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'gift' then referred to here was that by which Timothy was qualified for the work of the ministry."
2. "It does not refer 'exclusively' to any influence that came upon him in virtue of his ordination, or to any new grace that was infused into him by that act, making him either officially or personally more holy than other people, or than he was before - or to any efficacy in the mere act of ordination - but it comprised 'the whole train of circumstances' by which he had been qualified for the sacred office and recognized as a minister of religion."
3. "The endowment for the ministry; the previous anticipations and hopes of friends; and the manner in which he had been inducted into the sacred office, should all be regarded as a 'benefit' or 'favor' of a high order, and as a reason why the gift thus bestowed should not be neglected."

2. "Let each of us, therefore, consider what gift he possesses, that he may diligently apply it to use."
3. "Hence we infer that it was not a useless ceremony, because God by his Spirit, accomplished that consecration which men expressed symbolically 'by the laying on of hands.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words point, like the 'rekindle' in 2 Timothy 1:6, to the danger of an ascetic temperament tending to meditative quiescence rather than energetic service."

3. "The scene which the words suggest is that of the young convert kneeling in prayer, the presbytery, or body of elders in the Church of Lystra (or, it may be, Ephesus) laying their hands upon him, in prayer for the gifts he needed, while a prophet, recognizing at once his special capacities and the gifts which were required for their full development, told the elders for what gifts to pray."
