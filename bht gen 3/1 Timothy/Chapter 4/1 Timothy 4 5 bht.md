# 1 Timothy 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Food is sanctified by the word of God and intercession, just as the Lord's Supper sanctifies the elements. The thanksgiving prayer at the table brings the meal into harmony with God, transforming it from its naturally alien position to its true relationship with the new life. Our thanksgiving should be rooted in the words of Scripture, just as the ancient grace in the Apostolic Constitutions consists of Scripture. Through faith, the use of God's gifts can be advantageous and lawful, but we must approach food with knowledge and calling on the name of God.

3. "The Apostolic Constitutions [7.49], give this ancient grace, almost wholly consisting of Scripture, 'Blessed art thou, O Lord, who feedest me from my youth, who givest food to all flesh: Fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that we, having all sufficiency, may abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom glory, honour, and might, be to thee for ever.

1. "But it ought to be observed, that this word must be embraced by faith, in order that it may be advantageous; for, although God himself sanctifies all things by the Spirit of his mouth, yet we do not obtain that benefit but by faith."
2. "Common sense, indeed, pronounces, that the wealth of the world is naturally intended for our use; but, since dominion over the world was taken from us in Adam, everything that we touch of the gifts of God is defiled by our pollution; and, on the other hand, it is unclean to us, till God graciously come to our aid, and by ingrafting us into his Son, constitutes us anew to be lords of the world, that we may lawfully use as our own all the wealth with which he supplies us."
3. "Hence it ought to be inferred that the use of all the gifts of God is unclean, unless it be accompanied by true knowledge and calling on the name of God; and that it is a beastly way of eating, when we sit down at table without any prayer; and, when we have eaten to the full, depart in utter forgetfulness of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sanctified. Better, â€˜consecrated.â€™"
2. "Such formulae, so far as they are now extant, were for the most part a tesselated mosaic of scriptural phrases."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is sanctified (Î±Î³Î¹Î±Î¶ÎµÏ„Î±). Present passive indicative of Î±Î³Î¹Î±Î¶Ï‰, here 'rendered holy' rather than 'declared holy.'"
