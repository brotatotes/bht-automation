# 1 Timothy 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exercise of the body is only profitable to a small extent, but godliness or piety is profitable for all things. While bodily exercise may have its uses, it is secondary to the essential thing, which is piety. Godliness not only promises a fulfilling life in the present, but also in the life to come. It is through godliness that one can experience true and everlasting life in Christ Jesus. Mere external worship and bodily exercise alone are insufficient for everlasting life; it is godliness that leads to complete perfection and the welfare of the soul.
