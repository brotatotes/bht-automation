# 1 Timothy 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Younger widows are advised to refuse the opportunity to be enrolled as presbyteress widows, as their inclination to marry again demonstrates a lack of commitment to their initial faith in Christ. By giving in to their desires for marriage, they rebel against Christ and forsake their promise to devote themselves to widowhood. Engaging in unruly desires would hinder their service to Christ in His church. Therefore, it is imperative for them to decline the offer of becoming presbyteress widows to remain steadfast in their dedication to Christ and avoid being led astray.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The sense here is, that they would not be subordinate to the restraints implied in that situation, they would become impatient, and would marry again."
3. "It is clear, from this, that the apostle did not contemplate any vows which would prevent their marrying again; nor does he say that it would be absolutely wrong for them to marry, even if they were admitted in to that rank."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The compound verb, signifying to feel the sexual impulse, only here, and not in LXX or Class."
2. "Their unruly desire withdraws them from serving Christ in his church, and is, therefore, against him."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, I say, does not allow of abstaining from marriage till they are in extreme old age, and altogether beyond the danger of incontinence."
2. "Accordingly, it is rash, and even cruel, to lay a snare for those who still are young girls, and who would have been fitter for the married state."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But younger widows refuse (ŒΩŒµœâœÑŒµœÅŒ±œÇ Œ¥Œµ œáŒ∑œÅŒ±œÇ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±ŒπœÑŒøœÖ). Present middle imperative as in 1 Timothy 4:7. 'Beg off from.' They lack experience as above and they have other ambitions." 
2. "When they have waxed wanton (ŒøœÑŒ±ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉœÑœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ±œÉœâœÉŒπŒΩ). First aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉœÑœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ±œâ, late compound (only here and Ignatius), to feel the impulse of sexual desire, but simplex œÉœÑœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ±œâ (Revelation 18:7; Revelation 18:9)." 
3. "Souter renders it here 'exercise youthful vigour against Christ' (œÑŒøœÖ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ, genitive case after Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± in composition)."

### John Gill:
1. "Being at ease, and without labour, live a wanton, loose, and licentious life, and in carnal lusts and pleasures, contrary to the commands of Christ, and to the reproach and dishonour of his name."
2. "Marriage being the effect of wantonness, would not be so honourable in them, and especially after they had made application to the church for relief, and had declared themselves widows indeed, and desolate, and such as trusted in God, and gave themselves up to supplication and prayer."
3. "It would be much better for them, and more to the credit of religion, to marry first, than afterwards and it would be best not to apply at all to the church; and if they should, it would be most advisable to reject them for the said reasons."

### John Wesley:
1. "Refuse ‚Äî Do not choose."
2. "For when they are waxed wanton against Christ ‚Äî To whose more immediate service they had addicted themselves."
3. "They want to marry ‚Äî And not with a single eye to the glory of God; and so withdraw themselves from that entire service of the church to which they were before engaged."
