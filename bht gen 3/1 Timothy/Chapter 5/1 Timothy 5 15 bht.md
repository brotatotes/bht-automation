Some young widows have already turned aside after Satan, the seducer, giving occasion for reproach.

Their actions have exposed them to the revilings of those who, consciously or unconsciously, are doing the work of Satan. This serves as a reminder that even the most holy ordinances can be tainted by the wickedness of people. Therefore, it is crucial to remain steadfast and not deviate from the Lord, for turning aside leads to bondage under Satan.
