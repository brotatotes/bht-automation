# 1 Timothy 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let the presbyters who well preside be held worthy of double honor, especially those that labor in the word and teaching. The transition from the widow presbyteresses to the presbyters here is natural, implying a college of presbyters in each large congregation. If a presbyter is already worthy of honor, he who rules well is doubly so. This double honor includes pecuniary remuneration and symbolizes the acknowledgement due to them for their dedicated service and labor in the word and teaching.

3. "Especially they who labour in the word and doctrine; which lies in a constant reading of the Scriptures, the word of God, and diligently searching into them, and comparing them together, in order to find out the mind and will of God in them; in a daily meditation upon them, and study of them; and in frequent and fervent wrestling with God, or prayer to him, to give an understanding of them; and in endeavouring to find out the sense of difficult passages, which are hard to be understood; and in providing for the different cases and circumstances of hearers, that everyone may have a portion; and in the choice of apt and proper words to express truth in, to the capacities of all."

### John Wesley:
