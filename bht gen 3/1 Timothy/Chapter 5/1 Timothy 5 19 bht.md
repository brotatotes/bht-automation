For accusations against presbyters, accuracy demanded two or three witnesses due to widespread false information. While Timothy couldn't judge private matters, he could entertain, but not without such witnesses.

Credible testimony was of utmost importance, and there was a distinction in treatment when it came to citing private individuals versus elders in accusations.
