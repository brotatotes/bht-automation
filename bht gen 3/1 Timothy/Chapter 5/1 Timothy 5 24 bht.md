# 1 Timothy 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some men's sins are evident, going before them to judgment. These sins fall into two categories: those that are clearly manifest and those that are concealed until the final judgment. The former types of sins are openly proclaimed, acting as heralds that proclaim their sentence in advance. On the other hand, the latter types of sins may not be apparent at first, but they will eventually be made plainly manifest. Therefore, one should not always presume fitness for a sacred office simply because there are no previous adverse rumors. It is vital to be watchful, as these sins will follow the offender to the judgment seat and be openly exposed there.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The â€˜other menâ€™s sinsâ€™ in which Timothy is not to be a partaker, are of two classes (1) flagrant, notorious, so conspicuous even before the trial, that they scarcely need witnesses, are, indeed, as the accusers who bring the criminal before the judge; (2) those which do not come out at first, but, as it were, creep on, and dog the manâ€™s steps, and at last overtake him." 
2. "Receiving the words as applicable chiefly to the precept against hasty laying on of hands, they contain a warning against assuming fitness from the absence of open scandal."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The sins of some men are evident, going before them to judgment. These sins are categorically divided into two types: those that are palpably manifest and those that are hidden until the final judgment. The former category is openly proclaimed and condemned, like heralds announcing their sentence in advance. However, the latter category may not be apparent at first, but they will ultimately be made plainly manifest. Even though these sins may be hidden now, they cannot be concealed in the end. We must not presume the fitness of someone for sacred office simply because there is no previous adverse rumor about them. It is crucial to be watchful and cautious, for these sins will follow up the offender to the bar of judgment and be first made openly manifest there. The sins are so plain that they receive instant condemnation in human judgment.
