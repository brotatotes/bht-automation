# 1 Timothy 5:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as some sins are openly manifest, so too are the good works that cannot be hidden. While a person's good character may sometimes be evident from the start, we should not rush to judgment or condemnation when it is not immediately apparent. Through careful examination and inquiry, the hidden good deeds will be brought to light and known. This reminds us to be patient and not overlook or underestimate the unseen good works of others, as they will eventually be revealed.
