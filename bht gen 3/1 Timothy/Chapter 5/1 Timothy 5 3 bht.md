# 1 Timothy 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The proper care for widows who are truly destitute, lacking the support of family or children, is a key aspect addressed in this biblical instruction. This responsibility of caring for widows was transferred from Jewish tradition to the Christian community. In return for their maintenance, these widows were expected to carry out specific obligations, such as tending to orphans, the sick, and prisoners. Honoring widows denotes more than mere respect; it entails meeting their needs, providing for them, and esteeming them through both words and actions.
