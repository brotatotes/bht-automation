# 1 Timothy 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let the children and grandchildren learn first to show piety towards their own family and to behave piously towards their progenitors. Piety towards one's family is considered primary, even before acts of piety towards God, unless it interferes with one's duty to Christ. By learning and practicing filial piety, we not only honor our parents but also exemplify godly conduct at home which is pleasing and acceptable to God. Caring for our parents in old age is a duty that should not be neglected, as it is a requital for their past care and support.
