# 1 Timothy 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A certain kind of widow is not deserving of the church's charity because she is living in worldly pleasure and lacks true spiritual life. The Greek word used indicates wanton prodigality and excess. This woman, who lives for her own pleasure, is dead in the spirit while alive in the flesh. Her pursuit of pleasure is merely an appearance of life, but she is spiritually dead. Such individuals are not fulfilling the purpose of life and are as good as dead. Consequently, their names should be struck off the register of those entitled to support.
