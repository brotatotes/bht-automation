# 1 Timothy 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let a woman be enrolled as a widow in the Church if she is at least sixty years old and has been the wife of one husband. These widows were not deaconesses, but a specific group dedicated to serving God and the Church. They were chosen based on their age, experience, and influence on others. The purpose of their enrollment was to provide them with support from the Church while they, in turn, ministered to those in need. It was important to select widows who had been faithful and had not remarried or engaged in scandalous practices.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let a woman be inserted in the catalogue as a widow." 
2. "They are also mentioned as the band of widows, as presbytresses, as having precedence of rank."
3. "if she (at any time) washed the feet of the saints."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These were not deaconesses, who were chosen at a younger age (forty was the age fixed at the Council of Chalcedon), and who had virgins (in a later age called widows) as well as widows among them, but a band of widows set apart, though not yet formally and finally, to the service of God and the Church." 
2. "The reference here cannot be, as in 1 Timothy 3:2- :, to providing Church sustenance for them. For the restriction to widows above sixty would then be needless and harsh, since many widows might be in need of help at a much earlier age."
3. "Age was doubtless a requisite in presbyters, as it is here stated to have been in presbyteresses, with a view to their influence on the younger persons of their sex."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There can be no doubt, however, what he means. In the Acts of the Apostles 1 Timothy 6:1 we have this account: 'And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a complaining of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.'"
2. "In this way, while they were supported by the church, they might render themselves useful."
3. "(4) Among the pagans, it was regarded as especially honorable to have been married to but one man, and such widows were the Pudicitioe Coronam, or crown of chastity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be taken into the number. Better, enrolled (as a widow)."
2. "Originally, to pick out, as soldiers. Hence, to enroll, enlist."
3. "Here, to be enrolled in the body of widows who are to receive church support."

### John Calvin:
1. "They were received on the condition that the Church should relieve their poverty, and that, on their part, they should be employed in ministering to the poor, as far as the state of their health allowed."
2. "It may be regarded as a sort of pledge of continence and chastity, when a woman has arrived at that age, satisfied with having had but one husband."
3. "He wished carefully to guard against laying any females under a necessity of remaining unmarried, who felt it to be necessary to have husbands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let not a woman be taken into the number." 
2. "Under threescore years of age." 
3. "The wife of one husband."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let a widow be enrolled, having become of no less than sixty years."
2. "This list of genuine widows apparently had some kind of church work to do."
3. "Widows on this list must not be married a second time."

### John Gill:
1. "Now such [widows] were not to be taken under the church's care for relief, under threescore years old: for under this age it might be supposed they would marry, and so not be desolate, but would have husbands to provide for them." 
2. "Nor is the sense only, that she should be one who never had more husbands than one at once; for this was not usual for women to have more husbands than one, even where polygamy obtained, or where men had more wives than one: this rather therefore is to be understood of one who had never put away her husband, and married another." 
3. "And this being a scandalous practice, the apostle was willing to put a mark of infamy upon it, and exclude such persons who had been guilty of it from the number of widows relieved by the church."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let not a widow be chosen...into the number of deaconesses." 
2. "Under threescore...admitted at forty, if they were eminent for holiness."
3. "Having been the wife of one husband...having lived in lawful marriage, whether with one or more persons successively."
