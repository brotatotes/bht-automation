# 1 Timothy 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God alone possesses immortality and bestows it upon those who believe, for outside of him there is only death. It is incorrect to attribute inherent indestructibility to the soul, as this trait can only be attributed to God's gift. Just as mortal man cannot gaze upon the sun due to its intense heat and power, we are unable to fully comprehend the indescribable glory of God. He dwells in unapproachable light, and though no one has seen him or can see him, we can look forward to beholding him as we are transformed and purified to enjoy his presence.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: God alone possesses immortality, and he grants it to those who believe in him. Mortal man cannot comprehend the inexpressible glory of God, as even the sun is beyond our gaze due to its intense heat and power. It is important to recognize that the immortality of the soul is not inherent but a gift from God. This truth opposes the pagan belief in the indestructibility of the soul. The imagery of God dwelling in an unapproachable light signifies the inaccessibility and overwhelming splendor of his presence. Though no one has seen God, we are assured of beholding him one day, purified from sin and mortality, and enabled to enjoy his beatific vision.

- Attempt 3 BHT: God alone possesses immortality and graciously imparts it to believers, revealing that apart from Him, there is death. It is erroneous to assign innate indestructibility to the soul, as this quality is solely a gift from God. Just as mortals cannot gaze directly at the scorching sun, we are unable to fathom the indescribable glory of God. He dwells in an unapproachable light, and though no one has seen or can see Him, we anticipate the day when we will behold Him, cleansed from sin and mortality, to enjoy His divine presence.

- Attempt 4 BHT: God, who alone possesses immortality, offers this eternal life to those who believe in Him. The soul's indestructibility is a fallacy, as it is a gift solely from God. The radiant glory of God is so intense that mortal eyes cannot endure it, comparable to gazing at the scorching sun. This unapproachable light in which God dwells represents His incomprehensible and awe-inspiring presence. Though no one has seen or can see God, believers anticipate the day when they will be purified from sin and mortality to behold His divine splendor.

- Attempt 5 BHT: God uniquely possesses immortality, extending this gift to those who have faith in Him. It is a misconception to assume that the soul is inherently indestructible, as this quality is exclusively bestowed by God. Mortal humanity is incapable of fully comprehending the astonishing glory of God, just as one cannot directly gaze upon the scorching sun. God dwells in a light that is unapproachable and beyond human perception. Although no one has seen or can see God, believers eagerly anticipate the day when they will be transformed to behold His magnificence.
