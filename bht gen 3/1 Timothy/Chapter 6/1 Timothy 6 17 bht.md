## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To those who are rich in this present world, command not to be highminded, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but in God, who affordeth us all things richly for enjoyment." 
2. "To be rich in good works, to be free givers, ready contributors, laying up for themselves as a treasure a good foundation for the future."
3. "They may lay hold of that which is really life, the possession and substance of that other, which, as full of joy and everlasting, is the only true life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Resuming the subject from above, 1 Timothy 6:5; 1 Timothy 6:10. The immortality of God, alone rich in glory, and of His people through Him, is opposed to the lust of money."
2. "They who rest their trust on riches, rest trust on uncertainty itself."
3. "Enjoyment consists in giving, not in holding fast. Non-employment should be far removed, as from man, so from his resources."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Property really makes no distinction in the great things that pertain to character and salvation...for so slight and unimportant a distinction as gold can confer, no man should be proud."
2. "Riches are uncertain because they may soon be taken away. No dependence can be placed on them in the emergencies of life...A man whose house is in flames, or who is shipwrecked, or whose child lies dying, or who is himself in the agonies of death, can derive no advantage from the fact that he is richer than other people."
3. "He is able to supply all our needs, and to do for us what riches cannot do...He is able to meet our needs if in the flames, or in a storm at sea, or when a friend dies, or when we lie down on a bed of death, or wherever we may be in the eternal world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Rich in this world, for others are rich in the world to come." (Chrysostom)
2. "The uncertainty of riches." 
3. "A contrast is implied between being highminded on account of wealth - cherishing and worshipping it - and rightly enjoying it."

### John Calvin:
1. "That they be not haughty, nor hope in the uncertainty of riches...For whence comes it, that rich men grow insolent, and take extreme delight in despising others, but because they imagine that they are supremely happy? Vain confidence goes first, and then arrogance follows." 
2. "All that is in the world has the taste of its nature; so that it is fading, and quickly passes away. The uncertainty and vanity of the hope that is placed in riches are shewn by him from this consideration, that the possession of them is so transitory that it is like a thing unknown; for, while we think that we hold them, they slip out of our hands in a moment. How foolish is it, therefore, to place our hope in them!" 
3. "When he says 'abundantly for enjoyment,' he describes how kind God is to us, and even to all men, and to the brute beasts; for his kindness extends far and wide beyond our necessity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Charge them that are rich in this world."
2. "High-minded. The state of one who forms great and ambitious schemes in which be himself is the centre."
3. "In God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In this present world (ÎµÎ½ Ï„Ï‰ Î½Ï…Î½ Î±Î¹Ï‰Î½). 'In the now age,' in contrast with the future."
2. "Riches have wings. But on God (Î±Î»Î»' ÎµÏ€ Î¸ÎµÏ‰). He alone is stable, not wealth."
3. "A lavish emphasis to the generosity of God" (Parry).

### John Gill:
1. "Riches produce pride; rich men are apt to be proud of themselves, and despise others; and therefore this evil is taken notice of, as what they are to be cautioned against, and charged to the contrary."
2. "No man that is possessed of them can be sure of them a moment; they make themselves wings and flee away; he that gives them, can take them away at pleasure."
3. "Almost every word carries in it an argument or reason why he should be trusted, because he is God, and not a creature; the 'living' God, who has life in himself, essentially and originally."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not to be highminded â€” O who regards this! Not to think better of themselves for their money, or anything it can purchase." 
2. "But in the living God â€” All the rest is dead clay." 
3. "Who giveth us â€” As it were holding them out to us in his hand. All things â€” Which we have. Richly â€” Freely, abundantly. To enjoy â€” As his gift, in him and for him."
