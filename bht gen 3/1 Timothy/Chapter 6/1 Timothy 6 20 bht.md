## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The true or sound doctrine to be taught, as opposed to 'the science falsely so called,' which leads to 'error concerning the faith.'"
2. "Keep,' saith he, 'the deposit'; preserve intact and inviolate the talent of the catholic faith."
3. "Let there be progress in religion in Christ's Church...but then let it be real progress, not a change of the faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Keep that which is committed to thy trust - All that is entrusted to you, and to which reference has been particularly made in this Epistle."
2. "Avoiding profane and vain babblings - Greek, 'Profane, empty words.'"
3. "And oppositions of science falsely so called - Religion has nothing to fear from true science."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It may mean either something put beside another as an addition or appendix or something put with or in the keeping of another as a trust or deposit."
2. "The meaning here is that teaching which Timothy had received from Paul; the 'sound words' which he was to guard as a sacred trust, and communicate to others."
3. "The word gnwsiv cannot therefore be interpreted to mean the Gnostic system; while it may properly be understood as referring to that conceit of knowledge which opposed itself to the Christian faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "He describes the high-sounding and verbose and bombastic style of those who, not content with the simplicity of the gospel, turn it into profane philosophy."
2. "The power of the Spirit is extinguished as soon as the Doctors blow their flutes in this manner, to display their eloquence."
3. "[Paul] pronounces that 'science' which exalts itself above the plain and humble doctrine of godliness ‚Äî to be falsely called and thought a science."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That which is committed to thy trust. The Greek has one word with the sense of ‚Äòdeposit.‚Äô Taken by itself, it is general in its meaning, and may refer either (1) to the faith committed to him, (2) to the Church entrusted to his charge, or (3) to the spiritual gifts bestowed on him." 
2. "Vain babblings. A various reading, differing only in two vowels, gives ‚Äò new phrases,‚Äô but the text is preferable."
3. "There is not much difficulty as to the ‚Äò science‚Äô thus spoken of. ‚Äò Knowledge,‚Äô the familiar rendering in other passages, would be far better here also. The dreamy fantastic gnosis of the Apostolic Age was as remote as possible in its character and tendencies from the ‚Äòscience‚Äô of modern culture."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Keep (aorist of urgency) the deposit." 
2. "Turning away from (ŒµŒ∫œÑœÅŒµœÄŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ). Present middle participle of ŒµŒ∫œÑœÅŒµœÄœâ."
3. "Babblings (Œ∫ŒµŒΩŒøœÜœâŒΩŒπŒ±œÇ). From Œ∫ŒµŒΩŒøœÜœâŒΩŒøœÇ, uttering emptiness."

### John Gill:
1. "That is, the Gospel, which is a rich treasure put into earthen vessels, and ought to be kept pure and uncorrupt, and faithfully dispensed, and diligently preserved."
2. "Avoiding profane and vain babblings; about the law, and circumcision, and other things, which the false teachers insisted much on, and amused their hearers with; and which were vain, empty, useless, and unprofitable talk."
3. "The false teachers boasted of their science and knowledge, but it was not true, solid, spiritual, and saving; it was merely notional and speculative; it was idle, empty, and useless, mere Pagan philosophy, and vain deceit, upon which they formed antitheses, or oppositions and objections to the truths of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "Keep that which is committed to thy trust."
2. "Avoid profane empty babblings."
3. "Knowledge falsely so called."
