## BHT:
Godliness with contentment is great gain, as piety joined with contentment is the means of gain. It is not merely contentment that is great gain, but the present and eternal gain that piety, with its accompaniment of contentment, secures to the soul. True happiness lies in piety, which feels no need of what it lacks and exalts it above worldly possessions. This attitude of mind, accompanied by contentment, is Paul's conception of 'great gain' and it brings unspeakable profit in both time and eternity.
