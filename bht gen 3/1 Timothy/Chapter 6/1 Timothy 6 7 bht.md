# 1 Timothy 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We brought nothing into the world and we cannot carry anything out. This should teach us to have no gain-seeking anxiety and to be content with what we have. Our covetousness is insatiable unless restrained, so let us desire only what is necessary for life. We should be satisfied with having enough, for worldly possessions hold no significance in the face of our departure from this world. Instead of accumulating material wealth, let us focus on our eternal destination.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: We should remember that we brought nothing into the world and we cannot take anything out of it, which should teach us to have no anxious desire for gain. Contentment is key, for our arrival and departure from this world are marked by the fact that we bring nothing with us and we can carry nothing out. Our covetousness is insatiable if unchecked, so we must learn to desire only what is necessary for life. We should be satisfied with having enough, as godly individuals are, recognizing that worldly possessions are insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately, we cannot take our worldly substance with us after death, so accumulating material wealth serves no purpose. Instead, we should focus on our eternal destination.
