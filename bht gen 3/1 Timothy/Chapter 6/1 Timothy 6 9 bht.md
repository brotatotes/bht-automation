# 1 Timothy 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who wish to be rich are prone to fall into a snare, trapped by foolish and hurtful desires that are both unintelligent and wicked. It is not the possession of riches themselves, but the strong desire for them that leads one into temptation. This longing for wealth is detrimental to contentment and is the first step in a terrible descent towards destruction and perdition. The consequences of avarice are severe, with its foolish approaches and the drowning in destructive lusts.
