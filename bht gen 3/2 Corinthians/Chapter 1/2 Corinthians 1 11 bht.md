# 2 Corinthians 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul relied on God and felt the need of the prayer of God's people. The expression is pictorial; that thanksgiving may be given from many faces; the cheerful countenances being an offering of thanks to God. For whatever God will confer upon me, being as it were obtained through means of many persons, will, also, by many be celebrated with praises. The apostle's view in this is to stir them up to a joint acknowledgment of the deliverance with them, which better became them than to side with the false apostles in their charge against him.
