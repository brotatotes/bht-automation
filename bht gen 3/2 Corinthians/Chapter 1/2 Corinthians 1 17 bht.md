## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Did I at all use levity (of purpose)? Or those things which I plan, do I plan according to the flesh...that there should be with me the yea yea, and the nay nay." 
2. "Or those things which I plan, do I plan after the flesh (as fleshly men do), so that my yea must (at all events) be yea, and my nay nay?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did I act with levity, or (on the other hand) do I purpose what I purpose like worldly (fleshly) men, so that my 'yea' must at all costs be yea, and my 'nay' nay?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This charge had been probably made that he had made the promise without any due consideration, or without any real purpose of performing it; or that he had made it in a trifling and thoughtless manner."
2. "Paul denies in a positive manner that he formed such plans; and they should have known enough of his manner of life to be assured that that was not the nature of the schemes which he had devised."
3. "Paul says that this was not his character. He did not affirm a thing at one time and deny it at another; he did not promise to do a thing one moment and refuse to do it the next."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a sign of changeableness to purpose or promise what you almost immediately afterwards regret. With that fault Paul declares he had not been chargeable."
2. "To purpose according to the flesh is not owning God as our ruler, but, instead of this, being impelled by a rash presumption, which is afterwards justly derided by God, and punished."
3. "Thus the reiterating of the affirmation and negation will not have the same meaning as in Matthew 5:37 and in James, but will bear this meaning â€” 'that yea should with me be in this instance yea, and on the other hand, when it pleases me, nay, nay'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Did I show fickleness? This shows that his original plan had somehow become known at Corinth either through Timothy or in the letter referred to...and that advantage had been taken of the change to his prejudice..." 
2. "That with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?" 
3. "'Saying yes and no to the same thing as suits the whim of the moment.' That this is the meaning is clear from what follows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did I shew fickleness?"

### John Gill:
1. "did I use lightness in my resolutions and promises?"
2. "Or the things that I purpose, do l purpose according to the flesh?"
3. "has there appeared such contradictions in my words, and such inconstancy in my conduct, that my 'yeas' are 'nays', and my 'nays yeas?'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Did I use levity â€” Did I lightly change my purpose?"
2. "Do I purpose according to the flesh - Are my purposes grounded on carnal or worldly considerations?"
