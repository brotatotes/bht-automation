### John Calvin:
1. "For, as it may be, and often does happen, that Christ is disfigured by the inventions (284) of men, and is adulterated, as it were, by their disguises, he declares that it had not been so as to himself or his associates, but that he had sincerely and with an integrity that was befitting, held forth Christ pure and undisguised."
2. "Hence those go beyond due limits, who teach anything else than Christ alone, with whatever show of wisdom they may otherwise be puffed up."
3. "Others, with a view to procure the favor of men, present him under various forms, while there is still another class, that inculcate one day what on the next they retract through fear. Such was not Paulâ€™s Christ, nor can that of any true apostle (288) be such."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When we were with you, was it vacillating, fickle preachers that preached to you the unchanging One, the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and for ever?"

3. "It is an appeal to the incongruity of the thing, and to their whole bearing at Corinth as men, like their message, honest and true."

3. Paul appeals to the life of Christ to sustain his own veracity.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the Son of God": this article he began his ministry with...which is of the greatest moment and importance.
2. "the Son of God is Christ, anointed to bear and execute the office of a mediator... a Saviour."
3. "The Gospel, as in Christ... is all of a piece; its constant and invariable strain is to display the free, rich, and sovereign grace of God, to magnify and exalt the person and offices of Christ, to debase the creature, and to engage persons to the performance of good works, on Gospel principles, and by Gospel motives, and for right ends."

### John Wesley:
1. "For Jesus Christ, who was preached by us... Was not yea and nay... But was yea in him."
