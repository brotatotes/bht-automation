### John Calvin:
1. "He had previously taught, that this is a befitting harmony ‚Äî when, on the one hand, the calling of God is without repentance, and we, in our turn, with an unwavering faith, accept of the blessing of adoption that is held out to us. That God remains steadfast to his promise is not surprising; but to keep pace with God in the steadfastness of our faith in return ‚Äî that truly is not in man‚Äôs power."
2. "For God, by pouring down upon us the heavenly grace of the Spirit, does, in this manner, seal upon our hearts the certainty of his own word."
3. "As the Spirit, in bearing witness of our adoption, is our security, and, by confirming the faith of the promises, is the seal, so it is on good grounds that he is called an earnest, because it is owing to him, that the covenant of God is ratified on both sides, which would, but for this, have hung in suspense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ... not only inserting us into, but keeping us in Christ." 
2. "God... anointed us." 
3. "Of Him (God) are ye in Christ Jesus."

2. "Their standing is alone in him; the unchangeable love and favour of God, which is their grand security, is in Christ."
3. "Whatever steadfastness and stability the saints have, whether ministers or people, they ought to ascribe it entirely to God, Father, Son, and Spirit."
