# 2 Corinthians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sufferings of Christ overflow upon His followers, for as He is, so are we in this world. These sufferings are not just things suffered for Christ's sake, but rather Christ's own sufferings as they are shared by His disciples. Through our partnership with Christ in suffering, we also partake in His glory. The sufferings may be many, but the consolation received through Christ's presence and assurance outweighs them all. As we suffer in the cause of Christ, He ensures that our hearts are filled with His comfort, just as He promised.
