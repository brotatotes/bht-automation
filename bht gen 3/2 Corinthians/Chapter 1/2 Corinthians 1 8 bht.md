# 2 Corinthians 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During his time in Asia, the Apostle Paul faced not only the threat of persecution but also a deadly sickness. He felt as though he had been condemned to die and had no way of escape. The distress he experienced was not just from external trouble, but also from inward anguish. Paul and his companions were weighed down exceedingly beyond their own power to bear. It was a trial so great that there seemed to be no way out. However, in the midst of this overwhelming situation, Paul found comfort in relying on God's strength rather than his own.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There would be an appropriateness in the expression 'in Asia' here, as he has in his mind an apologetic account of the reasons which hindered him from leaving those parts and coming to them."
2. "I am unable to assign any other event as in the Apostle‚Äôs mind: but the expressions seem rather to regard a deadly sickness, than a persecution."
3. "Such an expression surely would not be used of a tumult, where life would have been the first thing in danger if Paul had been at all mixed up in it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "we had the sentence of death in ourselves," mean, that he looked upon himself as a man condemned to die.
2. "had Paul been found by the mob in the excitement, he would have been torn in pieces."
3. "His weak state of health at the time combined with all this to make him regard himself as all but dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We wish you to be fully informed"
2. "We were borne down, or weighed down by calamity exceedingly"

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "He felt that his strength would have failed him, if the Lord had not imparted fresh strength."
2. "So that I thought life was gone, or at least I had very little hope of it remaining, as those are wont to feel who are shut up so as to see no way of escape."
3. "At the same time I have preferred to explain the word ·ºêŒæŒ±œÄŒøœÅŒµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, which is made use of by Paul, as denoting a trembling anxiety, rather than render it, as Erasmus has done by the word despair; because he simply means, that he was hemmed in by the greatest difficulties, so that no means of preserving life seemed to remain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostle seems to labour under the difficulty of finding words to express what he felt at the time referred to."
2. "The thought seems to be, 'Looking up, to discern what God might mean by this, and asking ourselves whither all was tending, the answer seemed to be, Thou art now to die for the name of the Lord Jesus.'"
3. "But it drove him to the one Source of courage and strength to hold on, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We do know that the disciples and the Asiarchs would not allow Paul to face the mob in the amphitheatre gathered by Demetrius (Acts 20:30)."
2. "He had a trial so great that 'we were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power' (Œ∫Œ±Œ∏' œÖœÄŒµœÅŒ≤ŒøŒªŒ∑ŒΩ œÖœÄŒµœÅ Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπŒΩ ŒµŒ≤Œ±œÅŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒµŒΩ)."
3. "There seemed no way out."

### John Gill:
1. "The affliction was as an heavy burden upon them, too heavy to bear; it was exceeding heavy, Œ∫Œ±Œ∏' œÖœÄŒµœÅŒ≤ŒøŒªŒ∑ŒΩ, even to an 'hyperbole', beyond expression; and above strength."
2. "But not above the strength of grace, or that spiritual strength communicated to them, by which they were supported under it."
3. "They were at the utmost loss, and in the greatest perplexity how to escape the danger of life; they greatly doubted of it; they saw no probability nor possibility, humanly speaking, of preserving it."

### John Wesley:
1. "We would not have you ignorant, brethren, of the trouble which befell us in Asia." 
2. "The Corinthians knew before that he had been in trouble: he now declares the greatness and the fruit of it." 
3. "We were exceedingly pressed, above our strength ‚Äî Above the ordinary strength even of an apostle."
