## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "our answer within ourselves to the question, â€˜Life or Death?â€™ was, â€˜Death.â€™" 
2. "Our thoughts were weaned from all hope of surviving in this life, and fixed on that better deliverance which God shall work when He raises us from the dead." 
3. "who delivered us from so great a death, and will deliver us,â€”on whom we hope that He will also continue to deliver us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We had so given up all thoughts of life, that our only hope was fixed on the coming resurrection."
2. "His hope of the resurrection was what buoyed him up in contending with foes, savage as wild beasts."
3. "Here he touches only on the doctrine of the resurrection, taking it for granted that its truth is admitted by the Corinthians, and urging its bearing on their practice."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The words 'in ourselves,' mean, against ourselves; or, we expected certainly to die. This seems as if he had been condemned to die, and may either refer to some instance when the popular fury was so great that he felt it was determined he should die; or more probably to a judicial sentence that he should be cast to the wild beasts, with the certain expectation that he would be destroyed."
2. "He felt that he must die; and that human aid was vain. According to every probability he would die; and all that he could do was to cast himself on the protection of that God who had power to save him even then, if he chose, and who, if he did it, would exert power similar to that which is put forth when the dead are raised."
3. "It is probable that on this occasion Paul was near dying; that he had given up all hope of life - perhaps, as at Lystra Acts 14:19, he was supposed to be dead. He felt, therefore, that he was raised up by the immediate power of God, and regarded it as an exertion of the same power by which the dead are raised."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sentence of death. Apokrima, occurs only here in the New Testament, and not in classical Greek nor in the Septuagint." 
2. "Sentence, which occurs in some inscriptions, if a legitimate rendering at all, is a roundabout one, derived from a classical use of the verb ajpokrinw to reject on inquiry, decide."
3. "The sense is well given by Stanley : 'When I have asked myself what would be the issue of this struggle, the answer has been, 'death.'' "

### John Calvin:
1. "The fleshly confidence with which we are puffed up, is so obstinate, that it cannot be overthrown in any other way than by our falling into utter despair."
2. "The saints themselves have some remains of this disease adhering to them, and that for this reason they are often reduced to an extremity, that, stripped of all self-confidence, they may learn humility."
3. "Let us begin, therefore, with despairing of ourselves, but with the view of placing our hope in God. Let us be brought low in ourselves, but in order that we may be raised up by his power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The answer of death: This late word...always in the sense of decision or judgment rendered." 
2. "We ourselves have had within ourselves: Regular perfect...and still have the vivid recollection of that experience."
3. "That we should not trust in ourselves: A further purpose of God in affliction...to give him a precious spiritual lesson."

### John Gill:
1. "By the sentence of death is meant, not any decree of heaven, or appointment of God that they should die; nor any sentence of condemnation and death passed on them by the civil magistrate; but an opinion or persuasion in their own breasts, that they should die..."
2. "...to learn to lay aside all self-trust and confidence: that we should not trust in ourselves; in our strength, wisdom, and policy, to make our escape, and preserve our lives..."
3. "...to teach and encourage them to trust in God alone, and depend on his arm, on his almighty power..."

### John Wesley:
1. Yea, we had the sentence of death in ourselves â€” We ourselves expected nothing but death.
