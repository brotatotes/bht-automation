### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul boldly casts into the scales of his readers the weight of his own personality over against his calumniators" (Meyer).

2. "Plutarch combines œÄœÅŒ±œÖœÑŒ∑œÇ with ŒµœÄŒπŒµŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ± as Paul does here... Matthew Arnold suggested 'sweet reasonableness' for ŒµœÄŒπŒµŒπŒ∫ŒµŒπŒ±."
3. "The bad use of œÑŒ±œÄŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÇ, the old use, but here alone in N.T. in that meaning... Probably Paul here is quoting one of the sneers of his traducers in Corinth about his humble conduct while with them."

### John Gill:
1. "I Paul myself"; whose name the false teachers played upon, it signifying "little"; and he being of little stature, they reproached him for it, and would insinuate, that as his name was "little", and his person mean, his bodily presence weak, and his speech contemptible, that he had a little soul, was a man of small knowledge, mean parts, and a very insignificant minister. (93 words)

Now it is as if the apostle should say, I am not ashamed of my name, nor of my person, and I am willing to own myself the least of the apostles, yea, less than the least of all saints; but I beg of you by the mild and gentle Spirit of my Lord and master, whom I am not ashamed to imitate, that you would not join in those sneers. (59 words)
3. though my enemies say the contrary, as that I am such an one, who in presence am base, or "humble among you": they suggested, that when he was at Corinth he was humble and modest in his conversation, mild and gentle in all his expressions and deportment; and which they interpreted of a meanness and baseness of spirit, as though he crept and cringed to curry favour with men, to avoid offence, and gain and keep an interest among them. (70 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Who when present am base among you - So, probably, some of the false teachers affirmed."
2. "Copying after the meekness and gentleness of Christ, entreat - Though I might command you."
3. "A strongly emphatical expression."
