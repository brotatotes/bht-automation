# 2 Corinthians 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let them not flatter themselves that there will be any discrepancy between my words and my deeds. All which has been threatened will be certainly executed unless there is repentance. Let such an one reckon this, that what was said in word by letters when absent, is indeed how we are in reality when present. He threatens the calumniator, that he should find him, to his sorrow, the same man present as absent, and what he sent by letters, should be found to be fact, when he came again.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Let those who question the Apostle's character consider that he is consistent in both his words and his deeds.

So, they should not think that his threats in his letters are empty, but rather that they will be fully executed unless there is repentance.
