# 2 Corinthians 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We should be cautious of boasting excessively and measuring ourselves against others, as this can lead to an unlimited self-opinion. Instead, our boast should be limited to the measure of the work God has assigned to us. Paul, in defending his apostolic authority, recognizes that his boasting is confined to the boundaries appointed by God. He reaches even to the Corinthians within these limits, faithfully fulfilling his commission. It is important to acknowledge the measure and province assigned to us by God, avoiding any desire to extend beyond it.
