# 2 Corinthians 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their hope is not to boast excessively or go beyond their appointed boundaries, but rather to be enlarged among the Corinthians as their faith grows. They do not seek to rely on the labors of others or exceed their own measure. Instead, they aim to go even further in their ministry, guided by God's measuring line. The progress of the Corinthians will be a vital step towards reaching regions beyond, and their success will magnify the apostle's work.
