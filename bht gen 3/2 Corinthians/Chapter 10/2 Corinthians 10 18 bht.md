# 2 Corinthians 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who commend themselves are not truly approved, but rather those whom the Lord commends as His chosen instruments. The approval spoken of here is not a temporary or earthly commendation, but rather one that stands the test of trial, like metals tested in fire. In contrast, those who are rejected by the Lord are like reprobate silver. Therefore, let us seek the approval of God alone, which holds more value than the praises of the whole world. May we strive to be approved by the Lord, knowing that His commendation leads to eternal joy.
