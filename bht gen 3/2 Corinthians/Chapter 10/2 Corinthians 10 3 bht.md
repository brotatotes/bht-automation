# 2 Corinthians 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though we walk in the flesh, our battle is not fought according to it. We do not use earthly methods or worldly resources in our fight against sin, idolatry, and evil. Our warfare is spiritual, carried out with the power of truth and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. As soldiers of Christ, we do not stoop to the level of those who war in the flesh. We face the devil and his agents, even when they disguise themselves as representatives of heaven, armed with courage and the spiritual weapons at our disposal.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Though as humans we walk in this physical world, we do not wage war in the same manner. The accusation that we walk according to the flesh is unfounded, as the battle we fight is not fought with earthly weapons or worldly resources. Instead, our fight is against sin, idolatry, and all forms of evil, aiming for conquests by the force of truth and the power of the Spirit of God. Our existence in the flesh does not define our actions; rather, we engage in a spiritual warfare, armed with courage and the weapons provided to us. As soldiers in Christ's army, we do not stoop to the level of those who war according to the flesh, for our fight is against the devil and his agents, even when they disguise themselves as representatives of heaven. Thus, while we live in this world, we do not wage our battles in the ways of the world, but with the spiritual weapons bestowed upon us.
