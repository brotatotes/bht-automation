3. "In which may be observed the great modesty of the apostle, who does not go about to disprove others being Christ's, who so confidently boasted of it; nor bid them look to it to see if they were or not, since all that say so are not; only as if granting that they were, he would have them look upon him, and his fellow apostles as such also, who had at least equal pretensions to this character."

### John Wesley:
1. "Do ye look at the outward appearance of things." 
2. "Let him again think this of himself."
