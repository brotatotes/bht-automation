# 2 Corinthians 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though we walk in the flesh, we do not take our apostolic weapons from the flesh, for our rule of warfare is not based on worldly methods. Even if I were to boast more exceedingly of our authority, I would not be put to shame. This authority is given by the Lord for building up His people, not for tearing them down. It is a power that is meant for the edification and salvation of the Church, bestowed upon us by God Himself.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Though we walk in the flesh, we do not rely on worldly methods for our spiritual warfare. To boast of our apostolic power is not to bring shame upon ourselves, but rather to validate our authority. Our intention is not to tear down, but to build up. This power, bestowed upon us by the Lord Himself, is meant for the edification and salvation of His people. It is a divine authority that should not be seen as burdensome, for it is given by God and exercised for the welfare of the Church. Therefore, if I were to boast even more greatly about this authority, I would not be put to shame, as it is a power that cannot be given by any mere human being.
