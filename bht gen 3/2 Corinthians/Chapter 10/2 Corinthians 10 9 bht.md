- Attempt 4 BHT: I say this, in order that I may not seem to terrify you by my letters, as if I would frighten and threaten you with empty threats. I could boast of my authority, but I choose not to, so as not to appear as someone who only talks a big game but lacks action. I want to assure you that my power and influence are not limited to my words alone. Some may try to diminish my credibility, claiming that I am less effective in person than I am through my letters. But that is not the case. I am just as powerful in actions as I am in words. I avoid emphasizing my authority in order to avoid giving any occasion for the false accusation that I am bold and intimidating when absent, but unable to follow through.
