# 2 Corinthians 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I wish you would bear with me a little in my foolishness. Although you already do bear with me, I ask for your further patience in my self-commendations. My boasting may seem like imprudent and even wicked folly, but it is a legitimate self-vindication demanded by the circumstances. I openly and freely command you to bear with me in this proclamation of my praises, as it is necessary for me to address the opposition I have faced from false apostles.
