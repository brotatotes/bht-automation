# 2 Corinthians 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do I refuse to receive anything from you because I do not love you? God knows that is not the case. It is not because I do not have a deep and tender attachment to you, but because I want to promote the gospel and advance the kingdom of the Redeemer. Love is often offended when its favors are not accepted, as if the person offering them wishes to avoid any obligation. However, I willingly incur obligations to those whom I love, and it is God who knows my heart and understands my motives.
