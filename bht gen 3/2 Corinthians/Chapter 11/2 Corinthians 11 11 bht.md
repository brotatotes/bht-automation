# 2 Corinthians 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do I refuse to accept anything from you because I don't love you? God knows that is not the reason. Love is often offended when the recipient does not want to be obliged to the one who offers. So, it is not that I don't love you, but rather, it is because I can better promote the gospel and advance the kingdom of the Redeemer by not being under any obligation to you.
