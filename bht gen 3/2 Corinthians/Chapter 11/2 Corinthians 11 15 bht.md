# 2 Corinthians 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Satan, the father of falsehood, opposes the righteousness of God manifested in the Gospel. These false shepherds, dressed in the appearance of heaven, serve the devil and propagate his kingdom of darkness. While they may deceive with their sanctimonious pretenses, their true nature will be revealed in the day of judgment. It is no surprise that they transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, but their end shall correspond to their works, stripping away their deceptive forms. Their destiny will be determined by their deeds, not their false claims.
