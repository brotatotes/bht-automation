# 2 Corinthians 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Please do not regard me as a tool for boasting, but rather grant me the indulgent hearing conceded even to one suspected of folly. If you do think me foolish, at least allow me to make use of my right and liberty to speak foolishly after the manner of fools, just as others do without being rebuked. I say again, let no man think I do this without the utmost necessity, but bear with my folly for a moment, so that I may boast myself and expose the disgusting vanity of the false apostles.
