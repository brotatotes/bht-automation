# 2 Corinthians 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They were wise, so full of wisdom that they could tolerate, even complacently look down on, the follies of others. This ironic encouragement from the apostle Paul was a plea for their forbearance and patronage as he boasted. Yet Paul's real view of their wisdom was very different, as they willingly indulged the foolish and took pleasure in it. The irony in his words was both obvious and keen, as they showed themselves to be men of wisdom by tolerating and even delighting in the empty-headed.

- Attempt 5 BHT: The Corinthians prided themselves on their wisdom, thinking themselves superior to others. Paul, however, saw their so-called wisdom in a different light. He sarcastically points out that they not only tolerated fools but took pleasure in it, as though it was a sign of their wisdom. This irony is meant to highlight their hypocrisy and to build a case for why they should bear with Paul's boasting. The Corinthians' true attitude towards wisdom and folly is exposed in Paul's rhetorical critique.
