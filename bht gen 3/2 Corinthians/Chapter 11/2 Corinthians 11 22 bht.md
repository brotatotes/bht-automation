### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is also clear that they prided themselves on being Jews - on having a connection with the people and land from whence the religion which the Corinthian church now professed had emanated."

3. "Seed of Abraham. Compare Matthew 3:9; John 8:33; Romans 9:7; Romans 11:1; Galatians 3:16; Hebrews 2:16. The three names are arranged climactically, Hebrews pointing to the nationality; Israelites to the special relation to God's covenant; seed of Abraham to the messianic privilege. Compare with the whole, Philippians 3:4, Philippians 3:5."

### John Calvin:
1. "If they boast of illustrious descent, I shall be on a level with them, for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham."
2. "This is a silly and empty boast, and yet Paul makes use of three terms to express it; nay more, he specifies, as it were, three different marks of excellence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  So am I (ÎºÎ±Î³Ï‰). This is his triumphant refrain with each challenge. 


### John Gill:
1. "The apostle was able to match them in this, and asserts himself to be an Hebrew too, which he could do with the strictest truth, for he was an Hebrew of the Hebrews, he was an Hebrew by father and mother's side."
2. "The Jews were called Israelites from Israel, a name which was given to Jacob their ancestor, upon his wrestling with an angel, and prevailing over him; and was accounted an honourable one, or title of honour; for the people of Israel were they whom God chose for a peculiar people to himself above all others..."
3. "The apostle was of the stock of Israel, and of the tribe of Benjamin, a son of Jacob, or Israel; and was an Israelite indeed, as Nathanael, for all are not Israel that are of Israel."

### John Wesley:
1. Are they Hebrews, Israelites, the seed of Abraham â€” These were the heads on which they boasted.
