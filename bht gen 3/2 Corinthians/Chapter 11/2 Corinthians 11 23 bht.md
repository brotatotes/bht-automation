# 2 Corinthians 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I speak as one beside myself, for I am more than just a minister of Christ. Paul's assertion of being more should not be misunderstood as arrogance, but rather as a recognition of his faithfulness, self-denial, and the abundant tokens of God's recognition of his ministry. He has endured imprisonments and countless beatings, even facing death on multiple occasions. Paul's boasting may seem out of character, but his labors, sufferings, and apostolic mission to the Gentiles set him apart as a servant of Christ beyond compare.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I speak as beside myself] I say it as a madman. This is far stronger than 'I speak in foolishness: it is said from a deep sense of his own unworthiness."
2. "The assertion, I am more, must not be misunderstood. He concedes to them their being ministers of Christ, and assumes (as it were in madness) for himself, something more."
3. "Paul is a minister in a much higher degree, more faithful, more self-denying, richer in gifts and divine tokens, than they."

1. "I speak as if beside myself." 
2. "I am more...more faithful and self-denying; and richer in tokens of God's recognition of my ministry."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bear in mind, in what I am now about to say, that he who speaks is accused of being a fool in boasting."
2. "His frequent reminding them of this charge was eminently suited to humble them that they had ever made it, especially when they were reminded by an enumeration of his trials, of the character of the man against whom the charge was brought."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As a fool [œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÜœÅŒøŒΩœâŒΩ] . Only here in the New Testament. See the kindred parafronia madness, 2 Peter 2:16. Lit., being beside myself Rev., as one beside myself."
2. "Strikes above measure [œÖœÄŒµœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩœÑœâœÇ] . This peculiar form of suffering is emphasized by details."
3. "Deaths. Perils of death, as at Damascus, Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Thessalonica, Beroea."

### John Calvin:
1. "For to be a servant of Christ is a thing that is much more honorable and illustrious, than to be the first-born among all the first-born of Abraham‚Äôs posterity."

"I am more; that is, more a minister of Christ than they, more manifestly so than they were; yea, he was more than an ordinary minister of Christ, he was an apostle, the apostle of the Gentiles, and laboured and suffered more than even the rest of the true apostles of Christ, and therefore must be greatly superior to the false ones."
2. "in labours more abundant; in taking fatiguing journeys, preaching the Gospel constantly, administering ordinances, working with his own hands, c."
