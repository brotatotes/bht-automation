## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was a frequent mode of punishment among the ancient nations, and as Paul was often persecuted, he would be naturally subjected to this shameful punishment."
2. "Had the assault been completed; had the history related that a stone was thrown, as it relates that preparations were made both by Jews and Gentiles to stone Paul and his companions; or even had the account of this transaction stopped without going on to inform us that Paul and his companions were aware of their danger and fled, a contradiction between the history and the Epistle would have ensued."
3. "The supposition of some commentators that he spent his time on some rock in the deep; or of others that this means some deep dungeon; or of others that he was swallowed by a whale (that is, a big fish), like Jonah, shows the extent to which the fancy is often indulged in interpreting the Bible."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck. The shipwreck at Malta, being later, is, of course, not referred to; so that no one of these three is on record." 
2. "A night and a day [νυχθημερον] . A compound term occurring only here in the New Testament, and rarely in later Greek."

### John Calvin:

2. "We have not, however, a complete narrative, nor is there mention made in it of every particular that occurred, but only of the principal things."
3. "Truth is necessarily consistent; but it is scarcely possible that independent accounts, not having truth to guide them, should thus advance to the very brink of contradiction without falling into it."

1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods...once was I stoned...thrice I suffered shipwreck...a night and a day I have been in the deep." 
2. "This phrase may only signify that the ship in which he was was drove from the coast into the sea, and lost sight of the land for the space of a day and night, and lay floating about in the deep, which was reckoned very dangerous."
