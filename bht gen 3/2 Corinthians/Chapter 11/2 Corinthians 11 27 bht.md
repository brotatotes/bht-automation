# 2 Corinthians 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul endured weariness, painfulness, frequent watchings, hunger, thirst, and frequent fastings in his ministry. These fastings were distinct from hunger and thirst, resulting from foodlessness. Insufficient clothing led to cold, while Paul's constant health issues made his self-devotion almost superhuman. Nevertheless, he persevered, not despising lesser trials, and serving Christ with a pure conscience. Ultimately, Paul's focus was on faithfully following Christ, considering all other challenges as additional.

1. "In weariness and painfulness,.... Through long journeys and frequent preaching; or 'in labour and trouble'; or in troublesome labour, for all labour is not so; as hunting, hawking, c. though laborious, yet delightful but the labours of the apostle were painful and troublesome to the flesh, though he had much inward spiritual delight and pleasure in them..."
2. "in watchings often; being sometimes engaged at midnight, either in preaching, or praying, or staging psalms, and sometimes obliged to work early and late with his own hands to supply his necessities..."
3. "in cold and nakedness; when travelling in the winter season, and but poorly clothed to keep him from the inclemencies of the weather; and having no certain dwelling place to retire unto and abide in, during any severe season there might be, and wanting the comforts of life to support him under such inconveniences."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having no place where to lay my head; no convenient raiment to cover me; yet appearing before noble-men, governors, kings"
