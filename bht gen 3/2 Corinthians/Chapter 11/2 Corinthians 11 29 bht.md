## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The minister of Christ takes on him the feelings of all, puts on the person of all, that he may accommodate himself to all."
2. "The weakness spoken of may be in various ways; in faith, as Rom. xiv. 1 al., or in purpose, or in courage: that of the Apostle, see 1 Cor. ix. 22, was a sympathetic weakness, a leaning to the same infirmity for the weak brotherâ€™s sake, but also a veritable trouble in himself on the weak brotherâ€™s account."
3. "In that case he was suffering with the weak: here he stands between the offender and the offended; indignant at the one, sympathizing with the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Care generates sympathy, which causes the minister of Christ personally to enter into the feelings of all his people, as if he stood in their position, so as to accommodate himself to all."
2. "The 'I' is emphatic, which it is not in the former clause, 'I am not weak.' I not only enter into the feeling of the party offended, but I burn with indignation at the offender, I myself taking up his cause as my own."
3. "Who meets with a stumbling-block and I am not disturbed even more than himself."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

3. "Take upon himself the afflictions of all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Who is weak, and I am not weak?" 
2. "Who is made to stumble, and I burn not?" 
3. "Does not draw out my sympathy and find me 'burning' with indignation against abusers of their Christian liberty, and thereby endangering the souls of those for whom Christ died?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I burn... when a brother stumbles."
2. "Paul is set on fire with grief."
3. "Paul is set on fire with grief... when a brother stumbles."

### John Gill:
1. "Who is weak, and I am not weak?.... What church is so? or what particular believer is so?"
2. "He was cautious of offending them, or doing anything by which their consciences should be defiled, and their peace be broken."
3. "He was as one in a flame, all on fire, full of grief and trouble till the cause of the offense was removed, and the person offended made easy and restored."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who â€” So he had not only the care of the churches, but of every person therein."
2. "Is weak, and I am not weak â€” By sympathy, as well as by condescension."
3. "And I burn not â€” Being pained as though I had fire in my bosom."
