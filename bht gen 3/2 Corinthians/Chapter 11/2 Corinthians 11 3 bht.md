2. "Where Eve first gave way, was in mentally harboring for a moment the possibility insinuated by the serpent, of GOD not having her truest interests at heart, and of this 'other' professing friend being more concerned for her than God."
3. "The same Greek stands for 'minds' as for 'thoughts'; intents of the will, or mind."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "This connection, however, is accomplished in Christ, as Paul teaches in Ephesians, (Ephesians 5:25.) He points out, however, at present the means of it ‚Äî when we remain in the pure simplicity of the gospel, for, as in contracting marriages among men, there are written contracts (802) drawn out, so the spiritual connection between us and the Son of God is confirmed by the gospel, as a kind of written contract." 
2. "By this he intimates that men‚Äôs minds are adulterated, (807) whenever they turn aside, even in the least degree, to the one side or to the other, from the pure doctrine of Christ."
3. "For if false teachers have a show of wisdom, if they have any power of eloquence for persuading, if they plausibly insinuate themselves into the minds of their hearers, and instill their poison by fawning artifices, it was in a similar way that Satan also beguiled Eve, as he did not openly declare himself to be an enemy, but crept in privily under a specious pretext."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity (the single-mindedness) that is toward Christ."
2. "There is here taken for granted, as a historical fact, both the narrative of the fall and the agency of Satan, in serpent form, in that transaction."
3. "His continued agency in the seduction of men from the paths of truth and safety, through the instrumentality of his ministers, is certainly implied."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The serpent beguiled Eve. Paul's only mention of the serpent in Eden." 
2. "The compound ŒµŒæŒ±œÄŒ±œÑŒ±œâ means to deceive completely."
3. "Corrupted. Second aorist passive subjunctive with ŒºŒ∑ œÄœâœÇ of œÜŒ∏ŒµŒπœÅœâ, to corrupt."
