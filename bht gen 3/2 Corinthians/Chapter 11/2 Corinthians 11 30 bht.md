# 2 Corinthians 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He will boast of his weaknessesâ€”of those things which made him appear mean and contemptible in the eyes of his adversaries. He is carried on in his fervency of self-renunciation amidst his apparent self-celebration, and he will even cast before his enemies the contemptible antecedents of his career, boasting in being despised, if only for what Christ had done in him. A character utterly incompatible with that of an enthusiast, he will be attested as a true apostle by the sufferings which show his weakness.
