## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The will of man has no share in receiving the Spirit, as it has in accepting the Gospel." 
2. "Seeing that there is but one gospel, and they and I profess to preach one Jesus and impart one Spirit, they have no such claim: mine is superior."
3. "There seems to be some excuse in that case, but even in that, really there is none, for your tolerating him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But there can be no new Gospel there is but the one which I first preached; therefore it ought not to be 'borne' by you, that the false teachers should attempt to supersede me."
2. "Another implies a distinct individual of the same kind; different implies one quite distinct in kind."
3. "There would be an excuse for your conduct, though a bad one (for ye ought to give heed to no Gospel other than what ye have already heard from me); but the false teachers do not even pretend they have 'another Jesus' and a 'different Gospel' to bring before you; they merely try to supplant me, your accredited Teacher."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main idea doubtless is, that Paul felt that there was danger that they would be corrupted."
2. "The gospel which he preached was as perfect as it could be, and that any change would be for the worse."
3. "Let us never forsake the gospel which we have until we are sure we can get a better."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Another denies the identity; a different denies the similarity of nature."
2. "You gladly endure these false teachers, why do you not endure me?"
3. "Ye endure them finely."

### John Calvin:
1. "How is it that they take so much liberty with you, and you submit patiently to their control?"
2. "Had they brought you another Christ, or another gospel, or another Spirit, different from what you received through my hands, I would assuredly approve of your regard for them."
3. "What sort of gratitude do you show in all but adoring those, to whom you are indebted for nothing, while you despise me, through whom God has bestowed upon you so many and so distinguished benefits?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I may well be jealous over you; for ye seem ready to drink in the teaching of men who come to you preaching another Jesus, and a different gospel, and claiming a 'spirit' very different from that which we brought to you and ye received." 
2. "Right gladly do ye listen to such; may ye not well, then, listen to me?"
3. "The suppressed irony is very keen."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Another Jesus (Œ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖŒΩ). Not necessarily a different Jesus, but any other 'Jesus' is a rival and so wrong. That would deny the identity."
2. "A different spirit (œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ± ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ). This is the obvious meaning of ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ in distinction from Œ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ as seen in Acts 4:12; Galatians 1:6. But this distinction in nature or kind is not always to be insisted on."
3. "A different gospel (ŒµœÖŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒπŒøŒΩ ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ). Similar use of ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ."

### John Gill:
1. "if he proposes and recommends in his ministry, a better Saviour and Redeemer than had been preached by the apostles; one that was better qualified, and more fit for the purposes of salvation"
2. "the spirit which the contrary ministers brought with it, and tended to not generate in them, must be the reverse of this, even a spirit of bondage again to fear"
3. "since another and a better Saviour than Jesus of Nazareth could not be proposed, or the doctrine of salvation by him be preached in another and better manner than it was"

### John Wesley:
1. If indeed ‚Äî Any could show you another Saviour, a more powerful Spirit, a better gospel.
Ye might well bear with him ‚Äî But this is impossible.
