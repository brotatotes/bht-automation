# 2 Corinthians 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul proceeds to share visions and revelations from the Lord, even though it is not to his advantage. These visions are a form of divine revelation personally given by the Lord. Paul emphasizes the power of Christ displayed through his weaknesses rather than boasting about his own glory. It is evident that boasting is unwise based on the proof provided by these revelations. While all parts of Scripture are inspired, not all are revelations from God. Paul's extraordinary visions and revelations were meant to guide, teach, and strengthen him during exceptional circumstances.

### Philip Schaff:
1.

1. "Though it was lawful for him to glory, and was necessary in the present circumstances of things, in vindication of himself, and to preserve the Corinthians from being carried away with the insinuations of the false apostles; and so for the honour and interest of Christ and the Gospel; yet it was not expedient on some other accounts, or profitable and serviceable to himself."
