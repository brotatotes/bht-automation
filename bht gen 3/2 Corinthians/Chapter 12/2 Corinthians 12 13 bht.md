# 2 Corinthians 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Were my efforts among you rendered ineffective because I worked without charge? You suffered loss compared to other churches, except for the fact that I didn't burden you with my support. This is an expression of wounded Love, pleading for your forgiveness. You were treated with less consideration, indicating possible spiritual inferiority and a lack of confidence and love towards you. Nonetheless, you were not lacking in spiritual gifts and graces, distinguishing yourselves in this regard from other churches who generously provided for their ministers.
