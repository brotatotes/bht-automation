# 2 Corinthians 12:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I did not take advantage of anyone, nor did my associates. It is important for those who seek to influence others for good to adhere to this rule. I go straight to the point without any hesitation. If you wonder whether I have ever defrauded you through anyone I have sent to you, I appeal to the facts and to what you know. Name a single person who has received money from you on my behalf, or any reason to believe that I have used them for such purposes. If you can't provide an example, then this accusation should be seen as slander and calumny. I emphatically deny that I have deceived you in any way.
