## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Spirit in which they walked was the Holy Spirit."
2. "In the same footsteps, viz. each as the other: they did not in the minutest particular deviate from my path."
3. "This brother was quite subordinate to Titus in the mission."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not the mission mentioned 2 Corinthians 8:6; 2 Corinthians 8:17; 2 Corinthians 8:22; but a mission previous to this Epistle."
2. "Our (literally, 'the') brother; one well known to the Corinthians, and perhaps a Corinthian."
3. "Same spirit - inwardly; steps - outwardly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They had received him kindly, treated him with affection, and sent him away with every proof of confidence and respect; see 2 Corinthians 7:7. How then could they now pretend that he had defrauded them?"
2. "Did not all his actions resemble mine? Was there not the same proof of honesty, sincerity, and love which I have ever manifested?"
3. "He now boldly appeals to them and asks whether Titus and he had not in fact acted in the same manner; and whether they had not alike evinced a spirit free from covetousness and deceit?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did Titus take advantage of you? (Î¼Î·Ï„ ÎµÏ€Î»ÎµÎ¿Î½ÎµÎºÏ„Î·ÏƒÎµÎ½ Ï…Î¼Î±Ï‚ Î¤Î¹Ï„Î¿Ïƒ?). That puts the issue squarely."
2. "By the same Spirit (Ï„Ï‰ Î±Ï…Ï„Ï‰ Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±Ï„). That translation refers to the Holy Spirit and makes the case instrumental."
3. "The locative case, 'in the same spirit,' makes it mean that Paul's attitude is the same as that of Titus and most likely is correct."

### John Gill:
1. "Did Titus make a gain of you? Did he greedily desire your substance? Did he show an avaricious temper, or a covetous inclination after your money?"
2. "Walked we not in the same Spirit? In the same Spirit of God, being directed and influenced by him; or in the same disposition of mind, being agreed and determined to preach the Gospel freely, and receive nothing for it."
3. "The apostle suggests, that where are the same Spirit, temper, disposition, and principles, there will be the same works and actions; and as for covetousness, it is neither agreeable to the Spirit of God, nor to the spirit of a Christian."

### John Wesley:
1. I desired Titus â€” To go to you.
