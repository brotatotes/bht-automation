## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I know (not, â€˜knew,â€™ as A.V.: which is a mistake in grammar, and introduces serious confusion, making it seem as if the fourteen years ago were the date of the knowledge, not, as it really is, of the vision) a man in Christ."
2. "whether in the body, I know not; or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth."
3. "The safest explanation is, not to follow any fixed division, but judging by the evident intention of the expression, to understand a high degree of celestial exaltation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such glory belonged not to him, but the weakness did. Nay, he did not even know whether he was in or out of the body when the glory was put upon him, so far was the glory from being his."
2. "His spiritual self was his highest and truest self: the flesh with its infirmity merely his temporary self."
3. "The occurrence TWICE of 'whether in the body . . . I know not, God knoweth,' and of 'lest I should be exalted above measure,' marks two stages in the revelation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Those who have been most favored with spiritual enjoyments will not be the most ready to proclaim it. They will cherish the remembrance in order to excite gratitude in their own hearts and support them in trial; they will not emblazon it abroad as if they were more the favorites of heaven than others are." 
2. "It may be added here, however, that Paul evidently supposed that his soul might be taken to heaven without the body, and that it might have separate consciousness and a separate existence. He was not, therefore, a materialist, and he did not believe that the existence and consciousness of the soul was dependent on the body."
3. "How happy would it be if all theologians were as ready to be satisfied with the knowledge of a fact, and to leave the mode of explaining it with God, as this prince of theologians was."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb suits the swift, resistless, impetuous seizure of spiritual ecstasy." 
2. "Third heaven. It is quite useless to attempt to explain this expression according to any scheme of celestial gradation."
3. "Some think that Paul describes two stages of his rapture; the first to the third heaven, from which he was borne, as if from a halting - point, up into Paradise."

### John Calvin:
1. "At the same time, this does not, in any degree, detract from the assurance of faith, which rests simply on this single point â€” that we are aware that God speaks to us."
2. "let us learn from this, that we must seek the knowledge of those things only that are necessary to be known, and leave other things to God."
3. "For our faith scales heaven and enters it, and those that are superior to others in knowledge get higher in degree and elevation, but to reach the third heavens has been granted to very few."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The obvious answer is, that he could not bear extolling himself so nakedly as the use of the first person would express."
2. "As the event was probably the most marvellous that ever occurred to him since his conversion, he is careful to specify the precise time of its occurrence."
3. "Enough to understand it of a height of translation towards 'the secret place of the Most High,' to which he was through life an utter stranger save at this time."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul singles out one incident of ecstasy in his own experience that he declines to describe." 
2. "The date was probably while Paul was at Tarsus. We have no details of that period."
3. "He seems to mean the highest heaven where God is."

### John Gill:
1. "He speaks in the third person...to show his modesty and humility, and how much he declined vain glory and popular applause."
2. "He studies as it were to conceal himself from being the person designed."
3. "The apostle did not know himself, and much less can any other be able to say how it was; it is best with him to refer and leave it to the omniscient God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whether in the body or out of the body I know not...it would be vain curiosity for us to attempt determining it."
2. "The third heaven â€” Where God is; far above the aerial and the starry heaven."
3. "Some suppose it was here the apostle was let into the mystery of the future state of the church; and received his orders to turn from the Jews and go to the gentiles."
