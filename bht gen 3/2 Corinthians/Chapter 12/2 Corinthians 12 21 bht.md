2. "He lets us know the disposition of a true and genuine Pastor...that he will look upon the sins of others with grief."
3. "It is, indeed, a thing that is common to all the pious, to be grieved in every case in which God is offended, and to bewail the ruin of brethren, and present themselves before God in their room as in a manner guilty, but it is more particularly requisite on the part of Pastors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "So bound up was his comfort in this and all his churches with their spiritual prosperity, that the prospect of finding the church which of all others lay most at his heart in the deplorable condition here described, sickened him at the thought of it, and held out to him only humiliation, in place of delight, in visiting them." 
2. "I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore falling back into those pollutions from which they had been delivered." 
3. "Missionaries who have been the happy instruments of rescuing sensual heathens from such vices as these, but find to their grief the same tendency, after a time, to return upon them, can best enter into the apostle‚Äôs feelings as here expressed, and will be the best expositors of them."

### John Gill:
1. "Another thing which he feared would be the case when he came again to them, that he himself should be afflicted and distressed, seeing them in a disorderly and dissolute course of life, be obliged to punish them, which would be an humiliation and matter of grief to him."
2. "Instead of rejoicing in the fruit of his labours, that they were not in vain, he signifies that he should have great sorrow of heart...inasmuch as he had boasted of them to others, he should be ashamed."
3. "Nothing was more grieving, and occasioned more sorrow and humiliation to the apostle, than the unbecoming walk of professors; and nothing more sensibly affects a faithful minister of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. Who had sinned before ‚Äî My last coming to Corinth.
