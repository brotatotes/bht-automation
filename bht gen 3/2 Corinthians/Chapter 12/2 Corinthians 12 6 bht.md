# 2 Corinthians 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I wish to be judged based on what you have seen and heard from me personally, not by any boasting I may do. I have good reason to boast, but I refrain from it because those who think too highly of themselves deceive themselves. I have no desire to be seen as foolish, which is why I speak of the Paul you have seen and heard, not the one who experienced revelations. I want you to form your opinion of me based on my present actions and teachings, rather than my past boasts.
