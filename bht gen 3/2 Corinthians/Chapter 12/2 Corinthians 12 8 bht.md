1. "For (‚Äòabout‚Äô) this thing I besought the Lord the Lord Christ, as is plain from the next verse, thrice, that it might depart from me therein following his Master when He prayed thrice that the cup might pass from Him; not three petitions merely, but at three successive times making this the subject of solemn entreaty."
2. "A poor attempt has been made to set aside the argument here, by urging that the word beseech here used is never employed to express prayer to God, and that it means not to invocate but rather to advocate...Any one with his Greek Testament in his hand will find it so used dozens of times."
3. "If this, then, was what Paul did to Christ, and Christ so answered him as implied His right to be so addressed, and to give the fitting answer, then the New Testament warrant to pray to Christ is conclusively settled, and with it His supreme Personal Divinity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
