# 2 Corinthians 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In response to Paul's plea for deliverance, God assures him that His grace is sufficient. The trial may endure, but so will the grace, never failing Paul. God's power is perfected in our weakness, making it more essential than our strength. Our weaknesses become an opportunity for Christ's power and grace to shine through us. Therefore, Paul gladly embraces his weaknesses, allowing the strength of Christ to rest upon him, so that the power of Christ may have its residence in him.
