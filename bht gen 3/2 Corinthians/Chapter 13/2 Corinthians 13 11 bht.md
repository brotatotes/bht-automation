## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "farewellâ€”meaning in Greek also 'rejoice'; thus in bidding farewell he returns to the point with which he set out, 'we are helpers of your joy'" (2 Corinthians 1:24; Philippians 4:4).
2. "Be perfectâ€”Become perfect by filling up what is lacking in your Christian character" (Ephesians 4:13).
3. "be of good comfort" (2 Corinthians 1:6; 2 Corinthians 7:8-13; 1 Thessalonians 4:18).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be perfect - A command to be perfect, however, does not prove that it has ever in fact been obeyed: and an earnest wish on the part of an apostle that others might be perfect, does not demonstrate that they were; and this passage should not be adduced to prove that any have been free from sin."
2. "Be of good comfort - Be consoled by the promises and supports of the gospel. Take comfort from the hopes which the gospel imparts."
3. "And the God of love and peace - The God who is all love, and who is the Author of all peace. What a glorious appellation is this! There can be no more beautiful expression, and it is as true as it is beautiful, that God is a God of love and of peace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Finally. As for the rest. Sometimes rendered now, for the time that remains."
2. "Farewell. It is somewhat doubtful whether it ever has the meaning farewell in the New Testament."
3. "Be perfect. Paul speaks both of individual perfection and of the perfection of the Church through the right adjustment of all its members in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "For then only are reproofs beneficial, when they are in a manner seasoned with honey, that the hearer may, if possible, receive them in an agreeable spirit."
2. "To be of one mind, and to live in peace, are expressions which mean two different things; for the one takes its rise from the other."
3. "God will be with us, if we cultivate peace among ourselves; but those that are at variance with each other are at a distance from him. For where there are strifes and contentions, there, it is certain, the devil reigns."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be perfect (â€˜perfectedâ€™). The word 'adjusted' (as a net put in order for casting), 'thoroughly furnished,' be of good comfort (â€˜comfortedâ€™)." 
2. "Be of one mind, the want of which was the first thing he complained of in his First Epistle (2 Corinthians 1:10)." 
3. "Live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."

### John Gill:
