## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "CONCLUDING BENEDICTION; remarkable for the distinct recognition of the Three Persons in the Holy Trinity."
2. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is put first; 'for by the grace of Christ men come 'to the love of the Father.'"
3. "And this blessing he invokes, not on a few individuals, or any one section of the Corinthian Church, but expressly on every portion and every individual of those with whom, throughout these two Epistles, he had so earnestly and so variously argued and contended."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The grace of Christ" comes first, for it is only by it we come to "the love of God" the Father.
2. Whoever has "the fellowship of the Holy Ghost," has also "the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ," and "the love of God"; and vice versa.
3. The doctrine of the Trinity was not revealed clearly and fully till Christ came, and the whole scheme of our redemption was manifested in Him, and we know the Holy Three in One more in their relations to us than in their mutual relations to one another.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If so, it is right to offer worship to the Lord Jesus and to the Holy Spirit."
2. "The Holy Spirit is a person, or has a distinct personality."
3. "The passage, therefore, furnishes a proof of the doctrine of the Trinity that has not yet been answered, and, it is believed, cannot be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The grace, etc. The most complete benediction of the Pauline epistles." 
2. "In most of the epistles the introductory benedictions are confined to grace and peace." 
3. "In the closing benedictions uniformly grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "The term grace does not here mean unmerited favor, but is taken by metonymy, to denote the whole benefit of redemption."
2. "For God, viewed in himself, loved us before the creation of the world, and redeemed us for no other reason than this â€” because he loved us. As for us, on the other hand, as we see in ourselves nothing but occasion of wrath, that is, sin, we cannot apprehend any love of God towards us without a Mediator."
3. "The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is added, because it is only under his guidance, that we come to possess Christ, and all his benefits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Remarkable it is that an Epistle written under a tempest of conflicting emotions, breathing in some places indignation, reproach, and sadness, [...] the one which the Christian Church in every land and of every age has found, and will find as long as the world lasts, the most available for public use, as a close to its worship." 
2. "Observe the characteristic features in the agency of each of the Persons in the Godhead as here assigned them."
3. "This is that 'communion of the Holy Ghost' which is here invoked."

### John Gill:
1. "This passage contains no inconsiderable proof of a trinity of persons in the Godhead, to whom distinct things are here ascribed, and of them asked, equal objects of prayer and worship."
2. "Meaning either the love of Christ...is the ground and foundation of all he has done and underwent for his people."
3. "Or else that communion and fellowship which the Spirit of God leads the saints into with the Father...and with the Son."
