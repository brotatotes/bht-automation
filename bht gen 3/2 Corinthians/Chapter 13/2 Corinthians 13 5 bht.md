# 2 Corinthians 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly know if we are in the faith, we must examine ourselves and prove our own selves. It is far more important for us to ensure that we are walking in the faith and living out the love of Christ rather than questioning the validity of others' faith. Instead of seeking proof of others' faith, we should test our own spiritual condition to discern if Christ is in us as a result of our faith in Him. Our focus should be on personal self-assessment rather than trying to prove others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "You want to prove Christ speaking in me:â€”if you necessitate this proof, it will be given."
2. "But I will tell you whom rather to prove, Prove YOURSELVES; there let your attention be concentrated, if you will apply tests."
3. "reprobates, literally, â€˜not abiding the proof,â€™ worthless,â€”i. e. in this case, â€˜mere pretended Christians.â€™"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Examineâ€”Greek, 'Try (make trial of) yourselves.'"
2. "This should be your first aim, rather than 'seeking a proof of Christ speaking in me.'"
3. "If ye try your own selves ye will see that Christ is also in you."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "So important are the interests at stake, and so liable are the best to deceive themselves, that all Christians should be often induced to examine the foundation of their hope of eternal salvation."
2. "That religion which will enable a man to imitate the example of Paul or Howard, or the great Master himself, in doing good, is genuine."
3. "If they are Christians, they may know it with as undoubted certainty as they may know their character on any other subject. Why should not a man be as able to determine whether he loves God as whether he loves a child, a parent, or a friend?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Instead of putting Christ to the test, test yourselves."
2. "Trial implies a definite intent to ascertain their spiritual condition."
3. "Assuming that you thus prove yourselves, does not this test show you that Christ is in you as the result of your faith in him?"

### John Calvin:
1. "Then only has a minister a true and well grounded assurance for the approbation of his doctrine, when he can appeal to the consciences of those whom he has taught, that, if they have any thing of Christ, and of sincere piety, they may be constrained to acknowledge his fidelity."
2. "For, in the first place, it shows the relation, which subsists between the faith of the people, and the preaching of the minister â€” that the one is the mother, that produces and brings forth, and the other is the daughter, that ought not to forget her origin."
3. "Let us, therefore, reckon that alone to be right faith, which leads us to repose in safety in the favor of God, with no wavering opinion, but with a firm and steadfast assurance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Try your own selves...whether ye be in the faith or are Christians in name only; prove your own selves." 
2. "Know ye not your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you?" 
3. "Christians only in name, of whom Christ will say, 'I never knew you.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul challenged his opposers in Corinth to try themselves, to test themselves, whether they were 'in the faith', a much more vital matter for them than trying to prove Paul a heretic."
2. "Such tests can be made, unless, alas, they are 'reprobate', the very adjective that Paul held up before himself as a dreadful outcome to be avoided."
3. "a much more vital matter for them than trying to prove Paul a heretic."

### John Gill:
1. "He advises them to examine the state of their own souls, and see whether they were in the faith."
2. "If they took a survey of things in their own souls, it would appear that Christ was in them."
3. "If upon examination they were found to be in the faith, and Christ in them, then they did not want a proof of Christ speaking in him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Prove yourselves â€” Whether ye are such as can, or such as cannot, bear the test - This is the proper meaning of the word which we translate, reprobates."
2. "Know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you - All Christian believers know this, by the witness and by the fruit of his Spirit."
3. "Some translate the words, Jesus Christ is among you; that is, in the church of Corinth; and understand them of the miraculous gifts and the power of Christ which attended the censures of the apostle."

- Attempt 1 BHT: If we are truly seeking to know Christ and to grow in our faith, we must first examine ourselves. Instead of being preoccupied with proving the authenticity of others' faith or the authority of their teaching, we should focus on testing and proving our own selves.

This self-assessment is crucial as it helps us to discern whether we are authentic Christians or merely pretenders. It is far more important for us to ensure that we are walking in the faith and living out the love of Christ rather than questioning the validity of others' faith.
