# 2 Corinthians 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our power is not against the truth, but rather on behalf of it. We can do nothing against the truth, but our apostolic power is meant to further the cause and spread of the truth. When you walk in the truth, there is no opportunity for us to show our power against you. Our aim is to promote and establish the truth, and we desire to use our power not against the innocent, but in support of well-doing. Though we may be able to hold down the truth by evil deeds, in the end, the truth triumphs.
