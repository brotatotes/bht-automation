## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not come again to you in sorrow... implying, that some former visit had been in grief." 
2. "Clearly the first visit... could not be thus described: we must therefore infer, that an intermediate unrecorded visit had been paid by him." 
3. "In sorrow is explained in vv. 2, 3 to mean in mutual grief. 'I grieving you (ver. 2), and you grieving me' (ver. 3): not St. Paulâ€™s grief alone, nor grief alone inflicted on them by St. Paul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The same antithesis between Paul and them appears in 2 Corinthians 1:23."
2. "He had already paid them one visit in sorrow since his coming for the first time to Corinth."
3. "The 'in heaviness' implies mutual pain; they grieving him, and he them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I made up my mind on this point; I formed this resolution in regard to my course."
2. "I resolved, therefore, to endeavor to remove these evils before I came, that when I did come, my visit might be mutually agreeable to us both."
3. "It was really from no fickleness, but it was from love to them, and a desire that his visit should be mutually agreeable."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul, with affectionate tact, puts it as if he had taken this resolution for his own pleasure." 
2. "He refers to the sorrow which his coming would bring to the Church."
3. "Referring to a former unrecorded visit."

### John Calvin:

2. "I had determined... not to come to you any more in sorrow."
3. "He chose rather to give them longer time for repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow." 
2. "This is so plainly a continuance of his explanation of the delay of his expected visit to Corinth."
3. "It is a pity a new chapter should in the recognised division have begun here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Had he paid another visit besides that described in 2 Corinthians 2:18 which was in sorrow... Either interpretation is possible as the Greek stands and scholars disagree."
2. "So in 2 Corinthians 12:14 'The third time I am ready to come' may refer to the proposed second visit (2 Corinthians 1:15) and the present plan (a third). And so as to 2 Corinthians 13:1."
3. "There is absolutely no way to tell clearly whether Paul had already made a second visit. If he had done so, it is a bit odd that he did not plainly say so in 2 Corinthians 1:15 when he is apologizing for not having made the proposed visit."

### John Gill:
1. "He determined with himself, he took up a resolution within his own breast some time ago, says he, that I would not come again to you in heaviness." 
2. "He determined to wait their repentance and amendment before he came again." 
3. "As his first coming among them was to the joy of their souls, so it was a determined case with him, that his second coming should not be with grief, either to them or himself, or both."

### John Wesley:
1. In grief â€” Either on account of the particular offender, or of the church in general.
