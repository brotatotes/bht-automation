## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is the only fair rendering of the words; implying, that some former visit had been in grief."
2. "Clearly the first visit, Acts xviii. 1 ff., could not be thus described: we must therefore infer, that an intermediate unrecorded visit had been paid by him."
3. "In sorrow is explained in vv. 2, 3 to mean in mutual grief. â€˜I grieving you (ver. 2), and you grieving meâ€™ (ver. 3): not St. Paulâ€™s grief alone, nor grief alone inflicted on them by St. Paul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The same antithesis between Paul and them appears in 2 Corinthians 1:23." 
2. "At that visit he had warned them 'he would not spare if he should come again'."
3. "The 'in heaviness' implies mutual pain; they grieving him, and he them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I made up my mind on this point; I formed this resolution in regard to my course."
2. "I would not come, if I could avoid it, in circumstances which must have grieved both me and you."
3. "I resolved, therefore, to endeavor to remove these evils before I came, that when I did come, my visit might be mutually agreeable to us both."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "With myself [ÎµÎ¼Î±Ï…Ï„Ï‰] . Rev., better, for myself. Paul, with affectionate tact, puts it as if he had taken this resolution for his own pleasure."
2. "In heaviness [ÎµÎ½ Î»Ï…Ï€Î·] . Meaning, apparently, the apostle's own sorrowful state of mind. This is wrong. He refers to the sorrow which his coming would bring to the Church."
3. "Again. Referring to a former unrecorded visit."

### John Calvin:
1. "I had determined...not to come to you any more in sorrow."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow." 
2. "This is so plainly a continuance of his explanation of the delay of his expected visit to Corinth."
3. "It is a pity a new chapter should in the recognised division have begun here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What does Paul mean by 'again'? Had he paid another visit besides that described in 2 Corinthians 2:18 which was in sorrow? Or does he mean that having had one joyful visit he does not wish the second one to be in sorrow?" 
2. "Either interpretation is possible as the Greek stands and scholars disagree."
3. "There is absolutely no way to tell clearly whether Paul had already made a second visit. If he had done so, it is a bit odd that he did not plainly say so in 2 Corinthians 1:15 when he is apologizing for not having made the proposed visit."

### John Gill:
1. "That he would not come with sorrow and heaviness, bewailing their sins not repented of, and by sharp reproofs and censures, which in such a case would be necessary, be the cause of grief and trouble to them."
2. "In his former epistle, which was a sort of coming to them, he made them heavy and sorry, by sharply rebuking them for some disorders that were among them."
3. "As his first coming among them was to the joy of their souls, so it was a determined case with him, that his second coming should not be with grief, either to them or himself, or both."

### John Wesley:
1. In grief â€” Either on account of the particular offender, or of the church in general.
