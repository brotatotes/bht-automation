# 2 Corinthians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gospel has a polarizing effect on those who hear it. Unbelievers perceive it as a putrid stench, an association with death and unbelief that leads to spiritual demise. In contrast, believers experience it as a sweet aroma, a proclamation of resurrection and abundant life that invigorates their faith. This stark contrast poses the question of who is capable of adequately fulfilling the role of a minister. It emphasizes the insufficiency of human effort and attributes competence to God alone, who empowers ministers for the life-giving proclamation of Christ.

1. "These preach up salvation by the death of Christ, and so are the sweet savour of the death of Christ; but this being despised and rejected by the sons of men, is 'unto the death', and issues in the eternal death of the despisers and rejecters of it."
2. "The Gospel preached by Christ's faithful ministers is the means of quickening souls, and giving them 'spiritual life'; and of supporting and maintaining that life, and of nourishing them up unto 'eternal life'; and so becomes 'the savour of life' spiritual, 'unto life' eternal."
3. "Who is sufficient for the preaching of the Gospel? no man is sufficient of himself, very insufficient in the best sense, and none so but by the grace of God, and gifts of his Spirit; or who is sufficient to give success to the Gospel when preached? none can do this; Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but it is God alone that gives the increase."

### John Wesley:
1. And who is sufficient for these things â€” No man living, but by the power of God's Spirit.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse speaks of two distinct responses to the preaching of the gospel. For those who reject Christ, the message is like a foul odor that leads to death. It is a reminder of Christ's crucifixion, evoking unbelief and working death in their lives. However, for believers, the gospel message is a fragrance of life that leads to eternal life. It is a proclamation of Christ's resurrection and brings about faith in Him, working life in those who receive it. The contrast between these two responses emphasizes the impact of the gospel and raises the question of who can fulfill the role of a sufficient minister. The verse highlights the insufficiency of human efforts and attributes any sufficiency to God, who enables and empowers ministers to proclaim the life-giving message of Christ.
