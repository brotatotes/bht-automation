# 2 Corinthians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we must faithfully deliver the unadulterated word of God without seeking personal gain or popularity. Just as hucksters would mix and corrupt wine for profit, false teachers would dilute the Gospel for their own selfish aims. Our goal should be to hold forth Christ, speaking before God Himself, as members of His body. Our ministry has eternal consequences, and we must remember that we are in the sight of God, the witness and spectator of all that we do.

3. "Whoever has the three following things, is in no danger of forming the purpose of corrupting the word of God. The first is â€” that we be actuated by a true zeal for God. The second is â€” that we bear in mind that it is his business that we are transacting, and bring forward nothing but what has come from him. The third is â€” that we consider, that we do nothing of which he is not the witness and spectator, and thus learn to refer every thing to his judgment."
