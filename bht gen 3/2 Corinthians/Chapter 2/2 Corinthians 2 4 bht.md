## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Explanation (for) that he did not write in levity of purpose, but under great trouble of mind,â€”not to grieve them, but to testify his love."
2. "he wrote, out of (this was the inducement) much tribulation (inward, of spirit, not outward) and anguish of heart with (under the accompaniment and as it were investiture of) many tears."
3. "more abundantly] Estius thinks, the comparative is not to be pressed, but understood as â€˜overmuchâ€™ (in the A.V.) in ver. 7,â€” 'exceedingly.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I wrote my letter to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart, and with many tears." 
2. "My ultimate and main object was, 'not that ye might be made sorry,' but that through sorrow you might be led to repentance, and so to joy, redounding both to you and me."
3. "'Love' is the source from which sincere reproof springs; that the Corinthians might ultimately recognize this as his motive, was the apostle's aim."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The evil conduct of others gives pain to a good man; and the necessity of administering reproof and discipline is often as painful to him who does it, as it is to those who are the subjects of it."
2. "This is also a specimen of the manner in which Paul met the faults of his Christian brethren. It was not with bitter denunciation. It was not with sarcasm and ridicule. It was not by emblazoning those faults abroad to others. It was not with the spirit of rejoicing that they had committed errors, and had been guilty of sin. It was not as if he was glad of the opportunity of administering rebuke, and took pleasure in denunciation and in the language of reproof. All this is often done by others; but Paul pursued a different course."
3. "It is proof of genuine friendship for another, when we faithfully and affectionately admonish him of the error of his course; it is the highest proof of affection when we do it with tears. It is cruelty to suffer a brother to remain in sin unadmonished; it is cruel to admonish him of it in a harsh, severe, and authoritative tone; but it is proof of tender attachment when we go to him with tears, and entreat him to repent and reform."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Anguish, from the Latin, angere to choke: anger, which, in earlier English, means affiction, mental torture." 
2. "The Latin anguis a snake, marking the serpent by his throttling."
3. "It reappears obscurely in our medical term quinsy, which was originally quinancy, Greek kunagkh dog - throttling, med., cynanche."

### John Calvin:
1. "Intensity of grief has extorted from me everything that I have written."
2. "Tears, which in a man that is brave and magnanimous, are a token of intense grief."
3. "The more tender the affections of love are, they are so much the more praiseworthy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Contraction of heart, a spiritual angina pectoris."
2. "He dictated that letter 'through tears' (accompanied by tears)."
3. "Proleptic position of Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î·Î½ and ingressive second aorist active subjunctive Î³Î½Ï‰Ï„Îµ, come to know."

### John Gill:
1. "I wrote to you with many tears; as signs and expressions of, and by which were vented, the inward anguish and distress of his soul;"
2. "which was written, not that you should be grieved; that is, not merely for the sake of grieving of them, in which he took no pleasure;"
3. "his chief view was, next to their spiritual good, and God's glory, to express the greatness of his love to them."

### John Wesley:
1. From much anguish I wrote to you, not so much that ye might be grieved, as that ye might know by my faithful admonition my abundant love toward you.
