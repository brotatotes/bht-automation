## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if any one hath caused sorrow, he hath grieved, not me, but in part, that I be not too heavy on him." 
2. "A delicate way of pointing out the one who had occasioned it."
3. "More or less; 'partially,' this gives the reason why he used the expression 'more or less,' which qualifies the blame cast on the offender."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'any' is a delicate way of referring to the incestuous person."
2. "He has grieved me only in part, that is, I am not the sole party aggrieved; most of you, also, were aggrieved."
3. "That I may not unduly lay the weight of the charge on you all, which I should do, if I made myself to be the sole party aggrieved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not harshly charge him with sin; he did not use any abusive or severe epithets; but he gently insinuates that he 'had caused grief;â€™ he had pained the hearts of his brethren."
2. "He has grieved me only in common with others, and as a part of the church of Christ. All have common cause of grief; and I have no interest in it which is not common to you all."
3. "But I would not charge the whole church with it; or seem to bear hard on them, or overcharge them with lack of zeal for their purity..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not that Paul did not grieve over the offender; but he desires to emphasize the fact that the injury caused by the sin was not to him personally, but to the Church."
2. "Overcharge, however, is not incorrect, though possibly ambiguous in the light of the various uses of charge. Charge is from the Latin carrus a wagon. Hence charge is a load... all implying a burden, either of pecuniary or of other responsibility, or of guilt."
3. "Thus you all depends upon he hath caused sorrow, not upon that I press not too heavily upon. Render, as Rev., He hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all."

2. "He hath not grieved me alone, but almost all of you."
3. "I do so in order that I may not bear too hard upon him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The wrong has been done, not to me, but to some extent (for I would not press you too hard) to you all."
2. "This is somewhat obscurely expressed, but the emphatic 'me' seems to give the meaning..."
3. "Referring delicately and indirectly to the offender, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In both cases Paul shows delicacy of feeling by not mentioning the name."
2. "The whole Corinthian Church has been injured in part by this man's wrongdoing."
3. "He does not wish to give pain by too severe language."

### John Gill:
1. "if", seeing, or although he has caused grief... he hath not grieved me but in part; or in some measure..."
2. "besides, though this man did grieve him, it was but in part; he was not the sole cause of his grief: they also greatly added to it by their unconcernedness of him, and negligence in reproving him..."
3. "he hath not grieved me, but in part, or in some measure... almost all of you..."

### John Wesley:
1. He hath grieved me but in part â€” Who still rejoice over the greater part of you. Otherwise I might burden you all.
