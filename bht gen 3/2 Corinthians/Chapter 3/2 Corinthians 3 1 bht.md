# 2 Corinthians 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Have we really sunk so low as to need letters of recommendation? Is our character so tarnished that we have to resort to self-praise and dishonest means? Paul questions whether certain false teachers coming with letters of commendation have influenced the belief that he too needs such letters. Indeed, in those times, it was natural for letters of recommendation to be given, but Paul relied on his zeal, self-denial, and success to make himself known and earn the affections of those he ministered to, a much better recommendation than mere introductory letters.
