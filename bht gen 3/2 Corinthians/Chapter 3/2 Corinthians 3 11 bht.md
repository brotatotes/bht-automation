# 2 Corinthians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ministry of the Old Testament, which was marked by glory, is being done away with, making room for the New Testament ministry. The everlasting gospel now remains in glory, accompanied by the Spirit, life, and righteousness. The contrast between the Old and New Testaments highlights the opposition of Judaizers in Corinth, but Paul confidently declares the superiority and permanence of Christianity. The law, in all its forms, is passing away, while the gospel endures as the glorious and everlasting economy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If that which is being done away was with glory, much more is that which abideth in glory." 
2. "The whole purpose which that ministry served, which was parenthetical and to come to an end."
3. "The everlasting gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "was glorious‚Äîliterally, 'was with glory'; or 'marked by glory.'" 
2. "that which remaineth‚Äîabideth (Revelation 14:6). Not 'the ministry,' but the Spirit, and His accompaniments, life and righteousness."
3. "is glorious‚Äîliterally, 'is in glory.' The Greek 'with' or 'by' is appropriately applied to that of which the glory was transient. 'In' to that of which the glory is permanent. The contrast of the Old and New Testaments proves that Paul's chief opponents at Corinth were Judaizers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Law he calls œÑŒøÃÄ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÅŒ≥ŒøÃÅœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ to katargoumenon the thing which was to be made to cease; to be put an end to; to be done away with; to be abolished. It had no permanency; and it was designed to have none."
2. "The gospel is permanent, or abiding...its effects on the heart are permanent. It is complete in itself."
3. "The gospel contemplates a great, permanent, and eternal good, adapted to all ages, all climes, all people, and all worlds. It is, therefore, so much more glorious than the limited, temporary, and partial good of the Mosaic system, that that may be said in comparison to have had no glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That which is done away... in course of abolition through the preaching of the Gospel." 
2. "Both the A. V., and Rev. passeth fail to bring out the idea of process." 
3. "Was glorious... with glory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For if that which passeth away which was in its own nature but transitory, was with glory was ushered in with manifestations of awful glory much more that which remaineth the enduring economy is in glory."
2. "Now comes the application of all this."
3. "The enduring economy is in glory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The new ministry is permanent. This claim may be recommended to those who clamour for a new religion." 
2. "Christianity is still alive and is not dying." 
3. "Surely Paul has kept nothing back here, no mental reservations, in this triumphant claim of superiority."

### John Gill:
1. "The law is 'that which is done away'; not merely the ceremonial law, or the judicial law, but the whole ministry of Moses."
2. "Distinguish between the law, as in the hands of Moses and of Christ; as in the hands of Moses it is broken to pieces and abolished, as in the hands of Christ, as King in his church, it remains."
3. "The Gospel is 'that which remaineth'; which denotes the continued efficacy, the incorruptibleness, the inexpugnableness, and duration of it; notwithstanding all the opposition of men and devils to it, still its blessings, promises, doctrines, ordinances, and effects continue."

### John Wesley:
1. That which remaineth ‚Äî That dispensation which remains to the end of the world; that spirit and life which remain for ever.
