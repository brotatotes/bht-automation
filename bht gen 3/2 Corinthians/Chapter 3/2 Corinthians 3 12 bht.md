Having the hope of future glory from the ministration of the Gospel, we speak openly and plainly, concealing nothing and using great boldness of speech.

We express ourselves in the language of common life, proclaiming the wonders of grace in Christ Jesus with all openness and boldness. The great truths now openly proclaimed in the Gospel were once hidden under the figures of the legal economy, but now they may be fully and confidently declared.
