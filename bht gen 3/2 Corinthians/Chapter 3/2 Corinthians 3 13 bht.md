# 2 Corinthians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After finishing his speech, Moses placed a veil on his face not because the Israelites couldn't handle the radiance, but so that they wouldn't see it fade away. This concealment represented the interruptions in God's revelations through Moses. In contrast, the gospel ministry is characterized by open and full proclamation. Paul compares the veiled ministry of Moses to the gospel ministry that progresses from one glory to another, without ever ending. The remaining veil on the unbelieving Jew signifies their blindness to the ultimate fulfillment brought by Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He spoke to them without the vail, with his face shining and glorified:â€”when he had done speaking, he placed the vail on his face: and that, not because they were afraid to look on him, but as here, that they might not look on the end, or the fading, of that transitory glory; that they might only see it as long as it was the credential of his ministry, and then it might be withdrawn from their eyes."
2. "Thus the declaration of Godâ€™s will to then was not in openness of speech, but was interrupted and broken by intervals of concealment, which ours is not. The opposition is twofold: (1) between the vailed and the unvailed ministry, as regards the mere fact of concealment in the one case, and openness in the other: (2) between the ministry which was suspended by the vailing, that its end might not be seen, and that which proceeds from glory to glory, having no termination."
3. "For (answering to an understood clause, â€˜and remain hardenedâ€™) to the present day the same vail (which was once on the face of Moses) remains at the reading of the Old Covenant...that it (the Old Test.) is done away (or, being done away: but the other is better here) in Christ (that the Old Covenant has passed away, being superseded by Christ)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The veil was the symbol of concealment, put on directly after Moses' speaking; so that God's revelations by him were interrupted by intervals of concealment."
2. "Paul here passes from the literal fact to the truth symbolized by it, the blindness of Jews and Judaizers to the ultimate end of the law: stating that Moses put on the veil that they might not look steadfastly at (Christ, 2 Corinthians 3:7- :) the end of that (law) which (like Moses' glory) is done away."
3. "The veil which has been taken off to the believer is left on to the unbelieving Jew, so that he should not see. He stops short at the letter of the law, not seeing the end of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Our conduct is not like that of Moses. We make no attempt to conceal anything in regard to the nature, design, and duration of the gospel. We leave nothing designedly in mystery."
2. "There was a glory and splendor in that which the institutions of Moses typified, which the children of Israel were not permitted then to behold."
3. "There was a splendor and a glory in the gospel which the Mosaic institutions were designed to typify, which was so great that the children of Israel were not fully prepared to see it, and that he designedly threw over that glory the veil of obscure types and figures."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "When he ceased speaking he put a veil on his face;" not because the Israelites could not endure the radiance, but that they should not see it fade away."
2. "Paul's comparison is between the ministry of Moses, interrupted by intervals of concealment, and the gospel ministry, which is marked by frank and full proclamation."
3. "The face of Moses needed a continually renewed illumination : in the face of Christ the glory abides forever."

### John Calvin:
1. "He did not intentionally involve his doctrine in obscurity, but that the fault was on the part of the people."
2. "He was contented with faithfully discharging the duty assigned to him."
3. "That bluntness, or that weak and obtuse vision, of which Paul is now speaking, is confined to unbelievers exclusively."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Moses veiled his face that they â€˜might not look stedfastly unto the end (Ï„ á½¸ Ï„Î­Î»Î¿Ï‚) of that which was passing away;â€™" (63 words).
2. "Bright as was the glory of Moses' economy, like that of his countenance when he came forth from having this disclosed to him from the excellent glory, and transitory as it was like the glory of his own countenance yet it was too bright for their gaze" (52 words).
3. "To them it behoved to be a veiled economy, like the veiled face of the lawgiver while giving it forth to them" (28 words).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Put a veil upon his face."
2. "That the children of Israel should not look steadfastly."
3. "The Authorized Version had a wrong translation here."

### John Gill:
1. "the veil upon his face had a mystery in it; it was an emblem of the Gospel being veiled under the law, and of the darkness and obscurity of the law in the business of life and salvation"
2. "the future blindness of the Jews, when the glory of the Gospel should break forth in the times of Christ and his apostles"
3. "to Christ, who is the end of the law, which is abrogated by him: to him they could not look, nor could they see him to be the fulfilling end of the law for righteousness"

### John Wesley:

2. "The whole Mosaic dispensation tended to, and terminated in, [Christ]."
3. "The Israelites had only a dim, wavering sight of him, of whom Moses spake in an obscure, covert manner."
