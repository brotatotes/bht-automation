# 2 Corinthians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tragic reality is that there is a veil over the hearts and minds of those who do not see that the Mosaic economy has been done away in Christ. Just as Moses' face was veiled, their minds are blinded and hardened, preventing them from understanding the true meaning of the Old Testament. Even today, the same veil remains unlifted, obscuring the glory of their own Scriptures. However, in Christ, this veil is removed, and He becomes the key to unlocking the true splendor of the law and the Gospel.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Their thoughts (ŒΩŒøŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±) literally. Œ†œâœÅŒøœâ (first aorist passive indicative here) is late verb from œÄœâœÅŒøœÇ, hard skin, to cover with thick skin, to petrify."
