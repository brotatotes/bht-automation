This vivid and distressing picture, applicable to the Jews in Paul's time and even now, shows their retreat into darkness and their preference for their temporary system over embracing the light of the Gospel.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Whenever the Scriptures of Moses are read, there is a veil over their understanding. This veil represents the spiritual blindness and ignorance of the Jews, who refuse to see the true meaning and beauty of their own Scriptures. The rabbis, with their wilful blindness and devotion to their own traditions, have set aside the word of God. This description of the Jews in Paul's time is still accurate today, as they remain trapped in their own darkness, unable to see the inherent imperfection of their provisional system.
