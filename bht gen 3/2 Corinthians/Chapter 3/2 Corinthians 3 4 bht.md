# 2 Corinthians 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our confidence is not a vain boast, but rests on the power imparted to us through Christ in regard to God's work and our own account to be given to Him. This confidence is solid and real, as looking to Him for the strength needed now and the reward of grace to be given hereafter. Human confidence is unreal in that it looks to man for help and its reward. Through Christ, we have confidence toward God and to whom we must account for our work.
