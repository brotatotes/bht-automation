# 2 Corinthians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our ability to carry on any process of thinking or action does not originate from ourselves, but rather comes from God. We cannot expect too little from ourselves and too much from God. We have no power to originate such confidence or sufficiency on our own. All success, even in the power of close thinking, is to be attributed to God. We are not sufficient of ourselves for any spiritual work, but our sufficiency comes from God.
