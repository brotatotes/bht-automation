3. "The spirit giveth life, not merely life eternal, but the whole new life of the man of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "The spirit of the Gospel when brought home to the heart by the Holy Spirit, gives new spiritual life to a man. This 'spirit of life' is for us in Christ Jesus, who dwells in the believer as a 'quickening' or 'life-giving Spirit.'"

### Albert Barnes:

2. "They were appointed to go forth and make the provisions of that new covenant known to a dying world."

2. "By the term letter, therefore, is meant literal preaching â€” that is, dead and ineffectual, perceived only by the ear. By the term spirit, on the other hand, is meant spiritual doctrine, that is, what is not merely uttered with the mouth, but effectually makes its way to the souls of men with a lively feeling."
3. "The meaning of this passage, however, is as follows â€” that, if the word of God is simply uttered with the mouth, it is an occasion of death, and that it is lifegiving, only when it is received with the heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not we are fit of our-selves... but our fitness is from God." 
2. "The spirit that word of the Gospel which, instinct with quickening power, 'is spirit and life,' for the letter killeth."
3. "A contrast, extending to the end of the chapter, between the two dispensations, both in their essential character as killing and as quickening and, as a consequence from this, in that freedom and openness which are distinctive of the Gospel and its ministry."

3. "Only God can make us that."

### John Gill:
1. "Our sufficiency is of God, he hath made us able, or sufficient ministers."
2. "The covenant of grace is... called 'new', as well as because it will always continue so, and never give way to another covenant."
3. "The Gospel is 'the spirit'; it contains spiritual things, and not things merely natural, moral, and civil, as does the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "The letter â€” The law, the Mosaic dispensation. Killeth â€” Seals in death those who still cleave to it."
2. "But the Spirit â€” The gospel, conveying the Spirit to those who receive it. Giveth life â€” Both spiritual and eternal."
3. "If we adhere to the literal sense even of the moral law, if we regard only the precept and the sanction as they stand in themselves, not as they lead us to Christ, they are doubtless a killing ordinance, and bind us down under the sentence of death."
