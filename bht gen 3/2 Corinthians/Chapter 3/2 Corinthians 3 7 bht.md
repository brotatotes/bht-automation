# 2 Corinthians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law, engraved on stones, brought death and knowledge of sin, in contrast to the life-giving Spirit of the Gospel. The glory that shone from Moses' face on Sinai represented the transitory nature of the law, in comparison to the permanent, increasing glory of the Gospel. While the law brings death, the Gospel brings life and freedom. The splendor of the law testified to its divine authority, but the Gospel, being superior, shines forth with even greater glory.
