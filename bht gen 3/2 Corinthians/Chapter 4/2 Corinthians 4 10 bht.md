# 2 Corinthians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through our daily exposure to death for the cause of Jesus, we bear in our bodies the image of the suffering Savior.

These sufferings, though contemptible to the world, hold honor in the sight of God and will ultimately lead to the manifestation of Jesus' life in us.
