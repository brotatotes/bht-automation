## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the trials by which the dying of Jesus is exhibited in us, are exclusively and peculiarly OUR OWN, whereas... the life, whereof we are to be witnesses, extends beyond ourselves, nay finds its field of action and energizing IN YOU."
2. "the vivifying influence of His Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is spoken of as extending to the body also; here, the upholding influence of Him who delivers and preserves the body, is spoken of as vivifying the whole man: LIFE, in both places, being the higher and spiritual life, including the lower and natural."
3. "And, in our relative positions, of this life, YE are the examples, a church of believers, alive to God through Christ in your various vocations...more especially examples of conformity to the death of our common Lord: in whom DEATH WORKS."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'death' of Christ manifested in the continual 'perishing of our outward man' works peculiarly in us." 
2. "The life whereof we witness in our bodily dying, extends beyond ourselves."

2. "You live as the effect of our being constantly exposed to death."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was also necessary that the folly of the Corinthians should be reproved, inasmuch as they contrived to themselves a Christianity without the cross."
2. "Such an allotment would certainly have been exceedingly unreasonable."
3. "Life denotes a condition that is prosperous and agreeable; agreeably to the maxim: 'Life is â€” not to live, but to be well.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "ours is the sorrow, the trouble, the affliction, and death itself, yours is the gain, the joy, the pleasure, and life"

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In 2 Corinthians 4:12, Paul explains that the trials and sufferings they endure as apostles represent the dying of Jesus in them, and these experiences are unique to them. However, the life they bear witness to extends beyond themselves and finds its purpose in the Corinthians. The life they speak of is not just physical, but a higher and spiritual life that includes the natural. The apostles, as examples of conformity to Christ's death, demonstrate the power of death at work in them while spiritual life is at work in the Corinthians. The preaching of the Gospel exposes the apostles to trials and suffering, ultimately for the benefit and salvation of others.
