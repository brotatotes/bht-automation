# 2 Corinthians 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The trials we endure as believers serve as a reflection of the dying of Jesus in us, revealing the life that extends beyond ourselves.

Through the preaching of the gospel, we are exposed to trials that can be viewed as death working in us, but these sufferings ultimately result in the benefit and salvation of others. As believers, we live as examples of conformity to the death of our common Lord, showcasing the life that extends beyond ourselves.
