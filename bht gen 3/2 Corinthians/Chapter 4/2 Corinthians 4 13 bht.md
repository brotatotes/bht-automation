# 2 Corinthians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though death worketh in us, and life in you, as we have the same spirit of faith, we look for the same immortal life and speak as we believe. According to what is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken, we also believe and speak without fear, amidst afflictions and deaths. Our preaching is the result of a firm conviction of the truth of the gospel, and when such a conviction exists, it is natural to give utterance to the belief, influencing others positively.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though 'death worketh in us, and life in you,' yet as we have the same spirit of faith as you, we therefore [believingly] look for the same immortal life as you, and speak as we believe." 
2. "The balance of the sentence requires the parallelism to be this, 'According to that which is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken we also believe, and therefore speak,' namely, without fear, amidst 'afflictions' and 'deaths'."
3. "ALFORD not so well translates, 'The same...faith with that described in the Scriptures.' The balance of the sentence requires the parallelism to be this, 'According to that which is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken we also believe, and therefore speak,' namely, without fear, amidst 'afflictions' and 'deaths'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have the same spirit of faith which he had who said, 'I believed,' etc. The phrase, 'spirit of faith,' means substantially the same as faith itself; a believing sense or impression of the truth."
2. "The sentiments of both were the language of faith. Both, in afflictions, uttered the language of faith; and Paul uses here, as he often does, the language of the Old Testament, as exactly expressing his feelings, and the principles by which he was actuated."
3. "No man should attempt to preach the gospel who has not a firm belief of its truths; and he who does believe its truths will be prompted to make them known to his fellow-men. All successful preaching is the result of a firm and settled conviction of the truth of the gospel; and when such a conviction exists, it is natural to give utterance to the belief, and such an expression will be attended with happy influences on the minds of other people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The same spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both; faith as a gift of the Spirit of God." 
2. "I believed, etc. Cited from Sept., Psalms 115:10. The Septuagint mistranslates the Hebrew, which is, 'I believed though I said,' etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though God spares you, and deals with you more indulgently, while he treats me with somewhat more severity, this diversity, nevertheless, will be no hinderance in the way of the like glorious resurrection awaiting both of us." 
2. "Because we have an assured hope of a blessed resurrection, we are bold to speak and preach what we believe, as it is written, 'I believed, therefore have I spoken.'"
3. "Let now our pretended followers of Nicodemus mark, what sort of fiction they contrive for themselves in the place of faith, when they would have faith remain inwardly buried, and altogether silent, and glory in this wisdom â€” that they utter, during their whole life, not a single word of right confession."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having the same spirit of faith (as the Psalmist), according to that which is written (Psalms 116:10), I believed, and therefore did I speak." 
2. "We also believe, and therefore also we speak out of the fulness of our heartâ€™s conviction and experience."
3. "All the words of this life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "According to that which is written... Paul makes adaptation of the words in Psalms 95:1." 
2. "We also believe... And therefore can speak with effect. Otherwise useless."
3. "Shall present us with you... This shows that Paul was not certain that he would be alive when Jesus comes."

### John Gill:
1. "By faith here is meant, not the doctrine, but the grace of faith...a reliance on the power, faithfulness, and promises of God to support under the afflictions of this life. Now of this faith the Spirit of God is the author..." 
2. "Which is the 'same' in all saints; the Spirit is the same in one as in another, and so is the faith which he is the author of...Faith is the same in all the saints...though it may be, the apostle may chiefly design the sameness of faith, and of the Spirit, in him and his fellow ministers, and in these Corinthians..."
3. "where there is true faith, and the true Spirit of faith, there will be a speaking of, for, and in the name of Christ, as there ought to be...more especially of the ministers of the word, who have a firm and well grounded belief in the doctrines of the Gospel, and person of Christ; and therefore speak freely, and without any doubt and hesitation about these things..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having the same spirit of faith â€” Which animated the saints of old; David, in particular, when he said, I believed, and therefore have I spoken"
2. "We also speak â€” We preach the gospel, even in the midst of affliction and death"
3. "because we believe that God will raise us up from the dead, and will present us, ministers, with you, all his members"
