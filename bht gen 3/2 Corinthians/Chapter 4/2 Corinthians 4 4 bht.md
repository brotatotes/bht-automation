2. "Christ's light is also God's. Compare Hebrews 1:3, Rev., effulgence (ajpaugasma, compare aujgasai shine, in this passage). Theodoret says: 'The effulgence is both from the fire and with the fire, and has the fire as its cause, yet is not divided from the fire; for whence comes the fire, thence also comes the effulgence.'"

1. "in whom the God of this world so called from the mysterious power over men, permitted him since the fall... hath blinded the minds of them which believe not." 
2. "lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God... is as 'glorified,' now in our own nature, 'with the glory which He had with the Father before the world was,' and so held forth in the preaching of the Gospel that He is here spoken of."
3. "as having a brightness before which the god of this world cannot stand, knowing that if one ray of it do but enter any soul, his hold over it is gone; and therefore he dreads and strives (in many, too successfully) to hide it from view."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Satan is 'the god of this age,' a phrase nowhere else in the N.T." 
2. "They refused to believe and so Satan got the power to blind their thoughts. That happens with willful disbelievers." 
3. "That is, if Î±Ï…Î³Î±ÏƒÎ± is intransitive as is likely, though it is transitive in the old poets... If it is transitive, the idea would be 'that they should not see clearly the illumination, etc.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The more excellent and knowing part of man; not the eyes of their bodies, but of their understandings; which shows the near access Satan has to the souls of men; he penetrates into their very hearts and minds, and has an influence there." 
2. "The persons whose minds he blinds, are those 'who believe not'; which distinguishes them from others that perish, who never enjoyed the Gospel, and therefore he says, 'in', or 'among whom'; and from true believers, on whom Satan can have no such influence; and is a reason of these men's perishing, and of Satan's influence over them; and must be understood of reprobates, and final unbelievers." 
3. "All these excellent characters of the Gospel serve to enhance the spite and malice of Satan, in endeavouring all he can to hinder the bright shining of this glorious Gospel, to and upon any of the sons of men; and his reason for so doing is, because he knows, that should the Gospel shine unto them, the interest and glory of Christ would be advanced, and his own would decline."

### John Wesley:
1. "The God of this world â€” What a sublime and horrible description of Satan!"
2. "He is indeed the god of all that believe not, and works in them with inconceivable energy."
3. "The Son exactly exhibits the Father to us."
