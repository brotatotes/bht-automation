## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For we preach not (the subject of our preaching is not) ourselves."
2. "But Christ Jesus as Lord."
3. "And ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their blindness is not our fault, as if we had self-seeking aims in our preaching."
2. "Preach . . . Christ . . . the Lordâ€”rather, 'Christ as Lord,' and ourselves as your servants."
3. "'Lord,' or 'Master,' is the correlative term to 'servants.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are merely the 'ambassadors' of another. We are not 'principals' in this business, and do not despatch it as a business of our own, but we transact it as the 'agents' for another, that is, for the Lord Jesus, and we feel ourselves bound, therefore, to do it as he would have done it himself; and as he was free from all trick, and dishonest art, we feel bound to be also."
2. "To prove that he is the Messiah so often predicted in the Old Testament, and so long expected by the Jewish people. To do this was a very vital part of the work of the ministry in the time of the apostles, and was essential to their success in all their attempts to convert the Jews; and to do this will be no less important in all attempts to bring the Jews now or in future times to the knowledge of the truth."
3. "To set forth the truth and the design of his resurrection. To prove that he rose from the dead, and that he ascended to heaven; and to show the influence of his resurrection on our hopes and destiny. The whole structure of Christianity is dependent on making out the fact that he rose; and if he rose, all the difficulties in the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead are removed at once, and his people will also rise."

### John Calvin:
1. "For there are other ways in which men preach themselves, than by arrogating to themselves dominion, as for example, when they aim at show, rather than at edification â€” when they are desirous in any way to have distinction â€” when, farther, they make gain of the gospel."
2. "Hence, he that would preach Christ alone, must of necessity forget himself."
3. "An honorable servitude, it is true, this is, and superior to any principality, but still it is a servitude, so that Christ alone may be elevated to distinction â€” not encumbered by the shadow of a single rival."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Did we preach ourselves, the god of this world would have no cause to fear for his victims: it is in the sinking of ourselves, in our one desire to exalt our Master and save the souls of men, that he knows our strength lies."
2. "Even we ourselves had never taken in the light of Christâ€™s glory, had it not burst upon us by the same power that made the light to arise at the beginning on this dark world."
3. "The less smooth reading is more likely to be the true one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Surely as poor and disgusting a topic as a preacher can find."
2. "But Christ Jesus as Lord."
3. "Your bond-slave for the sake of Jesus. This is the sufficient reason for any preacher's sacrifice, 'for Jesus' sake.'"

### John Gill:
1. "We did not preach any doctrine of our own devising; we did not set up ourselves as lords over the faith and consciences of men; nor was our view in preaching to set forth our learning, parts, and eloquence, or to amass wealth and riches to ourselves." 
2. "They preached Christ Jesus the Lord; that is, the doctrines respecting the person, office, and grace of Christ; as that he is truly and properly God, the eternal and only begotten Son of God, God and man in one person, the only Mediator between God and man, the Saviour and Redeemer of lost sinners."
3. "They declared themselves the servants of the churches, for Jesus' sake; either for the sake of preaching Christ unto them; or because they were chosen and called by him to this service, and in which they were willing to continue, for the sake of his honour and interest."

### John Wesley:
1. "We preach not ourselves - As able either to enlighten, or pardon, or sanctify you."
2. "But Jesus Christ - As your only wisdom, righteousness, sanctification."
3. "And ourselves your servants - Ready to do the meanest offices."
