# 2 Corinthians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is a remarkable display of God's power that an earthen vessel, a frail and humble body, can carry such brilliance and safeguard a precious treasure. This treasure signifies the gospel, an abundance of rich truths that are stored in ministers of the Word, who are themselves ordinary and fragile. The purpose of this arrangement is to highlight the divine power at work and ensure that it is God, not humans, who is honored. We are mere vessels, used by God to fulfill His purposes and demonstrate His boundless power.

2. "The vessel is the body, not the whole personality; the 'outer man' of ver. 16; see ver. 10." 
3. "The exceeding greatness of the power, viz. of the power consisting in the effects of the apostolic ministry, as well as in the upholding under trials and difficulties."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This very fact is one of the most marvellous proofs of God's power, that an earthen vessel could bear such splendor and keep such a treasure" (CHRYSOSTOM, Homilies, 8.496, A).

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel is called a 'treasure,' for not grace, nor Christ, but the Gospel is here meant; which is so styled, because it contains rich truths, and an abundance of them."
2. "The repository, or cabinet, in which this treasure is, are 'earthen vessels'; by which are meant, ministers of the word, who are so in themselves, in their own esteem, and in the esteem of others."
3. "The reason why it pleased God to put such a rich and valuable treasure into the hands of persons so mean and contemptible was, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have this treasure â€” Of divine light, love, glory."
2. "In earthen vessels â€” In frail, feeble, perishing bodies."

- Attempt 1 BHT: It is truly astounding that God would choose to place such a precious treasure in something as fragile as an earthen vessel. This treasure, referred to as the gospel, is a valuable and abundant source of rich truths. The vessel mentioned here is the human body, the outer shell that houses the soul. Despite its seeming insignificance, this vessel becomes the means through which God's power is magnified. Through the ministry of apostles and other humble servants, the brilliance of the treasure is revealed. It is in the very breaking of these vessels that the light of the gospel shines forth. This is a testament to the limitless power of God, who purposefully employs imperfect and ordinary individuals to carry His message. Such vessels may lack the appearance of excellence, but it is precisely because of their weakness that God's power becomes all the more evident. So, let us recognize that it is not our own abilities, but the divine treasure within us that brings forth the true power and glory of God.
