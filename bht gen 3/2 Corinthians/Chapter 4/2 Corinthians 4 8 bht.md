## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "pressed, but not (inextricably) crushed..."
2. "in perplexity, but not in despair..."
3. "persecuted, but not deserted..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "BEING hard pressed, yet not inextricably straitened; reduced to inextricable straits."
2. "Without were fightings; within were fears."
3. "As perplexity refers to the future, so 'troubled' or 'hard pressed' refers to the present."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was not so closely pressed as a man would be who was so straitened that he could not move his body, or stir hand or foot. He had still resources; he was permitted to move; the energy of his piety, and the vigor of his soul could not be entirely cramped and impeded by the trials which encompassed him."
2. "The idea is, he was not wholly discouraged, and disheartened, and overcome. He had resources in his piety which enabled him to bear up under these trials, and still to engage in the work of preaching the gospel."
3. "The idea of Paul here is, that they were not left 'entirely' without resource. Their needs were provided for; their embarrassments were removed; their grounds of perplexity were taken away; and unexpected strength and resources were imparted to them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We are pressed closely, yet not cramped."
2. "We are perplexed, but not utterly perplexed."
3. "We are perplexed, yet not unto despair."

### John Calvin:
1."We are reduced...to straits, but the Lord at length opens up for us an outlet; we are oppressed with poverty, but the Lord affords us help."
2."Many enemies are in arms against us, but under God's protection we are safe."
3."Though we are brought low, so that it might seem as if all were over with us, still we do not perish."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pressed (θλιβομενο). From θλιβω, to press as grapes, to contract, to squeeze. Series of present passive participles here through verse 2 Corinthians 4:9 that vividly picture Paul's ministerial career."
2. "Yet not straitened (αλλ' ου στενοχωρουμενο). Each time the exception is stated by αλλ' ου. From στενοχωρεω (στενοχωρος, from στενος, narrow, χωρος, space), to be in a narrow place, to keep in a tight place. Late verb, in LXX and papyri. In N.T. only here and 2 Corinthians 6:12."
3. "Yet not unto despair (αλλ' ουκ εξαπορουμενο). Late perfective compound with εξ- of εξαπορεω. A very effective play on words here, lost, but not lost out."

### John Gill:
1. "We are troubled on every side,.... Or afflicted;...for wherever we be, we are in the world, in which we must expect tribulation." 
2. "We are never free from one trial or another."
3. "Notwithstanding all our troubles, we have freedom at the throne of grace, and in our ministry; we can go with liberty to God, and preach the Gospel boldly."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not crushed - Not swallowed up in care and anxiety."
2. "Perplexed — What course to take, but never despairing of his power and love to carry us through."
