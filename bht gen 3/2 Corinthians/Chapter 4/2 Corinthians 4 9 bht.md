## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "not forsakenâ€”by God and man. Jesus was forsaken by both; so much do His sufferings exceed those of His people." (Commentary)
2. "cast downâ€”or 'struck down'; not only 'persecuted,' that is, chased as a deer or bird, but actually struck down as with a dart in the chase." (Commentary)
3. "The Greek 'always' in this verse means, 'throughout the whole time'; in 1 Samuel 26:20, the Greek is different, and means, 'at every time,' 'in every case when the occasion occurs.'" (Commentary)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not deserted; nor left by God...God always interposed to aid them; always saved them from the power of their enemies; always sustained them in the time of persecution. It is still true." 
2. "His people have been often persecuted. Yet God has often interposed to save them from the hands of their enemies; and where he has not saved them from their hands, and preserved their lives, yet he has never left them, but has sustained, upheld, and comforted them even in the dreadful agonies of death." 
3. "Not killed. They rose again; they recovered their strength; they were prepared for new conflicts. They surmounted every difficulty, and were ready to engage in new strifes, and to meet new trials and persecutions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Pursued by enemies, but not left to their power: left in the lurch."
2. "Though the pursuers overtake and smite down, yet are we not killed."
3. "In all these paradoxes the A. V. fails to bring out the metaphors."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Forsaken (ÎµÎ³ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î»ÎµÎ¹Ï€Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿). Double compound of old verb ÎµÎ³-ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±-Î»ÎµÎ¹Ï€Ï‰, to leave behind, to leave in the lurch."
2. "Smitten down (ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î²Î±Î»Î»Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿). As if overtaken."
3. "Destroyed (Î±Ï€Î¿Î»Î»Ï…Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿). Perishing as in verse 2 Corinthians 4:3. Was Paul referring to Lystra when the Jews stoned him and thought him dead?"

### John Gill:
1. "Persecuted, but not forsaken...though we are followed close by evil men, and left by our friends, we are not forsaken of God."
2. "Cast down we sometimes are, as an earthen vessel...we are sometimes foiled by sin, Satan, and the world."
3. "But not destroyed; we are still safe in the hands of Christ, and are kept by the power of God."
