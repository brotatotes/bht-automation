# 2 Corinthians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our present physical bodies, like the tabernacle in the Old Testament, will eventually wear out and be replaced. However, as believers, we have the confidence of a future resurrection body, a permanent dwelling that comes from God. Unlike our earthly house, this heavenly building is eternal and substantial, not a fragile tent. By faith, we hold the title to this future home, which brings us assurance and hope. It is a knowledge that goes beyond human intellect and is revealed by the Holy Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If this daily delivering unto death should end in actual death."
2. "Its wooden frame and curtains wore out in course of time when Israel dwelt in Canaan, and a fixed temple was substituted for it. The temple and the tabernacle in all essentials were one."
3. "Our body stands in contrast to 'from God.' For though our present body be also from God, yet it is not fresh and perfect from His hands, as our resurrection body shall be."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They had no doubt on the subject. And it proves that there may be the assurance of eternal life; or such evidence of acceptance with God as to leave no doubt of a final admission into heaven."
2. "The body is a mere unfixed, movable dwelling place; liable to be taken down at any moment, and not designed, anymore than a tent is, to be a permanent habitation."
3. "The future body shall never be taken down or dissolved by death. It is eternal, of course, only in respect to the future, and not in respect to the past. And it is not only eternal, but it is to abide forever in the heavens - in the world of glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase earthly house of the tabernacle expresses a single conception - the dwelling which is, or consists in the tabernacle, the tent - house. The transient character of the body is thus indicated."
2. "The figure of the tent suits the contrast with the building, and would naturally suggest itself to the tent - maker."
3. "The building from God is an actual possession in virtue of the believer's union with Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "We know, says he. This knowledge does not spring from the human intellect, but takes its rise from the revelation of the Holy Spirit. Hence it is peculiar to believers."
2. "Even the heathens had some idea of the immortality of the soul, but there was not one of them, that had assurance of it â€” not one of them could boast that he spoke of a thing that was known to him."
3. "Believers alone can affirm this, to whom it has been testified of by the word and Spirit of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved or 'our earthly tent-house be taken down,'"
2. "we have a building from God meaning the resurrection-body, called 'a building' in contrast with the tent-house of our present frame,"
3. "a house not made with hands (like the buildings we erect), eternal in the heavens."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The very word used (ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î»Ï…Ï‰) for striking down a tent."
2. "We possess the title to it now by faith. 'Faith is the title-deed (Ï…Ï€Î¿ÏƒÏ„Î±ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚) to things hoped for' (Hebrews 11:7)."
3. "This Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î´Î¿Î¼Î· (found in Aristotle, Plutarch, LXX, etc., and papyri, though condemned by Atticists) is more substantial than the ÏƒÎºÎ·Î½Î¿Ï‚."

### John Gill:
1. "By this house is meant the body, so called from its being like a well-built house, a curious piece of architecture; as an house consists of a variety of parts fitly framed and put together in just symmetry and proportion, and with an entire usefulness in all, so is the body of man."
2. "It is said to be an 'earthly' house, because it is from the earth; is supported by earthly things; has its present abode on the earth, and will quickly return to it."
3. "Now it is the saints' comfort whilst they are in it, and in a view of the dissolution of it, that they have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."

### John Wesley:
1. Our earthly house â€” Which is only a tabernacle, or tent, not designed for a lasting habitation.
