# 2 Corinthians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our earthly bodies, described as tabernacles or temporary dwellings, stand in contrast to the future resurrection bodies that are a building from God. The term earthly house of the tabernacle highlights the transient nature of our mortal bodies, while the building from God denotes the permanent and eternal nature of our resurrection bodies. This understanding brings comfort and courage, as believers anticipate a future inheritance and the assurance of a better life beyond this fleeting existence. Our current bodies may be frail and short-lived, but the resurrection body is a lasting and heavenly construction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This 'house' expresses more permanency than belongs to the body; therefore the qualification, 'of the tabernacle' (implying that it is shifting, not stationary), is added."
2. "Such is the relation between the 'earthly' body and the resurrection body."
3. "'Our' body stands in contrast to 'from God.' For though our present body be also from God, yet it is not fresh and perfect from His hands, as our resurrection body shall be."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason was, that they knew that even if their body should die, they had an inheritance reserved for them in heaven."
2. "The idea is a beautiful one, that the body is a mere unfixed, movable dwelling place; liable to be taken down at any moment, and not designed, anymore than a tent is, to be a permanent habitation."
3. "The future body shall never be taken down or dissolved by death. It is eternal, of course, only in respect to the future, and not in respect to the past."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase earthly house of the tabernacle expresses a single conception - the dwelling which is, or consists in the tabernacle, the tent-house."
2. "The transient character of the body is thus indicated."
3. "The building from God is an actual possession in virtue of the believer 's union with Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "For what is it that keeps men so firmly bound in a misplaced attachment to this life, but their deceiving themselves with a false imagination â€” thinking themselves happy in living here?"
2. "This knowledge does not spring from the human intellect, but takes its rise from the revelation of the Holy Spirit. Hence it is peculiar to believers."
3. "On the contrary, every one must have a knowledge peculiar to himself, for this, and this only, can animate me to meet death with cheerfulness â€” if I am fully persuaded, that I am departing to a better life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For we know that if [1] the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved or â€˜our earthly tent-house be taken down,â€™" 
2. "we have a building from God meaning the resurrection-body, called 'a building' in contrast with the tent-house of our present frame,"
	
3. "a house not made with hands (like the buildings we erect), eternal in the heavens."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The very word used (ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î»Ï…Ï‰) for striking down a tent."
2. "The house (Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¹Î±) is the tent."
3. "This Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î´Î¿Î¼Î· (found in Aristotle, Plutarch, LXX, etc., and papyri, though condemned by Atticists) is more substantial than the ÏƒÎºÎ·Î½Î¿Ï‚."

### John Gill:
1. "By this house is meant the body, so called from its being like a well built house, a curious piece of architecture; as an house consists of a variety of parts fitly framed and put together in just symmetry and proportion, and with an entire usefulness in all, so is the body of man."
2. "The earthly house of this tabernacle, in allusion to the tabernacles the patriarchs and Israelites of old dwelt in; or to the tents and tabernacles of soldiers, shepherds, travellers, and such like persons, which are soon put up and taken down, and removed from place to place; and denotes the frailty and short continuance of our mortal bodies."
3. "For we know that if our earthly house is dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."

### John Wesley:
1. Our earthly house â€” Which is only a tabernacle, or tent, not designed for a lasting habitation.
