# 2 Corinthians 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whether we appear mad or of sound mind, our ultimate goal is for God's glory and the benefit of others. Our enthusiasm for the message of Christ may be misunderstood as boasting madness, but it is actually a holy passion inspired by our love for God and love for others. We are willing to humble ourselves and adapt to the weaknesses of others in order to lead them to Christ. Despite any accusations, whether of being beside ourselves or seemingly calm, our motivation is always to advance the gospel and help others receive it.

2. "This is a passage that is deserving not merely of notice, but also of constant meditation; for unless we shall have our minds thus regulated, the smallest occasions of offense will from time to time draw us off from our duty."
3. "Let men take it as they will, that I speak so much of my integrity, I do it not upon my own account, but have respect to God and the Church in speaking of it; for I am as ready to be silent as to speak, when my silence may glorify God and advantage the Church as much as my speech."
