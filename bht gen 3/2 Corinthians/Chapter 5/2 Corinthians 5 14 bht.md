# 2 Corinthians 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of Christ shown through His death is the greatest proof of His love for mankind. This love constrains us, shutting us up to one purpose, and becomes the all-absorbing passion of our lives. It holds us together and compels us to serve Him, regardless of what others may say. Christ's death on behalf of all is an objective fact, but not all enter into the benefit of that Death due to their lack of love in response to Christ's love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ‚Äôs love to men, subjective, as most Commentators; as shewn in His death, which is the greatest proof of love."
2. "'Constraineth us,' generally:‚Äîlimits us to one great end, and prohibits our taking into consideration any others."
3. "This death on behalf of all men is the absolute objective fact: that all enter not into the benefit of that Death, is owing to the nonfulfilment of the subjective condition which follows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The love of Christ towards us...producing in turn love in us to Him, and not mere 'terror'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He gave himself to his great work impelled by that love which Christ had shown; by the view of the ruined condition of man which that work furnished; and by a desire to emulate the Redeemer, and to possess the same spirit which he evinced."
2. "The impelling, or exciting motive in the labors and self-denials of Paul, was the love of Christ - the love which he had showed to the children of men."
3. "The phrase ‚Äúfor all,‚Äù obviously means for all mankind; for every man. This is an exceedingly important expression in regard to the extent of the atonement which the Lord Jesus made, and while it proves that his death was vicarious, that is, in the place of others, and for their sakes, it demonstrates also that the atonement was general, and had, in itself considered, no limitation, and no particular reference to any class or condition of people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The love of Christ. Christ's love to men."
2. "Constraineth. It is the word rendered I am in a strait."
3. "The idea is not urging or driving, but shutting up to one line and purpose, as in a narrow, walled road."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if we be not harder than iron, we cannot refrain from devoting ourselves entirely to Christ, when we consider what great love he exercised towards us, when he endured death in our stead."
2. "The knowledge of this love, ought to constrain our affections, that they may go in no other direction than that of loving him in return."
3. "Christ redeemed us with this view ‚Äî that he might have us under his authority, as his peculiar possession."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For the love of Christ not our love to Christ, but Christ's love to men, constraineth us so shuts us up that we cannot choose but act as we do..."
2. "...the love of Christ has dissolved every old principle of action, and become the all-absorbing passion of our life..."
3. "‚ÄòWe are crucified with Christ, nevertheless we live; yet not we, but Christ liveth in us; and the life that we now live in the flesh we live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved us, and gave Himself for us.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul's conception of Christ's love for him holds him together to his task whatever men think or say."
2. "This is the central tenet in Paul's theology and Christology."
3. "The one died for the all and so the all died when he did, all the spiritual death possible for those for whom Christ died."

### John Gill:
1. "Nothing more effectually keeps ministers, or other believers, in the work and service of their Lord, or more strongly obliges and constrains them to a cheerful discharge of their duty to him, and one another, than his love displayed in his covenant engagements, in his assumption of human nature, and particularly in his dying for them."
2. "The doctrine of Christ's dying for men was well known, so that there was no need to mention his name; he is called 'one', in distinction to the 'all' he died for, and as exclusive of all others, he being sufficient of himself to answer the ends of his death."
3. "The conclusion from hence is, then were all dead; meaning, either that those for whom Christ died, were dead in Adam, dead in law, dead in trespasses and sins, which made it necessary for him to die for them; otherwise, there would have been no occasion for his death."

### John Wesley:
1. "The love of Christ... constraineth us... with such a strong, steady, prevailing influence..."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The love of Christ, shown in His death for all, is the greatest proof of His love for mankind. This love, not our own love for Christ, constrains us, shuts us up to one purpose, and becomes the all-absorbing passion of our lives. It is this love that holds us together and compels us to serve Him, regardless of what others may think or say. Christ's death on behalf of all is an objective fact, but not all enter into the benefit of that Death due to their nonfulfillment of the subjective condition, which is love in response to Christ's love. This love of Christ is not driven by fear, but produces love in us towards Him. It is this love that should constrain our affections to go in no other direction but towards loving Him in return.
