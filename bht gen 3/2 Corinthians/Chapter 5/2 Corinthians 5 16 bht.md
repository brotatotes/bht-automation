# 2 Corinthians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our understanding of others should not be based solely on their external appearance or worldly identity. Paul teaches us to see beyond the flesh and to know individuals in a spiritual sense. He himself had once known Christ according to worldly standards, but now realizes that this is insufficient. This new perspective calls us to look beyond outward distinctions and to approach others with spiritual discernment. It is through this lens that we can truly grasp the transformative power of Christ's work in our lives and in the lives of those around us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our knowledge of others must be altogether independent of that which they are according to the flesh,â€”must not be regulated according to the flesh."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "know we no man after the fleshâ€”that is, according to his mere worldly and external relations... outward distinctions... are lost sight of in the higher life of those who are dead in Christ's death, and alive with Him in the new life of His resurrection." 
2. "yea, thoughâ€”The oldest manuscripts read, 'if even.' "
3. "Paul here shows the true aim should be to know Him spiritually as new creatures, and that outward relations towards Him profit nothing... This is at variance with both Romish Mariolatry and transubstantiation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He who knows no man after the flesh, has, for example, in the case of the Jew, entirely lost sight of his Jewish origin; in that of the rich man, of his riches; in that of the learned of his learning; in that of the slave, of his servitude."
2. "We know no man henceforth after the flesh: even if we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now..."

2. "Though Christ lived for a time in this world, and was known by mankind in those things that have to do with the condition of the present life, he must now be known in another way â€” spiritually, so that we may have no worldly thoughts respecting him."
3. "But we acknowledge Christ as man, and as our brother in his flesh â€” not in a fleshly manner; because we rest solely in the consideration of his spiritual gifts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our old principles of judgment are at an end; we now look on persons and things alike in a quite new light."
2. "Men may boast that they saw, and heard, and talked with Him in the days of His flesh; but so far from that being any recommendation, so mean and unworthy were the views which the best of us (says the apostle) then entertained of Him, that they are a trouble to us even to remember them."
3. "Henceforth we wish to know every person and everything in a new light, yea, to know even Christ Himself only as we have now learned to regard Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "We have relinquished all our national prejudices, and former notions, concerning the Messiah, his kingdom, and people."

2. "We account not the least less than ourselves. We consider all, only in order to save all."
3. "Yea, if we have known even Christ after the flesh - So as to love him barely with a natural love, so as to glory in having conversed with him on earth, so as to expect only temporal benefits from him."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In 2 Corinthians 5:16, the apostle Paul instructs believers to have a different perspective when it comes to knowing others. He emphasizes that our knowledge of others should not be based on their outward appearance or worldly distinctions, but rather on a spiritual understanding. Paul himself had once known Christ according to the flesh, relying on hearsay and external reports, but after his conversion, he no longer viewed Christ in the same way. This change in perspective is not limited to Christ alone, but extends to all people. As new creatures in Christ, our old principles of judgment are replaced, and we are called to look at individuals and things from a new light, seeing them as God sees them. This means acknowledging others based on the spiritual gifts and transformation that Christ has brought into their lives, rather than worldly circumstances or external appearances.
