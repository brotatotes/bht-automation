# 2 Corinthians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone is in Christ, they become a new creature. The old things pass away spontaneously, like the snow of early spring before the advancing sun. This transformation is not merely recent, but a new nature quite different from anything previously existing. As if contemplating a rapidly shifting scene, they behold a fresh start. In Christ, the ancient way of looking at Him and other things passes by forever, and they have become new to stay so.
