## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And all things (in this new creation: he passes to a more general view of the effects of the death of Christâ€”viz. our reconciliation to God) are of God (as their source), who reconciled us (all men, from next verse, where 'the world' is parallel) to Himself through Christ (as an atonement, an expiatory sacrifice, ver. 21, for sin which made us 'God's enemies,' see Rom. v. 10)." 
2. "Observe, that the reconciliation spoken of in this and the next verse, is that of God to us, absolutely and objectively, through His Son: that whereby He can complacently behold and endure a sinful world, and receive all who come to Him by Christ." 
3. "This, the subjective reconciliation,â€”of men to God,â€”follows as a matter of exhortation, ver. 20)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ's blood was the price paid at the expense of God Himself, and was required to reconcile the exercise of mercy with justice, not as separate, but as the eternally harmonious attributes in the one and the same God."
2. "Diallagethi, however, implying mutual reconciliation, is distinct from Katallagethi here, the latter referring to the change of status wrought in one of the two parties."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This great truth Paul never forgot; and he never suffered himself to lose sight of it. It was in his view a cardinal and glorious truth; and he kept its influence always before his mind and his heart."
2. "There were indeed obstacles to reconciliation on the part of God, but they did not arise from any unwillingness to be reconciled; from any reluctance to treat his creature as his friend; but they arose from the fact that man had sinned, and that God was just..."
3. "And he has removed all the obstacles which existed to a reconciliation. On the part of God, he has made it consistent for him to pardon. He has made an atonement, so that God can be just while he justifies the sinner...And on the part of man, He, by the agency of His Spirit, overcomes the unwillingness of the sinner to be reconciled, humbles his pride, shows him his sin, changes his heart, subdues his enmity against God, and secures in fact a harmony of feeling and purpose between God and man, so that they shall be reconciled forever."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Through Christ, as the medium."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means, all things that belong to Christâ€™s kingdom. 'If we would be Christâ€™s, we must be regenerated by God...This they cannot do, unless they forget the world, as they are also no longer of the world, because they are of God.'" (2 Corinthians 5:18)
2. "The whole of the gospel tends to this...God hath reconciled us to himself by Christ...Because God was in Christ, and has in his person accomplished reconciliation." (2 Corinthians 5:18)
3. "Here we have an illustrious designation of the gospel, as being an embassy for reconciling men to God...Let us therefore bear in mind, that this is the main design of the gospel...Ministers are furnished with this commission, that they may bring us intelligence of so great a benefit, nay more, may assure us of Godâ€™s fatherly love towards us." (2 Corinthians 5:18)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Those who take this to mean â€˜induced us to give up our enmity to Him,â€™ go entirely against what the very next verse shews to be meant that, by putting away the cause of His enmity to us, which lay in sin, He has brought about peace between Himself and us sinners."
2. "It is exactly that kind of reconciliation of which our Lord says, 'If thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught (any good ground of displeasure) against thee ... go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother (not, dismiss thy bad feeling towards him, but get him to put away his bad feeling towards thee) and then . . . offer thy gift' (Matthew 5:23-24)."
3. "He has given unto us the ministry of reconciliation, the office of proclaiming this great fact to the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God's love provided the means and basis for man's reconciliation to God against whom he had sinned."
2. "God needs no reconciliation, but is engaged in the great business of reconciling us to himself."
3. "The task of winning the unreconciled to God is committed to us. It is a high and holy one, but supremely difficult."

### John Gill:
1. "A man's being brought into a Gospel church state is of God; the causing all old things to pass away, whether in the Jewish or Gentile world, is of God; the shaking of the heavens and the earth, and the removing of those things that are shaken, the abrogation of the ceremonial law, the putting an end to all the Mosaic rites and sacrifices, the ejection of Satan out of the Heathen temples, and the abolition of Gentilism, with every thing else that comes under the names of old, and new, are of God."
2. "Moreover, as all things in the old creation are from him, all creatures owe their beings to him, are supported in them by him, and all are made for his pleasure, and his glory so all things in the new creation are of him; the work of renovation itself is his; all the grace that is implanted in regeneration comes front him: nothing is of the creature, or to be ascribed to it."
3. "The work of reconciliation, or making atonement for sin, is ascribed to the Father; not that he is the author of it, for it is properly Christ's work; but because he took the first step towards it: he formed the scheme of it; he set forth his Son in his purposes and decrees to be the propitiary sacrifice; he assigned him this work in council and covenant, in promise and in prophecy, and sent him to effect it."

### John Wesley:
1. And all these new things are from God, considered under this very notion, as reconciling us - The world, 2 Corinthians 5:19, to himself.
