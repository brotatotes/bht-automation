# 2 Corinthians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our deep longing to put on the new body, our heavenly dwelling, testifies to the knowledge that we possess such a building of God. In our current tabernacle, we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with the habitation from heaven. This dwelling-place, our domicile, has a distinct reference to the inhabitant. It is not heaven itself, but it originates from heaven and will be brought to us by the Lord. This metaphor of putting on as a garment reflects the longing of our spirits to be united with a body that is pure, spiritual, and undecaying.
