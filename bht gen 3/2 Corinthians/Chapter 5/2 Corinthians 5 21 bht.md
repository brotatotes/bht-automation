# 2 Corinthians 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exhortation to be reconciled is based on the unspeakable gift of God, which brought about our reconciliation. Christ made himself to be sin so that we could become the righteousness of God. At His death on the cross, He bore our sins. We are representatives of God's righteousness, exemplifying it in our lives. Through Christ's sacrifice, our sins are transferred to Him, and His righteousness is imputed to us.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The strongest argument, and that which is most adapted to melt the soul, is the fact that the Son of God has become incarnate for our sins, and has suffered and died in our stead."
2. "In all conceivable senses of the expression he was holy, and pure, and the object of the divine approbation."
3. "It is the strongest argument that can be used. When God has given his only Son to the bitter suffering of death on the cross in order that we may be reconciled, it is the highest possible argument which can be used why we should cease our opposition to him, and become his friends."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Made to be sin...Not a sin-offering, nor a sinner, but the representative of sin."
2. "On Him, representatively, fell the collective consequence of sin."
3. "The one used here implies the fact of sinlessness as present to the consciousness of the person concerning whom the fact is stated."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us learn, therefore, to turn our views in that direction, whenever we desire to be absolved from guilt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "So far from God requiring to be moved by the death of Christ to compassionate and provide salvation for a sinful world, it was God Himself who spontaneously sent His Son on this errand into our world."
2. "Sinlessness, in the most absolute sense applicable to a creature nature, is here ascribed to Christ... expressing precisely what Christ said of Himself immediately before His apprehension."
3. "To be 'made sin' cannot mean to be made personally sinful, either in act or inclination: but neither must it be rendered 'made a sin-offering,' to which many expositors would reduce the words."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Definite claim by Paul that Jesus did not commit sin, had no personal acquaintance (Î¼Î· Î³Î½Î¿Î½Ï„Î±, second aorist active participle of Î³Î¹Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎºÏ‰) with it."
2. "God 'treated as sin' the one 'who knew no sin.' But he knew the contradiction of sinners (Hebrews 12:3)."
3. "This is God's purpose (Î¹Î½Î±) in what he did and in what Christ did. Thus alone can we obtain God's righteousness (Romans 1:17)."

### John Gill:
1. "He was made sin itself by imputation; the sins of all his people were transferred unto him, laid upon him, and placed to his account; he sustained their persons, and bore their sins; and having them upon him, and being chargeable with, and answerable for them, he was treated by the justice of God as if he had been not only a sinner, but a mass of sin; for to be made sin, is a stronger expression than to be made a sinner." 
2. "He knew no sin so as to approve of it, and like it; he hates, abhors, and detests it; he never was conscious of any sin to himself; he never knew anything of this kind by, and in himself; nor did he ever commit any, nor was any ever found in him, by men or devils, though diligently sought for."
3. "Now to be made the righteousness of God, is to be made righteous in the sight of God, by the imputation of the righteousness of Christ. Just as Christ is made sin, or a sinner, by the imputation of the sins of others to him; so they are made righteousness, or righteous persons, through the imputation of his righteousness to them; and in no other way can the one be made sin, or the other righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "He made him a sin offering, who knew no sin â€” A commendation peculiar to Christ."
2. "For us â€” Who knew no righteousness, who were inwardly and outwardly nothing but sin; who must have been consumed by the divine justice, had not this atonement been made for our sins."
3. "That we might be made the righteousness of God through him â€” Might through him be invested with that righteousness, first imputed to us, then implanted in us, which is in every sense the righteousness of God."
