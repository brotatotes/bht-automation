# 2 Corinthians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers eagerly anticipate being clothed with a heavenly body, as opposed to being disembodied spirits, emphasizing the desire to retain our earthly bodies rather than divesting ourselves of them. We long to be covered in the heavenly body to have our mortal part enveloped in the transformative power of life. The hope is that the Lord's coming finds us alive and clothed, so that we are not found naked and without a body. The term naked here signifies being without a body, while being clothed assures us of possessing an appropriate body in the future state.

2. "For also (a reason, why we long to clothe ourselves with our house which is from heaven, as in ver. 2) we who are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened (not by troubles and sufferings, nor by the body itself, which would be directly opposite to the sense: but. for the reason which follows)."
3. "Because we are not willing (literally, as follows) to divest ourselves (of it), but to put on (that other) over it, that our mortal part may (not, die, but) be swallowed up by life (absorbed in and transmuted by that glorious principle of life which our new clothing shall superinduce upon us)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Rendered as in our Authorised Version, a shade of doubt is undoubtedly conveyed to every English ear; while full certainty as to his eternal future is, in every varied form, conveyed here in almost every verse down to the ninth."
2. "And though competent scholars question whether in Biblical Greek the same certainty is conveyed by the particle here used as in classical Greek...we seem shut up by the present context in order to exclude that shade of doubt which the Authorised Version suggests to render the words as we have done."
3. "The next verse points to the real allusion to that notion...that the body, in its very nature, is nothing better than a clog to the only real part of man, his soul, which will never be capable of full development till disengaged by death from that encumbrance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being clothed (ÎµÎ½Î´Ï…ÏƒÎ±Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿). First aorist middle participle, having put on the garment."
