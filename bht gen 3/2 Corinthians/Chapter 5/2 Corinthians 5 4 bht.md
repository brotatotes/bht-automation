# 2 Corinthians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We long to be clothed in our heavenly body, not to be unclothed of our present body. Faith does not rid us of all natural feeling, but rather subordinates it to higher feeling. The anguish of the soul does not come from the pains and afflictions of the body nor the fear of death, but from a natural aversion to death and the loss of our physical form. Instead of dying, our desire is for the new spiritual organism to descend upon us while still alive, enveloping us like a new garment, and absorbing the old, sensuous life.
