# 2 Corinthians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our desire is not to be unclothed, but to be clothed with our heavenly body. Faith does not divest us of all natural feeling, but subordinates it to higher feeling. We long for the new spiritual body to come down upon us while still alive, as a new garment is thrown over an old one, and to have our mortal part absorbed and transformed into life. We groan because of the natural shrinking from death that would deprive us of the body, but our personality consisting of soul and body will survive.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Our desire as believers is not to be stripped of our present body, but to be clothed with our heavenly body. This is because faith does not eliminate our natural feelings, but rather elevates them to a higher realm. Instead of dying and being left without a new and higher organism, we long for the new spiritual body to come down upon us while we are still alive, absorbing and transforming our mortal part into life. We groan not because of the pains and afflictions of the body, nor the fear of death, but primarily because of the natural reluctance to be stripped of our current body without being immediately clothed with the new one. We desire to be swallowed up by life, to have our mortal body completely swallowed up by the immortal body, as our personality consisting of soul and body survives.
