# 2 Corinthians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in Christ groan and are burdened by the limitations of their mortal bodies, not out of fear of death but out of a natural reluctance to undergo the act of death itself. They desire to be clothed upon with their heavenly bodies, longing for the transformation and redemption of their earthly existence. The groaning of believers arises from the awareness that they are exiles in this present life and are burdened by the corruptible nature of their current bodies.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The oppression of soul (groan) is not from pains and afflictions of the body, nor from the fear of death, but from the natural shrinking from death, especially if death is to deprive him of the body (unclothe) only to leave him without a new and higher organism." 
2. "Therefore he desires, instead of dying, to have the new being come down upon him while still alive, investing him with the new spiritual organism (clothed upon), as a new garment is thrown over an old one, and absorbing (swallowed up) the old, sensuous life."
3. "For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey, This pledging anxious being e'er resigned, Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day, Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind?" (Quoting from GRAY, "Elegy.")

1. "For that (ÎµÏ†' Ï‰) we do not wish to put off the clothing, but to put it on" (Î±Î»Î»' ÎµÏ€ÎµÎ½Î´Ï…ÏƒÎ±ÏƒÎ¸Î±). The transposition of the negative Î¿Ï… weakens the sense.

3. "Only what is mortal perishes; the personality, consisting of soul and body, survives," (Plummer).

3. "The apostle goes on to explain what he means by desiring to be clothed, not for that we would be unclothed; that is, of our bodies; but from a principle of nature, which recoils at death, does not like a dissolution."

### John Wesley:
1. "We groan being burdened â€” The apostle speaks with exact propriety. A burden naturally expresses groans."
2. "Not that we would be unclothed â€” Not that we desire to remain without a body. Faith does not understand that philosophical contempt of what the wise Creator has given."
3. "But clothed upon â€” With the glorious, immortal, incorruptible, spiritual body. That what is mortal â€” This present mortal body. May be swallowed up of life â€” Covered with that which lives for ever."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Believers in Christ groan and are burdened by the limitations of their mortal bodies, not out of fear of death but out of a natural reluctance to undergo the act of death itself. Rather than desiring to be unclothed of their present bodies, they long to be clothed upon with their heavenly bodies so that their mortal part may be transformed and absorbed by eternal life. This desire for a new spiritual organism while still alive is not a rejection of the body, but a hope for the transformation and redemption of their earthly existence. The groaning of believers arises from the awareness that they are exiles in this present life and are burdened by the corruptible nature of their current bodies. They long for the day when the mortality of their bodies will be swallowed up by the life to come.
