# 2 Corinthians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being confident always, whether this hope of investiture over the mortal body or the fear of the other alternative be before us, we are confident at all times, as also most of all in the hope of a blessed departure. While we sojourn in our home in the body, we are away from our home in the Lord, living abroad. With the assurance of future glory and the prospect of being with the Lord, we can face trials undauntedly, knowing that our greatest happiness lies beyond the grave.
