# 2 Corinthians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we walk by faith, not by the appearance of heavenly things. Our life is governed by our faith in our immortal hope, rather than the outward specious appearance of present things. Although we may not see God or the glories of heaven, we perceive them through faith and confidently expect what is to come. Faith is the means by which we navigate this life, trusting in the unseen realities that are revealed to us. In the next life, our faith will be rewarded with vision.

### John Calvin:
1. "The reason why he is not seen by us is, that we walk by faith. Now it is on good grounds that faith is opposed to sight, because it perceives those things that are hid from the view of men â€” because it reaches forth to future things, which do not as yet appear."
2. "For such is the condition of believers, that they resemble the dead rather than the living â€” that they often seem as if they were forsaken by God â€” that they always have the elements of death shut up within them. Hence they must necessarily hope against hope."
3. "For we see, indeed, but it is through a glass, darkly; that is, in place of the reality we rest upon the word."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  By sight (Î´Î¹Î± ÎµÎ¹Î´Î¿Ï…Ï‚). Rather, by appearance.

1. "Faith is a grace which answers many useful purposes; it is the eye of the soul, by which it looks to Christ for righteousness, peace, pardon, life, and salvation."

3. "Faith is expressive, not of a weak, but of a strong steady faith of glory and happiness, and of interest in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "We cannot clearly see him in this life, wherein we walk by faith only."
2. "An evidence, indeed, that necessarily implies a kind of 'seeing him who is invisible.'"
3. "As far beneath what we shall have in eternity, as it is above that of bare, unassisted reason."
