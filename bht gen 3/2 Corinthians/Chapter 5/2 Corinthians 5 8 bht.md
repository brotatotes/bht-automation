# 2 Corinthians 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though we may have doubts, we are confident that being with the Lord is our ultimate goal. Dwelling in our physical bodies feels like separation from our true home with Him, so we prefer even death to remain with Him. To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord, a blissful state that surpasses earthly language. Longing for the Lord is not recklessness, but the disposition of true faith and trust in His promises. Being present with the Lord is not deferred until the resurrection; it is a present reality for believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "still (the last clause seeming to have somewhat dashed that confidence) we are confident, and are well content rather to go from (out of) our home in the body, and come to our home with the Lord"
2. "i.e. ‚Äòif (as in ver. 1) a dissolution of the body be imminent, even that, though not according to our wish, does not destroy our confidence"
3. "for so sensible are we that dwelling in the body is a state of banishment from the Lord, that we prefer to it even the alternative of dissolution, bringing us, as it will, into His presence"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We should prefer to be found alive at the Lord's coming, and to be clothed upon with our heavenly body."
2. "But feeling, as we do, the sojourn in the body to be a separation from our true home 'with the Lord,' we prefer even dissolution by death, so that in the intermediate disembodied state we may go to be 'with the Lord'."
3. "'To be with Christ' (the disembodies state) is distinguished from Christ's coming to take us to be with Him in soul and body."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are confident - 2 Corinthians 5:6. We are cheerful, and courageous, and ready to bear our trial."
2. "And willing rather to be absent from the body - We would prefer to die... rather than to remain in a world of sin and trial."
3. "To be present with the Lord - The Lord Jesus... to be with him was equivalent to being in a place of perfect bliss."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "To be absent - present." 
3. "To be from home, at home."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing can befall us, that can shake our confidence and courage, since death (which others so much dread) is to us great gain."
2. "True faith begets not merely a contempt of death, but even a desire for it."
3. "The desire, however, of which Paul speaks, is the disposition of a well-regulated mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But on its fundamental characteristics we have some clear and precious light: (1) That it will be a state of conscious existence, we are perfectly certain."
2. "To be in the immediate and conscious presence of his Lord could not but be felt by him to be 'far better.'"
3. "But to us strangers and sojourners here, harassed with cares and worried often out of our peace and rest, to whom 'without are fightings and within are fears' not to speak of sorrows and tears the thought that no sooner is the believer‚Äôs spirit disengaged from its clay tabernacle than it finds itself 'at home with the Lord' transcends all that language can describe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We are of good courage (Œ∏Œ±œÅœÅŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩ). Good word for cheer and same root as Œ∏Œ±œÅœÉŒµœâ (Matthew 9:2; Matthew 9:22). Cheer up."
2. "Are willing rather (ŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩ). Rather, 'We are well-pleased, we prefer' if left to ourselves. Cf. Philippians 1:21. Same ŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫Œµœâ used in Luke 3:22."
3. "To be at home with the Lord (ŒµŒΩŒ¥Œ∑ŒºŒ∑œÉŒ± œÄœÅŒøœÇ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒøŒΩ). First aorist (ingressive) active infinitive, to attain that goal is bliss for Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "The interval between death, and the resurrection, is a state of absence from the body, during which time the soul is disembodied, and exists in a separate state; not in a state of inactivity and sleep, for that would not be desirable, but of happiness and glory, enjoying the presence of God, and praising of him." 
2. "This was promised to Christ in the everlasting covenant, that all his spiritual seed and offspring should be with him. This he expected; it was the joy of this which was set before him, that carried him through his sufferings and death with so much cheerfulness."
3. "It is this which supports and comforts the saints under all their sorrows here, and which makes them meet death with pleasure, which otherwise is formidable and disagreeable to nature; and even desirous of parting with life, to be with Christ, which is far better."

### John Wesley:
1. Present with the Lord ‚Äî This demonstrates that the happiness of the saints is not deferred till the resurrection.
