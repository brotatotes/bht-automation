# 2 Corinthians 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though present in the body or absent from it, we have the sure confidence of being blessed, and thus we labor with the only lawful ambition, which is to be well-pleasing to Christ. In light of the resurrection and the hope of future glory, it is our constant aim to be acceptable to God, regardless of our earthly circumstances. This ambition to please Him stems from our love for Him and our desire to bring Him glory, for without faith, it is impossible to please Him.
