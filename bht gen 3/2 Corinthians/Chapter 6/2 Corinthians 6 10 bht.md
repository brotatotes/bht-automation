## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Poor again can hardly have been 'reproach, but sets forth the factâ€”as poor men, but enriching many."
2. "As having nothing, but possessing all things."
3. "Our inheritance never to be taken away; in that sense of the word 'to possess' which this world's buyers are not to use."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "making many richâ€”Spiritually (1 Corinthians 1:5), after the example of our Lord, who 'by His poverty made many rich' (1 Corinthians 1:5-:)."
2. "having nothingâ€”Whatever of earthly goods we have, and these are few, we have as though we had not; as tenants removable at will, not owners (1 Corinthians 1:5-:)."
3. "possessing all thingsâ€”The Greek implies firm possession, holding fast in possession (compare 1 Corinthians 3:21; 1 Corinthians 3:22). The things both of the present and of the future are, in the truest sense, the believer's in possession, for he possesses them all in Christ, his lasting possession, though the full fruition of them is reserved for the future eternity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the world looks only upon our trials, we must be regarded as always suffering, and always sad... Such, perhaps, is the estimate which the world usually affixes to the Christian life." 
2. "Religion had a power not only to sustain the soul in trial, but to fill it with positive joy... There is an internal peace and joy which the world may not see or appreciate, but which is far more than a compensation for all the trials which the Christian endures."
3. "They had bestowed on them the true riches. They had been the means of investing them with treasures infinitely more valuable than any which kings and princes could bestow. They to whom they ministered were made partakers of the treasure where the moth doth not corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Having - possessing [ÎµÏ‡Î¿Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚ - ÎºÎ±Ï„ÎµÏ‡Î¿Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚] . The contrast is twofold : between having and not having, and between temporary and permanent having, or having and keeping. Compare Luke 8:15; 1 Corinthians 14:2; 1 Thessalonians 5:21; Hebrews 3:6.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "sowing in tears, yet reaping in joy"
2. "putting them in possession of 'the true riches' (Luke 16:1), 'a treasure in the heavens that faileth not' (Luke 12:33)"
3. "as having nothing (earthly), and yet possessing all things"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Always rejoicing...Even in sorrow."
2. "Yet making many rich...Spiritual riches Paul has in mind."
3. "As having nothing and yet possessing all things...Contrast between Î¼Î·Î´ÎµÎ½ (nothing) and Ï€Î±Î½Ï„Î± (all things)."

### John Gill:
1. "As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing... rejoicing; not in themselves, or in any creature, but in the Lord."
2. "As poor, yet making many rich... by showing them their spiritual poverty, stripping them of what they trusted in, and valued themselves upon; directing them where true riches are."
3. "As having nothing, and yet possessing all things... they enjoyed all spiritual good things; they had not only a right unto them, but were possessed of them; they had all things pertaining to life and godliness."

### John Wesley:
1. "As sorrowing â€” For our own manifold imperfections, and for the sins and sufferings of our brethren."
2. "Yet always rejoicing â€” In present peace, love, power, and a sure hope of future glory."
3. "As having nothing, yet possessing all things â€” For all things are ours, if we are Christ's. What a magnificence of thought is this!"
