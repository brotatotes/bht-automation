# 2 Corinthians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Any constraint you may feel towards me is not because my heart lacks affection towards you, but it is a result of your own lack of affection towards me. It is your love that is contracted while my heart is wide enough to receive you all. My adversaries may have caused some of you to tighten up your affections, but know that there is no restraint in my heart towards you.
