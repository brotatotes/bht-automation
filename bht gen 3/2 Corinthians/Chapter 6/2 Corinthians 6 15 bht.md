# 2 Corinthians 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Belial, derived from the Hebrew word for wickedness and worthlessness, is personified as the Evil One, opposed to Christ. Paul cautions believers against being partnered with those who do not believe in Christ, emphasizing the stark contrast between believers and unbelievers. The image of discordant sounds highlights the incompatibility between Christ and Belial. Therefore, Christians are called to separate themselves from the wickedness of the world, as Christ did from the plans and purposes of Satan.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Christ and Belial are as opposite as can be, representing the forces of good and evil. Belial, personified as the Evil One, symbolizes wickedness and worthlessness. Therefore, believers should not be yoked together with unbelievers, disbelievers who do not acknowledge Christ. The contrast between Christ and Belial is as stark as the contrast between beautiful harmony and discordant sounds, highlighting that Christians are called to be separate from the world and its wicked ways. We are to have different principles, feelings, rewards, and destinies. Just as Christ has no fellowship with Satan, we too should keep ourselves apart from partnership with the wicked.
