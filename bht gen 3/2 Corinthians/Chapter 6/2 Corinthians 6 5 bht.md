### John Calvin:

2. "Unquestionably, two things are required on the part of ministers of the Gospel ‚Äî that they should endeavor to the utmost of their power to maintain peace, and yet on the other hand go forward, undaunted, through the midst of commotions, so as not to turn aside from the right course, though heaven and earth should be mingled."
