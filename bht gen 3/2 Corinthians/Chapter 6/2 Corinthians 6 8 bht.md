# 2 Corinthians 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In all these capacities and under all these representations, we, as ministers of God, recommend ourselves. As deceivers and yet true, as unknown and yet well known, we face glory and dishonor, good report and evil report, from those in authority and the multitude. Our enemies may regard us as deceivers, but we strive to live as ministers of God. We are tried by the slander of wicked men, but we hold steadfast in our integrity, seeking honor from God alone. Our ultimate purpose is to faithfully serve God and edify His people.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The first is, 'by honor.' They were not everywhere honored, or treated with respect. Yet they were sometimes honored by people... It is difficult in such circumstances to 'commend themselves as the ministers of God.'"
2. "Perhaps occasionally also they might be treated with great attention and regard by the people of the world... It is difficult in such circumstances to 'commend themselves as the ministers of God.' Few are the ministers who are proof against this influence, and who in such circumstances can honor the ministry."
3. "Perhaps this refers to some charges which had been brought against them by the opposing faction at Corinth, or perhaps to the opinion which the Jewish priests and pagan philosophers entertained of them...

2. "For God allows us to be tried even by the slander of wicked men, with the view of trying us, whether we act uprightly from disinterested motives; for if one is drawn aside from duty by the ingratitude of men, that man shows that he had not his eye directed to God alone."
3. "How cruel to despise the poverty of the man who supplies you from his abundance! He means spiritual riches, which ought to be much more esteemed than earthly."
