3. "The apostle does not mean that none of them had been to blame, or that the church had been free from fault, but he means that by their zeal and their readiness to take away the cause of complaint, they had removed all necessity of further blame, and had pursued such a course as entirely to meet his approbation."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Clearing of yourselves [Î±Ï€Î¿Î»Î¿Î³Î¹Î±Î½] . Exculpation or self - defense from complicity with the incestuous person by their neglect and refusal to humble themselves."

2. "Yea, what fear; not of hell and damnation, as in wicked men and devils, who repent not; but of God, and of grieving his ministers; and lest the corruption should spread in the church, as the apostle had suggested, 'a little leaven leavens the whole lump.'"
3. "Yea, what revenge; not of persons in a private way, vengeance belongs to God; but of all disobedience, particularly that of the unhappy criminal among them, which has shown in the punishment inflicted on him by many."
