2. "It was not mere grief; it was not sorrow producing melancholy, gloom, or despair; it was not sorrow which led you to be angry at him who had reproved you for your errors - as is sometimes the case with the sorrow that is produced by reproof; but it was sorrow that led to a change and reformation."
3. "Sinners are gainers in happiness in the end by all the pain of repentance produced by the preaching of the gospel.
