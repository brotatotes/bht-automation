# 2 Corinthians 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle Paul, speaking under the guidance of the Spirit, offers his opinion rather than a command, emphasizing the Corinthians' previous commitment to contribute to the collection.

By completing what they had started, they would experience both temporal and eternal rewards, while avoiding contempt and disgrace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I give my opinion in this matter, the stress being on opinion, as distinguished from command."
2. "I give my judgment, as rendered in the version of the Five Clergymen, is objectionable here, as conveying the very idea which the Apostle wishes to negative, that of an authoritative decision."
3. "He did not speak by way of command."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Herein he does not (as some misinterpret the passage) disclaim inspiration for the advice he gives; but under the Spirit, states that it is his 'opinion' [ALFORD] or 'judgment' [ELLICOTT, and others], not a command, that so their offering might be free and spontaneous."
2. "There were three steps: (1) the forwardness, more literally, 'the will'; (2) the setting about it, literally, 'doing it'; (3) completion of it [ALFORD]. In the two former, not only the act, but the intention, the Corinthians preceded the Macedonians."
3. "It appears hence, that something had been done in the matter a year before; other texts, however, show the collection was not yet paid (compare 2 Corinthians 8:11; 2 Corinthians 9:5; 2 Corinthians 9:7). This agrees with one, and only one supposition, namely, that every man had laid by in store the fund from which he was afterwards to contribute, the very case which is shown by 1 Corinthians 16:2 to have existed [PALEY, Hor√¶ Paulin√¶]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Advice will go much further than commands on the subject of charities."
2. "It became them; it was proper, and was demanded; and there would have been manifest disadvantages if it had not been done."
3. "They were voluntary in this, and they set about it with vigorous and determined zeal and courage."

### John Calvin:
1. "What you have given away is the only riches that you will always have."
2. "The Lord...would have us, not-withstanding, persevere in doing good."
3. "Such cheerfulness of anticipation is better than the actual performance of the deed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And herein I give my judgment or 'opinion;' for in 2 Corinthians 8:8 he had just disclaimed giving them a 'command' on the subject." 
2. "For this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago or as we should say, 'last year,' for a whole year had not intervened." 
3. "Not only to do, but to will a strange expression; but the meaning clearly is, 'Since ye not only began to make this collection last year, before ever the Macedonian churches were addressed upon the subject, but set yourselves to it with a will (as we should say), it would only be becoming in you not to fall behind the Macedonians in the completion of it.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Judgment (Œ≥ŒΩœâŒºŒ∑ŒΩ). Deliberate opinion, but not a 'command' (ŒµœÄŒπœÑŒ±Œ≥Œ∑ verse 2 Corinthians 8:8). Cf. 1 Corinthians 7:25."
2. "A year ago (Œ±œÄŒø œÄŒµœÅœÖœÉ) From last year."
3. "Not only to do, but also to will (ŒøœÖ ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒΩ œÑŒø œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÉŒ±Œπ, Œ±ŒªŒªŒ± Œ∫Œ± œÑŒø Œ∏ŒµŒªŒµŒπŒΩ). Articular infinitives the objects of œÄœÅŒøŒµŒΩŒ∑œÅŒæŒ±œÉŒ∏Œµ on which verb see verse 2 Corinthians 8:6). That is to say, the Corinthians promised before any others."

### John Gill:
1. "Doing acts of beneficence is profitable to persons, as to things temporal, God usually blessing such with a greater affluence of the things of life, and which indeed is often promised; and is also profitable with respect to things spiritual."
2. "Such a conduct is profitable in relation to things eternal; for as it springs from the grace of God, and men are assisted therein by it, and is exercised towards persons that have received it, it will be rewarded with a reward of grace."
3. "To save their own credit, it was expedient for them to finish what they had begun; for otherwise, as their boasting of them would be in vain, so they would expose themselves to contempt and incur disgrace."
