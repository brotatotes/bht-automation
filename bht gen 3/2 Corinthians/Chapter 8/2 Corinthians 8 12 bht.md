# 2 Corinthians 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Readiness in God's service is accepted if its exertion is proportionate to its means. God judges not by the quantity but by the zeal and willingness of the heart. It is not about how much we give, but the proportion in relation to what we have. A small gift from a generous heart can be more acceptable than a large donation without genuine willingness. Ultimately, God values the readiness and cheerful giving that is worthy of Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Readiness in God‚Äôs service is accepted if its exertion be commensurate with its means,‚Äîand is not measured by an unreasonable requirement of what it has not."

2. "God will approve of it, and will receive it favorably."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Not according as he hath not (ŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œø ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµœáŒµ). Note present indicative rather than subjunctive because a specific case is presented."

### John Gill:
1. "If what is done springs from a truly noble, generous spirit...it is accepted; both of God and man."
2. "The widow's mite was as acceptable, and more so, than all the rich men cast into the treasury."
