In the spirit of equality, let us support our fellow Christians who are in need. By sharing our abundance, we can alleviate their deficiency, fostering a community where no one exceeds or falls short.

As circumstances may change, let us be ready to receive support when we are in need. By practicing this principle, we can meet both the spiritual and material needs of our brothers and sisters.

### Henry Alford:
1. "but that, by the rule of equality, at this present time (of their need: the stress is on these words, as suggesting that this relation may hereafter be altered) your abundance may subserve their deficiency; that also (supposing circumstances changed) their abundance may subserve your want."
2. "The reference is still, as is evident from the next verse, to the supply of temporal wants, in respect of which there should be a mutual relieving and sharing among Christians."
3. "that there may be equality: as it is written (i. e. according to the expression used in the Scripture history, of the gathering of the manna), He that (gathered) much did not exceed (the measure prescribed by God); and he that (gathered) little did not fall short (of it)."

2. "now at this time‚ÄîGreek, 'at the present juncture' or season."

### John Calvin:
1. "If it is irksome to you to help your brethren with riches that are of no value, consider how many blessings you are destitute of, and these too, far more precious, with which you may be enriched by those who are poor as to worldly substance."
2. "This participation, which Christ has established among the members of his body, should animate you to be more forward, and more active in doing good."
3.

### John Gill:
1. "All that he meant was, that there might be an equality both in givers and receivers, proportioned to their several circumstances and stations of life."
2. "Should they ever change circumstances, as it was not impossible that they that were now rich should become poor, and they that were poor become rich; then as their abundance had been a supply to the wants of others, the abundance of others in their turn would be a supply to their wants."
3. "That the rich should so distribute as not to leave themselves without a proper support, according to their station of life; and yet so freely communicate, that the poor may not be without food and raiment, suitable to their lower sphere of life."

May be ‚Äî At another time.
A supply to your want: that there may be an equality."

3. "So that all the spiritual wants of the one might be amply supplied; all the temporal of the other."
