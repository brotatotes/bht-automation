## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "If the expression whose praise in (the matter of) the Gospel is throughout all the Churches, is to be compared with any similar eulogium, that of Gaius in Rom. xvi. 23, seems to correspond most nearly."

1. "Luke may be meant; not that 'the Gospel' here refers to his written Gospel; but the language implies someone well known throughout the churches, and at that time with Paul, as Luke then was." 
2. "Luke was the most prominent [companion]... The fact that the person here referred to was 'chosen of the churches' as their trustee to travel with Paul in conveying the contribution to Jerusalem, implies that he had resided among them some time before."
3. "He who is faithful in the Gospel will be faithful also in matters of inferior importance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And we have sent with him the brother - It has been generally supposed that this anonymous brother was Luke."

2. "The person referred to has been variously identified with Titus' brother, Barnabas, Mark, Luke, and Epaenetus."
3. "The reference to Epaenetus has been urged on the ground of a supposed play upon the word praise, epainos; Epaenetus meaning praiseworthy."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is uncertain, however, who this second person was; only that some conjecture that it was Luke, others that it was Barnabas. Chrysostom prefers to consider it to have been Barnabas."
2. "He adds farther, that he had received praise, not from one individual, or even from one Church merely, but from all the Churches."
3. "We must observe, however, the mode of election ‚Äî that which was customary among the Greeks ‚Äî œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÑŒøŒΩŒØŒ±, (a show of hands), in which the leaders took the precedence by authority and counsel, and regulated the whole proceeding, while the common people intimated their approval."
