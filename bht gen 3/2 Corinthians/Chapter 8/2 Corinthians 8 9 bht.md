- Attempt 1 BHT: For your sakes, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was eternally rich in heavenly glory and possessed all things, willingly became poor and destitute, emptying Himself of His rights and privileges, in order to enrich us with the blessings of His grace. He left His exalted position in the bosom of the Father and embraced a life of poverty and suffering, combining divine power and excellence with human weakness. Through His poverty, He offered us the opportunity to become rich in the favor and image of God, heirs of His kingdom, and recipients of His abundant love and abundant grace. This act of self-devotion by our Lord should inspire us to show love and compassion towards our brethren, not sparing ourselves when help is needed. Just as the Lord's poverty created riches for us, may we also demonstrate an act of love and generosity, even at a small sacrifice to ourselves.
