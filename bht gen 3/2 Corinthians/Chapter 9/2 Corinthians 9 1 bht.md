# 2 Corinthians 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I urge you to receive our messengers with kindness and hospitality. It is superfluous for me to write to you about the duty of ministering to the saints because you are already aware of it. However, I choose to address this topic as a gentle reproof, as you have been somewhat negligent. Show love to the messengers and remember that the ministration for the saints is a responsibility that all members of Christ ought to fulfill towards one another.
