## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "they (the recipients) glorifying God by means of the proof (i. e. the experience, tried realityâ€”the substantial help yielded by) of this (your) ministration" 
2. "your confession, you who confess Christ, is really and truly subject in holy obedience, as regards the gospel of Christ" 
3. "liberality of your contribution, unto them, and unto all men"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The experience" [ELLICOTT and others]. Or, "the experimental proof" of your Christian character, afforded by "this ministration."
2. "Your subjection in accordance with your profession, in relation to the Gospel."
3. "The liberality of your contribution in relation to them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They shall in this ministration have experience or proof of your Christian principle."
2. "They will praise God as the source of your liberality, as having given you the means of being liberal, and having inclined your hearts to it."
3. "One evidence of true subjection to the gospel; one proof that our profession is sincere and genuine, is a willingness to contribute to relieve the needs of the poor and afflicted friends of the Redeemer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fundamental idea is that of saying the same thing as another; while profess (pro forth, fateor to say) is to declare openly. Hence, to profess Christ is to declare Him publicly as our Lord : to confess Christ is to declare agreement with all that He says."
2. "When Christ confesses His followers before the world, He makes a declaration in agreement with what is in His heart concerning them."
3. "The two ideas run into each other, and the Rev. is right in the few cases in which it retains profess, since confess would be ambiguous."

### John Calvin:
1. "The term experiment here, as in a variety of other places, means proof or trial."
2. "For it was a sufficient token for bringing the love of the Corinthians to the test, â€” that they were so liberal to brethren that were at a great distance from them."
3. "For by such proofs we truly manifest that we are obedient to the doctrine of the gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Actions speak louder than words. The brethren in Jerusalem will know by this collection that Gentiles make as good Christians as Jews."
2. "The nominative participle used independently like Ï€Î»Î¿Ï…Ï„Î¹Î¶Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿ in verse 2 Corinthians 9:11."
3. "Paul drives it home."

### John Gill:
1. "They glorify God; by giving thanks unto him, acknowledging him to be the author of all the grace and goodness which they, and others, were partakers of."
2. "Subjection to [the Gospel of Christ] lies in a hearty receiving of the doctrines of it, and a cheerful submission to his ordinances."
3. "True faith in the doctrine of grace, and a sincere obedience to it, are best declared and known by love to the saints; for faith works by love, both to Christ, and to his people."

### John Wesley:
1. Your avowed subjection â€” Openly testified by your actions.
To all men â€” Who stand in need of it.
