# 2 Corinthians 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When recipients of charity are moved by Christian love on account of the abundant grace of God that is displayed through the donors, they not only glorify God by their prayers, but also long for and pray for the well-being of the donors. Their prayers are worth more than the charity itself, as it is God who excites in us a disposition to do good to others. The generosity of the donors causes thanksgiving to God, prayer for them, and a yearning of heart towards them for the grace of God that is so evident in their lives.
