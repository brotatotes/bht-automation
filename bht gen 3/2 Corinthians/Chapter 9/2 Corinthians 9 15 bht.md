# 2 Corinthians 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift, which is the gift of His own Son. It is impossible to apply such a term to any gift short of that one. If we have received from God His unspeakable gift, what great thing is it if we give a few perishing gifts for His sake? These abrupt thanksgivings are common in Paul's writings. Indeed, words fail Paul to describe the gift of Christ to and for us. May we show our thankfulness by highly prizing and valuing this gift.

2. "It is impossible to apply such a term, so emphatically placed as here, to any gift short of THAT ONE."

2. "No words can properly express the greatness of the gift thus bestowed on man. It is higher than the mind can conceive; higher than language can express."

God forbid; for I also am an Israeliteâ€™ (Romans 11:1-2)."
