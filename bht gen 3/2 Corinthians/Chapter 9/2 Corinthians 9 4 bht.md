# 2 Corinthians 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To avoid being put to shame in this confident boasting, it is crucial that we, along with the Corinthians, fulfill our promised contribution. If those from Macedonia were to come and find the Corinthians unprepared with their collection, it would not only embarrass Paul, but also diminish the solid foundation of confident boasting. The Corinthians must be prepared to meet the confident expectations placed upon them, or else their character and reputation would suffer, causing them to feel ashamed for their lack of readiness.
