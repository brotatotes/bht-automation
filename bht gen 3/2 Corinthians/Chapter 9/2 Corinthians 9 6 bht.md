# 2 Corinthians 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we give generously, we sow seeds that will yield a bountiful harvest of blessings and showers of God's favor. Just as a farmer who sows sparingly reaps sparingly, our level of generosity determines the abundance we receive. Giving liberally to those in need or to promote virtue and religion leads to a multiplied return on our investment. This principle applies not only to earthly blessings but also to the spiritual reward of eternal life. Remember, when calculating the cost of giving, that God is faithful to reward according to our generosity.
