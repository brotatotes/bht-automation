# 2 Corinthians 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's grace is constantly available to us, giving us sufficiency in all things. This sufficiency, not limited to worldly possessions, allows us to be self-sufficient in Christ and independent of external circumstances. The gifts bestowed upon us are meant to be used to abound in good works towards others. As we trust in God's provision, we can expect blessings and an increase in our ability to generously consider the needs of others. Our acts of benevolence are not in vain, as God will multiply and restore to us what we have given.
