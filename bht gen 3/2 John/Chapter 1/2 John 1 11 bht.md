## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not of men who have never had any relation with the church, but of men who wish to be thought brethren, and overthrow the truth."
2. "Do not even by wishing him good speed, which, if spoken by a Christian, would mean God speed, identify yourselves with his course and fortunes."
3. "If you do, you pronounce approval of his evil deeds, and so far share his guilt, advancing their success by your wishes for it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By wishing a false brother or teacher 'God (or 'good') speed,' you imply that he is capable as such of good speed and joy, and that you wish him it while opposing Christ; so you identify yourself with 'his evil deeds.'"
2. "We cannot have communion with saints and with Antichrist at the same time."
3. "Here we see John‚Äôs naturally fiery zeal directed to a right end. Polycarp, the disciple of John, told contemporaries of Irenaeus, who narrates the story on their authority, that on one occasion when John was about to bathe, and heard that Cerinthus, the heretic, was within, he retired with abhorrence, exclaiming, Surely the house will fall in ruins since the enemy of the truth is there."

2. "It is to be borne in mind that the churches often met in private homes."
3. "There was no way of escaping responsibility for the harm wrought by these propagandists of evil."

### John Gill:
1. "For he that biddeth him God speed...is partaker of his evil deeds." 
2. "Wishes him well...is an abettor of him in his principles."
3. "He has fellowship with him...gives too much reason to think he is one with him in them."
