## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Grace has reference to the sins of men, mercy to their misery. God's grace, His free grace and gift, is extended to men as they are guilty: His mercy is extended to them as they are miserable."
2. "Peace is the whole sum and substance of the possession and enjoyment of God's grace and mercy."
3. "Truth and love are the conditional element in which the grace, mercy, and peace are to be received and enjoyed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Grace covers the sins of men; 'mercy,' their miseries. Grace must first do away with man‚Äôs guilt before his misery can be relieved by mercy. Therefore grace stands before mercy." 
2. "'Peace' is the result of both, and therefore stands third in order. Casting all our care on the Lord, with thanksgiving, maintains this peace."
3. "The element or sphere in which alone grace, mercy, and peace have place is truth and love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This salutation does not differ from those commonly employed by the sacred writers, except in the emphasis which is placed on the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is 'the Son of the Father.'"
2. "John dwells much on the fact that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, and on the importance of recognizing that fact in order to the possession of true religion."
3. "This phrase [in truth and love] is not to be connected with the expression 'the Son of the Father,' as if it meant that he was his Son 'in truth and love,' but is rather to be connected with the 'grace, mercy, and peace' referred to, as a prayer that they might be manifested to this family in promoting truth and love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grace is of rare occurrence in John's writings...and the kindred carizomai to favor, be kind, forgive, and carisma gift, are not found at all." 
2. "The sentiment in God assumes the character of pitying love. Mercy is kindness and goodwill toward the miserable and afflicted, joined with a desire to relieve them."
3. "In the Divine mind, and in the order of our salvation as conceived therein, the mercy precedes the grace...Yet the righteousness of God, which it is quite as necessary should be maintained as His love, demands that the guilt should be done away before the misery can be assuaged; only the forgiven may be blessed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Grace, mercy, peace, shall be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love." 
2. "It had become the sacred benediction, as including the whole compass of the Divine blessing in the Gospel."
3. "There is here an observable deviation from St. Paul‚Äôs formula; as also in the addition of ‚Äòtruth and love‚Äô the two spheres or characteristics of the Christian life in which, though not on account of which, these blessings are imparted."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The salutation is like that in the Pastoral Epistles: 'ŒßŒ±œÅŒπœÇ, the wellspring in the heart of God; ŒµŒªŒµŒøœÇ, its outpourings; ŒµŒπœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒ∑, its blessed effect' (David Smith)."
2. "The repetition of œÄŒ±œÅŒ± (with the ablative) is unique. 'It serves to bring out distinctly the twofold personal relation of man to the Father and to the Son' (Westcott)."
3. "'The Fatherhood of God, as revealed by one who being His Son can reveal the Father, and who as man (ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖ) can make him known to men' (Brooke)."

### John Gill:
1. "Grace be with you, mercy [and] peace." 
2. "He is God's own Son, in a true, proper, and natural sense." 
3. "He is his well beloved Son, his dear Son, the Son of his love."

### John Wesley:
1. "Grace takes away guilt; mercy, misery: peace implies the abiding in grace and mercy."
2. "It includes the testimony of God's Spirit, both that we are his children, and that all our ways are acceptable to him."
3. "In truth and love ‚Äî Or, faith and love, as St. Paul speaks. Faith and truth are here synonymous terms."
