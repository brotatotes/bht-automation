## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I entreat thee... not as writing a new commandment, but... that which we had from the beginning... we love one another."
2. "The expression of the commandment in the first person is a mark of gentleness and delicacy: a sign that he who wrote it kept the commandment himself."
3. "[This walking in truth is] a walking after God's commandments in love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Love performs both tables of the law, and is the end of
	the law and the Gospel alike."
2. "This verse seems to me to decide that a Church,
	not an individual
	lady,
	is meant."
3. "For a man to urge a woman... that he and she should love
	one another,
	is hardly like an apostolic precept, however pure may be the love
	enjoined; but all is clear if 'the lady' represent a Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John presumed that the command to love one another was understood as far as the gospel was known; and he might well presume it, for true Christianity never prevails anywhere without prompting to the observance of this law."
2. "That we love one another - That is, that there be among the disciples of Christ mutual love; or that in all circumstances and relations they should love one another."
3. "It was a command upon which, in his old age, he loved to dwell; and he had little more to say to her than this, to exhort her to obey this injunction of the Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. New [Œ∫Œ±ŒπŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ] . See on Matthew 26:29. 
We had [ŒµŒπœáŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩ] . The apostle identifies himself with his readers.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "I beseech thee, Syria: the request has in it a tone of dignity as well as of courtesy..."
2. "the apostle urges his request, which is sheltered behind the evangelical law, not as though writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, in the first person, that we love one another."
3. "Let us all walk in love: this, as well as the whole strain, shows the same exquisite courtesy which pervades St. Paul‚Äôs letters to individuals."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beseech (ŒµœÅœâœÑœâ). For pray as in 1 John 5:16."
2. "As though I wrote (œâœÇ Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜœâŒΩ). Common idiom œâœÇ with the participle (present active) for the alleged reason."
3. "That we love one another (ŒπŒΩŒ± Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄœâŒºŒµŒΩ Œ±ŒªŒªŒ∑ŒªŒøœÖœÇ). Either a final clause after ŒµœÅœâœÑœâ as in John 17:15 or an object clause in apposition with ŒµŒΩœÑŒøŒªŒ∑ŒΩ, like 1 John 2:27; 1 John 3:23 and like verse 2 John 1:6."

### John Gill:
