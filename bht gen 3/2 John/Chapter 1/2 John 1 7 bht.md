# 2 John 7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of the deceivers who deny that Jesus Christ came in the flesh; they are the deceivers and the antichrists. These false teachers deny the possibility and actuality of the Incarnation. Their denial of Christ's manifestation in the flesh at His first coming and His personal advent again makes them representatives and precursors of the Antichrist. Love and truth go hand in hand, so be on guard against those who reject the truth of Christ's incarnation. Hold fast to what you have heard from the beginning, for many seducers have entered into the world.
