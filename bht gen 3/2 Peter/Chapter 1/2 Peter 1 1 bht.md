## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "faith,â€”i. e. substance of truth believed: faith objective, not subjective,â€”of equal value: not, which confers equal right to Godâ€™s kingdom, equal honour and glory." 
2. "in His righteousness, which makes no difference between the one party and the other, God has given to you the like precious faith, as to us."
3. "I would interpret, as in Titus ii. 13 [where see note] our God of the Father, and [our] Saviour Jesus Christ of the Son."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Simonâ€”the Greek form: in oldest manuscripts, 'Symeon' (Hebrew, that is, 'hearing), as in :-. His mention of his original name accords with the design of this Second Epistle, which is to warn against the coming false teachers, by setting forth the true 'knowledge' of Christ on the testimony of the original apostolic eye-witnesses like himself. This was not required in the First Epistle." 
2. "obtainedâ€”by grace. Applied by Peter to the receiving of the apostleship, literally, 'by allotment': as the Greek is, Luke 1:9 John 19-24. They did not acquire it for themselves; the divine election is as independent of man's control, as the lot which is east forth." 
3. "like preciousâ€”'equally precious' to all: to those who believe, though not having seen Christ, as well as to Peter and those who have seen Him. For it lays hold of the same 'exceeding great and precious promises,' and the same 'righteousness of God our Saviour.' 'The common salvation . . . the faith once delivered unto the saints' (Judges 1:3)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To them that have obtained like precious faith with us - With us who are of Jewish origin."
2. "The apostle addresses them all now, whatever was their origin, as heirs of the common faith, and as in all respects brethren."
3. "The Greek will undoubtedly bear the construction given in the margin; and if this be the true rendering, it furnishes an argument for the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The combined name, Simon Peter, is found Luke 5:8; John 13:6; John 20:2; John 21:15, and elsewhere."
2. "The word Christ never occurs in the second epistle without Jesus; and only in this instance without some predicate, such as Lord, Savior."
3. "Like precious [Î¹ÏƒÎ¿Ï„Î¹Î¼Î¿Î½] . Only here in New Testament. The word should be written like - precious."

### John Calvin:
1. "But he calls it like or equally precious, not that it is equal in all, but because all possess by faith the same Christ with his righteousness, and the same salvation. Though then the measure is different, that does not prevent the knowledge of God from being common to all, and the fruit which proceeds from it."
2. "He adds, through the righteousness of God, in order that they might know that they did not obtain faith through their own efforts or strength, but through Godâ€™s favor alone. For these things stand opposed the one to the other, the righteousness of God (in the sense in which it is taken here) and the merit of man."
3. "For the efficient cause of faith is called Godâ€™s righteousness for this reason, because no one is capable of conferring it on himself. So the righteousness that is to be understood, is not that which remains in God, but that which he imparts to men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reason, however, may be that the writer has it in view to emphasize in the present connection his own Jewish origin, and enlist sympathetic attention to his admonitions, by exhibiting at the outset the common platform of grace on which Jewish Christians like himself and Gentile Christians like his readers stood."
2. "Hence it is most probably intended here to express the general idea of office, of which the apostleship was a special and distinguishing instance."
3. "The only sense that will suit the context (where the equality of Jew and Gentile in respect of faith is in view) is the broad sense of the rectitude, or righteous impartiality, of God and Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The faith which they have obtained is like in honor and privilege with that of Peter or any of the apostles."
2. "The righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ."
3. "The use of Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï‚ by Peter as a predicate with Jesus Christ no more disproves the Petrine authorship of this Epistle than a like use in John 1:1 disproves the Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel and the same use in Titus 2:13 disproves the genuineness of Titus."

### John Gill:
1. "Simon Peter, a servant, and an apostle of Jesus Christ...and is the same with Simeon; and so it is read in most copies; a name common with the Jews; the latter is what was given him by Christ at his conversion, John 1:4, and answers to Cephas in the Syriac language; and both signify a rock or stone, because he was built upon Christ."
2. "not of sin, nor Satan, nor man, but Jesus Christ, whose servant he was, not only by creation, but by redemption and grace; and not merely a servant of his, in common with other believers, but in a ministerial way, as a preacher of the Gospel, which this phrase sometimes designs."
3. "one that was immediately sent by Christ, had his commission and doctrine directly from him, and a power of working miracles...and an authority at large to go everywhere and preach the Gospel, plant churches, and put them in due order, and place proper persons over them."

### John Wesley:
1. "To them that have obtained â€” Not by their own works, but by the free grace of God."
2. "Like precious faith with us â€” The apostles. The faith of those who have not seen, being equally precious with that of those who saw our Lord in the flesh."
3. "Through the righteousness â€” Both active and passive. Of our God and Saviour â€” It is this alone by which the justice of God is satisfied, and for the sake of which he gives this precious faith."
