## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Give diligence...to make for yourselves your calling and election secure."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To make" absolutely and finally is God's part, and would be in the active.
2. The ensuring of our election is spoken of not in respect to God, whose counsel is steadfast and everlasting, but in respect to our part.

2. "The meaning here is, that they were to obtain such evidences of personal piety as to put the question whether they were 'called' and 'chosen,' so far as their own minds were concerned, to rest; or so as to have undoubted evidence on this point."
3. "Whatever may be the secret purpose of God in regard to us, the only evidence that we have that we shall be saved is to be found in the fact that we are sincere Christians, and are honestly endeavoring to do his will."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Give the more diligence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning then is = the case being as it has been explained...let these grave considerations of what is to be gained by the one course and what is to be lost by the other, make you all the more diligent..."
2. "But the fact that the â€˜electionâ€™ is named after the â€˜calling,â€™ and the awkwardness of speaking of the immutable decree of God as capable of being made sure by us, indicate that what is in view here is not the eternal election, but the historical, that is to say, the actual separation of the readers from their old life, and their introduction into the kingdom of Christ."
3. "For, doing these things, ye shall never stumble. It is true, therefore, that it indicates a â€˜step short of fallingâ€™ (Plumptre). It is so represented in Paulâ€™s question, â€˜Have they stumbled that they should fall...speaks of a stumbling or offending which is not hopeless. Here, however, it manifestly refers to the final issue of a forfeiture of salvation..."
