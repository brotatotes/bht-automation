# 2 Peter 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As I come to realize the brevity of my time in this earthly tabernacle, it is my solemn duty to stir you up and keep you spiritually awake. The intensity of Satan's opposition should motivate us to make the most of our limited time. Our bodies, like a temporary tent, remind us of the transient nature of our existence. Let us, therefore, diligently remind and rouse each other to faithfully persevere, especially as we approach the end of our earthly journey and prepare for eternity.
