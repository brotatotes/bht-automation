3. Though a violent death, he calls it a "departure" (Greek for "decease," 2 Peter 1:15), compare Acts 7:60.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is one of the few instances that have occurred in the world, where a man knew distinctly, long beforehand, what would be the manner of his own death, and where he could have it constantly in his eye."
2. "Peter would naturally seek to prepare himself for death in the particular form in which he knew it would occur to him; we should prepare for it in whatever way it may occur to us."
3. "Our days, like the fabled Sybilâ€™s leaves, become more valuable as they are diminished in number; and as the inevitable hour draws nearer to us, we should labor more diligently in our Masterâ€™s cause, gird our loins more closely, and trim our lamps."

2. "He declares that death is departing from this world, that we may remove elsewhere, even to the Lord. It ought not, then, to be dreadful to us, as though we were to perish when we die."
3. "For the apostles had not regard only for their own age, but purposed to do us good also. Though, then, they are dead, their doctrine lives and prevails: and it is our duty to profit by their writings, as though they were manifestly present with us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is some doubt as to the precise point intended by the â€˜quick.â€™ The epithet is a rare form ... of the ordinary adjective which means either swift or sudden."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The putting off of my tabernacle... For the metaphor see 2 Corinthians 5:3."
2. "Cometh swiftly... Either sense agrees with the urgent tone of Peter here, whether he felt his death to be near or violent or both."
3. "Signified unto me... Peter refers to the incident told in John 21:18, which he knew by personal experience before John wrote it down."

### John Gill:
1. "He sets forth his death in a very easy and familiar way, it being not at all terrible and distressing to him; it was but like the putting off of a garment, or unpinning of a tabernacle, or a removing from a tent to a palace."
2. "Saints are pilgrims here, they dwell in tents or tabernacles, at death they remove to their own country, and Father's house."
3. "Death is not a destruction of man, an annihilation of him, neither of his soul nor body: the soul is not mortal, it dies not with the body; it only removes from this world to another, from a cottage to a kingdom; and the body though it dies, it is not reduced to nothing, it is only like a tabernacle put off, or taken down, which will be put together again in better order than now it is."

### John Wesley:
1. "Even as the Lord Jesus showed me."
2. "In the manner which he had foretold."
3. "It is not improbable, he had also showed him that the time was now drawing nigh."
