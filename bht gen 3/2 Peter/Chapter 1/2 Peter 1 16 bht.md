A precautionary protest of the Spirit against the rationalistic theory of the Gospel history being myth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The â€˜mythsâ€™ are defined as â€˜cunningly devised,â€™ or cleverly elaborated..."

2. "Cunningly devised fables (ÏƒÎµÏƒÎ¿Ï†Î¹ÏƒÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹Ï‚ Î¼Ï…Î¸Î¿Î¹Ï‚)...only here and the Pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 1:4, etc.)...to invent cleverly (here) and so also in the old writers and in the papyri." 
3. "But we were eye-witnesses (Î±Î»Î»' ÎµÏ€Î¿Ï€Ï„Î± Î³ÎµÎ½Î·Î¸ÎµÎ½Ï„ÎµÏ‚)...used of those who attained the third or highest degree of initiates in the Eleusinian mysteries...Peter clearly felt that he and James and John were lifted to the highest stage of initiation at the Transfiguration of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables,.... Such as Jewish fables, cautioned against Titus 1:14."
2. "Now in order to set forth the nature, excellency, and certainty of the doctrine the apostle taught, especially that part of it which respected the coming of Christ; and to show that it was worth his while to put them in mind of it, and theirs to remember it; he observes, that he and his fellow apostles did not proceed in their account of it on such a foundation, but upon an evidence which they had received, both with their eyes and ears, and also on a word of prophecy surer than that."
3. "But were eyewitnesses of his majesty; meaning, not of the glory of his divine nature by faith, and with the eyes of their understanding, while others only considered him as a mere man; nor of the miracles he wrought, in which there was a display of his glory and majesty, of all which the apostles were eyewitnesses; but of that glory and greatness which were upon him, when he was transfigured on the mount before them."

### John Wesley:
1. "These things are worthy to be always had in remembrance For they are not cunningly devised fables."

"If what they advanced of Christ was not true, if it was of their own invention, then to impose such a lie on the world as it was, in the very nature of things, above all human power to defend, and to do this at the expense of life and all things only to enrage the whole world, Jews and gentiles, against them, was no cunning, but was the greatest folly that men could have been guilty of."
3. "But were eyewitnesses of his majesty â€” At his transfiguration, which was a specimen of his glory at the last day."
