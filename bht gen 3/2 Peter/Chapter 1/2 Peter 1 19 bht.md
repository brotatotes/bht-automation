# 2 Peter 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By possessing the prophetic word, we have a more sure confirmation of God's truth. It is like a lamp shining in a dark place, guiding us until the day of Christ's glory dawns. This prophetic word is a surer testament to Christ's deity than the Transfiguration, as it reveals the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies. It assures us that Christ's sufferings will be followed by His glory. Thus, we should firmly hold on to the prophetic word until the day dawns and all is made clear.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We have firmer hold of, or esteem [possess] more sure, the prophetic word, as now having in our own ears begun its fulfilment."
2. "The written word of God, inspired into and transmitted through men, [is] something firmer, more secure, than the uttered voice of God Himself."
3. "The being in the first [degree of the Christian life] is naturally called a walking in a dark place, in the light of a candle, while the being in the latter [degree] is a walking in the light of the morning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Prophecy assures us that Christ's sufferings, now past, are to be followed by Christ's glory, still future: the Transfiguration gives us a pledge to make our faith still stronger, that 'the day' of His glory will 'dawn' ere long."
2. "The word was the 'lamp (Greek for 'light') heeded' by Old Testament believers, until a gleam of the 'day dawn' was given at Christ's first coming, and especially in His Transfiguration."
3. "The day, when it dawns upon you, makes sure the fact that you saw correctly, though indistinctly, the objects revealed by the lamp."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The prophecies resemble a candle, lamp, or torch, in a dark room, or in an obscure road at night. They make objects distinct which were before unseen; they enable us to behold many things which would be otherwise invisible."
2. "Until the day shall dawn, and we shall see objects by the clear light of the sun, they are to be our guide. A lamp is of great value in a dark night, though it may not disclose objects so clearly as the light of the sun. But it may be a safe and sure guide; and a man who has to travel in dark and dangerous places, does well to 'take heed' to his lamp."
3. "Until you see the indications of that approaching day in which all is light. The period referred to here by the approaching day that is to diffuse this light, is when the Saviour shall return in the full revelation of his glory - the splendor of his kingdom. Then all will be clear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We have the word of prophecy made more sure, i.e., we are better certified than before as to the prophetic word by reason of this voice." 
2. "We have the word of prophecy as a surer confirmation of God's truth than what we ourselves saw, i.e., Old-Testament testimony is more convincing than even the voice heard at the transfiguration." 
3. "It was not the miracles of Christ by which he came to know Jesus, but the word of Christ as interpreted by the spirit of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "The truth of the gospel is founded on the oracles of the prophets, lest they who embraced it should hesitate to devote themselves wholly to Christ."
2. "The whole course of our life ought to be guided by Godâ€™s word; for otherwise we must be involved on every side in the darkness of ignorance; and the Lord does not shine on us, except when we take his word as our light."
3. "The Papists have ever and anon in their mouth, that the Church cannot err. Though the word is neglected, they yet imagine that it is guided by the Spirit. But Peter, on the contrary, intimates that all are immersed in darkness who do not attend to the light of the word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "we have the prophetic word made more sure."
2. "we have something surer still, namely the prophetic word."
3. "the prophetic word must be attended to until the present imperfect measure of grace and knowledge in the believer gives place to an immediate perception and clear assurance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Transfiguration scene confirmed the Messianic prophecies and made clear the deity of Jesus Christ as God's Beloved Son."
2. "The word of prophecy is a surer confirmation of Christ's deity than the Transfiguration."
3. "Shining in a dark place until the day dawn, the day-star arise."

### John Gill:
1. "We have also a more sure word of prophecy,...."
2. "This word of prophecy is not to be understood of the prophetic writings of the Old Testament; for though these are the word of God, and do testify of Christ, and are to be taken heed, and attended to, as proofs and evidence of Gospel truths, and are a light to direct and guide in matters both of faith and practice, yet they are not the only light, and are far from being the clearest, and what are only to be attended to."
3. "The prophecy concerning Christ's second coming is as 'as a light'; it is a revelation of that which was in the dark, lay hid as a secret and mystery in the heart of God; and which could not be known by men, had it not been foretold by God; and it is made as prophecy in all other cases is, by throwing light, as to this affair, into the mind of him, or them, to whom it is revealed."

### John Wesley:
1. "The words of Moses, Isaiah, and all the prophets, are one and the same word, every way consistent with itself."
2. "Wherein there was neither light nor window. Such anciently was the whole world, except that little spot where this lamp shone."
3. "As is the difference between the light of a lamp and that of the day, such is that between the light of the Old Testament and of the New."
