## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No prophecy of Scripture comes of private interpretation."
2. "This last purpose is not only not indicated in the context, but is quite out of the question; the Apostle referring to prophecy not as difficult of interpretation, but as a candle shining in a dark place."
3. "Prophecy springs not out of human interpretation, i.e. is not a prognostication made by a man knowing what he means when he utters it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No prophecy is found to be the result of 'private interpretation'...was plainly not of his own, but of God's disclosure, origination, and inspiration." 
2. "The words of the prophetical (and so of all) Scripture writers were not mere words of the individuals, and therefore to be interpreted by them, but of 'the Holy Ghost' by whom they were 'moved.'"
3. "He who is the author of Scripture is its supreme interpreter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bearing this steadily in mind as a primary and most important truth."
2. "The apostle teaches that the truths which the prophets communicated were not originated by themselves; were not of their own suggestion or invention; were not their own opinions, but were of higher origin, and were imparted by God."
3. "The fact that it discloses truths which the human mind could not of itself have originated, is a good reason for studying [the Bible] with diligence and with prayer - not for supposing that it is unlawful for us to attempt to understand it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is [Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒµœÑŒ±Œπ] . More literally, arises or originates."
2. "Private [ŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ±œÇ] . See on ver. 3. His own. Rev., special, in margin."
3. "Interpretation [ŒµœÄŒπŒªœÖœÉŒµœâœÇ] . Only here in New Testament. Compare the cognate verb expounded (Mark 4:34) and determined (Acts 19:39)."

### John Calvin:
1. "There may at the same time be two interpretations given, if you read ·ºêœÄŒ∑Œª·ΩªœÉŒµœâœÇ as some do, which means occurrence, impulse; or, as I have rendered it, interpretation, ·ºêœÄŒπŒª·ΩªœÉŒµœâœÇ."
2. "But Peter calls interpretation private, not that of every individual, in order to prohibit each one to interpret; but he shews that whatever men bring of their own is profane."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No prophecy of scripture comes of private interpretation."

3. "And in what sense prophecy is something more than the expression of the prophet‚Äôs own ideas or prognostications, is stated in the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No prophecy of Scripture comes out of private disclosure," not "of private interpretation."
2. "The usual meaning of ŒµœÄŒπŒªœÖœÉŒπœÇ is explanation, but the word does not occur elsewhere in the N.T."
3. "It is the prophet's grasp of the prophecy, not that of the readers that is here presented, as the next verse shows."
