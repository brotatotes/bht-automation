# 2 Peter 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By diligently adding to our faith, we are to manifest moral power and energetic excellency, translating our belief into action. Each grace assumed becomes a stepping stone to the next, with faith leading the band and love closing it. We are called to strive for progress, not content with one virtue but seeking to reach the highest elevation in holiness. The internal process of spiritual development requires understanding the will of the Lord. As we superadd virtues without losing the former, our diligence is accompanied by an increase in all of God's gifts.
