# 2 Peter 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By possessing these graces and allowing them to multiply within us, we are not rendered idle or unfruitful in our pursuit of knowing Jesus Christ. They serve as the means to advance towards a perfect knowledge of Him. As we become increasingly like Him, we are better able to see Him as He truly is. These virtues are not just theoretical, but require continuous growth and development in our lives. Let us not be complacent, but actively engage in doing His will and becoming more like Him, for it is through this process that we truly come to know Him.

1. "The word selected there is not the simple verb 'to be,' but another which implies not only existence but continuous existence, and looks at the possession of graces as a thing characterizing the readers, not merely now, but in their original spiritual condition."
2. "The idea, therefore, is that where these graces are one‚Äôs permanent inward property, at his command, and growing from strength to strength like things that live, they put him in a position, or create in him a constitution, under which it cannot be that he shall prove himself either a useless trifler doing no honest work, or an unprofitable servant effecting what is of no worth even when he gives himself to action."
3. "The sevenfold symmetry of the spiritual character, and the furnishing forth of all these varied graces, are recommended not as ends to themselves, but as means toward the higher end of an ever enlarging, and at last perfect, knowledge of Christ Himself."

### John Gill:
1. "And this is a mere notional and speculative knowledge, such as is not attended with any inward experience and application of Christ to themselves, or any fruits of righteousness in their lives, and is a bare theory of things relating to his person, offices, and works..."
2. "...there is a knowledge of him that is spiritual and experimental, by which a soul not only approves of Christ, but places its trust and confidence in him, and appropriates him to himself..."
3. "...he is not like the barren fig tree, or the earth that bears briers and thorns, and is nigh to cursing and burning, but like a tree planted by a river of water, and is green, flourishing, and fruitful."

### John Wesley:
1. "And abounding ‚Äî Increasing more and more, otherwise we fall short."
2. "Do not suffer you to be faint in your mind, or without fruit in your lives."
3. "If there is less faithfulness, less care and watchfulness, since we were pardoned, than there was before, and less diligence, less outward obedience, than when we were seeking remission of sin, we are both slothful and unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ, that is, in the faith, which then cannot work by love."
