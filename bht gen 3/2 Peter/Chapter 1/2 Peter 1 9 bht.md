# 2 Peter 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The absence of these qualities, indicating spiritual blindness and forgetfulness of the purification of sins through baptism, hinders one's discernment of their own spiritual state and inheritance in heaven. Without these qualities, one becomes short-sighted, fixated on present earthly things and unable to see heavenly things. The practice of remembering one's forgiven sins serves as a strong motivation for every grace. Those lacking these qualities have an indistinct vision of religion and struggle to perceive the elementary truths of the kingdom of God.

"He sees not that he is poor, and wretched, and miserable, but fancies himself to be rich, and in need of nothing; he sees nothing but outward things, the things of time and sense, worldly and earthly things, which are near him, and all around him, which he minds, on which his heart is set, and he pursues with rigour."
3. "He does not consider, nor think of it, that he was a sinner of old, a sinner in Adam, that he was conceived and shapen in sin, and went astray, and was called a transgressor from the womb; he does not think that he stands in any need of being purged from former sins; and is entirely unmindful of, and neglects, the purification of them by the blood of Christ."
