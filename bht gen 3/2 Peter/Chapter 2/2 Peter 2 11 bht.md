## BHT:
Even angels, who are so far above them, do not bring railing accusations against glories. Before the Lord the Judge, present and fearful, they abstain from judgment. If superior angels dare not speak evil of bad angels, how awful the presumption of those who speak evil of good 'dignities.' Satan, still a strong man, and his hierarchy of principalities and powers are to be respected. A warning against irreverence towards them, it ultimately curses one's own soul.
