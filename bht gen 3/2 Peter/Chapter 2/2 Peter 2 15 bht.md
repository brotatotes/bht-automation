2. "Possibly, however, he might have designed to refer to a more general resemblance, for in fact they imitated him in the following things: (1) In being professed religious teachers, or the servants of God; (2) In their covetousness; (3) In inducing others to sin, referring to the same kind of sins in both cases."
