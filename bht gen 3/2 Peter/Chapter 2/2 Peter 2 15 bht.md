# 2 Peter 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These false teachers have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following in the footsteps of Balaam, who loved the wages of unrighteousness. Balaam was a prophet who, driven by the love of gain, used his position for wicked ends. They spread deadly poison in their teaching, seeking to destroy the simple. Like Balaam's counsel enticed Israel to fleshly lust and idolatry, these false teachers lead others away from the path of truth. They are like wells without water and mists driven by a whirlwind, destined for the blackness of darkness.
