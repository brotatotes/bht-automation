# 2 Peter 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These false teachers, like clouds without water, promised refreshing truths but only brought disappointment and darkness. Just as misty clouds deceive the traveler's hope of water, these teachers excited delusive hopes with their lofty promises, only to leave bitter disappointment. Their doom is certain and perpetual, their fate likened to waterless springs. Though they appeared as angels of light, they were like drifting mist-clouds that vanish and leave behind only darkness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Clouds . . . without water" (promising what they do not perform).
2. "Great swelling words" are found on trial to be but "vanity."
3. "Mists" are dark, not transparent and bright as "clouds" often are, fittingly emblematic of the children of darkness.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nothing to an oriental mind would be more expressive than to say of professed religious teachers, that they were 'wells without water.'"
2. "In a world, not unaptly compared, in regard to its real comforts, to the wastes and sands of the desert, they would only grievously disappoint the expectations of all those who were seeking for the refreshing influences of the truths of the gospel."
3. "The expectation of the farmer is excited that the thirsty earth is to be refreshed with needful showers. Instead of this, however, the wind 'gets into' the cloud; it is driven about, and no rain falls, or it ends in a destructive tornado which sweeps everything before it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The metaphor is that of an ever upleaping, living fountain."
2. "The verdure excites the traveler's hope of water."
3. "Denoting a well-understood doom."

### John Calvin:

2. "He says that they were clouds carried by the wind, either without rain, or which burst forth into a calamitous storm."
3. "By naming the mist or the blackness of darkness, he alludes to the clouds which obscure the air; as though he had said, that for the momentary darkness which they now spread, there is prepared for them a much thicker darkness which is to continue for ever."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is rather in respect simply of the pretence which they make, and the deception which they practise, that they are likened to waterless springs."
2. "Like the drifting mist-clouds, presaging rain to refresh the earth and enrich the husbandman, which suddenly vanish and leave bitter disappointment to the expectant, when they are caught up by the tempest, so these teachers excite delusive hopes by lofty promises which leave nothing behind them."
3. "It asserts the Divine certainty, the hopelessness, the perpetuity of the doom of these apostates."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Without water...common and disappointing experience of travellers in the orient."
2. "Mists...old word for fog, here alone in N.T."
3. "For whom...dative case of personal interest."

### John Gill:
1. "These men looked like angels of light, transformed themselves as ministers of righteousness, had a form of godliness, and boasted of their great knowledge; promised great advantages to their followers, but were like deceitful brooks, or dry wells, and so disappointed those that came to them, and attended on them."
2. "These false teachers may be compared to clouds for their number, for many antichrists and false prophets soon came into the world; and for their sudden rise in the churches, into which they crept privily and unawares; and because of the general darkness they spread."
3. "The nature of their punishment is expressed by 'darkness', the blackest darkness, the mist of darkness, and which Jude calls blackness of darkness, the same with utter darkness; and which signifies a most forlorn and uncomfortable condition, and is a righteous judgment, and just retaliation upon them who studied to darken counsel by words without knowledge."

### John Wesley:
1. Fountains and clouds promise water: so do these promise, but do not perform.
