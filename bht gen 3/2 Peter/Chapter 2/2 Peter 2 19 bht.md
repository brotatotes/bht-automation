# 2 Peter 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of those who promise personal liberty but are slaves to corruption and sin themselves. They use great swelling words to entice others, advocating a liberty that is nothing but license, allowing the flesh to indulge. However, this false sense of freedom cannot compare to the true liberty found in Christ, where we are freed from the bondage of sin. Let us not be deceived by their cunning tricks and instead embrace the genuine freedom that comes through the truth in Christ.

1. While they promise them liberty â€” From needless restraints and scruples; from the bondage of the law.
Themselves are slaves of corruption â€” Even sin, the vilest of all bondage.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who entice others with their promises of liberty are actually leading them into a slavery to sin and corruption. They boldly proclaim their false ideals, deceiving those who long for freedom. Yet, what kind of freedom can be attained from those who themselves are enslaved to their own vices? It is only through the truth of Christ that true liberty is found, a freedom from sin and a new way of living. This deceitful notion of liberty is nothing more than a license for indulgence, a dangerous path that leads to eternal destruction. Let us then be cautious and discerning, for the liberty offered by Christ is the only true freedom that sets us free from the bondage of sin and corruption.
