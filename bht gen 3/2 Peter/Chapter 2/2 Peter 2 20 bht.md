# 2 Peter 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who once escaped the pollutions and corruption of the world by finding knowledge in Christ often find themselves entangled again in their former sinful ways. This relapse is worse than their original state of paganism because they no longer have the excuse of ignorance. Outward reformation does not guarantee true grace, and it would have been better for them not to have known righteousness at all. True progress in the gospel means faithfully learning from Christ and putting off the old self.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who once escaped the pollutions and corruption of the world by coming to know Christ, find themselves becoming entangled once again. They repeatedly fall into their former sinful ways and are repeatedly worsted. At first, their new knowledge of Christ seemed to have brought reform and escape from the world's pollutions. However, this outward reformation does not necessarily indicate true grace in their hearts. In fact, their relapse is declared to be worse than their original state of paganism because they are no longer excused by ignorance. It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness at all. They are like servants who knowingly and willfully despise their master's commands and deserve a twofold punishment. Truly progressing in the gospel means faithfully learning from Christ and putting off the old self. Only then can one truly know Christ.
