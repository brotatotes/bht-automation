# 2 Peter 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is better for those who have known the way of righteousness and the holy commandment to not turn back from it. The way of righteousness is the way of truth and Christian doctrine, while the holy commandment refers to the moral law of the gospel. Turning back from the holy commandment means going against the inviolate Gospel that enjoins holiness. Those who have known the way of righteousness and turn back are said to be in a worse state than those who have never known it at all.
