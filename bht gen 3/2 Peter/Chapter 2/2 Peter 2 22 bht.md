# 2 Peter 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These apostates, compared to dogs and swine, have returned to their own vomit and are wallowing in the mire once again. Their external reformation did not bring about a genuine internal change, with their hearts remaining untouched. They barely escaped their previous state before getting entangled in their filthy folly once more, even leading others astray. This serves as a reminder that sin is abominable and defiling, represented by vomit and mire. Their return to former ways highlights their irrecoverable condition without a change in their nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There hath happened to them that of the true proverb, The dog gone back to his own vomit."
2. "The sow after washing to wallowing in the mire."
3. "The washed sow to the mire."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "They 'scarcely' have escaped from their filthy folly, when they again are entangled in it."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "No matter how clean the swine is made by washing, this would not prevent it, in the slightest degree, from rolling in filth again."
3. "This passage will prove - what there are abundant facts to confirm - that persons may reform externally, and then return again to their former corrupt habits; it can never be made to prove that one true Christian will fall away and perish."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vomit. Wallowing. Mire." 
2. "This use of dogs and swine together recalls Matthew 7:6." 
3. "On proverb, see notes on Matthew 13:3."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle, in order to remove the offense, says that this happens through their own fault, and that because they are pigs and dogs. It hence follows that no part of the sin can be ascribed to the gospel."
2. "The gospel is a medicine which purges us by wholesome vomiting, but that there are many dogs who swallow again what they have vomited to their own ruin."
3. "The gospel is also a laver which cleanses all our uncleanness, but that there are many swine who, immediately after washing, roll themselves again in the mud."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'but' which the A. V. introduces is not sufficiently supported."
2. "The actual terms in the original, however, differ so much as to make it more probable that he was simply repeating a well-known popular maxim."
3. "These wretched men were never what they professed to be. They had, indeed, undergone a process of external reformation; but it was external merely, their heart all the while remaining unchanged."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first proverb here given comes from Proverbs 26:11. ŒïŒæŒµœÅŒ±ŒºŒ± is a late and rare word (here only in N.T., in Diosc. and Eustath.) from ŒµŒæŒµœÅŒ±œâ, to vomit."
2. "This second proverb does not occur in the O.T., probably from a Gentile source because about the habit of hogs. Epictetus and other writers moralize on the habit of hogs, having once bathed in a filthy mud-hole, to delight in it."
3. "J. Rendel Harris (Story of Ahikar, p. LXVII) tells of a story about a hog that went to the bath with people of quality, but on coming out saw a stinking drain and went and rolled himself in it."

### John Gill:
1. "The dog [is] turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire; which expresses the filthy nature of sin, signified by vomit, mire, and dirt, than which nothing is more abominable and defiling." 
2. "Also the just characters of these apostates, who are filly compared to dogs and swine and likewise their irreclaimable and irrecoverable state and condition, it being impossible they should be otherwise, unless their natures were changed and altered."
3. "So such apostates return to what they were before, to their former principles and practices."

### John Wesley:
1. The dog, the sow ‚Äî Such are all men in the sight of God before they receive his grace, and after they have made shipwreck of the faith. Proverbs 26:11.
