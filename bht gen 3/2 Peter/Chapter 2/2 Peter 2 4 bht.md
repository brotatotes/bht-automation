# 2 Peter 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If God did not spare angels when they sinned, casting them into hell and reserving them in dark dens for judgment, then surely, He will not spare the ungodly. Even the highest of intelligent creatures, angels, were not spared and are confined in the gloomy abode of the wicked, kept for judgment. God, as the judge of the whole world, does not show favoritism and will not forgive wickedness. Therefore, let us be watchful, for even false teachers who deny the truth will not escape God's vengeance.
