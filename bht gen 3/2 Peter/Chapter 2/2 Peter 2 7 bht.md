### Philip Schaff:
1. "The verb which is rendered ‘vexed’ by the A. V., but which has the stronger sense of ‘sore distressed’ (as the R. V. puts it), or ‘worn down,’ occurs only once again, viz. in Acts 7:24, where it is translated ‘oppressed.’"
2. "The adjective which the A. V. translates ‘wicked,’ but which has the more definite sense of ‘lawless,’ occurs only once again, namely in chap. 2 Peter 3:17."
