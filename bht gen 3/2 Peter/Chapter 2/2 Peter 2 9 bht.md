# 2 Peter 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord, who possesses both the wisdom and power to deliver the godly, knows exactly how to rescue them from temptation. In contrast, the unrighteous will be reserved for punishment until the day of judgment, even though they may seem to go free in the present. Sin already carries its own penalty, but the full manifestation of punishment awaits the ungodly. Though we may question why God allows us to be surrounded by wickedness, we find courage knowing that He claims the responsibility of helping and protecting His own.
