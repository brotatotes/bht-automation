## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (notwithstanding the delay) the day of the Lord shall (or, will) come as a thief in which the heavens shall pass away with a rushing noise, and the heavenly bodies being scorched up shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it shall be burned up."
2. "It is more than merely 'shall come,' though no one word will give the exact force in English: 'shall be here,' 'shall be upon you'."
3. "This may mean either the works of men, buildings and the like,‚Äîor, the works of the Creator: perhaps both of these combined, 'the works of nature and art'."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The day of the Lord SHALL come and be present."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The day of the Lord Jesus. That is, the day in which he will be manifested."
2. "Will come as a thief in the night - Unexpectedly; suddenly."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "As a thief. Omit in the night. Compare Matthew 24:43; 1 Thessalonians 4:2, 1 Thessalonians 4:4; Revelation 3:3; Revelation 16:15."
3. "With a great noise [œÅŒøŒπŒ∂Œ∑Œ¥ŒøŒΩ] . An adverb peculiar to Peter, and occurring only here."

### John Calvin:
1. "But the day of the Lord will come...that the faithful might be always watching, and not promise to-morrow to themselves."
2. "For we all labor under two very different evils ‚Äî too much haste, and slothfulness."

1. "Though some deem it so late of appearing (the writer means), that it may never appear, and though it is true that God in His long-suffering delays the event, ‚Äòyet come will (or, ‚Äòon you shall be ‚Äò) the day of the Lord.‚Äô"
2. "The suddenness with which it will enter is next asserted. as a thief: the best authorities omit the words ‚Äòin the night‚Äô which are added in the A. V."
3. "The phrase ‚Äòwith a great noise,‚Äô which is given by both the A. V. and the R. V., is a prosaic rendering, which entirely fails to do justice to the singular vividness and force of the original."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This great day will certainly come (Œ∑ŒæŒµ)."
2. "As a thief (œâœÇ Œ∫ŒªŒµœÄœÑŒ∑œÇ). That is suddenly, without notice."
