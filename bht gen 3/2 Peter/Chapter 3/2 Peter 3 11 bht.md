# 2 Peter 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness! Since this is an undoubted truth, the certainty of the end is made doubly vivid by the process of dissolution being represented as having already set in and as now working towards its final revelation. They hasten it by perfecting, in repentance and holiness, the work of the Gospel, and thus diminishing the need of the 'long-suffering'.
