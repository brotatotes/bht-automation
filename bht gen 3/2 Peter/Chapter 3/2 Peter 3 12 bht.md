# 2 Peter 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By praying for His coming, furthering the preaching of the Gospel, and bringing in those whom God waits to save, we hasten the coming of the day of God. Our part is to speed forward this consummation by praying, Even so, come, Lord Jesus. We have been given many myriads of days, but one day will be the great day of God Himself. Thus, we should earnestly desire and hasten on this day by fulfilling the conditions necessary for its coming.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By praying for His coming, furthering the preaching of the Gospel for a witness to all nations, and bringing in those whom 'the long-suffering of God' waits to save, we hasten the coming of the day of God." 
2. "Christ says, 'Surely I come quickly. Amen.' Our part is to speed forward this consummation by praying, 'Even so, come, Lord Jesus.'"
3. "God has given many myriads of days to men: one shall be the great 'day of God' Himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Looking for - Not knowing when this may occur, the mind should be in that state which constitutes 'expectation;' that is, a belief that it will occur, and a condition of mind in which we would not be taken by surprise should it happen at any moment."
2. "The true Christian does not dread the coming of that day. He looks forward to it as the period of his redemption, and would welcome, at any time, the return of his Lord and Saviour."
3. "The coming of the day of God - Called 'the day of God,' because God will then be manifested in his power and glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "causing the day of the Lord to come more quickly by helping to fulfil those conditions without which it cannot come; that day being no day inexorably fixed, but one the arrival of which it is free to the church to hasten on by faith and by prayer" (Trench, on "The Authorized Version of the New Testament").
2. "causing the day of the Lord to come more quickly by helping to fulfil those conditions without which it cannot come" (Trench, on "The Authorized Version of the New Testament").
3. "Melt [œÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒµœÑŒ±Œπ] . Literal. Stronger than the word in vv. 10, 11. Not only the resolving, but the wasting away of nature."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as quietness and waiting are the peculiarities of hope, so we must always take heed lest the security of the flesh should creep in; we ought, therefore, strenuously to labor in good works, and run quickly in the race of our calling."
2. "Hasten slowly."
3. "He refers to the endurance of hope; and he sets hastening in opposition to topor; and both are very apposite."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The idea, therefore, is that of accelerating the advent of that decisive day through our holy lives and our labours for the advancement of the Gospel, causing that day to ‚Äòcome the more quickly, as Archbishop Trench explains it..."
2. "The meaning is that this event of the ‚ÄòComing,‚Äô or this ‚Äòday of God,‚Äô will occasion the change or catastrophe which is reaffirmed here. The one thing will inevitably cause the other."
3. "The use to be made of the passage, however, must be a very guarded one, so far as theorizings about the nature of the end are concerned. Peter is speaking in terms of the lofty prophetic imagery of the O. T."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Earnestly desiring (œÉœÄŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ). Present active participle, accusative also, of œÉœÄŒµœÖŒ¥œâ, old verb, to hasten (like our speed) as in Luke 2:16, but it is sometimes transitive as here either (preferably so) to 'hasten on the parousia' by holy living (cf. 1 Peter 2:12), with which idea compare Matthew 6:10; Acts 3:19, or to desire earnestly (Isaiah 16:5)." 
2. "Being on fire (œÄœÖœÅŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒø). Present passive participle of œÄœÖœÅŒøœâ, old verb (from pur), same idea as in verse 2 Peter 3:10."
3. "Shall melt (œÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒµœÑŒ±). Futuristic present passive indicative of œÑŒ∑Œ∫œâ, old verb, to make liquid, here only in N.T. Hort suggests œÑŒ∑ŒæŒµœÑŒ± (future middle), though Isaiah 34:4 has œÑŒ±Œ∫Œ∑œÉŒøŒΩœÑŒ± (second future passive). The repetitions here make 'an effective refrain (Mayor).'"

### John Gill:
1. "The coming of this day saints should be 'looking for' by faith; believing that it certainly will come, since the patriarchs, prophets, Christ himself, the angels of heaven, and the apostles of the Lamb, have all declared and asserted the coming of this day." 
2. "They should look for it, and love it, as with the strongest affection for it, and most vehement desire of it, since they will then appear with Christ in glory."
3. "Saints should be hasting to it by their readiness for it, having their loins girt, and their lights burning, and their lamps trimmed, and they waiting for their Lord's coming, and going forth in acts of faith and love, and in the duties of religion, to meet him, and not slumber and sleep."

### John Wesley:
1. "Hastening on ‚Äî As it were by your earnest desires and fervent prayers."
2. "The coming of the day of God ‚Äî Many myriads of days he grants to men: one, the last, is the day of God himself."
