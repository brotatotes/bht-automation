# 2 Peter 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The skeptics' misunderstanding of the Lord's patience leads them to perceive it as slackness, but it actually presents an opportunity for repentance and salvation. Peter acknowledges Paul's supernatural wisdom given by God, not acquired through human education, solely to affirm the humility and love in Paul's Epistles. Implications of Christ's delayed return must not be interpreted as a postponement, but exemplify divine long-suffering, allowing ample time for the offer of grace and salvation. Paul's writings effectively reinforce Peter's teachings and possess wisdom that persuades individuals to repent and find salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those scoffers 'count it (to be the result of) slackness' on the Lord's part."
2. "Our beloved brother Paul‚Äîa beautiful instance of love and humility. Peter praises the very Epistles which contain his condemnation."
3. "Supernatural and inspired wisdom 'GIVEN' him, not acquired in human schools of learning."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Regard his delay in coming to judge the world, not as an evidence that he never will come, but as a proof of his desire that we should be saved."
2. "Let any man look on his own sins, his pride, and selfishness, and sensuality; let him contemplate the fact that he has sinned through many years, and against many mercies; let him endeavor to estimate the number and magnitude of his offences, and upon God‚Äôs patience in bearing with him while these have been committed, and who can overrate the force of such an argument in proof that God is slow to anger, and is willing to save?"
3. "Peter evidently did not mean to disparage that wisdom, or to express a doubt that Paul was endowed with wisdom; he meant undoubtedly that, in regard to Paul, the same thing was true which he would have affirmed of himself or of any other man, that whatever wisdom he had was to be traced to a higher than human origin."

### John Calvin:
1. "He takes it as granted that Christ defers the day of his coming, because he has a regard for our salvation."
2. "Thus, what usually disheartens others through weariness, he wisely turns to a contrary purpose."
3. "It is then probable that Peter referred to Paul in order to shew their consent; for it was very necessary to take away the occasion for such a calumny."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And account the long-suffering of our Lord salvation."
2. "The Divine delay is to be interpreted not as 'slackness' or procrastination, but as long-suffering, and the long-suffering is to be interpreted and valued as 'salvation,' as the suspension of judgment with a view to a prolonged offer of grace."
3. "Paul‚Äôs counsel was more than his own personal opinion. As the expression of a 'wisdom' which he received, it is the weightier confirmation of Peter‚Äôs teaching."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is salvation (œÉœâœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒ±ŒΩ). Predicate accusative after Œ∑Œ≥ŒµŒπœÉŒ∏Œµ in apposition with ŒºŒ±Œ∫œÅŒøŒ∏œÖŒºŒπŒ±ŒΩ (long-suffering), an opportunity for repentance (cf. 1 Peter 3:20). The Lord here is Christ."
2. "Our beloved brother Paul (Œø Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ Œ±Œ¥ŒµŒªœÜŒøœÇ Œ†Œ±œÖŒªŒøœÇ). Paul applies the verbal Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ (beloved) to Epaphras (Colossians 1:7), Onesimus (Colossians 4:9; Philemon 1:16), to Tychicus (Colossians 4:7; Ephesians 6:21), and to four brethren in 2 Peter 3:16 (Epainetus Romans 16:5, Ampliatus Romans 16:8, Stachys Romans 16:9, Persis Romans 16:12)."
3. "Given to him (Œ¥ŒøŒ∏ŒµŒπœÉŒ±ŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑœâ). First aorist passive participle of Œ¥ŒπŒ¥œâŒº with dative case. Peter claimed wisdom for himself, but recognises that Paul had the gift also. His language here may have caution in it as well as commendation."

### John Gill:
1. "Not his longsuffering towards the wicked, and his forbearance with them, for that is not the means of, nor the way to, nor does it issue in, their salvation, but in their sorer punishment and greater damnation."
2. "He waits, he stays, that none of them might perish, but that they might be all brought to faith and repentance, and so be saved."
3. "[Paul] was indeed a wise master builder, and whatever he wrote was 'according to wisdom'; not fleshly wisdom, the wisdom of this world, nor with enticing words of men's wisdom, but according to the divine wisdom, under the influence of the spirit of wisdom and revelation."

### John Wesley:
1. "And account the longsuffering of the Lord salvation ‚Äî Not only designed to lead men to repentance, but actually conducing thereto: a precious means of saving many more souls."
2. "As our beloved brother Paul also hath written to you ‚Äî This refers not only to the single sentence preceding, but to all that went before."
3. "St. Paul had written to the same effect concerning the end of the world, in several parts of his epistles, and particularly in his Epistle to the Hebrews. Romans 2:4."
