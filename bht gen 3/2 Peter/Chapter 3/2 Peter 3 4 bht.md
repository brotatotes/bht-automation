# 2 Peter 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scoffers exhibit presumptuous skepticism, placing the continuity of nature's phenomena above the promise of Christ's coming. They argue that since things have continued unchanged since the beginning of creation, there will be no fulfillment of the promise. However, this skepticism disregards the Christian hope of the resurrection and fails to acknowledge the preaching of Jesus and the apostles regarding the second coming. These scoffers mock the believers' trust in the promise, lacking any signs of an interruption in the old order.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "(Compare Psalms 10:11; Psalms 73:11.) Presumptuous skepticism and lawless lust, setting nature and its so-called laws above the God of nature and revelation, and arguing from the past continuity of nature's phenomena that there can be no future interruption to them, was the sin of the antediluvians, and shall be that of the scoffers in the last days."
2. "Whereâ€”implying that it ought to have taken place before this if ever it was to take place, but that it never will."
3. "the promiseâ€”which you, believers, are so continually looking for the fulfillment of (Psalms 73:11). What becomes of the promise which you talk so much of?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They evidently meant to imply that the promise had utterly failed; that there was not the slightest evidence that it would be accomplished; that they who had believed this were entirely deluded."
2. "Those old men, said the seeing objector, have died like others; and, notwithstanding their confident predictions, things now move on as they did from the beginning."
3. "Meantime, the expectations of those who have believed that the world was coming to an end have been disappointed; the time set for this by many interpreters of Scripture has passed by; men have looked out in vain for the coming of the Saviour, and sublunary affairs move on as they always have done."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From the beginning of the creation. Not a common phrase."
2. "Fell asleep. A literal and correct translation of the word."
3. "The difference between the pagan and the Christian usage lies in the fact that, in the latter, it was defined by the hope of the resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was a dangerous scoff when they insinuated a doubt as to the last resurrection; for when that is taken away, there is no gospel any longer, the power of Christ is brought to nothing, the whole of religion is gone."
2. "All religion is wholly subverted, except faith in the resurrection remains firm and immovable. Hence, on this point Satan assails us most fiercely."
3. "They set the regular course of nature, such as it seems to have been from the beginning, in opposition to the promise of God, as though these things were contrary, or did not harmonize together."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'coming' is again expressed here by the word parousia, 'presence;' as to which see on chap. 2 Peter 1:16. The question, put with triumphant scorn by these mockers, repeats the cherished terms used by believers the 'promise 'in which they trusted, the 'coming' which they looked for with vivid expectancy."
2. "The idea seems to be that, taking it for granted that some great disturbance in the system of the world will be necessarily involved in such an event as the Advent of Christ, and failing to see any signs of an interruption in the old order, they will deride the event itself."
3. "Greater vivacity is added to the assertion of unbroken uniformity by the use of the present tense 'continue' (the verb itself also is a compound form expressing continuance persisting through an indefinite length of time), and by the simple 'thus' by which the idea of 'as they are,' or 'as we see them,' is conveyed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter, like Paul, preached about the second coming, as Jesus himself did repeatedly, and as the angels promised at the Ascension."
2. "The parables of Jesus urged readiness and forbade setting dates for his coming, though his language in Matthew 24:34 probably led some to believe that he would certainly come while they were alive."
3. "Continue. In statu quo. 'As they were.' From the beginning of creation."

### John Gill:
1. "what is become of the promise of his coming? where the accomplishment of it?"
2. "but where is the fulfillment of all this? he is not come, nor is there any sign or likelihood of it"
3. "reasoning from the settled order of things... to the future continuance of things, without any alteration; and consequently, that Christ would not come"

### John Wesley:
1. "Saying, Where is the promise of his coming... We see no sign of any such thing."
2. "For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
3. "Without any such material change as might make us believe they will ever end."
