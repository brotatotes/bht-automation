# 2 Peter 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scoffers willingly ignore the Scripture record of creation and the flood. They choose to forget that the earth was formed out of water and consists by the Word of God. Their denial is a deliberate rejection of God's Word. Just as the flood came in spite of their reasoning, so will the conflagration of the earth come, changing the order of things. The earth was created and is preserved by God's Word, which bounds the duration of all things.

2. "They obstinately shut their eyes to the Scripture record of the creation and the deluge."
3. "The flood came in spite of their reasonings; so will the conflagration of the earth come in spite of the 'scoffers' of the last days, changing the whole order of things."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'will' has usually more to do in the denial and rejection of the doctrines of the Bible than the 'understanding' has."
2. "Everything depends on his word or will. As the heavens and the earth were originally made by his command, so by the same command they can be destroyed."
3. "The point of time, therefore, in which Peter looks at the earth here, is not when the mountains, and continents, and islands, seem to be standing partly out of the water and partly in the water, but when there was a vast mass of materials called 'waters' from which the earth was formed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This they willingly are ignorant of... this they wilfully forget." 
2. "i.e., compacted or formed. Compare Colossians 1:17, consist. Rev., compacted."
3. "Dia has its usual sense here, not as Rev., amidst, but by means of. Bengel : 'The water served that the earth should consist.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The world no doubt had its origin from waters, for Moses calls the chaos from which the earth emerged, waters."
2. "It hence appears that the power of nature is not sufficient to sustain and preserve the world, but that on the contrary it contains the very element of its own ruin, whenever it may please God to destroy it."
3. "By these few words the petulance of those is abundantly refuted, who arm themselves with physical reasons to fight against God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The point then is this: 'they speak so, because they wilfully forget such a break in the constancy of nature as that caused by the Deluge.'"
2. "In reference to the 'God said' of the Mosaic record, and resembling the statement in Hebrews 11:3, but not equivalent to the ultimate identification of the creative word with the personal Word or Son which we have in John."
3. "From this Will the 'all things' at first received their form, and upon it they depended for the constancy and permanence to which the scoffers would appeal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For this they wilfully forget (ŒªŒ±ŒΩŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒµ Œ≥Œ±œÅ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖœÇ œÑŒøœÖœÑŒø Œ∏ŒµŒªŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ). Literally, 'for this escapes them being willing.'"
2. "Out of water and amidst water (ŒµŒæ œÖŒ¥Œ±œÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ± Œ¥Œπ' œÖŒ¥Œ±œÑŒøœÇ). Out of the primeval watery chaos (Genesis 1:2)."
3. "By the word of God (œÑœâ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ ŒªŒøŒ≥œâ). Instrumental case ŒªŒøŒ≥œâ, 'by the fiat of God' (Genesis 1:3; Hebrews 11:3 œÅŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ)."

### John Gill:
1. "The present heavens and earth are kept and reserved for a general burning."
2. "It was 'by the word of God' that they at first existed, and were so long preserved in being."
3. "The earth consists, or is kept and held together by water; there is a general humidity or moisture that runs through it, by which it is compacted together, or otherwise it would resolve into dust."

### John Wesley:
1. "That by the almighty word of God - Which bounds the duration of all things, so that it cannot be either longer or shorter."
2. "The aerial heavens were, and the earth - Not as it is now, but standing out of the water and in the water."
3. "This, or some other great and manifest difference between the original and present constitution of the terraqueous globe, seems then to have been so generally known, that St. Peter charges their ignorance of it totally upon their wilfulness."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The scoffers mentioned in this verse are willingly ignorant and obstinately blind to the truth. Just as they choose to forget the waters through which the earth was originally formed, they also ignore the fact that the world is held together by water. These scoffers fail to recognize that it was by the Word of God that the heavens and the earth were created, and it is by His Word that they are preserved. Their denial of these truths stems not from a lack of understanding, but from a deliberate rejection of the Scriptures. However, just as the flood came in spite of their reasonings, so too will the conflagration of the earth come, changing the whole order of things.
