# 2 Peter 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's watchful providence preserves the present heavens and earth, storing them up for their eventual destruction by fire. This destruction will be in contrast to the past, and it is already prepared and reserved for the impious. The example of Sodom and Gomorrah serves as a reminder of God's judgment by fire. The day of judgment will bring perdition and everlasting destruction for the ungodly, a fixed time known only to God.
