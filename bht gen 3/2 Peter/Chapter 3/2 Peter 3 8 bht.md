# 2 Peter 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's delay in fulfilling His promise is not due to inability, but through His long-suffering. His eternity exceeds all measures of time, and His long-suffering excludes impatient expectations. The day of judgment may come tomorrow, but to God, a thousand years may be as a single day. Waiting may seem long to us, but if we fix our minds on the eternity of God's kingdom, many ages vanish like moments. Trust in God's superior ways beyond human measurements of time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's delay in fulfilling His promise is not, like men's delays, owing to inability or fickleness in keeping His word, but through 'long-suffering.'" 
2. "His eternity exceeds all measures of time: to His divine knowledge all future things are present: His power requires not long delays for the performance of His work: His long-suffering excludes all impatient expectation and eager haste, such as we men feel."
3. "No delay which occurs is long to God: as to a man of countless riches, a thousand guineas are as a single penny. God's oeligonologe (eternal-ages measurer) differs wholly from man's horologe (hour-glass)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That which may seem to be a long time to us is a brief period with God."
2. "In the infinity of his own duration there is abundant time to accomplish his designs, and it can make no difference with him whether they are accomplished in one day or extended to one thousand years."
3. "With Him who always lives it will be as easy to accomplish them at a far distant period as now."

### John Calvin:
1. "For waiting seems very long on this account, because we have our eyes fixed on the shortness of the present life, and we also increase weariness by computing days, hours, and minutes."
2. "But when the eternity of Godâ€™s kingdom comes to our minds, many ages vanish away like so many moments."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." 
2. "His object is not to exhibit the brevity of human life over against the eternity of God, as is the case with the Psalmist, but to express how inapplicable to God are all those ideas of time, those estimates of long and short, of hasting and delay, by which man measures things."
3. "Peter meets the scorner by asserting God to be superior in all His modes of action to human reckonings of time, he also exhibits the ground of His peopleâ€™s continued faith in Himself and His promise through postponements of their hope."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let not this one thing escape you."
2. "The day of judgment is at hand. It may come tomorrow; but what is tomorrow? What does God mean by a day? It may be a thousand years."
3. "God's clock does not run by our timepieces. The scoffers scoff ignorantly."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: God's delay in fulfilling His promise is not due to inability, but rather his long-suffering. Time, as we understand it, does not hold the same meaning for God. His eternity exceeds all measures of time, and his patience excludes the impatience and haste that we feel. The day of judgment is at hand, but to God, a thousand years may be as a single day. We must not let this concept escape us. God's clock does not run by our timepieces, and the scoffers who mock His timing do so out of ignorance. Time may seem long to us, but it is a brief period for God, who has abundant time to accomplish His purposes. In His infinite duration, it makes no difference to God whether His plans are accomplished in one day or extended to one thousand years. Just as one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day, we must remember that waiting seems long because we fix our eyes on the brevity of this present life. However, when we meditate on the eternity of God's kingdom, many ages vanish away like moments. So, let us ascend in our minds to heaven, and time will no longer be a concept of long or short. Through all the postponements and delays of our hope, we can maintain our faith in God and His promises because His ways are superior to human reckonings of time.
