# 2 Peter 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord is not tardy in fulfilling His promise, but patient, desiring that all should come to repentance and be saved. His delay is a demonstration of His mercy and grace, not a lack of interest or willingness. Rather than being impotent, He is longsuffering towards us and bears with the wicked for the sake of the righteous. It is God's desire that all should have the opportunity to receive His salvation, and He is prepared to bestow it on the lost.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "slack‚Äîslow, tardy, late; exceeding the due time, as though that time were already come." 
2. "his promise‚Äîwhich the scoffers cavil at." 
3. "long-suffering‚Äîwaiting until the full number of those appointed to 'salvation' shall be completed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The delay should be regarded as an evidence of his desire that men should have space for repentance, and an opportunity to secure their salvation."
2. "No one should infer that God will not execute His threats, unless he can look into the most distant parts of a coming eternity, and demonstrate that there is no suffering appointed for the sinner there; anyone who sins, and who is spared even for a moment, should regard the respite as only a proof that God is merciful and forbearing now."
3. "That God has a sincere desire that people should be saved; That any purpose in regard to the destruction of sinners is not founded on mere will, or is not arbitrary; That it would be agreeable to the nature of God, and to His arrangements in the plan of salvation if all human beings should come to repentance, and accept the offers of mercy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is literally to delay or loiter. [...] is not tardy, would be an improvement." 
2. "The word implies, besides delay, the idea of lateness with reference to an appointed time."
3. "Come [œáœâœÅŒ∑œÉŒ±Œπ] . Move on, or advance to."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord defers his coming that he might invite all mankind to repentance."
2. "He is tardy who allows an occasion to pass by through slothfulness: there is nothing like this in God, who in the best manner regulates time to promote our salvation."
3. "So wonderful is his love towards mankind, that he would have them all to be saved, and is of his own self prepared to bestow salvation on the lost."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apparent delay in the performance of the Divine engagement is capable of a still more assuring explanation. It has a gracious purpose."
2. "When a human promise fails to be fulfilled according to expectation, those to whom it has been made are in the habit of attributing the delay to a slackness which betrays unwillingness or some personal end. But if the Lord seems to be slow in fulfilling His promise, that is not to be explained, Peter means, as men are tempted to explain such slowness on the part of their fellow-men, as due to forgetfulness, lack of interest, procrastination, or anything personal to Himself only. Its explanation lies in something which touches our interest, and illustrates His grace."
3. "This sentence has been dragged too generally into the controversy about the Augustinian view of predestination, and the Calvinistic doctrine of the limited extent, or rather the definite design, of the Atonement. On the one hand, theologians like Beza have interpreted it of the elect only. On the other hand, exegetes like Huther regard it as adverse to the Calvinistic theory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God is not impotent nor unwilling to execute his promise."
2. "Some will perish, but that is not God's desire."
3. "God wishes 'all' to come, for God's provision of grace for all who will repent."

### John Gill:
1. "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise... whereas the true reason of the delay... none can turn him, nor will he delay the fulfilment of his promise." 
2. "He is not dilatory, but is longsuffering to us-ward." 
3. "He bears with the latter, for the sake of the former."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Lord is not slow ‚Äî As if the time fixed for it were past."
2. "Concerning his promise ‚Äî Which shall surely be fulfilled in its season."
3. "But is longsuffering towards us ‚Äî Children of men. Not willing that any soul, which he hath made should perish."
