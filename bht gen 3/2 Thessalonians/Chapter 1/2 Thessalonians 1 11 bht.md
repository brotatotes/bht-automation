## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "With a view to which (consummation, the being glorified, &c., above, in your case, as is shewn below: not â€˜wherefore, as A.V., &c.) we pray also (as well as wish) always concerning you, that our God may count YOU (emphatic) worthy (notâ€” â€˜make you worthy,â€™ which the word cannot mean) of your calling..."

3. "The latter I own seems to me far the best) and (all) work of faith (activity of faith: see ref. 1 Thess. note. The genitive is again one of apposition), with (in) power (belongs to fulfil, q.d. mightily)"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Of course no man is, strictly speaking, worthy of such a destiny. Had it been a mare matter of justice, such a prayer as this of Paulâ€™s would have been inappropriate if not impertinent. But while it is by Godâ€™s grace any one is counted worthy, there is a corresponding conduct looked for and required in those who are visited by this grace." 
3. "The prayer of Paul therefore is, that God would powerfully bring to complete and satisfactory result every desire or purpose which their goodness of heart engendered, or more probably would so increase their goodness as to make these desires themselves perfect, irrespective of their results, and would enable them to maintain and perfect that activity and endurance to which faith had prompted them."

1. "This is indeed of God, and not of man; and is owing, not to any previous worthiness in man, as appears from the instances of Matthew the publican, Zacchaeus, the Apostle Paul, the Corinthians, and others, but entirely to the free grace of God, who counts them worthy, not for any worthiness there is in them." 
2. "And next Christ will call the righteous, when raised and set at his right hand, to inherit the kingdom and glory prepared by his Father for them; and happy are those who by the grace of God will be counted worthy of this call."
3. "Faith is not only an operative grace, Ephesians 4:4- : and is attended with good works; but it is a work itself, not of man's, for he cannot produce it in himself, nor exercise it of himself; but it is the work of God, of his operation which he works in his people."

### John Wesley:
1. All the good pleasure of his goodness â€” Which is no less than perfect holiness.
