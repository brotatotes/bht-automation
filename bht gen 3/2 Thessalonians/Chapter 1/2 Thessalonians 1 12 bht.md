## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The believer's graces redound to Christ's glory, and His glory, as their Head, reflects glory on them as the members."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The wicked will certainly be punished when the Lord Jesus shall come to judgment. Words cannot reveal this truth more plainly than is done in this chapter."
2. "The punishment of the wicked will be eternal... If it were admitted to have been the intention of God to teach the doctrine of eternal punishment, it is impossible to conceive that he could have chosen more plain and positive language to express the doctrine than has been done here."
3. "If it be a 'righteous thing' that the wicked shall be punished, then they never can be saved by mere justice. No one will go to heaven because he deserves or merits it. All dependence on human merit, therefore, is taken away in the matter of salvation, and if the sinner is ever saved, it will be by grace, and not by justice."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the new life the soul was first and everything, and the barns and storehouses nothing."
2. "The bliss of the sanctified does not consist primarily in its endlessness, but in the nobler moral conditions of the new eon."

3. "For there is nothing here that is ours either in the action itself, or in the effect or fruit, for it is solely by the guidance of the Holy Spirit that our life is made to contribute to the glory of God."
