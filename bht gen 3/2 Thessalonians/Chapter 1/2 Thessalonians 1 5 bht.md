2. "God, in order that he may stir us up to the hope of a judgment to come, does, for the present, only to some extent judge the world. He furnishes, it is true, many tokens of his judgment, but it is in such a manner as to constrain us to extend our hope farther."

2. "Those who shun reproach and sufferings for [the Gospel] are not worthy to have a place, or their names there."
