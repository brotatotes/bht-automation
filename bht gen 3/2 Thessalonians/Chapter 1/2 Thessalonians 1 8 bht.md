## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This flame of fire accompanied His manifestation in the bush; also His giving of the law at Sinai. Also it shall accompany His revelation at His advent, symbolizing His own bright glory and His consuming vengeance against His foes."
2. "Not of course those involuntarily not knowing God, but those wilfully not knowing Him, as Pharaoh, who might have known God if he would, but who boasted 'I know not the Lord'."
3. "Primarily the unbelieving Jews; secondarily, all who obey not the truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is commonly described as coming in clouds, and to that common description there is here added the image of incessant lightnings, as if the whole heavens were illuminated with a continued blaze."
2. "The word 'vengeance' is used in the sense of punishment, for there cannot be in God what literally corresponds with the passion of revenge."
3. "On all who are strangers to him; that is, who are living in pagan darkness, or who, having heard of him, have no practical acquaintance with him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vengeance is an unfortunate rendering, as implying, in popular usage, personal vindictiveness. It is the full awarding of justice to all parties." 
2. "To know God is to know him as the one, true God as distinguished from false gods; to know his will, his holiness, his hatred of sin, and his saving intent toward mankind." 
3. "In the two classes, - those who know not God and those who obey not the gospel, - it is not probable that Paul has in mind a distinction between Jews and Gentiles."

### John Calvin:
1. "He teaches that this also involves the interests of God himself, inasmuch as the same persons that persecute the pious are guilty of rebellion against God."
2. "It may be asked, however, whether it is lawful for us to desire vengeance, for Paul promises it, as though it could be lawfully desired. I answer, that it is not lawful to desire vengeance upon any one, inasmuch as we are commanded to wish well to all."
3. "He distinguishes unbelievers by these two marks â€” that they know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ. For if obedience is not rendered to the gospel through faith, as he teaches in the first and in the last chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, unbelief is the occasion of resistance to it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fire is not viewed primarily as the instrument of vengeance, but as the natural symbol of perfect purity and unapproachable majesty."
2. "Those who â€˜did not like to retain God in their knowledge,â€™ and who were therefore given over to a reprobate mind. To this first class belong the Gentiles, whose conduct and doom is described by Paul in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans."
3. "To obey the Gospel is to yield oneself to its influence; to accept its light, to think of God as He is revealed in it, and to give ourselves to the life to which it prompts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To them that know not God."
2. "And to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus."
3. "Note the use of 'gospel' here as in Mark 1:15 'believe in the gospel.'"

### John Gill:
1. "he will be seen and easily discerned; there will be such a light and flaming fire about him, which, as it will serve to make him visible, will greatly add to the majesty of his appearance, and strike terror to his enemies."
2. "the punishment of ungodly men is often signified by fire, and flames of fire, by the fire of hell, and a lake which burns with fire and brimstone, by a furnace of fire, everlasting fire, and fire that cannot be quenched, to set forth the endless torture and inconceivable misery of the damned."
3. "vengeance will not be taken on them, because they have not a spiritual saving knowledge of God, in the Mediator Jesus Christ, who never was revealed to them; yet forasmuch as they had the light and law of nature, by which the being of God, and the invisible perfections of his nature might be seen and understood, and much of his will, with respect to moral good and evil, be known, against both which they have rebelled, and having sinned, will perish without law."

### John Wesley:
1. "Taking vengeance â€” Does God barely permit this, or (as 'the Lord' once 'rained brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven,' Genesis 19:24) does a fiery stream go forth from him for ever?"
2. "Who know not God - (The root of all wickedness and misery) who remain in heathen ignorance."
3. "And who obey not â€” This refers chiefly to the Jews, who had heard the gospel."

- Attempt 1 BHT: When our Lord Jesus is revealed to the world, He will come in a flaming fire, symbolizing His bright glory and His righteous judgment against those who willfully reject Him. The vengeance spoken of here is not personal vindictiveness, but the full application of divine justice. The ones who will face this judgment are not just those who are ignorantly unaware of God, but also those who have chosen to disregard Him, like Pharaoh who proudly proclaimed, I know not the Lord. This judgment extends to both the unbelieving Jews and all who do not obey the gospel. To know God is to know Him as the one true God, to understand His will, His holiness, His hatred of sin, and His desire to save humanity. The gospel calls us to obey its message, to accept its light, and to live in accordance with its teachings. So let us take heed and not be among those who remain in willful ignorance and rebellion, but rather embrace the truth of the gospel and walk in obedience to our Lord Jesus.
