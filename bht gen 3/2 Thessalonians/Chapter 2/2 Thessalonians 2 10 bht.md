# 2 Thessalonians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The danger lies in the deceit of unrighteousness that lures people away from the love of THE truth. Rejecting THE truth and Jesus, who embodies the Truth, leads to their downfall. The one embodying this deceit is described as the son of perdition and cunningly employs trickery to mislead. While Satan's power is limited, those who perish do so because of their rejection and contempt of the truth. They become victims of the enemy through their lack of love for and belief in THE truth.
