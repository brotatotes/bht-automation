## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No human reasoning powers can connect the two,‚ÄîGod‚Äôs sovereignty and man‚Äôs free will: all we know of them is, that the one is as certain a truth as the other."
2. "In proportion then as we assert the one strongly, we must ever implicate the other as strongly."
3. "In seeing that such is God‚Äôs intent respecting you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Therefore‚ÄîGod's sovereign choice of believers, so far from being a ground for inaction on their part, is the strongest incentive to action and perseverance in it."
2. "The Thessalonians had not held fast his oral instructions but had suffered themselves to be imposed upon by pretended spirit-revelations, and words and letters pretending to be from Paul, to the effect that 'the day of the Lord was instantly imminent.'"
3. "Tradition (in the sense of human testimony) cannot establish a doctrine, but can authenticate a fact, such as the facts just mentioned. Inspired tradition, in Paul's sense, is not a supplementary oral tradition completing our written Word, but it is identical with the written Word now complete."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Stand fast - Amidst all the temptations which surround you..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Tradition, in the scriptural sense, may be either written or oral."
2. "Tradition implies on the part of a teacher that he is not expressing his own ideas, but is delivering or handing over a message received from someone else."
3. "The prominent idea of tradition is therefore that of an authority external to the teacher."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now, to be furnished with invincible strength is a much higher thing than external discipline."
2. "Paul will be found in the next chapter making use of the term tradition, as meaning the rule that he had laid down, and the very signification of the term is general."
3. "We may judge in part from this Epistle what traditions he here recommends, for he says ‚Äî whether by word, that is, discourse, or by epistle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore, brethren, stand fast." 
2. "[The apostle's] meaning is: ‚ÄòSince these other events must precede the coming of Christ, be not shaken and troubled as if this coming were imminent, but stand fast." 
3. "And that you may do so, do not listen to what every one says, but keep clearly in mind what I have communicated to you, and maintain your faith in that."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stand fast (œÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒµœÑŒµ). Present imperative active of the late present œÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫Œø from ŒµœÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫Œ± (perfect active of ŒπœÉœÑŒ∑Œº)."
2. "Hold the traditions (Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒµŒπœÑŒµ œÑŒ±œÇ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒøœÉŒµŒπœÇ). Present imperative of Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒµœâ, old verb, to have masterful grip on a thing, either with genitive (Mark 1:31) or usually the accusative as here."
3. "The worth of the tradition lies not in the form but in the source and the quality of the content."

### John Gill:
1. "Therefore, brethren, stand fast....and not in the least waver about the thing itself." 
2. "And hold the traditions which ye have been taught: meaning the truths of the Gospel, which may be called traditions, because they are delivered from one to another."
3. "And so the Syriac version here renders it, 'the commandments': and these were such as these saints had been taught by the apostles, under the direction of Christ, and through the guidance of his Spirit."

### John Wesley:

2. "He preached before he wrote."
3. "And he had written concerning this in his former epistle."
