### Philip Schaff:
1. "May the Lord Himself effect these blessed results in you, inwardly enabling you to accept the consolation and hope which are really within your reach."
2. "Who loved us. This apparently refers only to 'God our Father,' but see below on the word 'comfort.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is probably no instance in St. Paul of a plural adjective or verb, when the two Persons of the Godhead are mentioned." 
2. "This singular articular participle refers to Œø œÄŒ±œÑŒ∑œÅ, 'though it is difficult to see how St. Paul could otherwise have expressed his thought, if he had intended to refer to the Son, as well as to the Father." 
3. "Distinct feminine form of Œ±ŒπœâŒΩŒπŒøœÇ here instead of masculine as in Matthew 25:46."

### John Gill:
1. "And in each of their characters are reasons contained, encouraging to believe the petitions will be regarded; for it is 'our Lord Jesus Christ himself' who is prayed unto; who is our Lord, not by creation only, in which sense he is Lord of all, but by redemption, and through a marriage relation; and he is our Jesus, our Saviour, and Redeemer; and our Christ, the anointed prophet, priest, and King; even he himself, who stands in these relations and offices; and what may not be expected from him?" 
2. "all true solid consolation is from God and Christ: God is called the God of all comfort; and if there be any real consolation, it is in, by, and from Christ; and it is the gift of God, an instance of his grace and favour, and not a point of merit; the least degree of consolation is not deserved, and ought not to be reckoned small: and it is everlasting..." 
3. "hope, as well as faith, is the gift of God, a free grace gift of his: and it may be called a good one, because God is the author of it; and it is built on a good foundation, the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ; and is of good things to come, and therefore called the blessed hope; and is what is sure and certain, and will never deceive, nor make ashamed..."
