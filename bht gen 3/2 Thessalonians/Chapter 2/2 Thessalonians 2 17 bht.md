# 2 Thessalonians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During a time of unsettling teachings about the imminent coming of the Lord, the Thessalonian believers needed comfort and stability. They required establishment in good words and good works and not in fanatical teachings. God, as the source of comfort and strength, grants everlasting consolation and a good hope that outshines all other comforts. This comfort should spur believers to diligently engage in every good word and work, rather than being consumed by vain speculations and forebodings. Our faith should be stable, anchored in the love of God, the covenant of grace, and the arms of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Comfort your heartsâ€”unsettled as you have been through those who announced the immediate coming of the Lord." 
2. "Good word and workâ€”The oldest manuscripts invert the order, 'work and word.'"
3. "Establishment in these were what the young converts at Thessalonica needed, not fanatical teaching."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The course of reasoning in 2 Thessalonians 2:0 would lead to the expectation that a considerable time would elapse before the Saviour would appear."
2. "The apostle Paul was inspired. He has recorded in this chapter a distinct prediction of an important series of events which were to occur at a future, and most of them at quite a remote period."
3. "If this be the 'fair interpretation,' then we may see what is the value of the pretended 'succession' of the ministry through that system."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Everlasting consolation. Everlasting, in contrast to all other comforts which are liable to come to an end, to be confronted with emergencies for which they are insufficient." 
2. "Good hope. 'Good, because of the pre-eminent excellence of the object of it, the impregnable basis on which it rests, and the purifying influence which it exerts in the heart and life' (Lillie)."
3. "Comfort should result not only in the feeling of personal security, but in an unanxious and unselfish diligence in every good word and work. The energies which were frittered away in vain speculations and gloomy forebodings should now, when our future is provided for, be concentrated on the duty of the hour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Comfort and stablish"
2. "God is the God of comfort and strength"

### John Gill:
1. "Comfort your hearts by his grace, joining the last clause of the preceding verse to this."
2. "Good words and good works, principles and practices, should go together, and the saints stand in need of stability in both."
3. "Though, as to their state and condition, they are established in the love of God, in the covenant of grace, in the arms of Christ, and in him the foundation, so as they can never be removed; yet they are often very unstable."
