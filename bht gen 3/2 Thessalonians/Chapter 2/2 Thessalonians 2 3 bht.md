# 2 Thessalonians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Man of Sin, who personifies sin as righteousness is embodied in Christ, will emerge in the future. This figure will proudly exalt himself above anyone called God and even enter the temple of God. Though there may be initial signs of falling away, the full manifestation of this anti-Christian force in one person is yet to come. We must beware of the beguiling deception that will lead many astray. The Man of Sin's sudden revelation will distinguish him from false apostles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the Man of Sin (in whom sin is as it were personified, as righteousness in Christ. The genitive, of sin, is called by Ellicott that of the predominating quality."
2. "he that withstandeth (the expression is absolute, 'he that withstands CHRIST,' the anti-christ, 1 John ii. 18), and exalteth himself above (in a hostile sense) every one that is called God."
3. "so that he sits in (enters into, sets himself down in, and remains in) the temple of God (this, say some Commentators, cannot be any other than the temple at Jerusalem)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As righteousness found its embodiment in Christ, 'the Lord our righteousness,' so 'sin' shall have its embodiment in 'the man of sin.'"
2. "Seeds of 'the falling away' soon appear, but the full development and concentration of these anti-Christian elements in one person are still to appear."
3. "Doubtless 'the apostasy' of Romanism is one of the greatest instances of the working of the mystery of iniquity, and its blasphemous claims for the Pope are forerunners of the final concentration of blasphemy in the man of sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This implies that there were then attempts to deceive, and that it was of great importance for Christians to be on their guard."
2. "The word rendered ‚Äúfalling away‚Äù (Œ±ÃìœÄŒøœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπÃÅŒ± apostasia, apostasy), is of so general a character, that it may be applied to any departure from the faith as it was received in the time of the apostles."
3. "To no succession of men who have ever lived could the appellative, 'the man of sin,' be applied with so much propriety as to this succession."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Deceive [ŒµŒæŒ±œÄŒ±œÑŒ∑œÉŒ∑]. Better beguile; since the word means not only making a false impression, but actually leading astray."
2. "Falling away [Œ±œÄŒøœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπŒ±]. Only here and Acts 21:21. Comp. LXX, Joshua 22:22; 2 Chronicles 29:19."
3. "The man of sin - the son of perdition [Œø Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒπŒ±œÇ, Œø œÖŒπŒøœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ±œÄœâŒªŒµŒπŒ±œÇ]. See on children of light, 1 Thessalonians 5:5."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, therefore, predicts a certain general revolt of the visible Church. 'The Church must be reduced to an unsightly and dreadful state of ruin, before its full restoration be effected.'"
2. "The weak, however, have something here on which to rest, when they learn that the unseemly state of matters which they behold in the Church was long since foretold."
3. "Paul, however, when he has given warning that there would be such a scattering, that the greater part would revolt from Christ, adds something more serious ‚Äî that there would be such a confusion, that the vicar of Satan would hold supreme power in the Church, and would preside there in the place of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let no man deceive you by any means, either by professing superior enlightenment as if a spirit spoke through him, or by interpreting my words as if I had meant what he affirms."
2. "This general 'going out from us' of those who 'were not of us,' this widespread falling away from faith in Christ, will apparently be produced by distressing outward circumstances, the perplexed and disturbed state of nations, and calamities of the kind most difficult to be borne."
3. "Before Christ is revealed, Antichrist must first be revealed. The same term is used of both; strengthening the supposition that Paul speaks of a personal, individual Antichrist."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is amazing how gullible some of the saints are when a new deceiver pulls off some stunts in religion." 
2. "The falling away [apostasy] is to be first before Christ comes again." 
3. "The man of sin is hidden somewhere who will be suddenly manifested just as false apostles pose as angels of light."

### John Gill:
1. "By any of the above means; by pretending to a revelation from the Spirit; or to have had it from the mouth of anyone of the apostles; or to have a letter as from them, declaring the day of Christ to be instant; or by any other means whatever; do not be imposed upon by them for the following reasons..."
2. "a religious sense, of the falling of men from the faith of the Gospel, from the purity of Gospel doctrines, discipline, worship, and ordinances; and this not of some Jews who professed faith in Christ, and departed from it, or of some Christians who went off to the Gnostics; but is to be understood of a more general defection in the times of the Papacy"
3. "this wicked man was now already revealed: nor is this to be understood of a certain Jew, that is to be begotten by the devil on a virgin of the tribe of Dan, and who is to reign three years and a half, and then to be destroyed by Christ, which is a fable of the Papists; but a succession of men is here meant"

### John Wesley:
1. "He is, in an emphatical sense, the man of sin, as he increases all manner of sin above measure."
2. "He has caused the death of numberless multitudes, both of his opposers and followers, destroyed innumerable souls, and will himself perish everlastingly."
3. "Claiming the prerogatives which belong to God alone."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In 2 Thessalonians 2:3, we are warned about the coming of the Man of Sin, who embodies sin in a way that is comparable to how righteousness was seen in Christ. This individual will exalt himself above every being called God, even going as far as sitting in the temple of God. While signs of the falling away may already be present, the full development and concentration of anti-Christian elements in one person are yet to appear. The deception caused by this figure will be beguiling, leading many astray. In order to avoid being deceived, we must be vigilant and pay attention to the signs of apostasy, as it is an essential precursor to the return of Christ. It is important to remember that this man of sin should not be confused with false apostles who pose as angels of light, as the manifestation of the Man of Sin will be sudden and distinct.
