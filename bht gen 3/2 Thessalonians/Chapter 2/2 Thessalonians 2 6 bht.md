### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "However, the testimony of the elect Church, and the Spirit in her, are the great hindrance to the rise of the apostasy; and it is possible that, though the Lord shall have a faithful few even then, yet the full energy of the Spirit in the visible Church, counteracting the energy of 'the mystery of lawlessness' by the testimony of the elect, shall have been so far 'taken out of the way,' or set aside, as to admit the manifestation of 'the lawless one'."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "He refers to some power which hinders the revelation of the man of sin or Antichrist."
3. "In his time [ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅœâ] . Better, in his own season. Not before his appointed season."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul declared that the light of the gospel must be diffused through all parts of the earth before God would thus give loose reins to Satan."
2. "The power of the Roman Empire stood in the way of the rise of Antichrist, inasmuch as he could only break through into a vacant possession."
3. "The delay, until the career of the gospel should be completed, because a gracious invitation to salvation was first in order."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If we turn to our Lord‚Äôs discourse, the only thing to which such power is ascribed is the purpose of God that the Gospel should first be preached for a witness unto all nations, before the end come." 
2. "This interpretation might therefore appeal to the history of the world before the flood, in which God for a time kept down the wickedness, but when the time for judgment came pronounced the final word, ‚ÄòMy Spirit shall not always strive with man.'"
3. "The interpretation which most modern writers agree in accepting is that which understands ‚Äòthat which withholdeth‚Äô to be ‚Äòthe restraining power of well-ordered human rule, the principles of legality as opposed to those of lawlessness, of which the Roman Empire was the then embodiment and manifestation.'"

3. "God overrules all human history and his ultimate purpose is wrought out." [14 words]

### John Gill:
1. "But by that which withheld, let or hindered the open appearance of antichrist, were the Roman empire and emperors; these stood in his way, and while this empire lasted, and the emperors wore the imperial crown, and sat on the throne, and held the government in their hands, the popes could not come at the height of their ambition, dignity, and authority, nor shine in their glory."
2. "Nor is the decree of God meant, though till the time came fixed by God for his appearance, the decree must be a bar in his way; since as there is a time for every purpose, nothing can come to pass till that time comes."
3. "The reason why the apostle expresses this not in plain words, but in an obscure manner, and with so much caution, was, that he might not offend the Roman emperors, and provoke them to a severe persecution of them as seditious persons, that sought the destruction of the empire."

### John Wesley:
1. "That which restraineth ‚Äî The power of the Roman emperors."
2. "When this is taken away, the wicked one will be revealed."
3. "In his time ‚Äî His appointed season, and not before."
