# 2 Thessalonians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And now ye know that which hindereth. That which keeps him back, that he may not be revealed before his appointed season. The power that has restrained the man of sin from his full and final development is the moral and conservative influence of political states. Romanism, as a forerunner of Antichrist, was thus kept in check by the Roman emperor until the Roman bishop raised himself to sole empire above the secular power. The removal of the withholding power will be when the civil polity yields to prevalent godless 'lawlessness' with 'the lawless one' as its embodiment.
