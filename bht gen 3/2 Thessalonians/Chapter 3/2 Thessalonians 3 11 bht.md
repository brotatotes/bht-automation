# 2 Thessalonians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They were idle people, not doing their own work but eagerly meddling in the affairs of others, constantly bustling about and being busybodies. Their idleness resulted in them neglecting their own responsibilities and focusing on trifles that were not their concern. This play on words highlights how their inactivity and lack of productivity made them prone to meddling in the business of their neighbors. In times of affliction and want, it is important to lend our aid, but during normal times, we should recognize that individuals can manage their own affairs and that it is not our business to interfere.
