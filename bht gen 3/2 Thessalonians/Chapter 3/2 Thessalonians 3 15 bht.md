# 2 Thessalonians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a fellow Christian errs, our role is to gently admonish, recognizing their belonging to the family of Christ. Rather than treating them as an adversary, we must approach with love and kindness, aiming for their repentance and restoration. Excommunication should not push them away; rather, it should serve as a means to bring them back when they have strayed. We are not to view them as enemies or deal with them harshly, but instead, we should offer compassionate admonition as brothers and sisters in Christ.

"In the mean time, excommunication is distinguished from anathema: for as to those that the Church marks out by the severity of its censure, Paul admonishes that they should not be utterly cast away, as if they were cut off from all hope of salvation; but endeavors must be used, that they may be brought back to a sound mind."
