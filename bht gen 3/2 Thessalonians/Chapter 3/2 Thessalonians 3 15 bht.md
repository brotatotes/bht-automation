# 2 Thessalonians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When dealing with a fellow Christian who has erred, it is important not to treat them as enemies but to approach them as a brother or sister. We should not abandon them but instead admonish them with gentleness and compassion, aiming for their repentance and restoration. Excommunication is not meant to sever all hope but rather serves as a means to bring them back to the right path. Therefore, in our interactions with one another, let us exhibit brotherly love through heartfelt admonition and a desire for reconciliation.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are not to deal with a man as an adversary over whom we are to seek to gain a victory, but as an erring brother - a brother still, though he errs."
2. "We triumph over him, and consider him at once as an enemy of the church, and as having lost all claim to its sympathies."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must observe, however, by what sign he would have brotherly love shewn ‚Äî not by allurements or flattery, but by admonitions; for in this way it will be, that all that will not be incurable will feel that concern is felt for their welfare." (Commentary)
2. "In the mean time, excommunication is distinguished from anathema: for as to those that the Church marks out by the severity of its censure, Paul admonishes that they should not be utterly cast away, as if they were cut off from all hope of salvation; but endeavors must be used, that they may be brought back to a sound mind." (Commentary)
3. "Excommunication does not tend to drive men from the Lord‚Äôs flock, but rather to bring them back when wandering and going astray." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though deprived, as we say, of church privileges, and shut out from fellowship with the members of the church, he was not to be counted hopeless."
2. "This discipline was to be expected to terminate in his repentance and reclamation."

2. "Few things in our churches are more difficult of wise execution than the discipline of erring members."
3. "The word ŒµœáŒ∏œÅŒøœÇ is an adjective, hateful, from ŒµœáŒ∏ŒøœÇ, hate. It can be passive, hated, as in Romans 11:28, but is usually active, hostile, enemy, foe."

### John Gill:
1. "Yet count him not as an enemy...nor deal with him in a hostile, fierce, furious, and passionate manner, as if you were seeking his destruction, and not his restoration."
2. "But admonish, or 'reprove' him as a brother;...with a brotherly affection, meekness, compassion, and tenderness."
3. "...the conduct of the church to such afterwards; who are not to neglect them, and much less to treat them as enemies, in a cruel and uncompassionate manner; but should inquire, and diligently observe, what effect the ordinance of excommunication has upon them, and renew their admonitions and friendly reproofs, if possible, to recover them."

### John Wesley:
1. Admonish him as a brother ‚Äî Tell him lovingly of the reason why you shun him.
