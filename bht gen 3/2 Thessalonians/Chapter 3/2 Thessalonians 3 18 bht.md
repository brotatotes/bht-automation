# 2 Thessalonians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. This closing prayer is a recurring element in Paul's writings, where he prays for grace upon the recipients. The word Amen was likely added by the congregation in response to the public reading of the Epistle. The subscription, indicating that the Epistle was written from Athens, is likely erroneous, as evidence suggests it was written from Corinth. The use of all in the salutation emphasizes the inclusivity of this grace towards every member of the Thessalonian church, even those who might have faced censure.
