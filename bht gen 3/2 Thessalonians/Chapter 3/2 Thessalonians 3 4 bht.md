# 2 Thessalonians 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Lord, we can confidently expect the Thessalonians to act consistently with their Christian profession. This expectation carries the force of an exhortation, but it is also a hopeful one. We are in a state of trust, relying not on the human heart but on the faithfulness of God. By having confidence in the Lord, we express our belief that the Thessalonians would boldly continue in the life to which they were introduced, carrying out the commands laid upon them. This confidence is not based on anything in themselves, but wholly on the Lord's faithfulness. We trust in the Lord concerning them, for without Him, they could do nothing.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And we have confidence in the Lord - Not primarily in you, for you have hearts like others, but in the Lord." 
2. "It is remarkable that when Paul expresses the utmost confidence in Christians that they will live and act as becomes their profession, his reliance is not on anything in themselves, but wholly on the faithfulness of God."
3. "He must be a stranger to the human heart who puts much confidence in it even in its best state."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the confidence which he says he has respecting them, made them much more ready to obey than if he had required obedience from them in a way of doubt or distrust."
2. "All, therefore, that do not observe this limitation, do to no purpose resort to Paulâ€™s example, with the view of binding the Church and subjecting it to their laws."
3. "For provided menâ€™s hearts continue to be directed towards love to God, and patient waiting for Christ, other things will be in a desirable state, and Paul declares that he desires nothing else."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse farther expresses the confidence which Paul felt that, by the faithfulness of the Lord, the Thessalonians would not be moved by persecution, but would boldly continue in the life to which he had introduced them, not fearing to carry out any of the commands he had laid upon them."
2. "We have confidence in the Lord. 'Here, as elsewhere, the apostle speaks of believing, hoping, doing all things in Christ. We lead an ordinary life, as well as a religious one; but with the apostle his ordinary life is his religious one, and hence he uses religious expressions in reference to all he says and does' (Jowett)."

2. "the ground of Paul's confident trust."

3. "Referring both to the commandments, which they had already given them by Christ, and they had showed, and continued to show a proper regard unto."

### John Wesley:
1. We trust in the Lord concerning you â€” Thus only should we trust in any man.
