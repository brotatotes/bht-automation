2. "And this is not to be done by a believer himself, nor by the ministers of the Gospel: the apostle could not do it, and therefore he prays 'the Lord' to do it; by whom is meant the Spirit of God, since he is distinguished from God the Father, into whose love the heart is to be directed, and from Christ, a patient waiting for whom it is also desired the heart may be directed into."
3. "For it follows, as another branch of the petition, and into the patient waiting for Christ...which being directed to by the Spirit of God, is of great use unto them in the present state of things."

Direct ‚Äî Lead you straight forward.
Into the patience of Christ ‚Äî Of which he set you a pattern.
