- Attempt 1 BHT: We are commanded to withdraw ourselves from those who are disorderly and disobedient to the teachings that Paul had given them. This withdrawal does not imply excommunication, but rather a deliberate avoidance of fellowship. The term tradition refers to the oral instructions that Paul had given when he was present, which were subsequently confirmed in writing. By taking this action, we are putting to the test the obedience of every brother to Paul's commands. This is not about denouncing or excommunicating, but primarily about withdrawing and separating from those who walk in a disorderly manner. Such disorderliness includes behaviors that are contrary to the rules of Christ and living idle and fussy lives. We must also remember that this withdrawal applies to all believers, regardless of their status or position. Ultimately, this passage reminds us of our responsibility to live obediently to the commands of Paul and walk in unity with our brothers and sisters in Christ.
