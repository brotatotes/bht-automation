## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Surely the remembrance is of the time when they parted, and the faith then existing."
2. "There is perhaps a slight reproach in this mention of the faith as a matter of remembrance, as if it were a thing once certain as fact, but now only resting on a persuasion."
3. "There is undoubtedly a want of entire confidence here expressed; and such a feeling will account for the mention of the faith of his mother and grandmother, to which, if he wavered, he was proving untrue."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The faith of the one parent sanctified the child."
2. "The mention of the faith of his mother and grandmother is designed as an incentive to stir up his faith."
3. "She was probably converted at Paul's first visit to Lystra. It is an undesigned coincidence, and so a mark of truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The same faith dwelt in her; or, she was a sincere believer in Christ."
2. "The one confirms the other, and the 'undesigned coincidence' furnishes an argument for the authenticity of both."
3. "But the piety of his mother alone is commended, and it is fairly implied that his father was not a believer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrases N. T.. o. Upomnhsiv reminding (but sometimes intransitive, remembrance), only here, 2 Peter 1:13; 2 Peter 3:1... As distinguished from ajnamnhsiv remembrance (1 Corinthians 11:24, 1 Corinthians 11:25) it signifies a reminding or being reminded by another; while ajnamnhsiv is a recalling by one's self." 
2. "The writer's thought is probably not confined to Christian faith, but has in view the continuity of Judaism and Christianity. In verse 3 he speaks of serving God from his forefathers. In Acts 24:14 Paul is represented as saying that even as a Christian he serves the God of his fathers, believing all things contained in the law and the prophets."
3. "Paul uses the verb with sin, the divine Spirit, God, the word of Christ, but nowhere with faith. The phrase faith dwells in, N. T. o. According to Paul, Christians are or stand in faith; but faith is not represented as dwelling in them. Christ dwells in the heart through faith (Ephesians 3:17)."

### John Calvin:
1. "When one has begun well and valiantly, the progress he has made should encourage him to advance, and domestic examples are powerful excitements to urge him forward."
2. "By this godly education, therefore, Timothy is admonished not to degenerate from himself and from his ancestors."
3. "Timothy, from his childhood, while he had not yet obtained a knowledge of the gospel, was imbued with the fear of God, and with such faith as proved to be a living seed, which afterwards manifested itself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He has to call to mind the past in order to feel confident for the future."
2. "His remembrance of their piety had helped him. A like remembrance might help his disciple."
3. "The Greek â€˜butâ€™ suggests a mental contrast in the slight misgiving implied in â€˜I am persuaded.â€™ We do not commonly say, â€˜I am sure you will feelâ€™ when we are quite sure."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having received a reminder" (Ï…Ï€Î¿Î¼Î½Î·ÏƒÎ¹Î½ Î»Î±Î²Ï‰Î½). 
2. "A reminder by another while Î±Î½Î±Î¼Î½Î·ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚ remembrance is rather a recalling by oneself."
3. "I am persuaded." (Ï€ÎµÏ€ÎµÎ¹ÏƒÎ¼Î±)

### John Gill:
1. "This is to be understood of the grace of faith, which was implanted in the heart of Timothy by the Spirit of God, and was genuine and sincere; he believed with the heart unto righteousness; his faith worked by love to God, and Christ, and to his people, and was attended with good works." 
2. "And so her [Lois] faith was of the same kind with Timothy's; and which dwelt in her, and continued with her to the last."
3. "Now when the same faith is said to dwell, first in his grandmother, and in his mother, and in him, this is not to be understood as if this grace was conveyed from one to another by natural generation; for grace comes not that way, only sin; men are not born of blood, but of God; but the sense is, that the same like precious faith was obtained by one, as by another."

### John Wesley:
1. "Which dwelt â€” A word not applied to a transient guest, but only to a settled inhabitant."
2. "First â€” Probably this was before Timothy was born, yet not beyond St. Paul's memory."
