## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul does not doubt the existence of real faith in Timothy, but he desires it to be put into active exercise." 
2. "The spiritual grace received for his ministerial office, either at his original ordination, or at his consecration to the particular office of superintending the Ephesian Church, imparting fearlessness, power, love, and a sound mind."
3. "Paul was the instrument in Timothy's ordination and reception of the grace then conferred; the presbyters were the concurrent participants in the act of ordination; so the Greek, 'dia' and 'meta'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea is, that Timothy was to use all proper means to keep the flame of pure religion in the soul burning, and more particularly his zeal in the great cause to which he had been set apart."
2. "However rich the gifts which God has bestowed upon us, they do not grow of their own accord, but need to be cultivated by our own personal care."
3. "It is such an expression as an aged Presbyterian, or Congregational, or Baptist minister would address to a son whom he had assisted to ordain. Nothing would be more natural than to remind him that his own hands had been laid on him when he was set apart to the work of the ministry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is, therefore, figurative, to stir or kindle the embers." 
2. "Ana combines the meanings again and up, rekindle or kindle up."
3. "It is not necessary to assume that Timothy's zeal had become cold."

### John Calvin:
1. "The more abundantly that Timothy had received the grace of God, the more attentive (the Apostle intimates) he ought to be in making progress from day to day."
2. "We ought, therefore, on the other hand, to strive to bring to perfection everything that is good in us, and to kindle what is languid."
3. "Let us also remember that we should diligently profit by them, lest they be extinguished by our slothfulness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is necessary to remind the disciple...to 'stir up' the gift of God, which...is thought of as a flame that may dwindle and be extinguished if not cherished and revived."
2. "The passage is not without interest as bearing on the sacramental language of the Church. The outward sign was not only a symbol, but an instrument of the spiritual gift."
3. "The anxiety shows itself again...to 'stir up' (literally, 'to rekindle') the gift of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For which cause," stronger than Œ¥ŒπŒø. So in verse 2 Timothy 1:12; Titus 1:13. Only example of Œ±ŒπœÑŒπŒ± by Paul save in Acts 28:20.
2. That thou stir up (œÉŒµ Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∂œâœÄœÖœÅŒµŒπŒΩ). Present active infinitive of Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∂œâœÄœÖœÅŒµœâ, old double compound (Œ±ŒΩŒ± and Œ∂œâœÄœÖœÅŒøŒΩ, live coal, Œ∂œâŒøœÇ and œÄœÖœÅ, then the bellows for kindling), to rekindle, to stir into flame, to keep blazing (continuous action, present time), only here in N.T. See 1 Thessalonians 5:19 for the figure of fire concerning the Holy Spirit.
3. The gift of God (œÑŒø œáŒ±œÅŒπœÉŒºŒ± œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ). See 1 Timothy 4:14. Here Paul says ŒºŒøœÖ (my), there he mentions the presbytery. Paul felt a deep personal interest in Timothy.

### John Gill:
1. "That thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee; by 'the gift' is meant his ministerial gift...what qualifies men for the ministry, is not anything natural in them, nor acquired by them, but what is given unto them, and that of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "I remind thee of stirring up ‚Äî Literally, blowing up the coals into a flame."
2. "The gift of God ‚Äî All the spiritual gifts, which the grace of God has given thee."
3. "Wherefore ‚Äî Because I remember this."
