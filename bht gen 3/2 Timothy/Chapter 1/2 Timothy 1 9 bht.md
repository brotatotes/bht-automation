# 2 Timothy 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is the amazing work of God alone, rooted in His own purpose and grace. It is a gift bestowed upon us by God's electing love, completely unrelated to our own deeds. The calling we receive is not a mere invitation, but a consecrated service, a holy and heavenly calling that claims us wholly for God. This calling is part of God's eternal counsels and should evoke our gratitude and a willingness to utilize the gifts He has given us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The call comes wholly from God and claims us wholly for God."
2. "The origination of salvation was of His own purpose, flowing from His own goodness, not for works of ours coming first, but wholly because of His own gratuitous, electing love."
3. "Believers being regarded by God as IN HIM, with whom the Father makes the covenant of salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He has brought us into a state in which salvation is so certain, that Paul could speak of it as if it were already done."
2. "The idea is, that our own works have nothing to do in inducing God to call us... The whole arrangement was irrespective of our deserts."
3. "That is, which he intended to give us, for it was not then actually given. The thing was so certain in the divine purposes, that it might be said to be already done."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Salvation is ascribed to God."
2. "Calling, saved."
3. "The gift planned and ordered in the eternal counsels is here treated as an actual bestowment."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word saved, though it admit of a general signification, is here limited, by the context, to denote eternal salvation. So then he means that they who, having obtained through Christ not a fading or transitory, but an eternal salvation, shall spare their fleeting life or honor rather than acknowledge their Redeemer; are excessively ungrateful."
2. "He places the sealing of salvation (142) in the calling; for, as the salvation of men was completed in the death of Christ, so God, by the gospel, makes us partakers of it. In order to place in a stronger light the value of this 'calling,' he pronounces it to be holy."
3. "Although Paul commonly employs the word 'purpose' to denote the secret decree of God, the cause of which is in his own power, yet, for the sake of fuller explanation, he chose to add 'grace,' that he might more clearly exclude all reference to works."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God has done so much for us. Shall we not at least do something for Him, if only by exercising the gifts He has bestowed on us?"
2. "A holy calling, i.e. a calling, a summons, which implies holiness."
3. "And as no commencement in time could be ascribed to the Divine purpose, for that would imply change in the Unchangeable, this purpose, yes, and even the gift, must be thought of as belonging to periods beyond man‚Äôs power to measure; literally, ‚Äòbefore the times of ages or ages‚Äô before the years of eternity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ here apparently not the invitation, but the consecrated service, 'the upward calling' (Philippians 3:14)." 
2. "Purpose (œÄœÅŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπŒΩ)."
3. "Before times eternal (œÄœÅŒø œáœÅŒøŒΩœâŒΩ Œ±ŒπœâŒΩŒπœâŒΩ)."

### John Gill:
1. "Salvation was not only resolved upon, but the scheme of it was contrived from eternity, in a way agreeable to all the divine perfections, in which Satan is most mortified, the creature abased, and the elect effectually saved."
2. "The calling here spoken of is not to an office, nor a mere call by the external ministry of the word, but a call by special grace, to special privileges, to grace and glory; and is an high and heavenly one."
3. "Vocation is also according to both the purpose and grace of God: it is according to his purpose; the persons called are fixed upon by him; whom he predestinates he calls; none are called, but whom God purposed to call."

### John Wesley:
1. "The love of the Father, the grace of our Saviour, and the whole economy of salvation, are here admirably described."
2. "Having called us with an holy calling ‚Äî Which is all from God, and claims us all for God."
3. "According to his own purpose and grace ‚Äî That is, his own gracious purpose."
