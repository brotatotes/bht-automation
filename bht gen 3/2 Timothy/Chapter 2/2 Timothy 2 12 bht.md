# 2 Timothy 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To suffer with Christ is to partake in his reign, while denying him leads to being denied by him. This implies that salvation goes beyond mere belief; it requires endurance in the face of suffering. Denying Christ, on the other hand, is rooted in weakness and unbelief, caused by being enticed by worldly attractions. It is crucial to recognize the gravity of such denial, as it contradicts the truth and bears consequences. Let us hold firm to our faith, enduring shame and persecution, knowing that we will ultimately share in Christ's reign in the kingdom of grace.
