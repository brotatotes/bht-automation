# 2 Timothy 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False teachings can be compared to a spreading, consuming disease. Just as a gangrene eats away at healthy flesh and spreads, these erroneous doctrines not only corrupt the specific truths they address but also infect and corrupt other truths. Such teachings have a destructive nature that can have far-reaching consequences, as seen with figures like Hymenaeus and Philetus. Like a cancer, false teachings feed on the vital elements of faith, threatening to bring destruction and death wherever they infiltrate. Therefore, it is imperative to oppose and cut off those who propagate such doctrines before the damage becomes irreparable.
