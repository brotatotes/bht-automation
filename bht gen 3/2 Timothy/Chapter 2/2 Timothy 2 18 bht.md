# 2 Timothy 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's words were twisted by some who falsely believed that the resurrection was merely a spiritual awakening from sin. This denial of the true meaning of resurrection undermines faith's foundation and leads to error. Those who assert that the resurrection is already past distort the truth and wander from Scripture. This dangerous misconception robs believers of hope and undermines a fundamental article of faith. We must diligently resist such teachings and hold onto the true understanding of resurrection.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "To believe it past (as the Seleucians or Hermians did, according to AUGUSTINE [Epistles, 119.55, To Januarius, 4]), is to deny it in its true sense." 
3. "Trying to subvert 'the foundation' on which alone faith can rest secure."

### Albert Barnes:

- Attempt 1 BHT: Some individuals, by distorting Paul's own words, have wrongly concluded that the resurrection is merely a spiritual awakening from the death of sin. These people, in their misguided attempt to deny the true sense of the resurrection, are in fact undermining the very foundation upon which faith rests. Their error has caused them to deviate from the truth and wander from the Scriptures.

Their teachings not only overthrow the faith of some, but also rob believers of the hope that comes from the true understanding of the resurrection. Such a dangerous misconception must be diligently resisted, as it undermines one of the fundamental articles of our faith.
