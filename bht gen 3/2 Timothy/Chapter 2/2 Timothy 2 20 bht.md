# 2 Timothy 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Church, there are both worthy and unworthy members. The Church is likened to a great house that contains vessels of gold and silver, representing precious and enduring believers, as well as vessels of wood and earthenware, symbolizing fragile and worthless individuals. This diversity within the Church is both expected and ornamental, reflecting the providence of God. While it is not surprising that bad men are mixed with the good, it is important for all vessels, whether of gold or clay, to remain pure in order to fulfill honorable purposes.

3. "But (contrast to the preceding definition of the Lord‚Äôs people) in a great house... there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware; and some for honour, some for dishonour."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The parable of the sweep-net gathering together of every kind, good and bad: as the good and bad cannot be distinguished while under the waves, but only when brought to shore, so believers and unbelievers continue in the same Church, until the judgment makes the everlasting distinction."
2. "The ark of Noah is a type of the Church; as in the former there were together the leopard and the kid, the wolf and the lamb; so in the latter, the righteous and sinners, vessels of gold and silver, with vessels of wood and earth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea is, that the church is a large edifice, and that in such a building we are not to expect entire uniformity in all the articles which it contains."
2. "Variety in the form, and use, and material, is necessary in furnishing such a house."
3. "In the church it is to be presumed that there will be a great variety of gifts and attainments, and that we are no more to expect that all will be alike, than we are that all the vessels in a large house will be made of gold."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "The mixed character of the church points to its greatness."

### John Calvin:

2. "This diversity is even ornamental, if, while the sideboard and the table glitter with gold and silver, the kitchen is furnished with vessels of wood and of earthenware."
3. "We ought not to think it strange, that bad men are mixed with the good, which happens chiefly in the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The classes of vessels correspond to the gifts which men have received... each has its proper use and honour in the great house of the Church of God." 
2. "But in each case, of the gold as of the clay, it is true that purity is the one essential condition of honourable use." 
3. "If the silver and the gold are allowed to be defiled by that which is unclean, if ‚Äòholiest things find vilest using,‚Äô then even they are in danger of serving only as vessels for dishonour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In a great house (ŒµŒΩ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒ∑ ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ±). Metaphor of a palace. He doubtless has the Kingdom of God in mind, but he works out the metaphor of a great house of the rich and mighty."
2. "Vessels (œÉŒ∫ŒµœÖŒ∑). Old word œÉŒ∫ŒµœÖŒøœÇ. See Romans 9:21 for the same double use as here."
3. "Of gold (œáœÅœÖœÉŒ±). Old contracted adjective œáœÅœÖœÉŒµŒøœÇ, only here by Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "since in every great house or palace, there is a variety of vessels of different matter, and for different uses, and some are mean, despicable, and dishonourable; and so it is in the church of God"

3. "there are others who are sensual, and carnal, and worldly, who mind earth, and earthly things, and have no spirituality, nor spiritual mindedness in them"

### John Wesley:
1. "In a great house... it is not strange that there are... vessels of wood and of earth - for less honourable purposes." 
2. "Yet a vessel even of gold may be put to the vilest use, though it was not the design of him that made it."
