# 2 Timothy 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Church, likened to a great house, there is a remarkable variety of vessels. Some vessels are made of precious gold and silver, able to withstand fire, while others are made of fragile wood and fragile earth. This diverse composition may seem strange, but it showcases the greatness of the Church. We ought not to be surprised or distressed by the presence of unrighteous individuals, for they are part of the providential arrangement within the Church. It is not for us to determine the purpose or honor of these vessels, as that is the design of the One who made them.

- Attempt 1 BHT: In 2 Timothy 2:20, the metaphor of a great house is used to illustrate the diversity within the Church. The vessels in this house represent believers, some being vessels of honor and others of dishonor. Just as the ark of Noah contained both righteous and sinners, the Church embraces a variety of characters. This mixed character reflects the greatness of the Church and the providence of God, even if it is not what we might expect. We should not be surprised or distressed by the presence of unrighteous individuals in the Church, for it is not the design of the One who made them to determine their honorable use or lack thereof.
