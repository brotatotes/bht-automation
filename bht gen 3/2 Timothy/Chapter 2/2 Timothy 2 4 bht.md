# 2 Timothy 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No soldier while serving in warfare entangles himself in the affairs of this life. The businesses of life should not hinder the work of the ministry; occupying the individual or being incompatible with it would make the occupation unlawful. Only when necessary, ministers of Christ may engage in secular occupations, but it is paramount for them not to be over-engrossed or entangled with worldly affairs. Similarly, soldiers should not be encumbered with the ordinary occupations of life but strive to please their captain and be devoted to Christ.

- Attempt 1 BHT: No soldier, when engaged in warfare, becomes entangled in the ordinary occupations of life. This does not mean that a minister of Christ cannot have a secular occupation. It is only when such occupation becomes a hindrance to the work of the ministry or is incompatible with it that it becomes unlawful. The grand purpose of the minister of the gospel is to please Christ, pursuing no separate plans or will of his own. Similarly, soldiers should not be encumbered with worldly affairs, but should focus solely on pleasing their captain. In order to be wholly devoted to Christ, we must be free from the entanglements of this world, giving our earnest attention to the worship of God.
