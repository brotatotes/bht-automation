# 2 Timothy 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who labor in the field are entitled to partake in the harvest's first fruits; such a right cannot be forfeited by relaxing their labor. The exhortation is clear: persevere in your toil to enjoy the reward. This principle extends beyond agriculture to the proclamation of the gospel, wherein those who share its message should live from it. Just as the husbandman tirelessly cultivates the land before gathering the fruit, ministers of the word must labor and endure hardships to reap heavenly rest and glory.
