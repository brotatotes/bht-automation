## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead." Remember Christ risen, so as to follow Him. As He was raised after death, so if thou wouldest share His risen "life," thou must now share His "death". The Greek perfect passive participle, implies a permanent character acquired by Jesus as the risen Saviour, and our permanent interest in Him as such.
2. Christ's resurrection is put prominently forward as being the truth now assailed, and the one best calculated to stimulate Timothy to steadfastness in sharing Paul's sufferings for the Gospel's sake.
3. In His death He assured us of His humanity; by His resurrection, of His divinity. That He was not crucified for His own sin appears from His resurrection; that He was crucified shows that He bore sin, on Him, though not in Him.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Remember Jesus Christ; him who was raised from the dead."
2. "Think of the Saviour, now raised up from the dead after all the sorrows of this life, and let this encourage you to bear your trials."
3. "There is nothing better fitted to enable us to endure the labors and trials of this life, than to think of the Saviour."

2. "The perfect marks the permanent condition - raised and still living."
3. "It is supposed by some that the words Jesus Christ - seed of David were a part of a confessional formula."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let no one corrupt or falsify my gospel by slanders; I have thus taught, I have thus preached, that Christ, who was born a man of the seed of David, rose from the dead."
2. "Now, in the resurrection of Christ we all have a sure pledge of our own resurrection. Accordingly, he who acknowledges that Christ has risen affirms that the same thing will take place with us also; for Christ did not rise for himself, but for us."
3. "Of the seed of David... By which he undoubtedly declares that he was a real man, the son of a human being, that is, of Mary."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Remember Jesus Christ. The exhortation, seemingly so abrupt and unconnected, looks both before and after."
2. "If that remembrance were clear and strong, he could not fail to be ready to take his share of hardships."
3. "He would be ready also to take a firm stand against the false teachers who, by saying that the resurrection was past already, reduced both truths to the level of fantastic myths."

### John Gill:

2. "[His resurrection] includes his whole life, and his righteousness, and obedience to the law of works, and points him out as the true Messiah..."
3. "the doctrine of the Gospel, and which he calls his, not because he was the author, or the subject of it...but because it was committed to him, and he was intrusted with it, and fully and faithfully preached it..."

### John Wesley:
1. Of the seed of David â€” This one genealogy attend to.
