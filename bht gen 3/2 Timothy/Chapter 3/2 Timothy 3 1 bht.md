# 2 Timothy 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the last days, grievous times shall come. The only modification in the understanding of the premonitory symptoms is that for us, He with whom a thousand years are as one day has spread them over many consecutive ages. These difficult times, preceding Christ's second coming, will be imminent and come unexpectedly, leading to a state of perfection. However, we must not be idle or complacent in these troubling times, but instead, we must always be prepared and resistant.

It is important to understand that the premonitory symptoms of these times have been spread over many consecutive ages, without changing their substance or truth. Paul's reference to these perilous times serves to emphasize the necessity of using every precaution to preserve the purity of the church.
