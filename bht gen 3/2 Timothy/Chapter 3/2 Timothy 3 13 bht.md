# 2 Timothy 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the end approaches, persecutions will increase and deceivers will become more prevalent. Those who have already deceived others are more easily swayed by the errors of others and continue to mislead and deceive. This diffusion of evil intensifies as the seducers, like modern impostors, constantly deceive and lead others astray. Sadly, these seducers not only deceive themselves but also have the ability to deceive others, causing great tragedy. It is important for godly teachers to be prepared for the ongoing warfare of spreading truth amidst the deceit and not be discouraged by the persistence of their adversaries.
