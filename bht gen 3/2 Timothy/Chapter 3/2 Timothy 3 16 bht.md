# 2 Timothy 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every Scripture, being God-inspired and breathed through with the power of the divine Spirit, is profitable for the complete edification of the man of God, equipping him for every good work. Verbal inspiration does not mean mechanical dictation, but rather, all Scripture is so inspired by God that everything in it, including its narratives, prophecies, and citations, were chosen with purpose. The usefulness of Scripture stems from its divine authority, its impartiality in revealing even the shortcomings of its writers, and its function as a perfect rule of faith and practice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every Scripture (not ‚Äòevery writing:‚Äô the word never occurs in the New Test. except in the sense of ‚ÄòScripture.‚Äô It may mean, perhaps, all Scripture: but, in the presence of such an expression as 'another Scripture saith,' John xix. 37, it is safer to keep to the meaning, unobjectionable both grammatically and contextually, ‚Äòevery Scripture‚Äô‚Äîi. e, ‚Äòevery part of Scripture‚Äô)"
2. "Given by inspiration of God (this word inspired, like that in the Greek, is an expression and idea connected with breath, the power of the divine Spirit being conceived of as a breath of life: the word thus amounts to ‚Äòbreathed through,‚Äô ‚Äòfull of the Spirit‚Äù)"
3. "That (result of the profitableness of Scripture: reasons why God has, having Himself inspired it, endowed it with this profitableness) the man of God (1 Tim. vi. 11 and note) may be complete (perfect at every point), thoroughly made ready to every good work (rather to be generally understood than officially: the man of God is not only a teacher, but any spiritual man: and the whole of the present passage regards the universal spiritual life)"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All Scripture is God-inspired and therefore useful; because we see no utility in any words or portion of it, it does not follow it is not God-inspired. It is useful, because God-inspired; not God-inspired, because useful."
2. "Verbal inspiration does not mean mechanical dictation, but all 'Scripture is (so) inspired by God,' that everything in it, its narratives, prophecies, citations, the whole‚Äîideas, phrases, and words‚Äîare such as He saw fit to be there."
3. "Since Paul is speaking of Scripture in general and in the notion of it, the only general reason why, in order to perfecting the godly, it should extend to every department of revealed truth, must be that it was intended to be the complete and sufficient rule in all things touching perfection."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means, God-inspired - from ŒòŒµŒøÃÅœÇ Theos, 'God,' and œÄŒΩŒµÃÅœâ pneoÃÑ, 'to breathe, to breathe out.' The idea of 'breathing upon, or breathing into the soul,' is that which the word naturally conveys."
2. "But the language must be figurative; for God does not breathe, though the fair inference is, that those Scriptures are as much the production of God, or are as much to be traced to him, as life is."
3. "The Scriptures furnish the rules of holy living in abundance, and thus they are adapted to the whole work of recovering man, and of guiding him to heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Every divinely-inspired Scripture is, besides being so inspired and for that reason, also profitable."
2. "Wfelimov profitable, according to A. V."
3. "Reproof is better understood as conviction, setting right with correction and discipline."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a principle which distinguishes our religion from all others, that we know that God hath spoken to us, and are fully convinced that the prophets did not speak at their own suggestion, but that, being organs of the Holy Spirit, they only uttered what they had been commissioned from heaven to declare."
2. "For this reason we may in the present day, condemn all who, disregarding edification, agitate questions which, though they are ingenious, are also useless."
3. "The most valuable knowledge, therefore, is 'faith in Christ.' Next follows instruction for regulating the life, to which are added the excitements of exhortations and reproofs. Thus he who knows how to use the Scriptures properly, is in want of nothing for salvation, or for a Holy life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God."
2. "Every Scripture, so far as it is inspired, works for the completeness of 'the man of God,' of the minister of Christ, and of his work."
3. "It is of small use acknowledging the inspiration of Scripture as a dogma, unless you use it for its appointed work."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable." 
2. "God-breathed."
3. "All scripture (or every scripture), inspired of God, is also profitable."

### John Gill:
1. "The Scriptures are here commended, from the divine authority of them."
2. "The impartiality of the writers of them, in not concealing the mean extract of some of them, the sins of others before conversion, and even their sins and failings afterwards, as well as those of their nearest relations and dearest friends, strengthens the proof of their divine authority."
3. "The Scriptures are a perfect rule of faith and practice; and thus they are commended from the usefulness and profitableness of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "All scripture is inspired of God" 
2. "Hence it is so profitable for doctrine, for instruction of the ignorant"
3. "for the reproof or conviction of them that are in error or sin"
