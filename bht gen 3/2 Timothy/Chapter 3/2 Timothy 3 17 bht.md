## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The man of God is perfectly accoutred out of Scripture for his work." 
2. "The man of God is thoroughly perfected and so 'perfect'." 
3. "No oral tradition is needed to be added."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Scriptures have laid down the way which leads to perfection, and that, if any one were perfect, he would find in the Scriptures all the instruction which he needed in those circumstances."
2. "Whatever good work the man of God desires to perform, or however perfect he aims to be, he will find no deficiency in the Scriptures, but will find there the most ample instructions that he needs."
3. "No new phase of human affairs can appear in which [the Bible] will not direct him; no new plan of benevolence can be started, for which he will not find principles there to guide him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Perfect [Œ±œÅœÑŒπŒøœÇ] . N. T. o. LXX Rev. complete; but the idea is rather that of mutual, symmetrical adjustment of all that goes to make the man : harmonious combination of different qualities and powers."
2. "Thoroughly furnished [ŒµŒæŒ∑œÅœÑŒπœÉŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ] . The same root as artiov. It fills out the idea artiov; fitted out."
3. "Any writing which can produce such profitable results vindicates itself as inspired of God. It is to be noted that the test of the divine inspiration of Scripture is here placed in its practical usefulness."

### John Calvin:
1. "Perfect means here a blameless person, one in whom there is nothing defective; for he asserts absolutely, that the Scripture is sufficient for perfection."
2. "He who is not satisfied with Scripture desires to be wiser than is either proper or desirable."
3. "So far as relates to the substance, nothing has been added; for the writings of the apostles contain nothing else than a simple and natural explanation of the Law and the Prophets, together with a manifestation of the things expressed in them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That the man of God may be complete, completely equipped."
2. "It is obvious that St. Paul refers chiefly, many would say exclusively, to the Scriptures of the Old Testament."
3. "The fact that the word had gained this wider range explains St. Paul‚Äôs addition of the qualifying adjective, not 'every Scripture' absolutely, but 'every God-inspired Scripture,' as though giving a test by which that inspiration might be recognised."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "May be complete (ŒπŒΩŒ± Œ∑ Œ±œÅœÑŒπŒøœÇ). Final clause with ŒπŒΩŒ± and present subjunctive of ŒµŒπŒº. ŒëœÅœÑŒπŒøœÇ is old word (from root Œ±œÅœâ, to fit), specially adapted, here only in N.T."
2. "Furnished completely (ŒµŒæŒ∑œÅœÑŒπœÉŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ). Perfect passive participle of ŒµŒæŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ∂œâ, rare verb, to furnish (fit) fully (perfective use of ŒµŒæ), in N.T. only here and Acts 21:5."
3. "For Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ∂œâ, see Luke 6:40; 2 Corinthians 13:11."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of the Scriptures and the end of writing them are, that both preachers of the word, and hearers of it, might have a perfect knowledge of the will of God."
2. "Thoroughly furnished unto all good works, or 'every good work'; particularly to the work of the ministry, which is a good one; and to every part and branch of it, a thorough furniture for which lies in the holy Scriptures."
3. "This may be also applied to all good works in common, which the Scriptures point unto, give directions about, as well as show where strength is to be had to perform them."

### John Wesley:
1. "That the man of God... may be perfect." 
2. "Blameless himself, and thoroughly furnished."
3. "By the scripture, either to teach, reprove, correct, or train up others."
