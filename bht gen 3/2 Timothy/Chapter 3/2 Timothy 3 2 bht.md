- Attempt 1 BHT: In the future, mankind will be marked by their excessive self-love, insatiable desire for money, arrogant boasting, disrespect towards authority, lack of gratitude and holiness, absence of natural affection, unyielding hatred, slanderous tongues, lack of self-control, inhumane behavior, refusal to embrace goodness, treachery, impulsive actions, and arrogance fueled by pride. They will maintain a form of godliness but reject its power. Therefore, it is advised to turn away from such individuals, for their ways resemble heathenism. The central vice among these wicked men is the love of money, as it serves as a root of all kinds of evil. These characteristics will be particularly evident among the younger generation, reflecting a decline in morality. Their love for self extends beyond healthy self-regard, and their covetousness is distinct from a generic love of money. Their blasphemous speech is akin to railing or reviling. Truly, the hardships of those times will derive from the wicked actions of men, rather than external calamities. The world, in all its disdain for true holiness, shall be deceived by these scoundrels. They claim superiority, despise others, exhibit cruelty, engage in covetousness, treachery, anger, rebellion against parents, neglect of good, and more. Their selfishness infringes upon the rights and well-being of others, making self the center and priority of their existence. It is a world devoid of gratitude and natural affection. May we be wary of falling into these destructive patterns and instead strive to cultivate genuine love for God and others.
