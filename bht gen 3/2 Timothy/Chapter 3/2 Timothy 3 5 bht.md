# 2 Timothy 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some individuals in the Church possess a mere outward semblance of godliness, denying the power and reality of it. They cling to the forms of religion but lack true piety. These characters, already present in the Church, should be turned away from. True godliness goes beyond the external show, for it is the living, regenerating, and sanctifying influence that truly matters. Do not associate with those who profess religion but live as if they had none, as true piety is not found in the mere appearance, but in the inward power and reality of it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Form‚Äîoutward semblance."
2. "The power‚Äîthe living, regenerating, sanctifying influence of it."
3. "Turn away‚Äîimplying that some of such characters, forerunners of the last days, were already in the Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They profess religion, or are in connection with the church. [...] in keeping up the forms of religion." This shows that the apostle referred to some great corruption in the church.
2. "They live as if they had None. This has been common in the world." The most regular and bigoted adherence to the forms of religion furnishes no evidence in itself that there is any true piety at heart.
3. "Have no contact with them as if they were Christians; show no countenance to their religion; do not associate with them." From such turn away.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The power [œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπŒΩ]. The practical virtue."
2. "The mere outward semblance, as distinguished from the essential reality."
3. "Turn away [Œ±œÄŒøœÑœÅŒµœÄŒøœÖ]."

### John Calvin:
1. "This exhortation sufficiently shows that Paul does not speak of a distant posterity, nor foretell what would happen many ages afterwards."
2. "How could Timothy 'turn away' from those who were not to arise till many centuries afterwards?"
3. "From the very beginning of the gospel, the Church must have begun to be affected by such corruptions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Greek word suggests the idea of a manufactured article, the 'fashion or semblance' of piety."
2. "The Greek participle is in the perfect, 'having denied' or 'repudiated.'"
3. "The injunction implies, what is in other ways apparent, that St. Paul thought of the characteristic features of the last days as already present."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A form of godliness... The outward shape without the reality."
2. "Having denied... The perfect middle participle of Œ±œÅŒΩŒµŒøŒºŒ±."
3. "Turn away... Present middle (direct) imperative of Œ±œÄŒøœÑœÅŒµœÄœâ, 'turn thyself away from.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Having a form of godliness,.... Either a mere external show of religion, pretending great piety and holiness, being outwardly righteous before men, having the mask and visor of godliness..."
2. "...they deny the use, the power, and efficacy of them; they deny the use of them to the laity, and affirm that they are not a sufficient rule of faith and practice, without their unwritten traditions..."
3. "...have no fellowship with them, depart from their communion, withdraw from them, and come out from among them: this passage sufficiently justifies the reformed churches in their separation from the church of Rome."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having a form... but not regarding, nay, even denying and blaspheming, the inward power and reality of it."
2. "Is not this eminently fulfilled at this day?"
3. "An appearance of godliness, but not regarding... the inward power and reality of it."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Having a mere outward semblance of godliness, without the living, regenerating, and sanctifying influence of it, there are those who are already in the Church. They deny the power and efficacy of the forms, even going so far as to reject and repudiate them. Therefore, in order to distance oneself from such characters, one must turn away from their company and association. This is not a prediction of a distant future, but rather a description of the corruption that has been present in the Church since its early days. The call to turn away from those who profess religion but live as if they had none, serves as a reminder that true piety is not found in the mere external show, but in the inward power and reality of it.
