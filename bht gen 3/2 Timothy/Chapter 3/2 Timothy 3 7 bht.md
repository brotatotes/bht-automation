## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The knowledgeâ€”the perfect knowledge; the only safeguard against further novelties."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They put themselves wholly under the care of these professedly religious teachers, but they never acquire the true knowledge of the way of salvation."
2. "There are many such persons in the world, who, whatever attention they may pay to religion, never understand its nature."
3. "Nothing is more common than for persons to be very busy and active in religion, and even to 'learn' many things about it, who still remain strangers to the saving power of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
