# 2 Timothy 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jannes and Jambres, who opposed Moses and resisted the truth, serve as prototypes for the opponents to the truth today. Being men corrupted in mind and worthless concerning the faith, they were reprobate, incapable of testing the truth and rejected when tested. Skilled in magic, they renounced their trust in Christ and stood against His truth. Yet, their example reminds us that adversaries rising against Christ and His gospel should not catch us off guard, for even Moses faced opposition.
