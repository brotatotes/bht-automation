# 2 Timothy 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Titus forsaking Paul seems to be motivated by a love of worldly ease and safety, choosing personal comfort over facing danger with Paul. It is important to note that Paul had friends among the Roman Christians who still visited him, even though they were afraid to stand by him during his trial. The mention of Demas in Colossians 4:14 may be related to his behavior of forsaking Paul. Titus had likely gone to Dalmatia to carry out Paul's intentions before being interrupted by his arrest.
