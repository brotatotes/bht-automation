# 2 Timothy 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When people reject the truth, they often seek solace in fables and myths that align with their desires. This rejection is a form of righteous punishment, as their ears refuse to hear what contradicts their lusts. It is unfortunate that some willingly choose illusions over the truth, turning against those who speak the truth, just as the crowd did with Stephen in Acts 7:57. Their minds become empty, devoid of sense and judgment, surrendering to idle and fictional tales, much like old wives' fables.
