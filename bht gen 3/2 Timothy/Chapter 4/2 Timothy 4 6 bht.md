## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For I am already being poured out, the process is begun, which shall shed my blood." 
2. "'Ready to be offered' misses the force of the present tense."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'ready' in the phrase 'ready to be offered,' conveys an idea which is not in the original. It implies a willingness to depart, which, whether true or not, is not the idea conveyed by the apostle." 
2. "The allusion here... is to the custom which prevailed among the pagan generally, of pouring wine and oil on the head of a victim when it was about to be offered in sacrifice. The idea of the apostle then is, that he was in the condition of the victim on whose head the wine and oil had been already poured, and which was just about to be put to death; that is, he was about to die." 
3. "The true idea of death is that of loosening the bands that confine us to the present world; of setting us free, and permitting the soul to go forth, as with expanded sails, on its eternal voyage. With such a view of death, why should a Christian fear to die?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Already. What he is now suffering is the beginning of the end."
2. "The figure is explained by some of loosing a Ship from its moorings; by others of breaking camp."
3. "Blessed are the presbyters who have gone before, seeing that their departure was fruitful and ripe."

### John Calvin:
1. "By the word dissolution he means that we do not altogether perish when we die; because it is only a separation of the soul from the body. Hence we infer, that death is nothing else than a departure of the soul from the body â€” a definition which contains a testimony of the immortality of the soul."
2. "Sacrifice was a term peculiarly applicable to the death of Paul, which was inflicted on him for maintaining the truth of Christ...martyrs are sacrificed in a more excellent manner, by shedding their blood for the name of Christ."
3. "Paul has here adorned his death by a magnificent commendation, when he called it the ratification of his doctrine, that believers, instead of sinking into despondency...might be more encouraged by it to persevere."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I am being offered. My life is being poured out as a libation."
2. "Do thy work thoroughly, for mine is all but over."
3. "The time of my departure...was probably suggested by the way in which it was commonly applied to the 'breaking up' or 'dispersion' of those who had been gathered together for a sacrifice or ft libation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The sacrifice of Paul's life-blood has begun."
2. "The departure, the unloosing, the analysis of my life has come."
3. "The hour has struck. The time has come."

### John Gill:
1. "This sacrifice of himself was not to atone for sin, his own, or others; Christ's death was the only sacrifice for sin, and that is a complete one, and needs no other to be added to it." 
2. "Death is a dissolution of soul and body, or a dissolving of the union that is between them, and a resolution of the body into its first principles; hence the Syriac version renders it, 'the time in which I shall be dissolved'." 
3. "The time for going out of this world, as well as for coming into it, is determined by God, beyond which there is no passing."

### John Wesley:
1. "The time of my departure is at hand â€” So undoubtedly God had shown him."
2. "I am ready to be offered up â€” Literally, to be poured out, as the wine and oil were on the ancient sacrifices."
