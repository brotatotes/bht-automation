## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There Is, as Calvin has shewn, no sort of inconsistency here with the doctrines of grace: 'For the gratuitous justification which is conferred on us by grace does not militate against the reward of good works, nay, rather the two exactly agree, that man is justified gratis by Christâ€™s merit, and yet shall receive the reward of his works before God.'"
2. "As soon as God receives us into grace, He is pleased with our works, so that He accounts them worthy of reward though undeserved."
3. "The crown of righteousness...which the Lord shall award me in that day, the righteous judge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A man is justified gratuitously by the merits of Christ through faith; and when he is so justified God accepts his works and honors them with a reward which is not their due, but is given of grace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That is, a crown won in the cause of righteousness, and conferred as the reward of his conflicts and efforts in the cause of holiness."
2. "No one is excluded because another is successful; no one fails of the reward because another obtains it."
3. "It is one of the characteristics of a true Christian that he sincerely desires the return of his Saviour, and would weLcome his appearing in the clouds of heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase N.T. o."
2. "The crown."
3. "Appearing, Christ's second coming."

### John Calvin:
1. "This certainty arises from turning his eyes to the day of the resurrection, and this is what we also ought to do; for all around we see nothing but death, and therefore we ought not to keep our eye fixed on the outward appearance of the world, but, on the contrary, to hold out to our minds the coming of Christ."
2. "For as soon as God has received us into favor, he likewise accepts our works, so as even to deign to give them a reward, though it is not due to them."
3. "That all the rest of the believers might fight courageously along with him, he invites them to a participation of the crown; for his unshaken steadfastness could not have served for an example to us, if the same hope of obtaining the crown had not been held out to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A crown of righteousness."
2. "His great joy is not that there is a special reward for himself, but that it will be given to all like-minded with him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul's 'crown of righteousness'... 'is laid away' for him."

3. "The righteous judge, the umpire who makes no mistakes who judges us all."

### John Gill:
1. "The happiness of the future state of the saints is signified by a crown, on account of the glory and excellency of it."
2. "This happiness, signified by a crown, is 'laid up'; in the covenant of grace for the saints, which is ordered in all things and sure."
3. "The apostle further observes, to the comfort and encouragement of Timothy, and others, that this happiness was not intended and prepared for himself only, but for others."

### John Wesley:
1. "The crown of that righteousness - Which God has imputed to me and wrought in me."
2. "That have loved his appearing â€” Which only a real Christian can do."
3. "Strictly speaking, to join real or sincere to a word of so complete an import, is grievously to debase its noble signification, and is like adding long to eternity or wide to immensity."
