He went so far as to cast them out of the church, wielding his power of excommunication. The aged apostle, unafraid of Diotrephes, defied him by vowing to remember and punish his actions and bring them to remembrance before the church. John knew that the conduct of Diotrephes, filled with malevolent words and a domineering spirit, would not stand the light.
