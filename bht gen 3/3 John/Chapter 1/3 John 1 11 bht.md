# 3 John 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. The one who does good is born of God, while the one who does evil has not truly experienced God. The word imitate in Greek carries the meaning of both an actor and a prose drama that portrays life and character. So, do not follow that which is evil, as seen in the actions of Diotrephes, but rather strive to imitate that which is good, which is exemplified in Demetrius.
