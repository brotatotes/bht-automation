### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Although the author of this verse initially had many things to communicate, he decides against writing them down using traditional means like ink and a reed pen. The imperfect tense of the verb suggests that he had these thoughts when he began writing. The use of the term reed can be seen in other contexts, such as in the scepter mockingly placed in Jesus' hand, or even as a measuring-reed in the book of Revelation. Instead of continuing to write, the author wishes to refrain from further communication through this traditional method. Instead, he may be implying that there are alternative ways to convey his message.
