## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Peace be to thee (beautifully paraphrased by Lyra, 'The internal peace of the conscience, the fraternal peace of friendship, the supernal peace of glory.')"
2. "Salute the friends by name (as if I had written their names here)."
3. "'The reason why St. John mentions friends [see John xi. 11, xv. 15, Acts xxvii. 3], and not brethren [1 Cor. xvi. 20, Phil. iv, 21, Eph. vi. 23], is probably to be found in the personal character of the Epistle, not addressed as from an Apostle to a church, but as from a friend to his friend, in which mutual friends on both sides would be the senders and receivers of salutation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "face to face â€” Greek, 'mouth to mouth.'" 
2. "Peace â€” peace inward of conscience, peace fraternal of friendship, peace supernal of glory [Lyra]."
3. "by name â€” not less than if their names were written [Bengel]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is proper to desire for our friends all temporal good; to wish their happiness in every respect."
2. "It is an unspeakable pleasure to a Christian to learn that his friends are living and acting as becomes sincere Christians; that they love what is true, and abound in the duties of hospitality charity, and benevolence."
3. "We may see from this Epistle that churches 'ought' to be united in promoting the cause of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Face to face. See on 2 John 1:12. 


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I hope (ÎµÎ»Ï€Î¹Î¶Ï‰)"
2. "We shall speak (Î»Î±Î»Î·ÏƒÎ¿Î¼ÎµÎ½). Literary plural really singular like ÎµÎ»Ï€Î¹Î¶Ï‰."
3. "The friends (Î¿ Ï†Î¹Î»Î¿). Those in Ephesus."

### John Gill:
1. "and we shall speak face to face; freely and familiarly converse together about these things..."
2. "peace [be] to thee; which was the usual form of salutation with the Jews..."
3. "greet the friends by name; meaning those that were where Gaius lived, to whom the apostle sends his salutation, and desires it might be delivered to each of them, as if they had been mentioned by name."

### John Wesley:
1. "Salute the friends by name â€” That is, in the same manner as if I had named them one by one." 
2. "The word friend does not often occur in the New Testament, being swallowed up in the more endearing one of brother."
