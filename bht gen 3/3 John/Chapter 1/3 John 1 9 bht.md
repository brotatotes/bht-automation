## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word somewhat docs not imply that the thing written was specially important, nor on the other hand does it depreciate; but merely designates indefinitely." 
2. "Diotrephes, who loveth preeminence... willed that not the Apostle but himself should rule the church."

2. "That Epistle was not designed by the Spirit for the universal Church, or else it would have been preserved." 
3. "Among themâ€”over the members of the Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair interpretation of this passage is, that these brethren had gone forth on some former occasion, commended by John to the church, and had been rejected by the influence of Diotrephes, and that now he commends them to Gains, by whom they had been formerly entertained, and asks him to renew his hospitality to them."
2. "The idea is, that he [Diotrephes] rejected his interference in the matter, and was not disposed to acknowledge him in any way."
3. "The case furnishes an illustration of the bad influence of one ambitious and arrogant man in a church.

2. "Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, the members of the church, receiveth us not..."
3. "The evangelists had reported to St. John that neither his authority nor his letter was honoured by Diotrephes; that he rejected both, and spoke against the apostle publicly in a church which was almost entirely under his influence, being opposed by Demetrius and his selecter company, and Gaius keeping aloof probably through sickness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not epistolary aorist nor a reference to II John as Findlay holds, but an allusion to a brief letter of commendation... sent along with the brethren."
2. "This ambitious leader and sympathiser with the Gnostics would probably prevent the letter referred to being read to the church." 
3. "Diotrephes refused to accept John's authority or those who sided with him, John's missionaries or delegates."

### John Gill:
1. "but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them,
receiveth us not."
2. "his slighting and rejecting the brethren that came from Judea: it is very likely he was more than a private member in the church, and that he was an officer, and it may be the pastor."
3. "this ambitious, lordly, and governing spirit, received not the Apostle John, and those that were with him; meaning not their persons, but his letter, his orders, and instructions."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who loveth to have the preeminence among them â€” To govern all things according to his own will."
2. "Receiveth us not â€” Neither them nor me."
3. "So did the mystery of iniquity already work!"
