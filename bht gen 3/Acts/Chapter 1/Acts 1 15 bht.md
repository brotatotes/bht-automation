### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In the days between the Ascension and Pentecost, the number of believers had increased as the disciples gathered around the Apostles. These were the days of expectant prayer, when the nature of their future work began to dawn upon them. The Holy Ghost was stirring in Peter, the leading spirit of the infant community, and many of the disciples who had seen the risen Lord remained in Galilee. The term names refers to the number of individuals, and it is likely that a multitude, about 120 people, were gathered together for this important occasion. This gathering of believers set the foundation for the preaching of the gospel, establishing an imperfect beginning that would credit the preaching with less credibility later on. The unity and oneness of the believers is evident, as they not only gave themselves to the Lord, but also to one another. The number 120 holds no special significance, but it was important that Matthias was chosen into the place of Judas to ensure the continuing fulfillment of Christ's appointed work.
