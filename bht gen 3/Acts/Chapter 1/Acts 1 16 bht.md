### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not that there was any physical necessity or any compulsion; but it could not but occur that a prediction of God would be fulfilled."
2. "A man will be just as free in wickedness if it be foretold that he will be wicked, as if it had never been known to any other being but himself."
3. "This is a strong attestation to the inspiration of David, and accords with the uniform testimony of the New Testament, that the sacred writers spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought to attribute this honor unto the prophecies of the Scriptures, that they are able to appease all such fear as we conceive of the sudden event of things."
2. "There is nothing which doth more trouble us than when we stay still in our own sense and understanding, and procure unto ourselves lets and doubts, which the Lord would be ready to cure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Guided by the Holy Spirit, St. Peter finds in these words of the two Psalms this especially sad episode in the history of Christ plainly foreshadowed, and discovers in them an injunction to proceed to the election of another to make up the number of the Twelve."
2. "His bishoprick let another take. St. Peterâ€™s words here give us the clue to the right understanding of the terrible imprecations found in some of the Psalms. They are no curses pronounced by David or any other king or prophet; they are never the expression of a longing for personal revenge, but are, as Chrysostom expresses it, a prophecy in the form of a curse pronounced upon some enemies of God and His Church, hereafter to arise."
3. "'We find these prayers for vengeance,' writes the Dean of Peterborough (Dr. Perowne, Hulsean Professor of Divinity, Cambridge), 'chiefly in four Psalms, the 7th, 35th, 69th, 109th.' 'Are these anathemas to be excused as being animated by the spirit of Elias? a spirit not unholy, indeed, but far removed from the meekness and gentleness of Christ.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "More dignified and respectful than just 'brethren.'"

### John Gill:
1. "this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled; or 'must needs be fulfilled': referring either to Psalms  41:9 or rather to the passages after cited out of Psalms 69:25." 
2. "there was a necessity of the fulfilling of it, consistent with the prescience of God, his counsel, and decree, and the veracity of the Scripture." 
3. "the omniscience, and so the deity of the Holy Ghost, and the divine authority of David's Psalms; as well as the honour that was put upon him to be the instrument by which the Holy Ghost speaks, and to be his amanuensis."

### John Wesley:
1.  Psalm 41:9.
