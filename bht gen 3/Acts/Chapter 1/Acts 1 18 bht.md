## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The various attempts to reconcile the two narratives...are among the saddest examples of the shifts to which otherwise high-minded men are driven by an unworthy system." 
2. "Falling headlong will hardly bear the meaning assigned to it by those who wish to harmonize the two accounts...It would rather point...to a sudden fall forward on the face by a stroke from God, or by an accident."
3. "An accurate acquaintance with the actual circumstances would account for the discrepancy, but nothing else."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 18. falling headlong, &amp;c.‚ÄîThis
	information supplements, but by no means contradicts, what is said in
	Matthew 27:5.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man is said often to do a thing when he furnishes means for doing it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression means merely that the field was purchased with the money of Judas."
2. "Falling headlong. Lit., having become headlong."
3. "He burst asunder. Only here in New Testament. Lit., to crack, to burst with a noise."

### John Calvin:
1. "He enjoyed not the money; he only possessed the field."
2. "Furthermore, it came to pass through the marvelous providence of God, that the very common name of the field should be a note of infamy for the priests."
3. "And out of this place must we learn, that the wicked shall not escape scott free, which have persecuted the Church of God; for this miserable and wretched end is prepared for them all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Falling headlong (œÄœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ). The word means, not 'headlong,' but 'flat on the face' as opposed to œÖœÄœÑŒπŒøœÇ on the back (Hackett)."
2. "The place suits admirably the idea that Judas hung himself (Matthew 27:5) and, the rope breaking, fell flat on his face and burst asunder in the midst (ŒµŒªŒ±Œ∫Œ∑œÉŒµŒΩ ŒºŒµœÉŒøœÇ)."
3. "Gushed out (ŒµŒæŒµœáœÖŒ∏Œ∑). First aorist passive indicative of ŒµŒ∫œáŒµœâ, to pour out."

### John Gill:
1. "It is somewhat difficult, that Judas should be said to purchase it, when Matthew says the chief priests bought it."
2. "The Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions render it, 'he possessed' it; not in person, unless he was buried there, as he might be."
3. "And this was the miserable end of Judas. The death of Arius, as related by Athanasius, from Macarius the presbyter, who was present, was much after the same manner; who reports, that having swore to the orthodox faith, and being about to be introduced into the church at Constantinople, after the prayer of Alexander, the bishop of it, he went out to the seat, to ease nature; when he, on a sudden, fell down headlong, and burst in the middle, and immediately expired."

### John Wesley:
1. "This man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity." 
2. "A field was purchased with the reward of his iniquity."
3. "It seems the rope broke before, or as he died."
