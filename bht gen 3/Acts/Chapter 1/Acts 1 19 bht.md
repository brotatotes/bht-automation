- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 1:19, it is important to consider the context of Peter's speech and the language he spoke. The Holy Ghost was stirring in Peter, who would become the leading spirit of the early Christian community. It is likely that many of the five hundred brethren who saw the risen Lord remained in Galilee. As the disciples were in a time of expectant prayer, the nature of their future work began to become clear. The name of the field, Aceldama, is an Aramaic word that means the field of blood. The presence of this field would have served as a reminder of Judas' guilt and his betrayal of Jesus. Additionally, there is the possibility that Aceldama was used with a double emphasis, emphasizing the ill-omened name. Thus, the name Aceldama not only referred to the field's historical significance but also carried a symbolic weight.
