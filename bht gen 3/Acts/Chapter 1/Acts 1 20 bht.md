## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ps. lxix. is eminently a Messianic psalm,‚Äîspoken in the first place of David and his kingdom and its enemies, and so, according to the universal canon of Old Testament interpretation, of Him in whom that kingdom found its true fulfilment, and of His enemies." 
2. "The same is true of Ps. cix., and there one adversary is even more pointedly marked out."
3. "Bishoprick not necessarily such, in technical accuracy: the word may signify any overseership, office, or charge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

	fellow conspirators against David.


### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Bishopric [ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒ∑ŒΩ] . See on 1 Peter 2:12. Rev., better, office, with overseership in margin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "His office (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ). Our word bishopric (Authorized Version) is from this word, office of bishop (ŒµœÄŒπœÉœáŒøœÄŒøœÇ). Only that is not the idea here, but over-seership (ŒµœÄŒπ, œÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒµœâ) or office as in 1 Peter 2:12."

### John Gill:

3. "That this psalm refers to Judas Iscariot, and to his affair, was so clear a point with the ancients, that they used to call it the Iscariotic Psalm."
