# Acts 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In their search for a suitable candidate to fill Judas's place, the disciples presented two individuals: Justus and Matthias. It is likely that both were chosen from the Seventy, a group previously distinguished by Jesus himself. Justus, whose name denotes justice, was a Roman name adopted according to prevalent customs. While Matthias's historical background remains unknown, there are various traditions surrounding his life, including preaching in Judea, martyrdom in Ethiopia or Colchis, and even the authorship of apocryphal writings. Through the casting of lots, God's determination and judgment affirmed Matthias's calling to the apostleship.
