# Acts 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The lot was used to determine the divine choice of the twelve apostles. The suffrages of the assembly unanimously agreed on the candidate chosen. Although the Bible doesn't explicitly state it, there is no reason to doubt the number of apostles was truly twelve. This method of casting lots was customary among the Jews as a way to learn the will of God. Matthias, upon whom the lot fell, became one of the apostles, accepted by the Church as chosen by God.
