## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is a general reproof and assertion, spoken with reference to men, as forbidden to search curiously into a point which Omniscience has reserved‚Äîthe times and seasons of the future divine dealings."
2. "It may be observed however, that the same assertion is not made here: only the times and seasons said to be in the power of the Almighty Father, Who ordereth all things 'according to the counsel of His will.'"
3. "The knowledge of times and seasons has very seldom been imparted by prophecy, which generally has formed a testimony to this very fact, that God has them in His foreknowledge, and, while He announces the events, conceals for the most part in obscurity the times."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not for you to know the times, &amp;c.‚Äîimplying not only that this was not the time, but that the question was irrelevant to their present business and future work."
2. "not only that this was not the time"
3. "the question was irrelevant to their present business and future work"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The question of the apostles respected the time of the restoration; it was not whether he would do it."

3. "All prophecy is remarkably obscure in regard to the time of its fulfillment."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Often used adverbially in the phrase kat' ijdian, apart, privately."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is the true means to become wise, namely, to go as far forward in learning as our Master Christ goeth in teaching, and willingly to be ignorant of those things which he doth conceal from us."
2. "We must be desirous to learn so far as our heavenly Master doth teach us; but as for such things as he will have us ignorant of, let mine be so bold as to inquire after them that we may be wise with sobriety."
3. "Christ forbiddeth us to apply those things unto ourselves, which God doth challenge as proper to himself alone."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "It is not for you to know the times and the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Times or seasons (œáœÅŒøŒΩŒøœÖœÇ Œ∑ Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅŒøœÖœÇ). 'Periods' and 'points' of time sometimes and probably so here, but such a distinction is not always maintained." 
2. "It is curious how eager people have always been to fix definite dates about the second coming of Christ as the apostles were about the political Messianic kingdom which they were expecting." 
3. "Note also 'his own' (ŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ±) 'authority' (ŒµŒæŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ±)."

2. "Which the Father hath put in his own power ‚Äî To be revealed when and to whom it pleaseth him."

- Attempt 4 BHT: It is not for you to know the times and the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power. This verse is a general reproof, reminding us that God has reserved the knowledge of future events and the specific timing of His divine dealings. The question of when these things will happen is not relevant to our present business and future work. It is interesting to note that throughout history, people have been eager to fix definite dates for significant events, whether regarding the second coming of Christ or the arrival of the political Messianic kingdom. However, it is essential to acknowledge that these are matters that God has chosen to keep in His own power, revealing them when and to whom it pleases Him.

However, these matters are under God's control, to be revealed when and to whom He chooses.
