## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "C√ÜSAREA ( 'of Palestine,' called 'by the sea' [as we say, 'super mare']) is between Joppa and Dora...It was, even before the destruction of Jerusalem, the seat of the Roman Procurators...It was chiefly inhabited by Gentiles, but there were also many thousand Jewish inhabitants." 
2. "It was built by Herod the Great...and in honour of C√¶sar Augustus named C√¶sarea, more fully C√¶sarea Sebast√©."
3. "A centurion...of the band called the Italian band, i.e. of a cohort levied in Italy, not in Syria."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "C√¶sarea‚Äî(See on :-)." 
2. "the Italian band‚Äîa cohort of Italians, as distinguished from native soldiers, quartered at C√¶sarea, probably as a bodyguard to the Roman procurator who resided there."
3. "An ancient coin makes express mention of such a cohort in Syria."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "He was a Gentile... one who did not in any sense esteem himself to be a Jew."
3. "The Italian band - Probably a band or regiment that was composed of soldiers from Italy."

### Marvin Vincent:

Band [œÉœÄŒµŒπœÅŒ∑œÇ] . See on Mark 14:16. 
Italian. Probably because consisting of Roman soldiers, and not of natives of the country.


### John Calvin:
1. "A rare example that a soldier was so devout towards God, so upright and courteous towards men!"
2. "The virtues of Cornelius deserve the greater commendation, in that leading a soldier‚Äôs life, which was at that time most corrupt, he served God holily, and lived amongst men without doing any hurt or injury."
3. "Seeing that none of these things could hinder Cornelius, but that forsaking his idols he did embrace the true worship of the true God alone, it must needs be that he was endued with rare and singular sincerity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All this sacred history, both in its outward circumstances and in the apostle's personal experience, is arranged on a providential plan."
2. "C√¶sarea is set before us as the scene of the bright beginning of that revelation of the 'mystery of the reception of the Gentiles on equal terms with the Jews, in which St. Paul afterwards so much gloried."
3. "We have here, in the case of Cornelius, an anticipation of the intimate association of St. Paul with the Roman army. It does not follow from this that war is a good thing. Rather we ought to say that it is a bad thing overruled for good, and made subservient to missionary purposes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These Roman centurions always appear in a favourable light in the N.T."
2. "Once more Luke has been vindicated."
3. "The soldiers could, of course, be Roman citizens who lived in Caesarea. But the Italian cohorts were sent to any part of the empire as needed."

2. "This was the Caesarea formerly called Strato's tower, not Caesarea Philippi."
3. "which consisted of soldiers collected out of Italy, from whence the band took its name, in which Cornelius was a centurion, having a hundred men under him, as the name of his office signifies."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In the city of Caesarea, a centurion named Cornelius lived. Caesarea, a Roman city named after Caesar Augustus, was a predominantly Gentile city, although it also had a significant Jewish population. Cornelius was a centurion of the Italian band, a cohort of Italian soldiers stationed in Caesarea, possibly serving as a bodyguard to the Roman procurator. It is worth noting that these Roman centurions often appeared in a favorable light in the New Testament. Despite being a Gentile and a soldier, Cornelius demonstrated remarkable devotion to God, personal integrity, and kindness towards others. His virtues are even more commendable considering the corrupt nature of the soldier's life at that time. Cornelius's story in Caesarea anticipates the later association of the apostle Paul with the Roman army and highlights the providential plan to reveal the mystery of the reception and inclusion of the Gentiles on equal terms with the Jews.
