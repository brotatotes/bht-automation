### Albert Barnes:
1. "Such a coincidence is not uncommon. An event of divine Providence may be as clear an expression of his will, and may as certainly serve to indicate our duty, as the most manifest revelation would do, and a state of mind may, by an arrangement of circumstances, be produced that will be extremely perplexing until some event shall occur..."
2. "We should then carefully mark the events of God‚Äôs providence. We should observe and record the train of our own thoughts, and should watch with interest any event that occurs, when we are perplexed and embarrassed, to obtain, if possible, an expression of the will of God."
3. "The word here rendered 'gate,' œÄœÖŒªœâÕÇŒΩŒ± puloÃÑna refers properly to the porch or principal entrance to an Eastern house. It does not mean, as with us, a gate, but rather a door."

### John Calvin:
1. "Peter was taught not only by the vision, but also by the Word of God; and yet in seeing he saw not, until the Spirit is unto him an interpreter; a most excellent mirror of our slackness."
2. "We are so far from understanding by and by what God will, or to what end he speaketh to us, that many interpretations are scarce sufficient for us."
3. "And we are justly plagued for our sluggishness, in that we profit no better in the Word of the Lord, seeing we are so cold, and have so small desire to inquire."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We should give close attention to the coincidence of time. It is manifestly intended that we are to see here the marks of a providential pre-arrangement."
