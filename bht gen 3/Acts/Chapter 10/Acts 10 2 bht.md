## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That he may have been such, there is nothing in the narrative to preclude: nor does Meyerâ€™s objection apply, that it is not probable that, among the many thousand converts, no Greek proselyte had yet been admitted by baptism into the church."
2. "The great point (ch. xi. 3) which made the present event so important, was, that Cornelius was an uncircumcised person."
3. "From Corneliusâ€™s own narrative, ver. 31, as well as from the analogy of Godâ€™s dealings, we are certainly justified in inferring, with Neander, that the subject of his prayers was that he might be guided into truth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A distinguished proselyte, who had brought his whole household establishment under the hallowing influence of the Jewish faith and the regular observance of its principal seasons of worship."
2. "Thinking it no 'great thing,' if they had 'sown unto him spiritual things, that they should reap his carnal things' (1 Corinthians 9:11)."
3. "Prayed to God alwayâ€”at the stated daily seasons."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "So there may be now persons found in pagan lands who in some unknown way have been taught the evils of idolatry and the necessity of a purer religion, and who may be prepared to receive the gospel."
2. "True piety will always lead a man to seek the salvation of his family."
3. "This is always an effect of piety."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unheard by all but angel ears The good Cornelius knelt alone, Nor dream 'd his prayers and tears Would help a world undone."
