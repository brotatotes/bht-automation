# Acts 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, without any prior communication, seems to have instinctively known that he was the one whom the strangers were seeking. His sudden appearance and direct address must have startled them, causing them to realize that Peter had received some supernatural communication. However, he was still ignorant of the specifics of their errand and would have to learn them through normal means. This is a powerful reminder that we should not judge what God calls pure to be common. True wisdom lies in submitting to the authority of God, regardless of our own understanding or opinions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 21. I am he whom ye seekâ€”This
	seems to have been said without any communication being made to Peter
	regarding the men or their errand.


### John Calvin:
1. "That which God calleth pure, judge not thou to be common."
2. "This is to be wise indeed, when as abandoning all vain confidence, and correcting our stubbornness, the authority of God doth so pull us unto it."
3. "We count nothing right but that which it [the authority of God] prescribeth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This coming down the outside stair, and suddenly standing face to face with the strangers, with whom he was presently to make such intimate acquaintance, is one of the most vivid passages of the narrative."
2. "They must have been much startled by this sudden address. They saw in a moment the man whom they were seeking: they perceived that some supernatural communication had been made to him; and renewed strength must have been given instantaneously to their conviction that they were engaged in no common transaction."
3. "He was entirely ignorant as yet of the details of their errand: and these he was to learn, not supernaturally, but by the usual methods of information."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Cause (Î±Î¹Ï„Î¹Î±). Or reason. Common in this sense. See on Matthew 19:3. 


### John Gill:
1. "The following clause, which were sent unto him from Cornelius, is not in Beza's most ancient copy, nor in the Alexandrian copy, nor in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions."
2. "Without being called by any of the family he came down, and without being informed in that way who the men were inquiring for; it being suggested to him by the Spirit of God, he declared himself to be the person they were seeking after."
3. "What is the cause wherefore ye are come? for that was not intimated to him by the Spirit; it was only told him there were three men seeking him, and he was bid to go with them, without any scruple or hesitation; but what they came for, or he was to go with them about, was not suggested."
