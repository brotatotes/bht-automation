# Acts 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, having learned from his vision the common honor and equality of all mankind in God's sight, begins to put this into practice by refusing excessive reverence from Cornelius. This act of humility by Peter, which stands in contrast to those who claim to have succeeded him, reminds us of Paul and Barnabas's horror at receiving divine homage and the angel in John's vision rejecting such worship. While Peter acknowledges his own humanity and undeserved role as an apostle, we are prompted to consider our Lord's acceptance of worship in the Gospel History.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are at once reminded of the horror expressed by Paul and Barnabas, when the attempt was made at Lystra to give them Divine homage (Acts 14:14), and of the repudiation of this kind of homage by the angel in St. Johnâ€™s vision (Revelation 22:8-9)."
