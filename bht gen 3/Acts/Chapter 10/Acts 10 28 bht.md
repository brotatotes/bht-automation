# Acts 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The custom of avoiding intimacy and social fellowship with uncircumcised individuals was deeply ingrained in Jewish tradition, despite there being no explicit prohibition. This separation reflected the established order, emphasizing the distinction between Jews and Gentiles. However, Peter's revelation from God challenged this practice and led to a shift in his understanding. The breaking down of the barrier between Jews and Gentiles, symbolized by the term common and unclean, allowed for a new era of mutual fellowship and unity. This transformation was a significant journey for Peter.
