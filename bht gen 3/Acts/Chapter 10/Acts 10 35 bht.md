## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In every nation, men who seek after God, who receive His witness of Himself without which He has left no man, and humbly follow His will as far as they know it,â€”these have no extraneous hindrance, such as uncircumcision, placed in their way to Christ, but are capable of being admitted into Godâ€™s church though Gentiles, and as Gentiles." 
2. "It is clearly unreasonable to suppose Peter to have meant, that each heathenâ€™s natural light and moral purity would render him acceptable in the sight of God:â€”for, if so, why should he have proceeded to preach Christ to Cornelius, or indeed any more at all?"
3. "And it is equally unreasonable to find any verbal or doctrinal difficulty in the expression worketh righteousness, or to suppose that righteousness must be taken in its technical and imputed sense, and therefore that he alludes to the state of men after becoming believers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But in every nationâ€”not (observe), in every religion; according to a common distortion of these words."
2. "This being the well-known phraseology of the Old Testament in describing the truly godly man, within the pale of revealed religion..."
3. "...the apostle intended to describe exactly such saintshipâ€”in its internal spirituality and external fruitfulnessâ€”as God had already pronounced to be genuine and approved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Acceptance with God does not depend on the fact of being descended from Abraham, or of possessing external privileges, but on the state of the heart."
2. "He that feareth him...he who is a true worshipper of God, according to the light and privileges which he has, is approved by him, as giving evidence that he is his friend."
3. "Those works were simply an evidence of true piety in the heart; a proof that he feared and loved God, and not a meritorious ground of acceptance."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the fear of God is nothing else but godliness and religion; and righteousness is that equity which men use among themselves, taking heed lest they hurt any man, and studying to do good to all men."
2. "Therefore the first accepting of God, whereby he receiveth us into favor, is altogether free; for there can as yet no respect of works be had, seeing all things are corrupt and wicked."
3. "The worthiness of the works doth not cause them to be had in estimation, but faith, which borroweth that of Christ which is wanting in works."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nationality, even a divinely-appointed nationality, like the Jewish, constitutes, in the sight of God, no essential mark of difference between one man and another."
2. "The true distinction between one man and another, as before God, is moral."
3. "The meaning of this passage is, that all the blessings of Christianity are freely offered to every human hand that is stretched out to receive them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That is to say, a Gentile would not have to become a Jew in order to become a Christian."
2. "On the great Day of Pentecost when he spoke of the promise 'to all those afar off' (Acts 2:39) Peter understood that they must first become Jews and then Christians."
3. "The new idea that now makes a revolution in Peter's outlook is precisely this that Christ can and will save Gentiles like this Cornelius group without their becoming Jews at all."

### John Gill:
1. "he that feareth him; God, not with a slavish fear, or with the fear of punishment to be inflicted by him, with a fear of hell and damnation, with which Cain, Pharaoh, Judas, and even the devils themselves have feared him; nor with an hypocritical fear; but with a godly filial fear; which is a new covenant blessing, springs from the love of God."
2. "is a grace implanted in the soul and regeneration, and includes all true religion, both external and internal; and faith among the rest, without which it is impossible to please God, or do works of righteousness acceptable in his sight."
3. "it should be observed, that though God accepts of such who fear him, and work righteousness from a right principle, and to a right end, without any regard to their being circumcised, or not circumcised, or to their being of this or the other nation, yet their fear of him, and working righteousness, are not the ground of their acceptance; but are to be considered as descriptive of the persons, who are accepted by him in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that, first, reverences God, as great, wise, good, the cause, end, and governor of all things."
2. "Not only avoids all known evil, but endeavours, according to the best light he has, to do all things well."
3. "He is in the favour of God, whether enjoying his written word and ordinances or not."
