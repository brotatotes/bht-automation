# Acts 10:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After His resurrection, Jesus intentionally ate and drank with His disciples to provide important testimony to the reality and identity of His risen Body. These eyewitnesses were specifically chosen by God and had personally witnessed Jesus after He rose from the dead. The absence of a public recognition of Jesus during this time actually strengthens the evidence, showing that the witnesses were not trying to exaggerate or make their case stronger. This certainty of the resurrection was meant to exercise the faith of believers and encourage them to believe the gospel over what their eyes saw.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But this is most improbable from the construction of the sentence, besides that the fact of their having eaten and drunk with Him after His Resurrection gives most important testimony to the reality and identity of His risen Body."
2. "And there is no real difficulty in it: Luke xxiv. 41, 43 and John xxi. 12 give us instances;"
3. "Even if the drinking with Him, is to be pressed, it is no contradiction to Luke xxii. 18, which only refers to one particular kind of drinking."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not to all the people - Not to the nation at large, for this was not necessary in order to establish the truth of his resurrection."
2. "Chosen of God - Appointed by God, or set apart by his authority through Jesus Christ."
3. "Who did eat and drink ... - And by doing this he furnished the clearest possible proof that he was truly risen; that they were not deceived by an illusion of the imagination or by a phantom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Chosen before [œÄœÅŒøŒ∫ŒµœáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÑŒøŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπœÇ] . Only here in New Testament."
2. "The simple verb ceirotonew, to appoint, occurs Acts 14:23; 2 Corinthians 8:19; and originally means to stretch out the hand for the purpose of giving a vote."
3. "The compound pronoun marks them more strongly as belonging to the class of eye - witnesses."

### John Calvin:
1. "And yet, assuredly God used this moderation to a good end. For the certainty of the resurrection was proved by many and firm testimonies, and this was profitable to exercise the faith of the godly, to believe the gospel rather than their eyes." 
2. "Yea, rather, we must endeavor ourselves that our unworthiness and unthankfulness do not darken so great kindness of the Son of God toward us." 
3. "That meat which is taken for the sustenance of the body is concocted and afterward digested; but we know that Christ took this meat to feed our faith, and in this use was it spent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The very fact that no such public recognition of His person is recorded, though at first it might have seemed to detract from the evidence of His resurrection, but serves to enhance it, by showing how free the witnesses of this event were from a disposition to exaggerate or make their case stronger than it was in fact."
2. "Witnesses, namely those who had been previously appointed by God."
3. "The facts here stated belong to the period of the Great Forty Days. Both St. Luke and St. John give instances."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter is evidently stating the thing as it happened and not trying to make a convincing story by saying that both friends and foes saw him after his resurrection."
2. "But at any rate Peter makes it clear that it was no hallucination or ghost, but Jesus himself whom they saw after he rose from the dead."
3. "Furneaux dares to think that the disciples misunderstood Jesus about eating after the resurrection. But that is to deny the testimony merely because we cannot explain the transition state of the body of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Not to all the people,.... Of the Jews, who crucified him; nor to the whole body of the Christians, though at one time to a large number, even five hundred brethren at once..." 
2. "even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead; namely, to the apostles, with whom he familiarly conversed by times, for the space of forty days after his resurrection..." 
3. "and though drinking is not mentioned, it is included in eating, as in Luke 7:36 wherefore there is no need to connect the last clause, 'after he rose from the dead', with the latter part of the preceding verse, as some do, on that account."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not now to all the people ‚Äî As before his death." 
2. "to us who did eat and drink with him." 
3. "conversed familiarly and continually with him, in the time of his ministry."
