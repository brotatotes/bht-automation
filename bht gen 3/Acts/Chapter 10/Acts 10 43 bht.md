# Acts 10:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The message that whoever believes in Jesus receives forgiveness of sins is not to be nitpicked for literal precision. The Old Testament, along with the sacrifices and the prophetic declarations, clearly pointed to the remission of sins through faith in Him. This declaration applies universally, irrespective of race, and is supported by both the prophets and the Jews. The power and perfection of Christ, embodied in His name, are what believers are called to embrace and confess for the full forgiveness of their sins.
