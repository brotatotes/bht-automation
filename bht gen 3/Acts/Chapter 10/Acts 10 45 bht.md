# Acts 10:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers of the circumcision were astonished because they had not anticipated the pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon the Gentiles. This miraculous event of speaking in tongues, which had previously only been witnessed among the Jews, was now being experienced by both Jews and Gentiles alike. The distinction between Jewish and Gentile Christians is evident as Luke introduces these two groups, with the inclusion of the Gentiles being a surprising revelation for the Jews who had not expected such a universal outpouring.
