# Acts 10:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit precluded the question of circumcision before baptism for Gentiles. It emphasized the two parts of baptism: the spiritual aspect represented by the Spirit and the physical aspect symbolized by water. The argument was that since Gentiles had received the greater gift of the Spirit, denying them the lesser gift of water baptism would be inconsistent. This narrative shows that while God can give spiritual gifts apart from rituals, divine ordinances still hold significance.
