# Acts 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The news from Caesarea spread quickly throughout Judea, but many Jewish Christians were incredulous about the acceptance of Gentiles into the church. They argued fiercely to bring the Gentiles under Jewish customs and traditions, for the manner in which the Gentiles were called seemed contrary to reason. The apostles and brethren, however, must have rejoiced in the thought that the Gospel had found acceptance in other hearts. Despite their initial confusion, they understood that the Gentiles had received the Holy Spirit and His extraordinary gifts, just as they had received His grace.
