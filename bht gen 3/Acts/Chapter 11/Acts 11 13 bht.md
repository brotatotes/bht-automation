# Acts 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The visions of Peter and Cornelius differ in their detail: Peter prays in Joppa, while Cornelius sees the angel standing in his house. This specificity bolsters Cornelius' case, as it portrays a direct encounter in his own home. Peter avoids naming Cornelius in his speech, instead focusing on the category of uncircumcised men. The angel's appearance at Cornelius' house serves as validation for Peter and the six brethren who followed God's orders.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difference between the vision of Cornelius and that of Peter is here again strikingly marked: while the latter is merely â€˜praying in the city of Joppa,â€™ no place nor circumstance being named, the former sees the angel â€˜standing in his house.â€™"
2. "Notice also that Peter never names Cornelius in his speech because he, his character and person, was absorbed in the category to which he belonged, that of men uncircumcised."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 13. seen an angelâ€”literally,
	"the angel," for the rumor took that definite shape.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. An angel. It has the definite article : "the angel," mentioned in ch. 10.


### Philip Schaff:

2. "If the angel, too, appeared in his very house, this rendered the case much stronger."
3. "It seems as if these words rang in Peterâ€™s ears."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:

2. "He looked upon him as an extraordinary person, as sent to him from God, and therefore obeyed the heavenly vision."
3. "The clause, 'in his house', is very appropriately put; for since an angel had entered into his house, it could not be criminal in Peter, and the six brethren, to follow him."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When comparing the visions of Peter and Cornelius, a clear distinction is evident. Peter's vision occurred while he was praying in the city of Joppa, whereas Cornelius saw the angel standing in his house. The specificity of Cornelius' vision strengthens the case for him, as it was a direct encounter in his own home. It is noteworthy that Peter never mentions Cornelius by name in his speech, focusing instead on the broader category to which he belonged - that of uncircumcised men. Perhaps Peter wanted to emphasize that he did not enter Cornelius' house of his own accord, but rather followed God's direct orders. The significance of the angel's appearance in Cornelius' house cannot be overlooked, as it justified Peter and the six brethren following him.
