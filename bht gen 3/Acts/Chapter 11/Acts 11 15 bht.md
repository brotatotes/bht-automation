# Acts 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Peter began to speak, he referred to the uncircumcised man he had been divinely sent to, without mentioning Cornelius by name or his high position. He did not defend his actions based on his words, but on what God had done. This interruption in Peter's speech revealed that he had more to say, but was prevented from doing so. By using the phrase at the beginning, Peter draws a parallel to the beginning of the new dispensation, just as it was on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit fell on them with visible manifestations and gifts.
