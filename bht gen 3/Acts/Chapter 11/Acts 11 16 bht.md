# Acts 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God included the Gentiles by pouring out the Holy Spirit on them, putting them on the same level as the believers. Refusing water baptism as a symbol for the Gentiles would hinder God. Peter understands that water baptism is a symbol of spiritual baptism in the heart. He recalls the words of Jesus, realizing their new meaning and sees the Gentiles' experience of the greater spiritual baptism. The Gentiles cannot be denied the lesser water baptism, as they have already received the greater baptism of the Spirit.
