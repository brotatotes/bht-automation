# Acts 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The presence of they of the circumcision reveals a division between Jewish Christians who clung to circumcision and Gentile believers. Jealousy arose from their belief that circumcision acted as a barrier between them. Their protest against the acceptance of the apostles implies that Peter held no special supremacy or papal authority. The controversy indicates that early Christians did not attribute the infallible authority claimed by Roman Catholics to Peter. The debate would not have occurred if Peter possessed supreme decision-making power.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is one of the circumstances which show conclusively that the apostles and early Christians did not regard Peter as having any particular supremacy over the church, or as being in any special sense the vicar of Christ upon earth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse talks about a group of people who were of the circumcision, which refers to Jewish Christians who strongly held onto their Jewish traditions, particularly circumcision, and saw it as a dividing factor between themselves and the Gentile believers. These individuals were likely jealous of the acceptance and embrace of the apostles, which indicated that Peter, as the leader of the apostles, was not viewed as a pope or overlord with supreme authority. This incident highlights that the early Christians did not recognize Peter's supposed superiority and did not submit to his decisions as the Roman Catholics claim. The journey mentioned in the verse was significant and debated, implying that if Peter truly had infallible authority, such a controversy would not have arisen. The issue stemmed from these zealous circumcision advocates who not only made circumcision a condition for church fellowship but also for normal social interactions. Their stubbornness indicates the common association of error with obstinacy.
