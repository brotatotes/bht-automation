## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They . . . of the circumcision‚Äînot the Jewish Christians generally, for here there were no other."
2. "From their jealousy for 'the middle wall of partition' which circumcision raised between Jew and Gentile."
3. "They doubtless embraced apostles as well as others."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is one of the circumstances which show conclusively that the apostles and early Christians did not regard Peter as having any particular supremacy over the church, or as being in any special sense the vicar of Christ upon earth."
2. "If he had been regarded as having the authority which the Roman Catholics claim for him, they would have submitted at once to what he had thought proper to do."
3. "But the earliest Christians had no such idea of Peter‚Äôs so-called authority. This claim for Peter is not only opposed to this place, but to every part of the New Testament."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. They of the circumcision. See on ch. Acts 5:45.


### John Calvin:
1. "Obstinacy doth for the most part accompany error."
2. "What letteth them then from embracing them, that they may be coupled together under the government of one God?"
3. "And why should not those grow together into one body who make the Messiah of God their head?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By this is expressed, not simply that they were Jews, but that they had a strong and deep feeling regarding the necessity of circumcision." 
2. "And indeed now, for the first time, there were within the Church the two strongly-contrasted elements of Jewish and Gentile Christianity." 
3. "The subject, however, was one of serious personal debate: and it occurs to us naturally to remark that this could not have taken place on so serious a religious question, if the power of supreme infallible decision had belonged to St. Peter as the first of the Popes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They that were of the circumcision (Œø ŒµŒ∫ œÄŒµœÅŒπœÑŒøŒºŒ∑œÇ)... The phrase in Acts 10:46 is confined to the six brethren with Peter in Caesarea (Acts 11:12). All the disciples in Jerusalem were Jews so that it can hardly mean the whole body."
2. "The objectors probably did not know of Peter's vision at Joppa, but only of the revolutionary conduct of Peter in Caesarea. These extremists who spoke probably had abundant sympathy in their protest."
3. "Peter is at once put on the defensive as the contention went on. It is plain that Peter was not regarded as any kind of pope or overlord."

### John Gill:
1. "they that were of the circumcision, which phrase designs not only the circumcised Jews that believed in Christ, but those of them, who were most strenuous for circumcision, and made it not only a bar of church communion, but even of civil conversation."
2. "these contended with him; litigated the point, disputed the matter with him, complained against him, and quarrelled with him."
3. "Epiphanius says that Cerinthus, that arch-heretic, was at the head of this contention."
