### Albert Barnes:
1. "From this circumstance it might have happened that they were led more particularly to address the Grecians who were in Antioch."
2. "But to them the gospel had been already preached; and yet in this place it is evidently the intention of Luke to affirm that the people of Cyprus and Cyrene preached to those who were not Jews."
