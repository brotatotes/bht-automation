## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For he was a good manâ€”The sense of 'good' here is plainly 'large-hearted,' 'liberal-minded,' rising above narrow Jewish sectarianism, and that because, as the historian adds, he was 'full of the Holy Ghost and of faith.'" 
2. "This proceeding of Barnabas, so full of wisdom, love, and zeal, was blessed to the great increase of the Christian community in that important city." 
3. "ANTIOCH BECOMES THE HONORED BIRTHPLACE OF THE TERM CHRISTIAN."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We should not undervalue talent, eloquence, or learning in the ministry, but we may remark that humble piety will often do more in the conversion of souls than the most splendid talents."
2. "The real power of a minister is concentrated in this, and without this his ministry will be barrenness and a curse. There is nothing on the earth so mighty as goodness."
3. "These qualifications should be sought by the ministry of the gospel...a kind, tender, benevolent heart; devoted piety; the fulness of the Spiritâ€™s influence; and strong, unwavering confidence in the promises and power of God."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Caused him to rejoice in their success."

### John Calvin:
1. "For all those are condemned of ungodliness and malice who envy other menâ€™s labors, and are grieved when they see the same have good success."
2. "That, abandoning the affections of the flesh, he did, with all his heart, embrace godliness, having the Spirit to be his guide."
3. "Thus doth the building of the Church go forward when one doth help another with mutual consent, and one doth gently allow that which another hath begun."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word â€˜goodâ€™ does not mean merely that Barnabas was a man of earnest religious character. Rather it denotes that he was a man of a genial, generous, charitable, and candid disposition."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was a really good man (Î±Î³Î±Î¸Î¿Ï‚). See Romans 5:7 for distinction between Î±Î³Î±Î¸Î¿Ï‚ and Î´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Î¿Ï‚, righteous, where Î±Î³Î±Î¸Î¿Ï‚ ranks higher than Î´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Î¿Ï‚."
2. "Besides, Barnabas was full of the Holy Spirit (like Peter) and of faith and so willing to follow the leading of God's Spirit and take some risks."
