## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Speaking from probability, it seems very unlikely that any considerable portion of time should have been spent by him before the great work of his ministry began." 
2. "Even supposing him during this retirement to have preached in Syria and Cilicia,â€”judging by the analogy of his subsequent journeys, a few months at the most would have sufficed for this."
3. "For my own view, see Introduction to Acts,Â§6."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As co-pastors, for the time being, of the Church there, they so labored that the Gospel, even in that great and many-sided community, achieved for itself a name which will live and be gloried in as long as this world lasts, as the symbol of all that is most precious to the fallen family of man: 'The disciples were called CHRISTIANS first in Antioch.'" 
2. "This name originated not within, but without, the Church; not with their Jewish enemies, by whom they were styled 'Nazarenes,' but with the heathen in Antioch, and with the Romans, not the Greeks there."
3. "It was not at first used in a good sense... but as it was a noble testimony to the light in which the Church regarded Christâ€”honoring Him as their only Lord and Saviour, dwelling continually on His name, and glorying in itâ€”so it was felt to be too apposite and beautiful to be allowed to die."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why Barnabas sought Saul is not known. It is probable, however, that it was owing to the remarkable success which he had in Antioch."

3. "Therefore, Barnabas is no whit afraid lest Paul do any whit debase him by his coming, so he glorify Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
