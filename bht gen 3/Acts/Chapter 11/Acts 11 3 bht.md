# Acts 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These objectors have no qualms about demanding an explanation from Peter, even though he is the foremost among the apostles. Interestingly, Peter does not insinuate any disrespect towards his authority in response to this demand, which is evidence that such authority was unknown to both the complainers and himself. The objection is not about Peter preaching to the Gentiles, but rather about him going into the house of Cornelius and eating with them, thus violating his supposed obligations as a Jew. This act of eating with uncircumcised men is viewed contemptuously by the objectors.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Men uncircumcised [Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ±œÇ Œ±Œ∫œÅŒøŒ≤œÖœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩ ŒµœáŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ] . An indignant expression. See Ephesians 2:11.


### John Calvin:
1. "Doctrine, indeed, if it be of God, is placed above the chance and die of man‚Äôs judgment; but because the Lord will have prophecy judged, his servants must not refuse this condition, that they prove themselves to be such as they will be accounted." 
2. "This is assuredly wonderful goodness of God, who maketh men ministers of life, who have nothing but matter of death in themselves, and which are not only subject to death in themselves, but are also deadly to others."
3. "The filthy unthankfulness of the world betrayeth itself in this point, which, loathing true and certain salvation offered unto it, and forsaking it when it lieth at the feet, doth imagine divers and vain salvations, in seeking which, it had rather gape being hungry, than to be filled with the grace of God which meeteth it and is present."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was not the communicating the Gospel to the Gentiles which they grudged, but the communicating it in such a way as to do violence to the most cherished principles of the past."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou wentest in (ŒµŒπœÉŒ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒµœÇ). Direct form, but Westcott and Hort have it ŒµŒπœÉŒ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ (he went in), indirect form. So with œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÜŒ±Œ≥ŒµœÇ (didst eat) and œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÜŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒΩ (did eat). The direct is more vivid."
2. "Men uncircumcised (Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ±œÇ Œ±Œ∫œÅŒøŒ≤œÖœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩ ŒµœáŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ). 'Men having uncircumcision.' It is a contemptuous expression."
3. "They did not object to Peter's preaching to the Gentiles, but to his going into the house of Cornelius and eating with them, violating his supposed obligations as a Jew."

### John Gill:
1. "Saying, thou wentest into men uncircumcised,.... Into the houses of such, and lodged with them, and familiarly conversed with them." 
2. "and didst eat with them; which, according to the traditions of the Jews, were unlawful..."
3. "they say nothing about his preaching to them, and baptizing them, because these were so manifestly agreeable to the commission of Christ in Matthew 28:19, and yet how these could be without the other, is not easy to say."
