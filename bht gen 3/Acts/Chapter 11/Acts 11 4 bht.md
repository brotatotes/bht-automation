## BHT:
Peter's speech began with a deliberate and detailed narrative, expounding graphically to give the full story of God's dealings with him in a methodical and orderly manner. Luke considered this defense of Peter important, preserving the marks of authenticity. By giving a simple and unvarnished statement of the facts, Peter disarmed prejudice and silenced opposition, as it often happens when a careful statement of the facts is presented. The telling of the story itself was proof of the Divine teaching in this case, which was far beyond any argument.
