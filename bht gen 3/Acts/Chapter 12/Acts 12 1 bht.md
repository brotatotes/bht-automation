# Acts 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of King Herod Agrippa I, there was a visit from Barnabas and Saul, likely occurring around the time of Agrippa's death. Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the Great, ruled over his father's dominions for three years until his death in A.D. 44. This marked the first instance of political power being used against the disciples since Pilate, resulting in the most significant danger the Church of Christ had faced thus far. However, the persecution was not as severe as it could have been, as the Lord restrained their enemies from inflicting greater harm.

- Attempt 1 BHT: During the time of King Herod Agrippa I, there was a visit from Barnabas and Saul, likely occurring near or after the death of Herod. Herod Agrippa I, the grandson of Herod the Great and son of Aristobulus and Berenice, ruled over his father's dominions for three years until his death in A.D. 44. He was the first ruler, after Pilate, to use political power against the disciples, and it marked a significant danger to the Church of Christ. While the persecution was severe, it was not as extreme as it could have been, as the Lord spared His sheep from further harm. Nonetheless, this persecution was a turning point, as the rulers in Jerusalem were unable to organize further general persecutions against the Christians.
