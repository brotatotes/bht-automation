# Acts 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Rhoda confidently affirmed that Peter was at the door, some of the disciples found it hard to believe and deemed her mad. Their response was not characterized by hard unbelief, but rather a lack of perception about the proximity of heaven and earth and the role of guardian angels. According to the popular Jewish belief, it was thought that each person had their own guardian angel who could appear in their likeness. Although scripture is silent on this matter, the knowledge of these blessed spirits brings comfort to believers in their battles with evil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No other rendering but his angel will suit the sense."
2. "Our Lord plainly asserts the doctrine of guardian angels."
3. "From this passage we find not only that such was believed to be the case, but that it was supposed that such angel occasionally appeared in the semblance (seeing that he spoke with the voice) of the person himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou art mad‚Äîone of those exclamations which one can hardly resist on hearing what seems far 'too good to be true.'" 
2. "Though this had been the burden of their fervent prayers... they dispute themselves out of it as a thing incredible."
3. "This... argues not so much hard unbelief as that kind of it incident to the best in this land of shadows, which perceives not so clearly as it might how very near heaven and earth, the Lord and His praying people, are to each other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians are often surprised even when their prayers are answered. They are overwhelmed and amazed at the success of their own petitions, and are slow to believe that the very thing for which they have sought could be granted." 
2. "Christians are often engaged in some unprofitable controversy when they should hasten to catch the first tokens of divine favor, and open their arms to welcome the proofs that God has heard their prayers." 
3. "The expression 'It is his angel' may mean that they supposed that the 'tutelary guardian,' or angel appointed to attend Peter, had come to announce something respecting him, and that he had assumed the voice and form of Peter in order to make them certain that he came from him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Constantly affirmed [Œ¥ŒπŒπœÉœáœÖœÅŒπŒ∂ŒµœÑŒø] . Better, confidently affirmed; constant is used in its older sense of consistent. The verb contains two ideas : strong assertion [ŒπœÉœáœÖœÇ] , and holding to the assertion through all contradiction [Œ¥ŒπŒ±] ; hence, she strongly and consistently asserted."
2. "Angel. Guardian angel, according to the popular belief among the Jews that every individual has his guardian angel..."

2. "The whole host of heaven doth watch for the safety of the Church; and that as necessity of time requireth sometimes one angel, sometimes more do defend us with their aid."
3. "Assuredly, this is inestimable goodness of God, in that he saith that the angels, who are the beams of his brightness, are our ministers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole question of the ‚Äòunseen ministry of angels‚Äô is a very mysterious one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou art mad." 
2. "She confidently affirmed... The girl stuck to her statement."
