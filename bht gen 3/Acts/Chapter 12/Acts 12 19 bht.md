# Acts 12:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After examining the keepers and commanding their execution, Herod's futile attempt to suppress the gospel backfired. In contrast, the message continued to flourish despite persecution. As Herod's miserable end forced him to retreat from Judea to Caesarea, it became evident that the power of human authority is fleeting compared to the enduring impact of God's kingdom. The failed plot to silence Peter underscores the triumph of the gospel and the limitations of earthly rulers.

	put to death‚ÄîImpotent vengeance!"
