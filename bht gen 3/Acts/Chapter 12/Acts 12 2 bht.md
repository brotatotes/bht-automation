# Acts 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
James, the son of Zebedee and one of the sons of thunder, was the first apostle to be martyred. His death is described briefly as being killed with a sword, with little detail given compared to the account of Stephen's martyrdom. James' desire to call down fire on the inhospitable Samaritans and his fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy of drinking the cup of suffering and being baptized with the same baptism suggest the importance of living as a martyr to die well.
