- Attempt 1 BHT: The people, mostly heathens, assembled and gave a loud applause, repeating their flattering adulation to gain Herod's favor. They proclaimed him a god, not in reference to the Supreme Being, but in the pagan sense of emperor worship. This praise pleased Herod's vanity, and he relished in the affirmation of the crowd, despite being aware of his impending death. In fact, the account of Herod's death in Josephus is remarkably similar, and other cases of such deaths have occurred throughout history. Nevertheless, Luke's account of this event is more consistent and credible than that of the Jewish historian.
