## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of the mission would be very soon accomplished: Saul would naturally not remain longer in Jerusalem than was unavoidable, and would court no publicity."
2. "Hence there seems an additional reason for placing the visit after Herod's death: for, of all the persons whose execution would be pleasing to the Jews, Saul would hold the foremost place."
3. "Our verse is probably inserted as a note of passage from the last recorded fact of Barnabas and Saul to their being found at Antioch."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem‚Äîwhere, it thus appears, they had remained during all this persecution." 
2. "took with them John . . . Mark‚Äî(See on Acts 12:1), not to be confounded with the second Evangelist, as is often done." 
3. "As his uncle was Barnabas, so his spiritual father was Peter (Acts 12:1- :)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When they had fulfilled their ministry - When they had accomplished the purpose for which they had been sent there; that is, to deposit the alms of the church at Antioch in the hands of the eiders of the churches."
2. "The labors of the other apostles are, after this, seldom referred to in this book, and the attention is fixed almost entirely on the trials and travels of the great apostle of the Gentiles."
3. "In that God and Saviour who then defended the church, we may still confide, and may be assured that he who was then its friend has it still 'engraved on the palms of his hands,' and designs that it shall extend until it fills the earth with light and salvation."

### John Calvin:
1. "The ministry which Luke saith Barnabas and Paul did finish, must be referred unto the alms, whereof mention was made before."
2. "The carrying of this money was committed to Barnabas and Paul."
3. "He addeth, that they took with them John, whose surname was Mark, whose mother was honorably commended before, that he might keep them company, who was afterward, as we shall see, a cause of grievous and dangerous [hurtful] discord between them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Barnabas and Saul, after the prediction of Agabus, had been sent from Antioch to Judea with alms for the poor saints of Jerusalem and the churches of Palestine."
2. "It seems most probable that they had sojourned during the Passover at Jerusalem, and had been eye-witnesses of the events related in this chapter."
3. "Chrysostom remarks that the writer of the ‚ÄòActs‚Äô still mentions Barnabas first, for Paul was not yet famous; he had not as yet wrought any sign."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The ministration (Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒπŒ±ŒΩ) referred to is that in Acts 11:29 which may have taken place, in point of time, after the death of Herod."
2. "Taking along (œÄŒ±œÅŒ±) with (œÉœÖŒΩ) them, John Mark from Jerusalem (Acts 12:12) to Antioch (Acts 13:1)."
3. "The aorist participle does not express subsequent action as Rackham here argues."
