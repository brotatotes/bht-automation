# Acts 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the Passover, Herod, in his desire to uphold Jewish customs, did not want to execute a prisoner. So, he delivered Peter to four quaternions of soldiers, each consisting of four soldiers. This was in accordance with the Roman practice of dividing the night into four watches, which the Jews followed. The sixteen soldiers ensured Peter's tight custody. Herod planned to bring him forth for trial after the Passover festival, not wanting to defile the sacred days. This providential delay allowed for the fervent prayers of the church and eventually led to Peter's release.
