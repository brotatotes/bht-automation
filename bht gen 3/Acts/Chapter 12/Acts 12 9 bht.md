# Acts 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Unaware of the reality, Peter followed the angel's instructions, not fully comprehending that he was being freed from prison. He thought it was simply a vision, as if his mind was playing tricks on him, rather than a tangible experience. Oblivious to the true nature of his deliverance, Peter willingly obeyed the angel's command, without questioning or reasoning, and emerged from the prison cell to follow wherever the angel led him. The astonishing nature of the events made Peter unsure if it was all real or if he was caught in a dream or trance.
