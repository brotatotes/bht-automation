# Acts 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, not realizing that his deliverance was actually happening, followed the angel's instructions without hesitation. He obeyed willingly and without questioning, content with the commandment of the angel alone. Even though he thought it might be a vision, he acted in faith, not knowing if what was happening was true or not. The whole experience was so incredible and astonishing to him that he couldn't be sure if it was real or just a dream-like vision. But regardless, he followed the angel and went out, stepping into the miraculous deliverance that awaited him.
