## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Symeon that was called Niger] Nothing is known of him. From his appellation of Niger, he may have been an African proselyte."
2. "Lucius] A Lucius, probably the same person, is mentioned Rom. xvi. 21 as a 'kinsman' of Paul."
3. "Manaen] The same name with Menahem the king of Israel, 2 Kings xv. 14. A certain Essene, of this name, foretold to Herod the Great, when a boy going to school, that he should be king of the Jews."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Simeon . . . Nigerâ€”of whom nothing is known."
2. "How differently did these two foster brothers turn outâ€”the one, abandoned to a licentious life and stained with the blood of the most distinguished of God's prophets, though not without his fits of reformation and seasons of remorse; the other, a devoted disciple of the Lord Jesus and prophet of the Church at Antioch! But this is only what may be seen in every age."
3. "and Saulâ€”last of all, but soon to become first. Henceforward this book is almost exclusively occupied with him; and his impress on the New Testament, on Christendom, and on the world is paramount."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Teachers are several times mentioned in the New Testament as an order of ministers... Their precise rank and duty are not known." 
2. "Barnabas was a preacher... it is not improbable that the names 'prophets and teachers' here simply designate the preachers of the gospel." 
3. "He [Saul] is mentioned here among the 'prophets and teachers,' showing that these words denote 'ministers of the gospel' in general, without reference to any particular order or rank."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Attempts have been made to identify him with Luke the evangelist; but the name Lucas is an abbreviation of Lucanus, and not of Lucius."
2. "The mention of the evangelist's name here is not in accord with his usual practice, since he nowhere mentions his own name, either in the Gospel or in the Acts."
3. "Of the five here named, four are known to be Jews; and therefore, probably, Lucius was also a Jew from Cyrene, where Jews are known to have abounded."

### John Calvin:
1. "His calling was, as it were, a key whereby God opened to us the kingdom of heaven."
2. "The wall of separation is taken away, that both those who were far off and those which were nigh hand may be reconciled to God; and that being gathered under one head, they may grow together to be one body."
3. "So even in our time God doth so enrich certain churches more than others, that they be seminaries to spread abroad the doctrine of the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Church of the first days during the lifetime of the apostles possessed certain supernatural gifts... when the apostles and the first generation of believers had passed away, these powers... seem to have ceased.".
2. "The 'prophets' and 'teachers' here spoken of were men to whom the power was at times given of communicating truths connected with the religion of Jesus under a Divine inspiration, and occasionally of predicting future events."
3. "No one in the early Church exercised a more noble influence than the Cypriote Barnabas; no one laboured more earnestly or more successfully to carry out his Risen Masterâ€™s plans."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Now a strong organization there. Luke here begins the second part of Acts with Antioch as the centre of operations, no longer Jerusalem."
2. "All prophets were teachers, but not all teachers were prophets who were fore-speakers of God."
3. "These are clearly the outstanding men in the great Greek church in Antioch."

### John Gill:
1. "who were both prophets and teachers, though these are sometimes distinguished"
2. "he appears to be a Jew, who by the Romans was called Niger; very likely from the blackness of his complexion"
3. "Of this Menahem, and of his going into the king's service, mention is made elsewhere... this Manaen, as Dr. Lightfoot conjectures, might be the son of him, and called after his name"

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 13:1, we see a diverse group of individuals mentioned, including Symeon called Niger, Lucius, Manaen, Simeon, and Saul. While little is known about Symeon called Niger, it is possible that he was an African proselyte. Lucius, who is possibly the same person mentioned in Romans 16:21, was considered a kinsman of Paul. Manaen's name is reminiscent of Menahem, the king of Israel, and there is speculation that he may have been an Essene prophet. Notably, Simeon was a foster brother of Herod the Great, who turned out to be a devoted disciple of Jesus and a prophet in the Church at Antioch, a clear example of how people can be transformed. Finally, Saul, who later becomes Paul, is mentioned last but is set to play a significant role in the New Testament and the emergence of Christianity. These individuals, including Barnabas, who is mentioned later, were among the noteworthy figures in the Greek church in Antioch, which became a key center for the spread of the gospel.
