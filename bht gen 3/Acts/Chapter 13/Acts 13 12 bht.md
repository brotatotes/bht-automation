# Acts 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amazed at the divine power accompanying the teaching of the Apostle, the deputy gives himself up to it. Being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord and the miraculous blindness that immediately followed, Sergius Paulus believes. His faith is not seen simply as a revenue-seeking belief, but rather, his joining the Christian brotherhood is evidence that the gospel was not confined to the poor and obscure. The word doctrine here denotes the wonderful effects connected with the teaching. While we do not know the exact fruit or duration of this conversion, Sergius Paulus' baptism is a natural inference.
