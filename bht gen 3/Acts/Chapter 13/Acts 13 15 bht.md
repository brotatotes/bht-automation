# Acts 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul stood up in the synagogue, he beckoned with his hand to get the attention of the people. The rulers of the synagogue, responsible for directing the worship, sent a message to Paul and Barnabas, assuming they would want to address their fellow Jews. This was a common practice, inviting speakers with any word of exhortation or comfort. It seems that the divisions of the law and prophets were not yet arranged as they would later be when they were read in the synagogues.
