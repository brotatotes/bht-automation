## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The contents of this speech (vv. 16‚Äì41) may be thus arranged: I. Recapitulation of God‚Äôs ancient deliverances of His people and mercies towards them, ending with His crowning mercy, the sending of the Deliverer and promised Son of David (vv. 16‚Äì25)." 
2. "II. The history of the rejection of Jesus by the Jews, and of God‚Äôs fulfilment of His promise by raising Him from the dead (vv. 26‚Äì37)." 
3. "III. The personal application of this to all present,‚Äîthe announcement to them of justification by faith in Jesus, and solemn warning against the rejection of Him."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "Ye that fear God - Probably proselytes of the gate, who had not yet been circumcised, but who had renounced idolatry, and were accustomed to worship with them in their synagogues."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Beckoning. See on ch. Acts 12:17. 
Men of Israel. See on ch. Acts 3:12.


### John Calvin:
1. "This is the drift of the first part of the sermon: that this is the principal point of the law and the foundation of God‚Äôs covenant, that they have Christ for their Captain and Governor, that he may restore all things among them; that without him religion cannot stand, and that they shall be most miserable without him." 
2. "Because Paul knew that there were many bastardly sons of Abraham, or such as were grown out of kind, he calleth the Jews to whom he speaketh by a double name...show yourselves to be no bastardly seed."
3. "Let us learn by this that it is not a fault common to one age only, that good and sincere worshippers being mixed with hypocrites, have the name of the Church common among them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‚ÄòMen of Israel,‚Äô that is, the Jews and proselytes worshipping in the congregation."
2. "‚ÄòThose that fear God‚Äô included those Gentile natives of Pisidia and strangers who had given up idol-worship, and who worshipped the God of Israel, without, however, being circumcised."
3. "They are usually termed ‚Äòproselytes of the gate.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul is the leader now and the more gifted speaker (Acts 14:12), so that he responds to the courteous invitation of the rulers."
2. "Evidently large numbers of these Gentiles like Cornelius in Caesarea were present. They offered Paul a great opportunity for reaching the purely pagan Gentiles."
3. "It is possible that Paul here based his sermon on the passages of the law and the prophets that had just been read. He uses two words from the LXX, one in verse Acts 13:19 from Deuteronomy 1:31 ŒµœÑœÅŒøœÜŒøœÜŒøœÅŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ (as a nursing-father bare he them), the reading of many old MSS. and the one preferred by the American Committee, the other in verse Acts 13:17 from Isaiah 1:2 œÖœàœâœÉŒµŒΩ (exalted)."

### John Gill:
1. "Men of Israel; by whom are meant the proper Jews, the natural descendants of Jacob, whose name was Israel; this was accounted a very honourable character..." (Acts 13:16).
2. "...by these are meant, not Jews by birth, but proselytes, devout and religious men from among the Gentiles; who were proselyted to the Jewish religion, and attended with them in their synagogues on religious worship..." (Acts 13:16).
3. "Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways...of what proselyte is it 'said blessed?' of the proselyte who is a proselyte of righteousness, and not of the Cuthites..." (Acts 13:16).

### John Wesley:
1. Ye that fear God ‚Äî Whether proselytes or heathens.
