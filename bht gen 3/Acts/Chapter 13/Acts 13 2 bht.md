## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As they ministered] The word in the original is that generally used to express the priestly service among the Jews, to which now had succeeded that of the prophets and teachers in the Christian church: ministering is therefore the only word adequate to render it, as A.V."
2. "The apostolic office terminated with the apostolic times, and by its very nature, admitted not of continuance: the episcopal office, in its ordinary sense, sprung up after the apostolic times: and the two are entirely distinct."
3. "The confusion of the two belongs to that unsafe and slippery ground in church matters, the only logical refuge from which is in the traditional system of Rome."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word denotes the performance of official duties of any kind, and was used to express the priestly functions under the Old Testament. Here it signifies the corresponding ministrations of the Christian Church."
2. "As this was done in other cases on special occasions, it is not improbable that they had been led to expect some such prophetic announcement at this time."
3. "Note.‚ÄîWhile the personality of the Holy Ghost is manifest from this language, His supreme divinity will appear equally so by comparing it with Hebrews 5:4."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As they ministered to the Lord means as they were engaged in prayer to the Lord, or as they were engaged in divine service."
2. "Separate me means to set apart to me, or for my service. It does not mean to ordain, but simply to designate, or appoint to this specific work."
3. "The work whereunto I have called them was that of preaching the gospel in the regions round about Antioch. It was not any permanent office in the church, but was a temporary designation to a missionary enterprise in extending the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ministered [ŒªŒµŒπœÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒøœÖŒΩœÑœâŒΩ] . See on the kindred noun ministration, Luke 1:23... Here, of the performance of Christian worship. Our word liturgy is derived from it."
2. "Separate. The Greek adds dh, now, which is not rendered by A. V. or Rev. It gives precision and emphasis to the command, implying that it is for a special purpose, and to be obeyed at the time."
3. "Compare Luke 2:15; Acts 14:36; 1 Corinthians 6:20."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ‚Äôs Church hath another priesthood, to wit that every man may offer himself and his to God; and that the public ministers may sacrifice to God, souls, with the spiritual sword of the gospel." 
2. "God publisheth that his decree, which was as yet known to a few, and that with a public commandment, and he commandeth that it be sealed with the solemn subscription of the Church." 
3. "The Holy Ghost is God indeed, whose authority is sufficient to choose pastors, and who hath the chief rule in choosing them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The writer of the 'Acts' here uses it to express generally the Christian divine service, including prayer, the singing of hymns and psalms, the office of preaching, the whole crowned by the solemn partaking of the Lord‚Äôs Supper."
2. "The Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them."
3. "Here we may see a proof of the divinity of the Holy Ghost... showing that He is coequal with God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Genitive absolute of ŒªŒµŒπœÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥Œµœâ, old verb, used of the Attic orators who served the state at their own cost ŒªŒµœâœÇ or ŒªŒ±ŒøœÇ, people, and ŒµœÅŒ≥ŒøŒΩ, work or service)." 
2. "Fasting was not obligatory on the Christians, but they were facing a great emergency in giving the gospel to the Gentile world."
3. "Here ŒµŒπœÇ has to be repeated from ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø ŒµœÅŒ≥ŒøŒΩ just before, 'for which' as Jesus sent the twelve and the seventy in pairs, so here."

### John Gill:
1. "The work which the Holy Ghost had appointed, and called them to before this, was to go and preach the Gospel among the Gentiles, distinct from the Jews."
2. "This shows the Spirit to be a person, since speaking and commanding in an authoritative way, and calling to a work, are ascribed unto him."
3. "A separation to it is ordered for himself, for his service, honour, and glory; he does not say separate them to the Lord, or to God, but to me."

### John Wesley:
1. "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." (Acts 13:2)
2. "St. Paul was ordained long before, and that not of men, neither by man: it was only inducting him to the province for which our Lord had appointed him from the beginning, and which was now revealed to the prophets and teachers."
3. "In consequence of this they fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on them, a rite which was used not in ordination only, but in blessing, and on many other occasions."
