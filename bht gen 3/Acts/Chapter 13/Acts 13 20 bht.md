# Acts 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After about four hundred and fifty years, the Israelites received judges until Samuel, either referring to the entire period or the elapsed time from the covenant with Abraham. Samuel, being the last judge and the first prophet, was chosen by God to lead the people after their repeated rebellion. This chronology aligns with the book of Judges and the Jewish tradition embraced by Josephus. The judges served as extraordinary leaders, defending and governing the nation despite the people's unfaithfulness. God displayed infinite goodness by repeatedly providing judges for the Israelites.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Taking the words as they stand, no other sense can be given to them, than that the time of the judges lasted 450 years." 
2. "It seems then that St. Paul followed a chronology current among the Jews, and agreeing with the book of Judges itself (the spaces of time in which, added together, come exactly to 450), and that adopted by Josephus."
3. "Samuel mentioned as the terminus of the period of the Judges, also as having been so nearly concerned in the setting up over them of Saul and David."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Taking the words as they stand in the Greek, thus, 'after that, by the space of four hundred fifty years, He gave judges,' the meaning may be, that about four hundred fifty years elapsed from the time of the covenant with Abraham until the period of the judges." (Commentary)
2. "Taking the sense to be as in our version, that it was the period of the judges itself which lasted about four hundred fifty years, this statement also will appear historically correct, if we include in it the interval of subjection to foreign powers which occurred during the period of the judges." (Commentary)
3. "Thus, from the Exodus to the building of the temple were five hundred ninety-two years [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 8.3.1]; deduct forty years in the wilderness; twenty-five years of Joshua's rule [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 5.1.29]; forty years of Saul's reign (1 Kings 6:1); forty of David's and the first four years of Solomon's reign (1 Kings 6:1), and there remain, just four hundred forty-three years; or, in round numbers, 'about four hundred fifty years.'" (Commentary)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He gave unto them judges - Men who were raised up in an extraordinary manner to administer the affairs of the nation, to defend it from enemies, etc."
2. "There is reason to believe that what is mentioned here was the common chronology of his time. It accords remarkably with that which is used by Josephus."
3. "This remarkable coincidence shows that this was the chronology which was then used, and which Paul had in view."

### John Calvin:
1. "He gave them judges. Under this name the Scripture comprehendeth rulers and governors; and here is another testimony of the infinite goodness of God toward the Jews, in that he pardoned so many backslidings in them."
2. "And we know what was the estate of the people during all that time, seeing that through untamed wantonness they did ever now and then shake off the yoke."
3. "And hereby it appeareth how unworthy they were of the favor of God, which they did despise and reject so often, unless the constancy of the election had gotten the victory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These questions of obscure dates, especially in a period so confused as the times of the judges, are of little or no importance."
2. "The passage, then, runs thus: 'He divided their land to them by lot' (or better rendered, 'He gave them their land for a possession') 'for about four hundred and fifty years, and after that he gave them judges until Samuel.'"
3. "The only remaining question is, when did the four hundred and fifty years commence? The birth of Isaac, on the whole, seems to be the period when God chose their fathers for the possession of the land."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That is, the time of the Judges then began." 
2. "He was the last of the judges and the first of the prophets who selected the first king (Saul) under God's guidance."
3. "Note the absence of the Greek article with œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒøœÖ."

### John Gill:
1. "And after that he gave unto them judges" 
2. "So that this account respects not the time of the judges, but refers to all that goes before"
3. "God gave them judges, or raised up one after another, until Samuel the prophet, who was the last of them"
