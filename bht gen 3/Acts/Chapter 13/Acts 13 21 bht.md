# Acts 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Saul, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, was anointed king at a young age and reigned for forty years. The Old Testament does not specify the length of Saul's reign, but Josephus records it in agreement with Paul's statement. The people of Israel desired a king, tired of a theocracy, and God granted their request by giving them Saul. This desire was seen as wicked and unlawful by some, but God, who knows how to use even evil things well, turned it into a means of safety and stability for His people.
