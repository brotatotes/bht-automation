## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul touches but lightly on the cross of Christ, and hastens on to the great point, the Resurrection, as the fulfilment of prophecy and seal of the Messiahship of Jesus."
2. "St. Paul, in this compendious narrative, makes no distinction between friend and foe in what was done to our Lord, but regards both as fulfilling Godâ€™s purpose regarding Him."
3. "There is also a contrast between what men did to Him, and God's raising Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The burial of Christ was an act of honor and love to Him by the disciples to whom the body was committed."
2. "The apostle regards this as the last manifestation on their part of enmity to the Saviour."
3. "They might see how God laughed all their precautions to scorn by 'raising Him from the dead.'"

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Paul is speaking of what was done to Jesus by the Jews at Jerusalem."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this means is the stumbling-block (which the understanding of the flesh conceiveth by reason of the ignominy of the cross) taken away, that the Son of God was not laid open to the furious fury of the wicked; but he obeyed his fathers decree." 
2. "Therefore, though Joseph and Nicodemus did bury Christ...that is ascribed improperly, and yet not absurdly, to the Jews; because it is not Paul's drift in this place to commend the good deed, but to prove Christ's resurrection." 
3. "He giveth us to understand that the body of Christ was not taken thence privily or by stealth, but that it was laid in a place both famous and known to the adversaries; and so, consequently, that even they were set to watch it; and yet for all this it was not found: whence we may gather the certainty of the resurrection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "From the tree. Not here strictly a tree, but wood as already in Acts 5:30; Acts 10:29 and later in Galatians 3:13." 
2. "Strictly speaking, it was Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus who took the body of Jesus down from the cross."
3. "Tomb. Memorial, common in the Gospels."
