3. "St. Paul refers the prophecy in its full completion to the Resurrection of our Lord." (33)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God hath completely fulfilled."
2. "As the apostle in Romans 1:4 regards the resurrection of Christ merely as the manifestation of a prior Sonship."
3. "It is against the whole sense of the New Testament to ascribe the origin of Christ's Sonship to His resurrection."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He does not say that every part of the promise had reference to his resurrection; but his being raised up completed or perfected the fulfillment of the promises which had been made respecting him."
2. "Paul uses the expression here as implying that the Lord Jesus is called the Son of God because he raised him up from the dead."
3. "The resurrection from the dead is represented as in some sense the beginning of life, and it is with reference to this that the terms 'Son,' and 'begotten from the dead,' are used, as the birth of a child is the beginning of life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Hath fulfilled [ŒµŒ∫œÄŒµœÄŒªŒ∑œÅœâŒ∫Œµ] . Completely fulfilled; force of ejk, out and out.


### John Calvin:
1. "Faith is the cause, that of a great multitude only a few are counted children." 
2. "God doth, as it were, acknowledge [David] to be his only begotten Son." 
3. "Christ's divinity was no less declared and established than if he had been begotten of God before the eyes of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God hath completely fulfilled, completely, because in the resurrection which is here about to be mentioned, the ascension and exaltation of Messiah are both involved."
2. "It is not the Custom of Paul or the New Testament writers to quote so exactly as in this instance, never giving the number of the chapter or the psalm whence the reference was drawn; the exception in this case was probably owing to the high importance attached by the early Christian teachers to this great Messianic prophecy appearing as it does on the first page, so to speak, of the sacred psalter."
3. "The Eternal speaks in this psalm to Messiah, 'Thou art my Son, today the day of Thy resurrection I have declared Thee have exhibited Thee as begotten.' He had been the Son of God from all eternity; but by His triumphant resurrection after His humiliation He was openly declared or shown to be so."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath filled out."
2. "This raising up (from Œ±ŒΩŒπœÉœÑŒ∑Œº, set up) as in Acts 3:22; Acts 7:37 refers not to resurrection (verse Acts 13:34), but to the sending of Jesus (two raisings up)."
3. "In the second psalm (ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ œàŒ±ŒªŒºœâ œÑœâ Œ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒµœÅœâ)."

### John Gill:
1. "God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children [...] in that he hath raised up Jesus again [...] of his being raised up, and sent forth into the world, to be a Saviour and Redeemer and to sit upon the throne of David."
2. "And that this psalm belongs to the Messiah, is evident from the mention made of him in Psalms 2:2 from the mad counsel, and vain attempts of the kings [...] and especially from that reverence, worship, and adoration, which are to be given to him, and that trust and confidence to be placed in him."
3. "Hence these words are applicable to any time or thing wherein Christ is manifested to be the only begotten Son of God, and accordingly are applied to different times and things; see Hebrews 1:3."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee ‚Äî It is true, he was the Son of God from eternity. The meaning therefore is, I have this day declared thee to be my Son."
2. "As St. Paul elsewhere, declared to be the Son of God with power, by the resurrection from the dead, Romans 1:4."
3. "And it is with peculiar propriety and beauty that God is said to have begotten him, on the day when he raised him from the dead, as he seemed then to be born out of the earth anew."
