# Acts 13:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
David served the will of God in his generation, fulfilling his purpose before he fell asleep and was buried. However, it is important to note that the prophecy in Psalms 16:1-11 could not have been about David, as it found its fulfillment in the resurrection of the uncorrupted body of the Son of God. David's corruption refers to the mortal part of his body. As believers, we are also called to serve God's will in our own generation, just as David did.

1. "Therefore, according to the hope of the resurrection to come, David saith by good right that he shall not see corruption; for that ought not altogether to be counted corruption for which there is a better restoring prepared; for the bodies of the faithful corrupt to this end, that they may put on blessed incorruption in their time."
2. "Now we see that both things are true and fitly said, that David and the rest of the faithful, inasmuch as they shall be like to their head, shall not see corruption, and yet the Son of God alone shall be free from corruption wholly."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: David, in serving his own generation, fulfilled the will of God. After this, he fell asleep and was buried among his ancestors. However, it is emphasized that David could not have been the subject of his own prophecy, as it found its ultimate fulfillment in the resurrection of the uncorrupted body of the Son of God. This is why it is said that David did not see corruption, referring to the mortality of his physical body. The figure of falling asleep to represent death was common in the ancient Eastern culture. Nevertheless, the service of David was limited to his own time, while the Messiah's service extends to all generations. Therefore, as believers, we are also called to serve the will of God in our own generation.
