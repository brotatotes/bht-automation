# Acts 13:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him. The word rendered 'mercies' denoting the sanctity of them, as comprehending the whole riches of the new covenant, presuppose the resurrection of Christ. An eternal kingdom was promised to David, and the Ruler of this kingdom could not remain under the power of death. As David had returned to corruption, while Jesus did not, it proves that the Messiah was to rise from the dead on the third day.
