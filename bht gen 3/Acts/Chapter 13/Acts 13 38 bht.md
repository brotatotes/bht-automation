## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul speaks here of justification only in its lowest sense, as negative, and synonymous with remission of sins." 
2. "He does not unfold here that higher sense of justifying, the accounting righteous, which those who have from God are just by faith." 
3. "Therefore he dwells on the remission of sins, merely just giving a glimpse of the great doctrine of justification, of which he had such wonderful things to write and to say."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

	first necessity of the sinner, and so the first experienced blessing
	of the Gospel.

### John Calvin:
1. "Therefore, we must first mark that we be all enemies to God through sin...it was an absurd thing that those benefits of God should be hidden from the faithful which were offered by Christ."
2. "The ceremonial law ought indeed to have been a schoolmaster to lead them by the hand unto Christ; all rites commanded by God were helps to help and further their faith; but as men use preposterously to corrupt the holy ordinances of God, they stop the way before themselves by their ceremonies."
3. "Certainly, it cannot be denied (but wickedly) that that justification annexed to remission of sins is, as it were, the means and way to obtain the same.

1. "Forgiveness of sins, which is sometimes expressed by a non-imputation of them, a non-remembrance of them, a covering and putting them away, and a blotting them out, is an act of free grace and mercy, and yet is through the blood of Christ; through that believers have it."
2. "the doctrine of forgiveness is a pure doctrine of the Gospel; and when it is preached aright, it is preached through Christ, not through the works of the law, not through repentance, nor through faith, nor through the absolute mercy of God, but through Christ, through the blood of Christ, which was shed to obtain it in a way consistent with the justice of God"
3. "he is God as well as man; had he been a mere man, forgiveness of sin could not have been by his blood, or through his name, or for his sake; it is because he is God, truly and properly God, that there is a virtue in his blood to take away sin, and cleanse from it"
