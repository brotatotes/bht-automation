# Acts 13:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every believer is justified by Christ, not by the law of Moses. The law could not provide justification for sins, but by faith in Jesus, believers are absolved from all charges of the law. This doctrine of grace may be a stumbling block to both Jews, with their ceremonial works, and Greeks, with their philosophical ethics. The design of the law was not to reveal a way of pardon, but that was reserved for the unique purpose of the gospel. In Jesus Christ, all men may find peace and obtain forgiveness of every sin.
