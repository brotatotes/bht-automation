Under the guidance of the Spirit, the missionaries sailed from Seleucia, a fortified city and seaport.

Moreover, Cyprus had already seen successful evangelization efforts and had a community of Cypriote Christians. Luke emphasizes that their authority for this journey came from the Holy Spirit, and Barnabas' ties to Cyprus made it a natural choice.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Four reasons may have induced them to turn in first to this island: (1) Its nearness to the mainland; (2) It was the native place of Barnabas, and since the time when Andrew found his brother Simon, and brought him to Jesus, and 'Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,' family ties had not been without effect on the progress of the Gospel." 
2. "It could not be unnatural to suppose that the truth would be welcomed in Cyprus when brought by Barnabas and his kinsman Mark, to their own connections or friends."

3. "Cyprus is 130 miles long, and in one part of the island 50 miles in breadth. It was famous for its corn and oil and fruits. Its history has been a chequered one."
