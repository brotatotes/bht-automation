# Acts 13:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Repetitive fulfillments of prophecy, leading to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and threats, encompass analogous acts of His providence. Even with unexceptional testimony, some refuse to believe the imminent calamity. Originally warning against Jerusalem's destruction, Habakkuk's words fittingly describe the impending disaster for the apostle's generation. The strong command to Perish desires their disappearance as the prophetic word is solemnly declared. However, deep-seated prejudice can hinder divine revelation. Rejecting the promised Messiah resulted in the complete ruin of the Jewish nation.
