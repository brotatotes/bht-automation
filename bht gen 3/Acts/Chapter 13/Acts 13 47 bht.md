# Acts 13:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul recognized that the prophecy referred to Christ, and thus he saw himself as fulfilling his Lord's destiny by turning to the Gentiles. The rejection of the Jews clarified for Paul the prophet's words about the Gentiles, prompting him to see himself as carrying out God's will. One must acknowledge, however, that God's people have been sluggish in executing His plans for salvation since the Gospel has yet to reach even half of the inhabitants of the earth.
