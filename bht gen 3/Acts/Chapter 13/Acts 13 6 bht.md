## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is Nea Paphos which is meant, about eight miles north of the Paphos more celebrated in classic poets for the temple and worship of Venus."
2. "The Roman aristocracy were peculiarly under the influence of astrologers and magicians, some of whom were Jews."

2. "They found a sorcererâ€”one of a numerous class of impostors who, at this time of general unbelief, were encouraged even by cultivated Romans."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Paphos was a city at the western extremity of the island."
3. "A certain sorcerer - Greek: magus, or magician."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All the Greek and Latin literature of the empire, from Horace to Lucian, abounds in proofs of the prevalent credulity of this sceptical period."
2. "We can hardly wonder when the East was thrown open the land of mystery, the cradle of the earliest religions that the imagination both of the populace and the aristocracy of Rome became fanatically excited, and that they greedily welcomed the most absurd and degrading superstitions."
3. "Not only were the women of Rome drawn aside into this varied fanaticism, but the eminent men of the declining republic and the absolute sovereigns of the early empire were tainted and enslaved by the same superstitions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word Î¼Î±Î³Î¿Î½ does not necessarily mean 'sorcerer,' but only a Î¼Î±Î³Ï…Ï‚ (Matthew 2:1; Matthew 2:7; Matthew 2:10 which see). The bad sense occurs in Acts 8:9; Acts 8:11 (Simon Magus) and is made plain here by 'false prophet.'"
2. "These Jewish mountebanks were numerous and had great influence with the uneducated."
3. "If one is surprised that a man like Sergius Paulus should fall under the influence of this fraud, he should recall what Juvenal says of the Emperor Tiberius 'sitting on the rock of Capri with his flock of Chaldaeans around him.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The Alexandrian copy, and the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read, 'the whole isle'; for through the midst of the whole island they must go, to go from Salarnis to Paphos; for Salamis was on the east, and Paphos on the west of the islands."
2. "Some say that Cinyras, a king of the Assyrians, coming into Cyprus, built Paphos; but Pausanias affirms that Agapenor, who came hither after the Trojan war, was the builder of this place, and also of the temple of Venus in it, for which it was famous."
3. "His name shows him to be a Jew, as he is here called: and he was one of those false prophets our Lord said should arise, and deceive many; he pretended to foretell things to come, and practiced sorcery, and was given to magic arts."

### John Wesley:
1. Paphos was on the western, Salamis on the eastern part of the island.
