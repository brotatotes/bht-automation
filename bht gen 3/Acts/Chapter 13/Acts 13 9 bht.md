# Acts 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this account, the Apostle Paul, previously known as Saul, is introduced as Paul for the first time. This shift in name reflects his transition from ministering primarily to Jews to becoming the prominent apostle to the Gentiles. Some suggest that Paul adopted the name Paulus, meaning little or dwarfish, to accommodate Roman ears and possibly alluding to his insignificance of stature. Filled with the power of the Holy Spirit, Paul fearlessly confronts the sorcerer Elymas, illustrating the Spirit's guidance in his ministry to expose wickedness and teach God's ways.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I do not regard it as indicative of any change of name at the time of this incident, or from that time: the evidence which I deduce from it is of a different kind, and not without interest to enquirers into the character and authorship of our history."
2. "If this was the first incident at which Luke was present, or the first memoir derived from Paul himself, or, which is plain, however doubtful may be the other alternatives, the commencement of that part of the history which is to narrate the teaching and travels of the Apostle Paul,â€”it would be natural that a note should be made, identifying the two names as belonging to the same person."
3. "It is strange that any one could be found capable of so utterly mistaking the character of St. Paul, or of producing so unfortunate an analogy to justify the mistake."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paulâ€”and henceforward Paul only; a softening of his former name, in accommodation to Roman ears, and (as the word signifies "little") probably with allusion as elsewhere to his insignificance of stature and appearance." 
2. "filled with the Holy Ghostâ€”the Spirit coming mightily upon him." 
3. "Henceforward Barnabas sinks into the background. The whole soul of his great colleague, now drawn out, as never before, shoots, by the lightning gaze of his eye, through the dark and tortuous spirit of the sorcerer. What a picture!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The name is of Roman origin. In the Latin language the name Paulus signifies little, dwarfish; and some have conjectured that it was given by his parents to denote that he was small when born; others, that it was assumed or conferred in subsequent years because he was little in stature."
2. "That it was given by the Romans, as being a name with which they were more familiar, and one that was more consonant with their language and pronunciation."
3. "Filled with the Holy Ghost - Inspired to detect his sin; to denounce divine judgment; and to inflict punishment on him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The most satisfactory seems to be that it was customary for Hellenistic Jews to have two names, the one Hebrew and the other Greek or Latin."
2. "As Paul now comes prominently forward as the apostle to the Gentiles, Luke now retains his Gentile name, as he did his Jewish name during his ministry among the Jews."
3. "The connection of the name Paul with that of the deputy seems to me purely accidental. It was most unlike Paul to assume the name of another man, converted by his instrumentality, out of respect to him or as a memorial of his conversion."

### John Calvin:
1. "For seeing that he was too much addicted to the magician, he could not embrace true doctrine as one that was free and at liberty."
2. "The devil keepeth those minds (which he hath entangled) in his slavery after a wonderful and incredible manner, that they cannot see even the most plain truth."
3. "Faith is so grounded in the word, that without this shore it fainteth at every assault; yea, that it is nothing else but the spiritual building of the word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By this name James and the Jerusalem Council write of him in their letters to the Gentile churches."
2. "This adoption of a Gentile name in addition to the original Hebrew name was a practice well known among the Jews."
3. "For Paul, in Acts 13:10, recognises in his burning reproaches Elymasâ€™ power and ability 'O full of subtilty and all mischief' and charges him with endeavouring, by his false though fair-seeming teaching, to prevent the noble Sergius Paulus from walking in the ways in which man should walk before God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By this remarkably brief phrase Luke presents this epoch in the life of Saul Paul."
2. "The 'also' (ÎºÎ±) does not mean that the name Paul was given now for the first time, rather than he had always had it."
3. "Here was a cultured heathen, typical of the best in Roman life, who called forth all the powers of Paul plus the special help of the Holy Spirit to expose the wickedness of Elymas Barjesus."

### John Gill:
1. "He was called by both these names; as he was a Jew by birth, his parents called him Saul, that was his Jewish name, and by which he went among the Jews; and as he was a citizen of a Roman city, Tarsus in Cilicia, he went among the Romans, or Gentiles, by the name of Paul, a Roman name."
2. "it is observable, that Luke calls the apostle by his Jewish name Saul, whilst he was among the Jews, and only preached among them; but now he is got among the Gentiles, and was about to appear openly to be their apostle, he all along hereafter calls him by his Gentile name Paul."
3. "others think he had his name Paul, or Paulus, from the smallness of his stature and voice, to which he seems to have some respect, in 2 Corinthians 10:10..."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is not improbable, that coming now among the Romans, they would naturally adapt his name to their own language, and so called him Paul instead of Saul."
2. "Perhaps the family of the proconsul might be the first who addressed to or spoke of him by this name."
3. "And from this time, being the apostle of the Gentiles, he himself used the name which was more familiar to them."
