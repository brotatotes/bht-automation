### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jupiter was the most powerful of all the gods of the ancients... His common appellation was, The Father of gods and men." 
2. "Mercury, called by the Greeks Hermes, was a celebrated god of antiquity... He was regarded as the god of eloquence; and as light, rapid, and quick in his movements."
3. "Because he was the chief speaker - The office of Mercury was to deliver the messages of the gods; and as Paul only had been discoursing, he was supposed to be Mercury."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He represents, so to speak, the utilitarian side of the human mind.... In the limitation of his faculties and powers, in the low standard of his moral habits, in the abundant activity of his appetites, in his indifference, his ease, his good nature, in the full-blown exhibition of what Christian theology would call conformity to the world, he is, as strictly as the nature of the case admits, a product of the invention of man."
2. "Barnabas was called Jupiter, possibly because his personal appearance was more imposing than Paul's (see 2 Corinthians 10:1, 2 Corinthians 10:10), and also because Jupiter and Mercury were commonly represented as companions in their visits to earth."
3. "The Greek names of these deities were Zeus and Hermes. As the herald of the gods, Mercury is the God of skill in the use of speech and of eloquence in general, for the heralds are the public speakers in the assemblies and on other occasions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Barnabas they imagined to be Jupiter (Zeus), most likely from his older and more venerable appearance."
2. "The less imposing figure of Paul better represented the attendant deity Mercury (Hermes), the persuasive, eloquent speaker."
3. "While to outward appearance he must have looked like some commonplace travelling Jew, his manner and address must have been singularly winning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because Barnabas was the older and the more imposing in appearance."
2. "Paul admits that he was not impressive in looks."
3. "Whether Paul was alluding to his experience in Lystra or not in Galatians 4:14, certainly they did receive him as an angel of God, as if 'Mercury' in reality."

### John Gill:
1. "And they called Barnabas Jupiter... because Barnabas was the oldest man, of the tallest stature, and largest bulk, and made the best figure."
2. "And Paul Mercurius... because he was the chief speaker; Mercury was the god of eloquence... Paul being chiefly concerned in preaching and speaking to the people."
3. "The Jews had a doctor in their schools, whom they called 'the chief of the speakers'."
