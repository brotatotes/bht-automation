# Acts 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of Lystra brought oxen and garlands to offer sacrifices to their tutelar god, Jupiter. Mistakenly, the priest planned to offer sacrifices to Paul and Barnabas, assuming them to be deities. This shows the foolishness of idolatry, as the priest sought personal gain and the people delighted in their errors. The gates of the city were considered the entrance to the temple where the divine presence resided. The garlands, worn by both sacrificer and animals, symbolized their devotion and reverence to the gods.
