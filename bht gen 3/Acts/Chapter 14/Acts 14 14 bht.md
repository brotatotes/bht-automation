3. "Moreover, there can be no greater injury done to them, than when the honor which is taken from God is given to them; which must needs be when any divine thing is ascribed and given them."

1. "Paul and Barnabas are styled apostles... set apart by the solemn act of the Church of Antioch, acting under the express direction of the Holy Ghost..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Such elaborate preparation 'with the multitudes' spread rumours."
2. "They rent their garments as if an act of sacrilege was about to be committed."
3. "It was all a sign of grief and horror with loud outcries."
