# Acts 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul preached, there were some Jews who refused to believe, disobeying God's word. His message won over both Jews and Gentiles, but displeased the rabbis. The unbelieving Jews incited the Gentiles, causing them to persecute and resist the believers. This opposition arose because the idea of Jews and Gentiles being united in one holy brotherhood was strangely hateful to those who prided themselves in their exclusive privileges as God's chosen people.
