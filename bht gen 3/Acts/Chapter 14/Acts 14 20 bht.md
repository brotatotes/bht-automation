## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first, and I think the right impression is, that this recovery was supernatural." 
2. "It is probably now DivlÃ©." 
3. "From Derbe not being enumerated, 2 Tim. iii. 11, with Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, as the scene of any of Paulâ€™s sufferings, we may perhaps infer that none befell him there."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And one appears to have been gained on this occasion, of far more importance than all the restâ€”TIMOTHEUS."
2. "It is possible that this recovery was natural; the insensibility occasioned by such treatment as he had received sometimes passing away of itself, and leaving the patient less hurt than appeared. But certainly the impression naturally left on the mind by the words is that the restoration was miraculous."
3. "Noble intrepidity!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The probability is that he was stunned by a blow - perhaps a single blow and after a short time recovered from it. Nothing is more common than thus by a violent blow on the head to be rendered apparently lifeless, the effect of which soon is over, and the person restored to strength."
2. "And came into the city - It is remarkable that he should have returned again into the same city. But probably it was only among the new converts that he showed himself."
3. "The opposition here was such that it was vain to attempt to preach there any longer. Having been seen by the disciples after his supposed death, their faith was confirmed, and he departed to preach in another place."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To Derbe. A journey of only a few hours.


### John Calvin:
1. "We must always mark what the Lord hath brought to our hand."
2. "We will not say that Saint Paul was left alone by the disciples through sloth, seeing they could not help him; and they declare their love and care when they stand about him after he is cast out."
3. "Let not pastors think that they have done their duty as they ought, when they have well trained up their people in true knowledge, unless they employ themselves to this part also."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Different to the awful night in Gethsemane when all forsook the arrested Master and fled, the disciples of Paul, undismayed by their master's arrest and execution, gathered round the poor scarred body of him they judged dead."
2. "the martyr rose up and walked among living men once more."
3. "among that group of mourning disciples gathered that day at Lystra round the apostle's apparently lifeless body, was the young Timothy, who, no doubt, heard the story of the Cross from Paul's lips during that first visit of the apostle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The would-be murderers left and a group of disciples gathered round to see if Paul was dead or alive and, if dead, to bury him."
2. "Timothy, a lad of about fifteen, would not soon forget that solemn scene."
3. "But Paul suddenly (apparently a miraculous recovery) rose up (Î±Î½Î±ÏƒÏ„Î±Ï‚) and entered the city to the surprise and joy of the disciples who were willing to brave persecution with Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "These were the young converts at Lystra, who, under the ministry of the apostles, were now brought to the faith of Christ; unless it can be thought, that they were such who followed them from other places, and attended them in their travels; but the former seems most probable, and which shows their affection to their spiritual Father, and their constancy in the faith of Christ, notwithstanding this ill treatment of his servant."
2. "And when it is considered what wounds and bruises he must receive by stoning, and his being dragged through the streets of the city, and left in such a miserable condition, that he should at once rise up in the midst of the disciples, and walk into the city as one in perfect health and strength, has something extraordinary and miraculous in it."
3. "It shows great resolution, courage, and strength of mind, to go into the same city again, where he had been so ill used; though he did not choose to continue there, nor were the inhabitants worthy of such a favor."

### John Wesley:
1. "That he should be able to do this, just after he had been left for dead, was a miracle little less than a resurrection from the dead."
2. "Especially considering the manner wherein the Jewish malefactors were stoned."
3. "The witnesses first threw as large a stone as they could lift, with all possible violence upon his head, which alone was sufficient to dash the skull in pieces. All the people then joined, as long as any motion or token of life remained."
