# Acts 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The narrator's presence is suggested by the use of the first person. Paul possibly remained in Antioch during the journey to Iconium, while the events between those limits are summarized more briefly. The disciples' souls were confirmed and strengthened, as they needed encouragement to continue in their faith amidst persecution. Paul's warning of the tribulations they would face in entering God's Kingdom prepared them for the challenges ahead. This support was necessary for these already converted new believers to endure and remain steadfast.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Confirming (ŒµœÄŒπœÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ). Late verb (in LXX), in N.T. only in Acts 14:22; Acts 15:32; Acts 15:41, to make more firm, to give additional (ŒµœÄ) strength. Each time in Acts the word is used concerning these churches."
2. "To continue in the faith (ŒµŒºŒºŒµŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ œÑŒ∑ œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµ). To remain in with locative, old verb... These recent converts from heathenism were ill-informed, were persecuted, had broken family and social ties, greatly needed encouragement if they were to hold out."
3. "Paul frankly warned these new converts in this heathen environment of the many tribulations through which they must enter the Kingdom of God (the culmination at last) as he did at Ephesus (Acts 20:20) and as Jesus had done (John 16:33). These saints were already converted."

### John Gill:
1. "Confirming the souls of the disciples...they did not confirm the bodies of these disciples, and the health of them, which is the business of the physician to confirm; nor their estates and civil property, to secure and defend which belongs to the civil magistrate; but their souls, their more noble and valuable part."
2. "and exhorting them to continue in the faith: in the exercise of the grace of faith, and in the doctrine of faith, and in the profession of both, whatever they might meet with on the account thereof, and which they were to expect."
3. "that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God either into a Gospel church state, which is sometimes so called, there being much trouble often attending an entrance into it, both from within, from the corruption and unbelief of the heart, and from without, from the temptations of Satan, and from the revilings and insults of men, and even from friends and relations."
