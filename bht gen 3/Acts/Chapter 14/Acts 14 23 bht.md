## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The verb means, appointed by suffrage: and probably, by the analogy of ch. vi. 2‚Äì6 (see 2 Cor. viii. 19), the strict meaning is here to be retained." 
2. "The word will not bear Jerome‚Äôs and Chrysostom‚Äôs sense of 'laying on of hands,' adopted by Roman Catholic expositors."
3. "Nor is there any reason here for departing from the usual meaning of electing by shew of hands."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "when they had made a choice of elders, that is, superintended such choice on the part of the disciples."
2. "ordination was by prayer and fasting... if the first clause refer to the choice and the second to the ordination, all is natural."
3. "they commended... all these churches... to the Lord‚ÄîJesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'ordain' we now use in an ecclesiastical sense, to denote 'a setting apart to an office by the imposition of hands.' But it is evident that the word here is not employed in that sense."
2. "The word occurs in only one other place in the New Testament, 2 Corinthians 8:19, where it is applied to Luke, and translated, 'who was also chosen of the church (that is, appointed or elected by suffrage by the churches) to travel with us, etc.'"
3. "They commended them ... They committed the infant church to the guardianship of the Lord. They were feeble, inexperienced, and exposed to dangers; but in his hands they were safe."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ordained [œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÑŒøŒΩŒ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ] . Only here and 2 Corinthians 8:19. Rev., more correctly, appointed. The meaning ordain is later." 
2. "Elders [œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤œÖœÑŒµœÄŒøœÖœÇ] . For the general superintendence of the church. The word is synonymous with ejpiskopoi, overseers or bishops."
3. "Commended [œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ∏ŒµŒΩœÑŒø]. See on set before, Luke 9:16; and commit, 1 Peter 4:19."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not only send his apostles to preach the gospel, but he commanded also that there should be pastors appointed, that the preaching of the gospel might be perpetual and in daily use."
2. "The Church cannot want an ordinary ministry, neither can any be counted Christians before God but those who, during their whole life, are willing to learn."
3. "We must beware that we attempt nothing unless we have him for our guide and governor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This is rendered more accurately, ‚ÄòAnd when they had appointed for them elders,‚Äô etc."
2. "The latter is the more probable, as in these new-formed communities, presbyters or elders chosen by Paul and Barnabas acting under the light of the Divine Spirit, would be more likely to command respect when the apostles were far away."
3. "On the office of ‚Äòpresbyter,‚Äô see Excursus B in the Chapter Comments."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "ŒßŒµŒπœÅŒøœÑŒøŒΩŒµœâ (from œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÑŒøŒΩŒøœÇ, extending the hand, œáŒµŒπœÅ, hand, and œÑŒµŒπŒΩœâ, to stretch) is an old verb that originally meant to vote by show of the hands, finally to appoint with the approval of an assembly that chooses..."
2. "It is most likely that this plan was the one pursued by Paul and Barnabas with these churches. They selected the elders in each instance and Paul and Barnabas 'ordained' them as we say..."
3. "It was a serious matter, this formal setting apart of these 'elders' in the churches. So it was done in a public meeting with prayer and fasting as when Paul and Barnabas were sent forth from Antioch in Syria on this mission tour."

### John Gill:
1. "These the apostles directed the churches to look out from among themselves, as in the case of deacons, an inferior office, who by joint suffrages declared their choice of them by the stretching out, or lifting up of their hands, as the word here used signifies, and not the imposition of them."
2. "And had prayed with fasting; for the elders ordained, that they might have a larger measure of gifts, and might be kept faithful to the trust committed to them, and be succeeded in their ministry; and for the members of the church, that they might abide by the truths of the Gospel, and the ordinances of it, and walk worthy of it in their conversations, and behave aright in their church state, both to their elders, and to one another, and that they might persevere to the end."
3. "they commended them to the Lord; both the elders and the churches, to be blessed by him with fresh supplies of grace, to be kept by his power, and to be preserved by him safe to his kingdom and glory."

### John Wesley:

2. "They commended them to the Lord - An expression implying faith in Christ, as well as love to the brethren."
