# Acts 14:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the city where Paul and Barnabas preached, a division arose among the Gentile populace. This division was within the Gentile populace. Some approved of their message, which divisions in families, towns, and cities, though the common consequence of the preaching of the Gospel, are not owing to any fault in that, but to the depravity and corruption of human nature. Despite the opposition, it was a way for God to bear His testimony and reveal the truth. Such divisions are common when the Gospel is preached, yet it is not the fault of Christianity itself.
