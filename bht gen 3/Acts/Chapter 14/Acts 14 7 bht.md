Through their preaching, many were likely converted, leading to the establishment of churches in these cities. Although there is limited historical information about these churches until much later, the apostles' active dissemination of the good news played a pivotal role in the growth of faith.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In the verse, it is mentioned that the apostles preached the gospel, and they did so for a prolonged period of time. Their evangelistic work was extensive, reaching not only the market-place but also the house that later became known as Timothy's home. This house served as a connection between the Jewish apostles and the people of Lycaonia, who were predominantly Gentiles. Through their preaching, it is likely that many were converted in these cities, resulting in the establishment of churches. However, there is limited information in ecclesiastical history about these churches until much later. The apostles did not stay still or hide, but actively proclaimed the good news and glad tidings, leading others to faith.
