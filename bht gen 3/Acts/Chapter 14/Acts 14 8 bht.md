# Acts 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Lystra, there sat a certain man who was impotent in his feet from birth. The word impotent here implies impossibility, a condition that the man had never been able to overcome. When Paul spoke to the crowd, this man heard his words and witnessed an extraordinary miracle. Through the power of God, the man was suddenly healed, causing his previously motionless legs to become nimble. This miraculous healing, before the eyes of all, served as a powerful testament to the truth of Paul's message and the undeniable power of God.
