# Acts 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To tempt God is to put obstacles in His evidently determined course. Peter's reference in this context is not about outward observance of ceremonies but about the imposition of the law as a condition of salvation on the consciences of the disciples. The burden of the law is far more grievous and impossible to bear than mere ceremonies. Thus, to put this yoke upon the Gentile believers would be to oppose God's will and to demand new proofs of His already clear purpose. Why then tempt God by standing in the way of His declared plan?

- Attempt 1 BHT: To tempt God is to put obstacles in His way and contradict His purpose. In Acts 15:10, Peter refers not to mere outward observance of ceremonies, but to the imposition of the law as a condition of salvation on the consciences of the disciples. The burden of legal death, unable to be borne by anyone, was far more grievous than the burdensome ceremonies. An attempt to put this yoke upon the disciples, particularly the Gentile believers, would be a clear opposition to God's clear will. So, why tempt God by standing in the way of His declared purpose and demanding new proofs of His will?
