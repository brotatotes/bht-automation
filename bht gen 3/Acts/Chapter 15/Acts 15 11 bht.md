- Attempt 1 BHT: It is clear that the grace of Christ is the sufficient cause of our salvation, and it is not reasonable or according to God's will to burden this grace with unnecessary conditions. The belief that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus is shared among all believers, regardless of whether they were circumcised or not. The doctrine of grace, as expressed by the Apostle Paul, dismisses the idea of salvation through ceremony or ritualism.

This understanding refutes any notion of salvation through the law, making it clear that salvation is found in the grace of Christ alone.
