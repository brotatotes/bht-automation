# Acts 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of God, seen in Amos' prophecy, was for the Gentiles, referred to as the residue of men, to seek after the Lord. James cites this prophecy to emphasize that circumcision and other Jewish ceremonies were not permanent rules for these redeemed strangers. The Septuagint translation, which James used, paraphrased the Hebrew text and identified Edom as symbolizing those who were estranged from the God of Israel. Ultimately, God's plan is to unite Jews and Gentiles, called by His name, into one church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  17. upon whom my name is called] Notice the same expression in the Epistle of James, ch. ii. 7.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase, 'the residue of men,' here is evidently understood, both by the Septuagint and by James, as referring to others than Jews, to the Gentiles the rest of the world - implying that many of them would be admitted to the friendship and favor of God."
2. "Why this variation occurred cannot be explained; but the sense is not materially different."
3. "This was a clear prediction that other nations were to be favored with the true religion, and that without any mention of their conforming to the rites of the Jewish people."

### John Calvin:
1. "To the end we may be numbered among the people of God, and that he may take us for his own, we must, on the other side, [in our turn,] be encouraged to seek him."
2. "Instead of the relics of the Gentiles which Amos useth, Luke, out of the Greek translation, (which was more familiar,) putteth the rest of the men in the same sense, to wit, that there must go before the purging of the filthiness of the world a cutting, or paring, as it came to pass."
3. "For, because the corruption of the world is worse than that it can be wholly brought to obey Christ, he bloweth away, with diverse fans of tribulations, the chaff and weeds, that he may at length gather unto himself that which shall remain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The quotation from Amos 9:11-12, contained in Acts 15:16-17, is made freely from the Septuagint, which differs here considerably from the Hebrew text as we now possess it."
2. "The LXX. here, as not unfrequently, give a paraphrase rather than a literal translation of the original, and regard 'Edom' (a common Rabbinical idea) as a general representative of those who were strangers to the God of Israel."
3. "The grand words which closed the prophecy of Amos were here cited by James as foretelling the future calling of the Gentiles, and at the same time as containing no recognition of circumcision as a permanent rule, no mention of other Jewish ceremonies as binding upon these multitudes of redeemed strangers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of Î¿Ï€Ï‰Ï‚ with the subjunctive (effective aorist active) to express purpose is common enough and note Î±Î½ for an additional tone of uncertainty."
2. "The Hebrew text is quite different, 'that they may possess the remnant of Edom.' Certainly the LXX suits best the point that James is making."
3. "The purpose of God, though future, is expressed by this perfect passive indicative ÎµÏ€Î¹ÎºÎµÎºÎ»Î·Ï„Î± from ÎµÏ€Î¹-ÎºÎ±Î»ÎµÏ‰, to call on. It is a Jewish way of speaking of those who worship God."

### John Gill:
1. "That the residue of men might seek after the Lord...attend his worship, pray unto him, and seek unto him for life and salvation."
2. "God is the God of the whole earth, of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews; and his Gospel was now spread among them, and many of them were converted and called Christians, and the children and people of God."
3. "Raises up the tabernacle of David, revives the interest of religion, resettles the church, and increases it, calls and converts the Gentiles, causes them to seek after the Lord, and unites them in one church state with the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. The Gentiles on whom my name is called â€” That is, who are called by my name; who are my people.
