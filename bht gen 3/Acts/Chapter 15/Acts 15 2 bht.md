## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Titus was one, Gal. ii. 1, 3, and that, in all probability, in order to give an example of a Gentile convert of the uncircumcision endowed with gifts of the Holy Spirit."
3. "Titus is not mentioned in the Acts; but only in 2 Cor., Gal., 2 Tim,, and the epistle addressed to him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "It is further implied here that it is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to defend the truth and to oppose error."
