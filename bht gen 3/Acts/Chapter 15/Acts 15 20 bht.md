## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The pollutions of idols are the things polluted by being offered to idols, about which there was much doubt and contention in the early church."
2. "In consequence we have the following attempts to evade the simple rendering of the word... Some explain it of spiritual fornication in eating things offered to idols: (2) others, of the committal of actual fornication at the rites in idol temples, &c."
3. "The moral abomination of the practice is not here in question, but is abundantly set forth by our Lord and his Apostles in other places."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From such food James would enjoin the Gentile converts to abstain, lest it should seem to the Jews that they were not entirely weaned from idolatry."
2. "The characteristic sin of heathendom, unblushingly practiced by all ranks and classes."
3. "The eating of [blood] on the part of the Gentile converts would shock their prejudices."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That flesh, after being offered in sacrifice, was often exposed for sale in the markets, or was served up at feasts, 1 Corinthians 10:25-29."
2. "This vice was almost universal; as it was practiced without shame or disgrace; as there were no laws among the pagan to prevent it; as it was connected with all their views of idol worship and of religion, it was important for the early Christians to frown upon and to oppose it, and to set a special guard against it in all the churches."
3. "The primary reason of the prohibition was, that it was thus used in the feasts and compacts of idolaters. That blood was thus drank by the pagans, particularly by the Sabians, in their sacrifices, is fully proved by Spencer, De Leg., p. 377-380 But the prohibition specifies a higher reason, that the life is in the blood, and that therefore it should not be eaten."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Originally, to send to, as a message; hence, by letter." 
2. "The flesh of idol sacrifices, of which whatever was not eaten by the worshippers at the feasts in the temples, or given to the priests, was sold in the markets and eaten at home."
3. "The association of fornication with three things in themselves indifferent is to be explained from the then moral corruption of heathenism, by which fornication, regarded from of old with indulgence, and even with favor, nay, practiced without shame even by philosophers, and surrounded by poets with all the tinsel of lasciviousness, had become in public opinion a thing really indifferent."

### John Calvin:
1. "Therefore, lest there should any blot of superstition remain in the Gentiles, and lest the Jews should see anything in them which did not agree with the pure worship of God, no marvel if, to avoid offense, they be commanded to abstain from things offered to idols."
2. "As concerning blood and that which was strangled, not only the Jews were forbidden by the law of Moses to eat them, ( Deuteronomy 12:23;) but this law was given to all the world after the flood, ( Genesis 9:4,) whereby it came to pass, that those which were not quite grown out of kind âˆ’ (137) did loathe blood."
3. "The filthiness of whoredom, which the heavenly Judge doth so sore condemn, can be covered with no cloaks by the patrons of whoredom how witty and eloquent soever they be."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Abstain from pollutions of idols, etc."
2. "The famous injunctions embodied in the decree of the Council."
3. "On the full meaning of the famous injunctions embodied in the decree of the Council, see Excursus at the end of the chapter, where they are discussed at length."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "James agrees with Peter in his support of Paul and Barnabas in their contention for Gentile freedom from the Mosaic ceremonial law."
2. "The restrictions named by James affect the moral code that applies to all (idolatry, fornication, murder). Idolatry, fornication and murder were the outstanding sins of paganism then and now."
3. "The problem is whether the words were added because 'blood' was understood as not 'murder,' but a reference to the Mosaic regulation or whether it was omitted to remove the ceremonial aspect and make it all moral and ethical."

### John Gill:
1. "God forbids his people from eating the blood of any animal."

3. "The harmful effects of eating blood can be illustrated by tribes in Africa who consume large amounts of blood in their pagan culture."

3. "When God first permitted man to eat flesh, he commanded Noah, and in him all his posterity, whenever they killed any creature for food, to abstain from the blood thereof."
