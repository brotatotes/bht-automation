## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The pollutions of idols are the things polluted by being offered to idols, about which there was much doubt and contention in the early church."
2. "The solution will best be found in the fact, that fornication was universally in the Gentile world regarded on the same footing with the other things mentioned, as indifferent, and is classed here as Gentiles would be accustomed to hear of it, among those things which they allowed themselves, but which the Jews regarded as forbidden."
3. "The moral abomination of the practice is not here in question, but is abundantly set forth by our Lord and his Apostles in other places."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From such food James would
enjoin the Gentile converts to abstain, lest it should seem to the
Jews that they were not entirely weaned from idolatry."
2. "The characteristic sin of heathendom, unblushingly practiced by all ranks and classes, and the indulgence of which on the part of the Gentile converts would to Jews, whose Scriptures branded it as an abomination of the heathen, proclaim them to be yet joined to their old idols."
3. "In every form, as peremptorily forbidden to the Jews, and the eating of which, therefore, on the part of the Gentile converts, would shock their prejudices."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That flesh, after being offered in sacrifice, was often exposed for sale in the markets, or was served up at feasts [...] It became a very important question whether it was right for Christians to partake of it." 
2. "Various explanations of this have been proposed. Some have supposed that James refers here to the offerings which harlots would make of their gains to the service of religion [...] after all, the usual interpretation of the word, as referring to illicit sexual intercourse of the sexes of any kind, is undoubtedly here to be retained." 
3. "The primary reason of the prohibition was, that it was thus used in the feasts and compacts of idolaters [...] It was proper, therefore, to forbid it to the early Christian converts; and for the same reason, its use should be abstained from everywhere."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Write [ÎµÏ€Î¹ÏƒÏ„ÎµÎ¹Î»Î±Î¹]. Originally, to send to, as a message; hence, by letter."
2. "Here the word is defined by things sacrificed to idols...the flesh of idol sacrifices."
3. "The association of fornication with three things in themselves indifferent is to be explained from the then moral corruption of heathenism."

### John Calvin:
1. "Therefore, lest there should any blot of superstition remain in the Gentiles, and lest the Jews should see anything in them which did not agree with the pure worship of God, no marvel if, to avoid offense, they be commanded to abstain from things offered to idols."
2. "The filthiness of whoredom, which the heavenly Judge doth so sore condemn, can be covered with no cloaks by the patrons of whoredom how witty and eloquent soever they be."
3. "The knowledge thereof must be let [sought] out of the continual doctrine of the Scripture; and it is nothing doubtful what the Scripture saith; to wit, that whoredom is accursed before God, and that the soul and body are thereby defiled, that the holy temple of God is polluted, and Christ is rent in pieces."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, etc."
2. "On the full meaning of the famous injunctions embodied in the decree of the Council, see Excursus at the end of the chapter."
3. "They are discussed at length."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The best old MSS. do not have Î±Ï€Î¿, but the ablative is clear enough in what follows."
2. "James agrees with Peter in his support of Paul and Barnabas in their contention for Gentile freedom from the Mosaic ceremonial law."
3. "The restrictions named by James affect the moral code that applies to all (idolatry, fornication, murder)."

### John Gill:
1. "God forbids his people from eating the blood of any animal. Blood carries both infections and toxins that might circulate in the animal's body." (Rex D. Russel, M.D.)
2. "The harmful effects of eating blood can be illustrated by tribes in Africa who consume large amounts of blood in their pagan culture. These people have developed the chronic diseases seen in our elderly while still teenagers. Their life span is approximately 30 years." (Rex D. Russel, M.D.)
3. "Therefore, by eating an animal's blood, one exposes himself needlessly to potential toxins and infections." (Rex D. Russel, M.D.)

### John Wesley:
1. "To abstain from fornication â€” Which even the philosophers among the heathens did not account any fault."
2. "And from things strangled â€” That is, from whatever had been killed, without pouring out the blood."
3. "When God first permitted man to eat flesh, he commanded Noah, and in him all his posterity, whenever they killed any creature for food, to abstain from the blood thereof."
