# Acts 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To maintain harmony and avoid disputes between Jews and Gentiles, it was necessary for the Gentiles to abstain from consuming blood. This was because blood held significance in the lives of animals and was consecrated for atonement purposes. Although the Gentiles were accustomed to consuming blood and even considered it a delicacy, this concession was seen as light and justifiable to ensure peace. Opposition from Judaizers seeking to disturb Paul's work should not overshadow the importance of upholding these guidelines for the well-being of the fellowship.
