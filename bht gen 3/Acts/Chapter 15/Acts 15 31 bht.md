### Albert Barnes:
1. "This closes the account of the first Christian council. It was conducted throughout on Christian principles; in a mild, kind, conciliatory spirit, and is a model for all similar assemblages."
2. "How happy would it have been if this spirit had been possessed by all professedly Christian councils; if all had really sought the peace and harmony of the churches; if none had ever been convened to kindle the fires of persecution, or to rend and destroy the church of God!"
3. "They asserted no abstract right of such jurisdiction; they sought not to intermeddle with the case; they enjoined no future reference of such cases to them, to their successors, or to any ecclesiastical tribunal. They evidently regarded the churches as blessed with the most ample freedom, and contemplated no arrangement of a permanent character asserting a right to legislate on articles of faith, or to make laws for the direction of the Lordâ€™s freemen."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The consolation over which they rejoiced was not merely that a dispute which threatened such grave consequences was so happily terminated..."
