## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The statement, that they were prophets also themselves, gives the reason for their superadding to the appointed business of their mission the work of exhorting and edifying."
2. "On the prophets see ch. xi. 27; xiii. 1: Eph. ii. 20, and notes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Judas and Silas, being prophets themselvesâ€”that is, inspired teachers."
2. "exhorted the brethren with many wordsâ€”"much discourse."
3. "confirmed themâ€”opening up, no doubt, the great principle involved in the controversy now settled, of gratuitous salvation, or the purification of the heart by faith alone."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being prophets - See the notes on Acts 11:27. This evidently implies that they had been preachers before they went to Antioch."
2. "What was the precise nature of the office of a prophet in the Christian church it is not easy to ascertain."
3. "Confirmed them - Strengthened them; that is, by their instructions and exhortations."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Many words. Or, lit., much discourse; adding the spoken to the written consolation."
2. "Exhorted. Or comforted. See on ver. 31. The latter agrees better with consolation there."
3. "Confirmed. See on ch. Acts 14:22."

### John Calvin:
1. "And we must note that he saith that they exhorted the Church, because they were prophets; for it is not a thing common to all men to enter such an excellent function."
2. "Therefore, we must beware, lest any man pass his bounds; as Paul teacheth, 1 Corinthians 7:20; and Ephesians 4:1, that every one keep himself within the measure of grace received."
3. "Wherefore, it is not in vain that Luke saith that the office of teaching is peculiar; lest any man, through ambition, being void of ability, or through rash zeal, or through any other foolish desire, coveting to put out his head, trouble the order of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their voices smote the air, and did their work, and died away, and we catch but the faintest echoes of them. Their words were written on the sand, and the advancing waves of time have washed away all or nearly all the traces of what was once as awful as the handwriting on the wall." 
2. "The chief characteristic feature of these prophets of early Christianity was that the prophets possessed a strange, winning power of words, which had a weighty effect on their hearers."
3. "They were, then, earnest, impassioned preachers, who possessed a supernatural insight into the hearts of men; they seemed to know what was in their minds, they read their most secret thoughts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being themselves also prophets...speakers for Christ who justify the commendation in the letter...with much talk." 
2. "Confirmed. It was a glorious time with no Judaizers to disturb their fellowship."

### John Gill:
1. "And by prophets are meant, not only such who had the gift of foretelling things to come; though such there were, and these might have that gift; but such who were able to explain the prophecies of the Old Testament, give the true sense of the Scriptures, and open them to the edification of others." 
2. "They comforted the brethren, giving them many useful instructions and exhortations."
3. "They confirmed them; in the doctrines of the Gospel, and particularly in their Christian liberty, and freedom from the law of Moses, in which the false teachers had endeavored to stagger them."
