### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: It is likely that the words in this verse are an interpolation to explain Silas' presence in Antioch in a later verse. According to Galatians 2:10, remembering the poor at Jerusalem was a condition attached to the recognition of Paul and Barnabas' Gentile mission. This was an objective that Paul was eager to fulfill, as his Epistles reveal. The absence of this verse in certain manuscripts and versions, along with its likely addition to clarify Silas' return to Antioch, further supports the notion that it is not original. Despite its questionable authenticity, it is clear that Silas' presence in Antioch was due to his desire to be with Paul, and the time between the events allowed for his return from Jerusalem.
