3. "He thought, doubtless, of the Pisidians and Lycaonians, as he thought afterwards at Athens and Corinth of the Thessalonians, from whom he had been lately 'taken in presence, not in heart, night and day praying exceedingly that he might see their face and perfect that which was lacking in their faith.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, in staying a time at Antioch, did provide for other churches; and so we must no less look unto his wisdom than his diligence in this example, because oftentimes the immoderate heat of the pastors in going about matters doth no less hurt than their sluggishness."
2. "There ought nothing under heaven to be more firm than the spiritual building of faith, whose stability is grounded in the very heaven; yet there be but few in whose minds the word of the Lord doth thoroughly take lively root; therefore, firmness is rare in men."
3. "Moreover, we see how Satan doth assault, and with what subtle shifts he goeth about privily to pull down sometimes whole churches, sometimes every one of the faithful particularly. Therefore, it is not without cause that Paul is so careful for his scholars, lest they behave themselves otherwise than is to be wished; and therefore is he desirous in time to prevent, if there be any inconvenience risen, which cannot be until he have taken view."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul is anxious, like a true missionary, to go back to the fields where he has planted the gospel."

3. "The precariousness of the life of new converts in pagan lands is shown in all of Paul's Epistles."

### John Gill:
1. "And it may be observed, what an affection the apostle had for the young converts, and members of these churches; he calls them 'brethren', they being partakers of the same grace, and of the same faith and family with himself."
2. "Such are to be visited and looked after, and their cases inspected into; and inquiries should be made of them, how they do, how they go on; whether they continue in the faith, and grow in grace and in the knowledge of Christ."
3. "And this is a work becoming the ministers of the Gospel; and the example of the apostle is worthy of imitation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let us go and visit the brethren in every city where we have preached...but it was not all that God designed...whose providence carried him much farther than he intended."
2. "And see how they do â€” How their souls prosper: how they grow in faith, hope, love: what else ought to be the grand and constant inquiry in every ecclesiastical visitation?"
3. "Reader, how dost thou do?"
