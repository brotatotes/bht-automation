# Acts 15:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul thought it was inappropriate to take John Mark with them on their journey because he had previously withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. His departure was not authorized by the Apostles, and Paul did not trust him to persevere in the toils and perils they would face. This decision by Paul was significant, as it led to a parting between him and Barnabas, both of whom had different opinions and could not reconcile their differences.
