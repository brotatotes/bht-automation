## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul sought justice, Barnabas courtesy." 
2. "It seems to me that their parting was by agreement, and that they said to one another, 'Since you will it, and I do not, that we be not at strife, let us divide our courses.' So that they did this out of a yielding spirit to one another."
3. "Barnabas appears to have gone with his nephew without any special sympathy or approval; whereas Paul was commended to the grace of God by the assembled church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But, in behalf of Paul, it may well be answered, that not being able to see into the future he had only the unfavorable past to judge by; that the gentleness of Barnabas had already laid him open to imposition..."
2. "On the whole, then, it seems clear that each of these great servants of Christ had something to say for himself, in defense of the position which they respectively took up..."
3. "And how affectingly does the Lord overrule such difference of judgment and such manifestations of human infirmity, by making them 'turn out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel'; as in this case is eminently seen in the two missionary parties instead of one, not travelling over the same ground and carrying their dispute over all the regions of their former loving labors, but dividing the field between them!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The contention was so sharp...a violent altercation that resulted in their separation for a time."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "In later times, we know Mark became once more the loved and trusted companion of Paul. We find him with Peter at Babylon. In the closing days of Paulâ€™s life, he seems to have been with Timothy at Ephesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is often so that the little irritations of life give occasion to violent explosions."

### John Gill:
1. "Barnabas insisting...that his mother Mary was an excellent good woman, who had received the saints into her house, in a time of persecution." 
2. "Paul, on the other hand, opposing his going with them, as a very unworthy person, because he had behaved so cowardly."
