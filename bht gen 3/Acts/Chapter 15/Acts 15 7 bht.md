## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A promiscuous debate, not perhaps without some angry feeling, ensued on their first coming together,â€”and among the multitude, as is implied in ver. 12,â€”man disputing with man."
2. "Peter... principallly because of his peculiar fitness to open the apostolic decisions on the subject, from having been made the instrument of the first public and approved reception of the Gentiles."
3. "The length of time elapsed is placed by Peter in the strongest light, to shew that the question had in fact been settled by divine interference long since."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the last mention of him in the Acts, and one worthy of his standing, as formally pronouncing, from the divine decision of the matter already in his own case, in favor of the views which all of Paul's labors were devoted to establishing." 
2. "A good while agoâ€”probably about fifteen years before this."
3. "Made choice . . . that the Gentiles by my mouth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Much disputing - Or rather, much inquiry or deliberation."
2. "Peter was probably the most aged, and was most accustomed to speak."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The word of the gospel [Ï„Î¿Î½ Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Ï… Ï„Î¿Ï… ÎµÏ…Î±Î³Î³ÎµÎ»Î¹Î¿Ï…] . This phrase occurs nowhere else; and eujaggelion, gospel, is found only once more in Acts (ch. 20 24).


### John Calvin:
1. "He suffered (even in that company and assembly wherein he was chief) the principal point of Christian doctrine to be diversely tossed and handled, lest we should wonder, if at any time it so fall out, that men, who are otherwise learned and godly, do, through unskillfulness, fall into an error."
 
2. "Now, it is meet that we ponder the words of Peter, whereby he proveth that this was granted to the Gentiles by God, to be free from the yoke of the law."
3. "The eyes of God do not look upon the vain pomp of men, but upon the integrity of menâ€™s hearts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The noble self-denial which Peter showed, the brave and independent position which he took on this momentous occasion, and which probably cost him much of his influence among the stricter Jewish Christians, must be reckoned among the famous apostleâ€™s chiefest titles to honour."
2. "Peterâ€™s reminder was a grave rebuke to the extreme Pharisee party, who probably had forgotten the case of Cornelius, referred to by the apostle, which had taken place some eight or ten years before."
3. "There is no doubt that the burning ardour of Paul, and his marked success in the work, had influenced in no small degree the warm-hearted and enthusiastic Peter."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were allowed plenty of time and there was no effort to shut off debate or to rush anything through the meeting."
2. "The wonder was that he had waited so long. It was fitting that Peter should speak."
3. "His point is that what Paul and Barnabas have reported is nothing new. The Judaizers made objection then as they are doing now."

### John Gill:
1. "And when there had been much disputing,... much had been said, and a great deal of time had been taken up about the thing in controversy."
2. "Peter rose up... to signify that he had something to say; and he stood up that he might be the better heard."
3. "some years ago it pleased God... to call him to go to Caesarea, and preach the gospel to Cornelius, and those that were in his house, that hearing they might believe in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "But if it had, if they themselves had debated at first, yet might their final decision be from an unerring direction."
2. "For how really soever they were inspired, we need not suppose their inspiration was always so instantaneous and express, as to supersede any deliberation in their own minds, or any consultation with each other."
3. "Peter rose up â€” This is the last time he is mentioned in the Acts."
