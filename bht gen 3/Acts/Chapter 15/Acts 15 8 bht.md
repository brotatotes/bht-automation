- Attempt 3 BHT: In determining admission to the visible Church, the state of the heart is the crucial factor. Any principle that contradicts this is unsound.

By this, the Eternal demonstrated His ability to judge their sincerity. Therefore, circumcision is not a prerequisite for salvation, and the bestowal of the Holy Spirit confirms the Gentiles' acceptance into the Church.
