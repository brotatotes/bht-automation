# Acts 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, who sees beyond the surface distinctions between Jew and Gentile, knows that the hearts of all are unclean and require the same all-sufficient sacrifice, applied through faith. He does not differentiate between us and them, rather, he cleanses their hearts, not simply by faith, but through their faith in Christ. This inward revolution transforms genuine disciples, as they are purified from dead works to serve the living God. It's remarkable how God treats Jews as heathens and heathens as Jews, purifying hearts not by works or ceremonies, but by faith alone.
