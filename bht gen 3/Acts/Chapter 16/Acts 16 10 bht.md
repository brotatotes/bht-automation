## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "While we safely conclude from it that the writer was in company with Paul when he thus speaks, we cannot with like safety infer that he was not, where the third person is used."
2. "It is conceivable that a narrative, even where it concerns all present, might be, in its earlier parts, written as of others in the third person, but might, when more intimacy had been established, or even by preference only, be at any point changed to the first."
3. "On the whole, and after careful consideration of the subject, I see no reason to doubt the common view, that Luke here joined the Apostle (whether as a physician, on account of his broken health, must of course be matter of conjecture, but is not improbable), and from this time (except from ch. xvii. lâ€“xx. 5), accompanies him to the end of the history."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'we,' here first introduced, is a modest intimation that the historian himself had now joined the missionary party." 
2. "Whether Paul's broken health had anything to do with this arrangement for having 'the beloved physician' with him, can never be known with certainty."
3. "But that he would deem himself honored in taking care of so precious a life, there can be no doubt."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is the first instance in which Luke refers to himself as being in company with Paul."
2. "It is hence probable that he joined Paul and Silas about this time."
3. "Assuredly gathering - Being certainly convinced."

### John Calvin:
1. "Satan doth oftentimes abuse ghosts and visures [masks] to deceive withal, that he may mock and cozen the unbelievers."
2. "Whereby it cometh to pass, that the bare vision leaveth manâ€™s mind in doubt; but such as are divine indeed, those doth the Spirit seal by a certain mark."
3. "In Paul and his companions the desire to obey ensued immediately upon the certainty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "From this it appears that Luke, the presumed author of these records, joined the missionary band first at Troas."
2. "The supposition that the â€˜beloved physicianâ€™ associated himself with his great master at this juncture and watched over his health is not without foundation."
3. "After the direct intimation given by the appearance of the â€˜man of Macedoniaâ€™, Paul seems to have had no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that his life-work lay for a time, at least, in Europe."
