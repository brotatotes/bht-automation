# Acts 16:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of baptism here signifies its special importance in the first European baptism performed by Paul. It is likely that Lydia's household, including her employees, were baptized along with her, given the practice of administering baptism to children by the apostles. Lydia's urgency, gratitude, hospitality, and desire for further instruction demonstrate the authenticity and fruit of her faith. The practice of infant baptism finds support in the presumption of including children in other instances of household baptism.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The practice, however, does not rest on inference, but on the continuity and identity of the covenant of grace to Jew and Christian, the sign only of admission being altered."
2. "The Apostles, as Jews, would have proposed to administer baptism to the children, and Jewish or proselyte converts would, as a matter of course, have acceded to the proposal."
3. "The preposterous views of the modern Baptists would have been received with astonishment and reprobation in the apostolic Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of baptism here for the first time in connection with the labors of Paul, while it was doubtless performed on all his former converts, indicates a special importance in this first European baptism."
2. "Whether it included children, also in that case baptized, is not explicitly stated; but the presumption, as in other cases of household baptism, is that it did."
3. "The word seems to imply that they were reluctant, but were overborne."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And when she was baptized - Apparently without any delay. Compare Acts 2:41; Acts 8:38. It was usual to be baptized immediately on believing."
2. "And her household - Greek: her house ŒøÃî ŒøŒπÃìÕÇŒ∫ŒøœÇ Œ±ÃìœÖœÑŒ∑ÕÇœÇ ho oikos auteÃÑs, her family. No mention is made of their having believed, and the case is one that affords a strong presumptive proof that this was an instance of household or infant baptism."
3. "And she constrained us - She urged us. This was an instance of great hospitality, and also an evidence of her desire for further instruction in the doctrines of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Constrained [œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ≤ŒπŒ±œÉŒ±œÑŒø] . Only here and Luke 24:29, on which see note. The constraint was from ardent gratitude.


### John Calvin:
1. "For he is unworthy to be numbered among the children of God, and to be a ruler over others, whosoever is desirous to reign and rule in his own house over his wife, children, servants, and maids, and will cause them to give no place to Christ."
2. "The godly (as we have already said) must endeavor, with might and main, to drive from their houses all manner of superstition; secondly, that they have not profane families, but that they keep them under the fear of the Lord."
3. "Nevertheless, it is not to be doubted but that the Lord gave her such an affection, to the end Paul might be the more encouraged to proceed, not only because he saw that he was liberally and courteously entertained, but also because he might thereby judge of the fruit of his doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The practice, however, of infant baptism rests on surer ground than on the doubtful interpretation of any solitary text."
2. "Is it credible, asks Bengel, that in so many families there was no child?"
3. "If infants were capable of spiritual blessings then, why, it may be well asked, should they be thought incapable now?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The river Gangites was handy for the ordinance and she had now been converted and was ready to make this public declaration of her faith in Jesus Christ."
2. "There is nothing here to show whether Lydia's 'household' went beyond 'the women' employed by her who like her had heard the preaching of Paul and had believed."
3. "The use of 'us' shows that Luke was not a householder in Philippi."

### John Gill:
1. "These seem to be her menial servants, who came along with her from her native place upon business, and who attended on her; accordingly the Ethiopic version renders it, 'and she was baptized with all her men'; and these were believers, and are called 'the brethren'..."
2. "Whether Lydia was a maid, a wife, or widow, cannot be said; it looks, however, as if she had no husband now, since she is mentioned as a trader herself..."
3. "Her faith soon worked by love; and by the fruits of righteousness which followed upon it, it appeared to be true and genuine."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who can believe that in so many families there was no infant?"
2. "The souls of the faithful cleave to those by whom they were gained to God."
3. "They did not immediately comply, lest any should imagine they sought their own profit by coming into Macedonia."
