# Acts 16:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this narrative, a woman is possessed by a spirit of divination, specifically the spirit of Python associated with the Pythian Apollo. The presence of this spirit is acknowledged by both the pagan owners and the Christian teachers. Attempts to explain away this account by rationalism are futile as the reality of demonic possession is as unquestionable as any recorded in the Gospel. It is worth noting that the author, Luke, uses the term Python which would naturally come to mind for a Greek physician, emphasizing the resemblance to the convulsive movements and cries of the Pythian priestess at Delphi.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This was a case in which the presence of the spirit was a patent fact, recognized by the heathen possessors and consulters of this female slave, and by them turned to account."
2. "And recognized also by the Christian teachers, as an instance of one of those works of the devil which their Lord came, and commissioned them to destroy."
3. "All attempt to explain away such a narrative as this by the subterfuges of rationalism, is more than ever futile."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reality of this demoniacal possession is as undeniable as that of any in the Gospel history."
2. "A spirit of divination - or, of Python, that is, a spirit supposed to be inspired by the Pythian Apollo, or of the same nature."
3. "Therefore not on the same day with what had just occurred."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whether this was on the same day in which the conversion of Lydia occurred, or at another time, is not mentioned by the historian."
2. "He had a celebrated temple and oracle at Delphi, which was resorted to from all parts of the world, and which was perhaps the only oracle that was in universal repute."
3. "It is plain that Paul regarded this as a case of demoniacal possession, and treated it accordingly."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "According to the legend, as related in the Homeric hymn, Apollo descended from Olympus in order to select a site for his shrine and oracle."
2. "Hence the name of the serpent Python (rotting); Pytho, the name of the place, and the epithet Pythian, applied to Apollo."
3. "Luke, in recording this case, which came under his own observation, uses the term which would naturally suggest itself to a Greek physician, a Python - spirit, presenting phenomena identical with the convulsive movements and wild cries of the Pythian priestess at Delphi."

### John Calvin:
1. "Assuredly, there is nothing more proper to him than to turn away the minds of the people from the word of the gospel, which he doth now will and wish them to hear." 
2. "For what can bear a fairer show than the Popeâ€™s titles, wherein he doth not boast himself to be the adversary of Christ, but his vicar? What can be more plausible than that solemn preface, In the name of the Lord, Amen? Notwithstanding we know, that whilst the hypocritical ministers of Satan do thus pretend the truth, they corrupt it, and, with a deadly corruption, infect it." 
3. "Therefore, so often as you read the divinations of Satan, think upon the just judgment of God. Now, if God so sharply punish the contempt of his light in the profane Gentiles, who have no other teachers but the heaven and earth, how much more sharp punishment do those deserve who wittingly and willingly choke the pure doctrine of salvation, revealed to them in the law and the gospel?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be possessed by the spirit of Pythoness was, in other words, to be possessed by a prophetic spirit or demon."
2. "She was the slave of several joint-owners, who used her unhappy powers as a source of gain for themselves."
3. "Paul, when he met her, and had had several opportunities of observing her, recognised that she was one of those many unhappy beings who, in the first days of Christianity, were afflicted with grievous soul maladies."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Certainly Luke does not mean to credit Apollo with a real existence."
2. "But Plutarch (A.D. 50-100) says that the term Ï€Ï…Î¸Ï‰Î½ÎµÏ‚ was applied to ventriloquists."
3. "This is the so-called instrumental use of the circumstantial participles."

### John Gill:
1. "a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination, met us...and the feasts and plays instituted to the honour of Apollo, were called the Pythian feasts and plays, and the place of the oracle Pythium...this maid, or the spirit in her, pretended to divine and foretell things to come." 
2. "The Jews make this spirit of Python, to be the same with Ob, which we render a familiar spirit...and most of the versions in the Polyglot Bible render it by 'Python'." 
3. "The spirit that was in this maid was a real spirit that possessed her; though some think it was no other than a deluding, devilish, imposture."
