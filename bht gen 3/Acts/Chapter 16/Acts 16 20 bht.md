2. "They put forward the name of Romans, which was in high favour."
3. "As far as religion was concerned, the Romans had affinity with any nation rather than the Jews."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is nothing that will make people more hypocritically conscientious than to denounce, and detect, and destroy their unlawful and dishonest practices."
2. "People slumber quietly in sin, and pursue their wicked gains; they hate or despise all law and all forms of religion; but the moment their course of life is attacked and exposed, they become full of zeal for laws that they Would not themselves hesitate to violate, and for the customs of religion which in their hearts they thoroughly despise."
3. "Worldly-minded people often thus complain that their neighborhoods are disturbed by revivals of religion; and the preaching of the truth, and the attacking of their vices, often arouses this hypocritical conscientiousness, and makes them alarmed for the laws, and for religion, and for order, which they at other times are the first to disturb and disregard."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Magistrates [œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥ŒøŒπœÇ]. Their usual name was duumviri answering to the consuls of Rome; but they took pride in calling themselves strathgoi, or praetors, as being a more honorable title."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The accusation against the Christians in Acts 16:20 was strategically crafted to harm their reputation. Knowing that the Romans held favor towards their name, the accusers cleverly presented the Christians as a threat to Roman interests. The Romans had little affinity for the Jews, viewing them with disdain and suspicion. However, there was some truth in the accusations as the Gospel, with its principle of Godly fear as the driving force behind human action, challenged the godless and revolutionary nature of the world. The response of the magistrates in Philippi, who called themselves strathgoi to appear more honorable, reveals their lack of distinction between Christians and Jews. This lack of recognition contributed to the contemptuous treatment of the Christians, who were seen as troublemakers by the Philippians. Overall, the accusation against the Christians not only aimed to injure their reputation but also showcased the extent of resistance that the Gospel faced in its revolutionary mission.
