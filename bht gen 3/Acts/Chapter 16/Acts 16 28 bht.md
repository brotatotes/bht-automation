## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But one thought filled the apostle's mind at that moment‚Äîanxiety
to save a fellow creature from sending himself into eternity, ignorant of the only way of life." 
2. "His presence of mind appears in the assurance which he so promptly gives to the desperate man, that his prisoners had none of them fled as he feared."
3. "Not less flat is the question, why the other liberated prisoners did not make their escape:‚Äîas if there were the smallest difficulty in understanding how, under the resistless conviction that there must be something supernatural in their instantaneous liberation without human hand, such wonder and awe should possess them as to take away for the time not only all desire of escape, but even all thought on the subject."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do thyself no harm - This is the solemn command of religion in his case, and in all others."
2. "It enjoins upon people to do themselves no harm by self-murder, whether by the sword, the pistol, the halter; by intemperance, by lust, or by dissipation."
3. "In all cases, if it were obeyed, people would do themselves no harm. They would promote their own best interests here, and their eternal welfare hereafter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are all here."
2. "The prisoners, we are especially told, had been listening to the sweet, solemn Hebrew hymns of Paul and Silas when the earthquake and its accompanying marvels took place."
3. "The words of Paul stayed the would-be suicide‚Äôs hand."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Do thyself no harm (ŒºŒ∑Œ¥ŒµŒΩ œÄœÅŒ±ŒæŒ∑ŒπœÇ œÉŒµŒ±œÖœÑœâ Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩ). The usual construction (ŒºŒ∑ and the aorist subjunctive) for a prohibition not to begin to do a thing."
2. "The older Greek would probably have used œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÉŒ∑ŒπœÇ here. The later Greek does not always preserve the old distinction between œÄŒøŒπŒµœâ, to do a thing, and œÄœÅŒ±œÉœÉœâ, to practice."
3. "The jailor was at the outer door and he wanted lights to see what was inside in the inner prison."

### John Gill:
1. "Knowing by divine revelation, what the jailer was about to do... he knew in the same way, what designs of grace God had towards this man and his family."
2. "Saying, do thyself no harm; which is an instance of great tenderness, humanity, and love, to one that had used him and his companion with so much severity and cruelty."
3. "For we are all here; not only Paul and Silas, but the rest of the prisoners also... to show the power of God, what he could do, and his presence with his servants."

### John Wesley:
1. "But Paul cried ‚Äî As they were all then in the dark, it is not easy to say, how Paul knew of the jailer's purpose; unless it were by some immediate notice from God, which is by no means incredible."
2. "With a loud voice ‚Äî Through earnestness, and because he was at some distance."
3. "Do thyself no harm ‚Äî Although the Christian faith opens the prospect into another life, yet it absolutely forbids and effectually prevents a man's discharging himself from this."
