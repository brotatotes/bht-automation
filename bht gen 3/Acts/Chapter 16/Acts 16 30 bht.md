## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The circumstantiality of the account shews that some eyewitness related it."
2. "His question connected with the words, 'the way of salvation,' of the dÃ¦moniac in ver. 17, makes it necessary to infer, as De Wette well observes, that he had previously become acquainted with the subject of their preaching."
3. "Sirs is literally Lords: they will not take this title to themselves, but tell him of One who was alone worthy of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Only one explanation of it can be givenâ€”that he had become all at once alarmed about his spiritual state, and that though, a moment before, he was ready to plunge into eternity with the guilt of self-murder on his head, without a thought of the sin he was committing and its awful consequences, his unfitness to appear before God, and his need of salvation, now flashed full upon his soul and drew from the depths of his spirit the cry here recorded."
2. "If still it be asked how it could take such definite shape, let it be considered [that] the jailer could hardly be ignorant of the nature of the charges on which these men had been imprisoned."
3. "Then would flash across him the light of a new discovery; 'That was a true cry which the Pythoness uttered, 'These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation! That I now must know, and from them, as divinely sent to me, must I learn that way of salvation!'"

### Albert Barnes:

2. "He knew that they were cast in prison for no other cause, save only because they did overthrow the common estate of religion. Now he is ready to hear their doctrine which he had before contemned."
3. "The wicked oftentimes when they see wonders, though they tremble for a time, yet are they straightway made more obstinate... But in this place the keeper (acknowledging the power of God) was not only a little afraid...but he showeth himself obedient to God, and desirous of sound and wholesome doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" 
2. "The question in the other sense appears abrupt, it is true; but we are to remember that Luke has recorded only parts of the transaction."
