# Acts 16:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Considering who the person was that asked the question‚Äîa heathen in the depths of ignorance and sin‚Äîand how indisputably therefore the answer embraces all sinners whatever, there perhaps does not stand on record a more important answer than this. The brevity, simplicity, and directness of this reply are singularly beautiful. Enough at that moment to have his faith directed simply to the Saviour, with the assurance that this would bring the needed salvation. This is the heart of the matter: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Considering who the person was that asked the question,‚Äîa heathen in the depths of ignorance and sin,‚Äîand how indisputably therefore the answer embraces all sinners whatever,‚Äîthere perhaps does not stand on record in the whole book a more important answer than this of Paul."

3. "There is a brief but remarkable comment of Alford‚Äôs on Paul‚Äôs answer to the Philippian jailor‚Äôs question as to how he should be saved: 'We may remark, in the face of all attempts to establish a development of St. Paul‚Äôs doctrine according to mere external circumstances, that this reply, 'Faith in Jesus only can save,' was given before any one of his extant epistles was written.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To be saved (ŒπŒΩŒ± œÉœâŒ∏œâ). What did he mean by 'saved'? Certainly more than escape from peril about the prisoners or because of the earthquake, though these had their influences on him."
