# Acts 16:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The magistrates' decision to release Paul and Silas may have been influenced by calmer thinking, reflection on their injustice, and the fear caused by the earthquake. This natural phenomenon was seen as a sign of divine anger and would have triggered remorse. Aware of the consequences of mistreating a Roman citizen, the magistrates chose to set the apostles free, possibly due to the same power that caused the earthquake softening their hearts.
