# Acts 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle's route through Asia was uncertain, for they were hindered by the Holy Spirit from preaching there. Paul, Silas, and Timothy passed through the regions of Phrygia and Galatia, as they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in Asia. This prohibition opened the way for the gospel to be introduced into Europe and for Paul and Barnabas to embark on a more important and wider field of ministry in Macedonia. The faithful should understand that they were called freely when others were set aside, for it is due to the mercy of God alone.
