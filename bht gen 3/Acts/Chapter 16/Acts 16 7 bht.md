# Acts 16:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit of Jesus played a remarkable role in guiding Paul's apostolic endeavors. Hindered by the Holy Spirit from going into Asia, Paul was led to Bithynia, marking a new epoch in his missionary work. This immediate and independent operation of the Spirit showcased the significance of divine guidance. Though the reasons behind this redirection remained unclear, the impact of such a strong impression should not be underestimated. Notably, although unable to preach in Bithynia at that time, the Gospel was eventually preached there, leading to the establishment of churches.
