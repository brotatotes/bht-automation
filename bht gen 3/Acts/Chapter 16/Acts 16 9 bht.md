## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The vision seems to have appeared in the same way as that sent to Peter in ch. x. It was an unreal apparition, designed to convey a practical meaning."
2. "The context precludes our understanding it as a dream."
3. "There would hardly be any peculiarity of dress by which a Macedonian could be recognized."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But it was a cry not of conscious desire for the Gospel, but of deep need of it and unconscious preparedness to receive it."
2. "That the highest splendor of heathendom...had arrived at the end of all its resources."
3. "This voice cries from heathendom still to the Christian Church, and never does the Church undertake the work of missions, nor any missionary go forth from it, in the right spirit, save in obedience to this cry."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whether this was in a dream, or whether it was a representation made to the senses while awake, it is impossible to tell."
2. "To this call, notwithstanding all this prospect of danger, Paul and Silas cheerfully responded, and gave themselves to the work."
3. "Appeals are coming from every quarter, and all that seems now necessary for the speedy conversion of the world is for the church to enter into these vast fields with the self-denial, the spirit, and the zeal which characterized the apostle Paul."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord did not always observe the same manner of revelation, because divers kinds are more convenient for confirmation."
2. "The gospel is the power of God to salvation, those which are the ministers of God are said to help those who perish; that having delivered them from death, they may bring them unto the inheritance of eternal life."
3. "All people unto whom the gospel is brought are taught reverently to embrace the ministers thereof as deliverers, unless they will maliciously reject the grace of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Twice Paul had been hindered by the Holy Spirit from going where he wanted to go. Most men would have gone back home with such rebuffs, but not so Paul."
2. "The narrative must not be robbed of its supernatural aspect."
3. "It was the cry of Europe for Christ."

1. "Macedonia was a very large country in Europe; which formerly consisted, as Pliny says, of a hundred and fifty people, or nations."
2. "Troas, where the apostle now was, when he had this vision, was just by the Hellespont, over which he must go to Macedonia."
3. "This shows what a miserable condition this country was in; and that God had some chosen people among them to gather in, whose time was now come."

### John Wesley:
1. "A vision appeared to Paul by night â€” It was not a dream, though it was by night."
2. "No other dream is mentioned in the New Testament than that of Joseph and of Pilate's wife."
3. "Help us â€” Against Satan, ignorance, and sin."
