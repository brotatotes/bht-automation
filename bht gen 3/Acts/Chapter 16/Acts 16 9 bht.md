## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "There would hardly be any peculiarity of dress by which a Macedonian could be recognized."
3. "A man of Macedonia known probably by the affecting words spoken by him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This visional Macedonian discovered himself by what he said. But it was a cry not of conscious desire for the Gospel, but of deep need of it and unconscious preparedness to receive it." 
2. "It was a virtual confession 'that the highest splendor of heathendom...had arrived at the end of all its resources."

3. "Openings of a similar character for the introduction of the gospel are presented in all lands."

### John Calvin:
1. "For, seeing that the gospel is the power of God to salvation...those which are the ministers of God are said to help those who perish; that having delivered them from death, they may bring them unto the inheritance of eternal life."

2. "This shows what a miserable condition this country was in; and that God had some chosen people among them to gather in, whose time was now come."
3. "This angel presided over the whole country, and was their tutelar angel, as some think."
