# Acts 17:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From Philippi, it is likely that Timothy accompanied Paul and Silas as they traveled to Thessalonica on the Via Egnatia, a significant road that connected Macedonia to the Adriatic. Along the way, they passed by Amphipolis and Apollonia, where it seems there was no opportunity or need to preach the Gospel. Thessalonica, however, was a strategic center for spreading the word of the Lord throughout Macedonia and Achaia. Although the apostle hurried through these two sizable cities, the significance of Thessalonica as a bustling seaport and commercial hub made it an important place to proclaim the Gospel.

2. "But because he knew that Christ was given to the Jews for salvation, and that he himself was made an apostle upon this condition, that he should preach repentance and faith, first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles, committing the success of his labor to the Lord, he obeyeth his commandment, (though he had no great hope to do good.)"
