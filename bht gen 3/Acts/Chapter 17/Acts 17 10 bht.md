## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The general character of the narrative seems to be, that where Paul, or Paul and Silas, are alone or principally concerned, all mention of the rest is suspended."
3. "Both these facts, especially the last, seeing that the distance from Philippi was 100 Roman miles, make it very improbable that his stay was so short as from three to four weeks."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For it would have been as useless as rash to attempt any further preaching at that time."
2. "The conviction of this probably made his friends the more willing to pledge themselves against any present continuance of missionary effort."

### Albert Barnes:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The magistrates, dreading a fresh outbreak on the part of these suspected Orientals, and the Christian community knowing the bitter and sleepless hostility of the Jews, determined it was best for the peace and wellbeing of the growing community of believers in Jesus that the great and hated teacher should, for a time at least, absent himself."
2. "Berea. A city of no great fame in history, about sixty miles from Thessalonica. It was a favourite dwelling-place for the Jews...Paul seems to have had marked success there among the Jewish population; but, strange to say, the name of Berea is never mentioned by him in any of his epistles."

3. "Who coming thither; to Berea; that is, Paul and Silas: went into the synagogue of the Jews; which was in that city; not being at all daunted or discouraged with what they had met with at Thessalonica."
