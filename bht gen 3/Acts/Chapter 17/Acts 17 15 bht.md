3. "In Beza's ancient copy it follows, 'but he passed through Thessalia, for he was forbidden to preach the word to them'; for as he came from Berea to Athens, he must come through Thessalia; but he made no stay here, but passed through, being forbid to preach the Gospel here, as he had been before to preach it in Asia and Bithynia, Acts 16:6."
