## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The multitude of statues and temples to the gods in Athens is celebrated with honour."
2. "Xenophon says of Athens, that 'the whole city is an altar, the whole city a sacrifice and an offering to the gods.'"
3. "The whole city a sacrifice and an offering to the gods."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It was easier to find a god at Athens than a man."
2. "All this majesty and beauty had placed itself between man and his Creator, and bound him the faster to his gods, who were not God."
3. "Upon the first contact, therefore, which the Spirit of Christ came into with the sublimest creations of human art, the judgment of the Holy Ghost‚Äîthrough which they have all to pass‚Äîis set up as 'the strait gate,' and this must remain the correct standard forever."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His spirit was stirred in him - His mind was greatly excited. The word used here (œÄŒ±œÅœâŒæœÖÃÅŒΩŒµœÑŒø paroÃÑxuneto) denotes ‚Äúany excitement, agitation, or paroxysm of mind,‚Äù 1 Corinthians 13:5. It here means that the mind of Paul was greatly concerned, or agitated, doubtless with pity and distress at their folly and danger."
2. "Yet there is no account that the mind of Paul was filled with admiration; there is no record that he spent his time in examining the works of art; there is no evidence that he forgot his high purpose in an idle and useless contemplation of temples and statuary. His was a Christian mind; and he contemplated all this with a Christian heart."
3. "Happy would it be if every Christian traveler who visits cities of wealth and splendor would, like Paul, be affected in view of their crimes and dangers; stud happy if, like him, people could cease their unbounded admiration of magnificence and splendor in temples, and palaces, and statuary, to regard the condition of mind, not perishable like marble of the soul, more magnificent even in its ruins than all the works of Phidias or Praxiteles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word, which occurs only here in the New Testament, and nowhere in classical Greek, means full of idols. It applies to the city, not to the inhabitants."
2. "In one street there stood before every house a square pillar carrying upon it a bust of the God Hermes. Another street, named the Street of the Tripods, was lined with tripods, dedicated by winners in the Greek national games, and carrying each one an inscription to a deity."
3. "Every street, every square, nay, every purlieu, had its sanctuaries, and a Roman poet bitterly remarked that it was easier in Athens to find gods than men."

### John Calvin:
1. "The vanity of man's wisdom is here marked with eternal infamy by the Spirit of God; because, where it was principally resident, there was the darkness more thick."
2. "In that Paul was wroth when he saw the name of God wickedly profaned, and his pure worship corrupted, he did thereby declare that nothing was to him more precious than the glory of God."
3. "He is pricked forward with a more sharp prick to maintain godliness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The great cities he was acquainted with, such as Antioch in the east and Thessalonica in the west, were busy commercial centres, full of life and energy, despising rather, while at the same time practising, idolatry."
2. "Ah belles et chastes images, vrais dieux et vraies D√©esses, tremblez, voici celui qui l√®vera contre vous le Marteau. Le mot fatal est prononc√©, vous √™tes des idoles, l‚Äôerreur de ce laid petit Juif sera votre arr√™t de mort."
3. "The Greek word rendered 'wholly given up to idolatry' (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµŒπÃÅŒ¥œâŒªŒøŒΩ) only occurs in this passage, but is formed after the analogy of other similar compounded words, such as Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨Œ¥ŒµŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ, a place full of trees so as to be overgrown by them; Œ∫Œ±œÑœçŒºœÄŒµŒªŒøœÇ, a place full of vines. The word here would be translated more accurately, 'full of idols.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Before they came and after they left, Paul felt lonely in Athens."
2. "The idolatry and sensualism of it all glared at him."
3. "Paul knew paganism better than Renan."

### John Gill:
1. "His spirit was stirred in him; not only his soul was troubled and his heart was grieved, but he was exasperated and provoked to the last degree."
2. "He had a burning fire in his bones, and was weary with forbearing, and could not stay; his zeal wanted vent, and he gave it."
3. "With all their learning and wisdom they knew not God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having no design, as it seems, to preach at Athens..."
2. "His zeal for God drew him into it unawares..."
3. "Without staying till his companions came."
