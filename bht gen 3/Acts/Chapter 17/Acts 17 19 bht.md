## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It might be expected that on the hill of Mars the mind of the stranger would be impressed with the magnificence of the religion which he sought to overthrow."
2. "Christianity advanced more meekly and surely: and though the immediate effect of the Apostleâ€™s sermon was not great, the Parthenon in time became a Christian church."
3. "Athens ceased to be a city wholly given to idolatry,â€”and the repugnance of the Greeks to images became so great, as to be a principal cause of the schism between the churches of the east and west in the eighth century."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No place in Athens was so suitable for a discourse on the mysteries of religion."
2. "The apostle, however, was not here on his trial, but to expound more fully what he had thrown out in broken conversations in the Agora."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "On many accounts this was the most celebrated tribunal in the world. Its decisions were distinguished for justice and correctness; nor was there any court in Greece in which so much confidence was placed." 
2. "May we know - We would know. This seems to have been a respectful inquiry; and it does not appear that Paul was brought there for the sake of trial." 
3. "It was just an instance of the inquisitive spirit of the people of Athens, willing to hear before they condemned, and to examine before they approved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It was a scene with which the dread recollections of centuries were associated. Those who withdrew to the Areopagus from the Agora, came, as it were, into the presence of a higher power."
2. "No place in Athens was so suitable for a discourse upon the mysteries of religion."
3. "The judges sat in the open air upon seats hewn out in the rock, on a platform ascended by a flight of stone steps immediately from the market - place."

### John Calvin:
1. "And that which followeth shortly after, touching the nature and conditions [manners] of the men of Athens, doth sufficiently declare that their curiosity was the cause; that Paul had such audience given him, that he had such a famous place granted him to preach Christ in, that so many came together." 
2. "and surely we see that curious men are like rent barrels."
3. "Now, though there were small hope to do any good among curious men, yet Paul did not neglect the opportunity, if, peradventure, he might gain some of a great company to Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On this spot, writes Howson (St. Paul), 'a long series of awful causes connected with crime and religion had been determined, beginning with the legendary trial of Mars [Ares], which gave to the place the name of 'Mars' Hill.'"
2. "The once famous and powerful Court of the Areopagus at most could only pretend to a jurisdiction over the city and its immediate neighbourhood. It seems, however, to have laid claim to and wielded powers far greater and more comprehensive than a merely local magisterial jurisdiction."
3. "Before such a body of men Paul was probably courteously invited to set forth at length those 'strange religious doctrines' he had been preaching with such marked success in the Macedonian cities of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But 'the court of refined and polished Athenians was very different from the rough provincial magistrates of Philippi, and the philosophers who presented Paul to their cognizance very different from the mob of Thessalonians' (Rackham). It was all very polite."
2. "May we know? (Î”Ï…Î½Î±Î¼ÎµÎ¸Î± Î³Î½Ï‰Î½Î±). Can we come to know (ingressive second aorist active infinitive)."
3. "This new teaching (Î· ÎºÎ±Î¹Î½Î· Î±Ï…Ï„Î· Î´Î¹Î´Î±Ï‡Î·). On the position of Î±Ï…Ï„Î· see Robertson, Grammar, pp. 700f. The question was prompted by courtesy, sarcasm, or irony. Evidently no definite charge was laid against Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "They took him along with them in a friendly manner, and had him to a more convenient place for preaching and disputation."
2. "and this might be Dionysius, who is called the Areopagite, and was converted by the apostle."
3. "they call his doctrine new, not so much by way of reproach, as suggesting it to be a reason why they inquired after it."

1. "The Areopagus, or hill of Mars, (dedicated to Mars, the heathen god of war,) was the place where the Athenians held their supreme court of judicature."
2. "The original number of its judges was twelve; but afterward it increased to three hundred."
3. "These were generally men of the greatest families in Athens, and were famed for justice and integrity."

The setting, so laden with history and grandeur, showcased the clash between the magnificence of the idolatry being challenged by Christianity's meek yet sure advancement.
