## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is what the Apostle elsewhere says, that he became to those not under the law as not under the law, that he might win those not under the law."
2. "It was given to the Apostle in this hour, what he should speak; this is plainly to be seen in the following discourse...a masterpiece of apostolic wisdom."
3. "He who is (by your own involuntary confession) unknown to you Athenians (religious though you are),...now commandeth all men (by me His minister) to repent, that they may know Him, and to believe in the Man whom He hath raised from the dead, that they may stand in the judgment, which He hath committed to Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitiousâ€”rather...in all respects extremely reverential or much given to religious worship."
2. "This prefatory allusion to the position he occupied shows the writer's wish to bring the situation vividly before us."
3. "The authorized translation would imply that only too much superstitition was wrong, and represents the apostle as repelling his hearers in the very first sentence; whereas the whole discourse is studiously courteous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No happier instance can be found of cool, collected argumentation than is furnished in this discourse."
2. "It properly means 'reverence for the gods'...and in this sense it accords with our word 'superstitious.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul would have been unlikely to begin his address with a charge which would have awakened the anger of his audience. What he means to say is, You are more divinity-fearing than the rest of the Greeks."
2. "This propensity to reverence the higher powers is a good thing in itself, only, as he shows them, it is misdirected, not rightly conscious of its object and aim."
3. "Paul proposes to guide the sentiment rightly by revealing him whom they ignorantly worship."

### John Calvin:
1. "We see how miserable their condition is who have not the certain light of the truth, because they do both always doubt in themselves, and lose their labor before God."
2. "Notwithstanding, we must note that the unbelievers, whilst that they sometimes make themselves blind through voluntary stubbornness, and are sometimes amidst divers and manifold doubts, [yet] strive and fight with themselves."
3. "Finally, though superstition be not always fearful, yet forasmuch as it is inwrapt in divers errors, it disquieteth menâ€™s minds, and doth prick them with divers blind torments."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was the proclamation of the religion of the future (though they guessed it not then) in the face of the dying religion of the past."
2. "This 'revelation' was his high mission, to tell them of that 'Great Unknown' whose existence and whose majesty this solitary, nameless altar, at least, showed they suspected."
3. "Surely we must never seek for Him in any earthly representation, however beautiful and costly, never in any image hewn by man, be it of marble, of silver, or of gold."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul does not speak as a man on trial, but as one trying to get a hearing for the gospel of Christ."
2. "Î”ÎµÎ¹ÏƒÎ¹Î´Î±Î¹Î¼Ï‰Î½ is a neutral word (from Î´ÎµÎ¹Î´Ï‰, to fear, and Î´Î±Î¹Î¼Ï‰Î½, deity). The Greeks used it either in the good sense of pious or religious or the bad sense of superstitious."

3. "This manner of addressing them, both as citizens of Athens, and as very religious persons, and who, as such, greatly exceeded all others, must greatly tend to engage their attention to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Paul in his divinely philosophical discourse, begins with the first, and goes on to the last things, both which were new things to them."
2. "He points out the origin and the end of all things, concerning which they had so many disputes, and equally refutes both the Epicurean and Stoic."
3. "With what clearness and freedom does he speak! Paul against Athens!"
