# Acts 17:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The doctrine of Creation refutes idolatry and lays the groundwork for the doctrine of Redemption. God does not dwell in temples made by human hands but is the Lord of heaven and earth, governing all His creation. This challenges the beliefs of the Epicureans and Stoics who deny God's role in creation and opposes the idea of multiple gods. Instead, there is one God who made the universe and is separate from all other gods.
