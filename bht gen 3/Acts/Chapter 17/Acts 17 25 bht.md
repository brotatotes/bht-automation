# Acts 17:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Deity, the Creator and Preserver of all, does not truly need anything from us. He is not dependent on us for His happiness or gain. The God Paul was preaching is the source of life, breath, and everything. Our worship and offerings cannot add anything to His essential glory and happiness. This concept of God's self-sufficiency would have shed light on the minds of candid heathens. The Epicureans missed this truth by placing God outside the universe, while Paul surpasses all Greek philosophers in proclaiming the truth about the Supreme Personal God.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is worshipped [Œ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖŒµœÑŒ±Œπ] . Incorrect. Rendel; as Rev., served. Luke often uses the word in the sense of to heal or cure; but this is its primary sense."
2. "It refers to the clothing of the images of the gods in splendid garments, and bringing them costly gifts and offerings of food and drink."

### John Calvin:
1. "But we may readily answer, that the faithful did never properly place the worship of God in ceremonies; but they did only count them helps wherewith they might exercise themselves according to their infirmity."
2. "And God himself saith plainly in many places, that he doth not pass for any external or visible thing, that ceremonies are of themselves of no importance, and that he is worshipped no otherwise but by faith, a pure conscience, by prayer and thankfulness."
3. "Therefore, because all mortal men, from the highest to the lowest, do think that God is pacified with external things, and they will, with their own works, fulfill their duty towards him, that doth Paul refute."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The men of the heathen world loved to spend their wealth on the adornment of the temples of the gods, to whom also they brought costly offerings of food and drink, as though these imaginary eternal beings needed such things."
2. "Paul‚Äôs words were the outcome of a mind steeped in the often-repeated reminders and reproaches of the prophets, that the God of Israel was not to be worshipped with sacrifice and incense, but with a pure, noble life."
3. "The God Paul was preaching to them not merely was the All-Creator but also the All-Preserver. Their very breath, by means of which from minute to minute each mortal lived, was His gift."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This self-sufficiency of God was taught by Philo and Lucretius, but Paul shows that the Epicurean missed it by putting God, if existing at all, outside the universe."
2. "Seeing he himself giveth to all. This Supreme Personal God is the source of life, breath, and everything."

3. "He that gives them all things, cannot want anything himself, nor receive anything at their hands."

2. "To all ‚Äî That live and breathe;-in him we live; and breathe - In him we move."
3. "I breathe this moment: the next is not in my power: and all things - For in him we are."
