# Acts 17:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle's affirmation of the unity of the human race contradicts the polytheistic belief in varying origins and guardian gods. By opposing Stoical Fate and Epicurean Chance, Paul ascribes the periods and localities in which men and nations flourish to the sovereign will and prearrangements of a living God. This cosmopolitan view rises above the divisions of Jew and Greek, claiming the one God as the Creator of the one race of men. God reveals himself in the history of all men, as well as in the Chosen People of Israel.
