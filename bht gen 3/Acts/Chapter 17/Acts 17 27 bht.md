# Acts 17:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though we may feel distant from God, it is our own ignorance that keeps us from Him. Our purpose is to seek the Lord and find Him, even in our blind search for truth. The blinding effect of sin may make it difficult to find God outside of revealed religion, but He is actually near to each one of us. He has placed us on this earth to help us discover Him and His character, and we can find Him if we truly seek Him.
