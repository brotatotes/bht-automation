# Acts 17:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Seeking after God is not about finding a distant deity, but rather acknowledging our ignorance of Him. We may grope and feel after Him like men in the dark, as He is not far from any of us. The difficulty lies not in God's distance, but in our distance from Him due to sin. However, seeking Him should be our highest purpose, for through the contemplation of His works, we can grasp His power, wisdom, and goodness.
