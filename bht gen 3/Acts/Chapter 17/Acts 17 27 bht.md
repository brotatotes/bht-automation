# Acts 17:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is through our ignorance of Him that we perceive God as distant, when He is not far from each one of us. The purpose of our existence is to seek the Lord, to grope and feel after Him in the darkness. God has graciously granted us the opportunity to know Him through His creation, engraving manifest marks of His glory throughout the world. Though imperfect, our search for God is open, for He is very near, even within us.
