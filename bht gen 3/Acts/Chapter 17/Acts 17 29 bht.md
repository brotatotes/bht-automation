# Acts 17:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being the offspring of God, we must not think that the Godhead is comparable to gold, silver, or stone engravings crafted by human art. The apostle Paul makes it clear that these lifeless idols cannot match the magnificence and wisdom of the Creator. As he stood amidst the statues of divinities in Athens, he highlighted the profound difference between these sculptures and the true glory of God. We should never reduce the infinite and incomparable nature of our Creator to mere physical representations.

- Attempt 1 BHT: As the offspring of God, it is absurd for us to think that the Godhead can be likened to objects made by human hands, such as gold, silver, or stone engravings. These lifeless idols are far inferior to the greatness and wisdom of the Creator. The apostle Paul points out the folly of such thinking, especially as he stood in the midst of a city surrounded by statues of divinities. The beauty and artistry of these sculptures could not compare to the true glory and majesty of God. To ascribe a bodily form or image to our Creator is to diminish and distort his infinite glory. We, who are made in the image of God, should not compare ourselves to graven images, and therefore it is even more unthinkable to compare God Himself to such things. Let us remember the incomparable nature of our Creator and worship Him in spirit and truth.
