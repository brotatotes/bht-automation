# Acts 17:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Paul addressed the Greeks in Athens, he encountered mixed reactions to his message about the resurrection of the dead. While some openly mocked and rejected his words, others expressed curiosity and a willingness to hear more at a later time. The Greeks, deeply rooted in their own beliefs and philosophy, found the idea of resurrection absurd and incompatible with their worldview. Nevertheless, Paul's speech demonstrated both prudence in not needlessly offending his listeners and boldness in proclaiming the Gospel, despite facing ridicule and skepticism.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We must not allot these two parties, as some have done, the former to the Epicureans, the latter to the Stoicks: the description is general."
2. "The words, we will hear thee again of this matter, need not be taken as ironical."
3. "The hearing not having taken place is no proof that it was not intended at the time: and the distinction between these and the mockers seems to imply that these were in earnest."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Resurrection, which presupposes the vanity of the present life, and is nothing but life out of the death of all that sin has blighted, could have no charm for the true Greek."
2. "It gave the death blow to his fundamental and most cherished ideas; nor until these were seen to be false and fatal could the Resurrection, and the Gospel of which it was a primary doctrine, seem otherwise than ridiculous."
3. "others said, We will hear thee again of this... an idle compliment to Paul and an opiate to their consciences."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead was believed by none of the Greeks; it seemed incredible; and they regarded it as so absurd as not to admit of an argument."
2. "It has not been uncommon for even professed philosophers to mock at the doctrines of religion, and to meet the arguments of Christianity with a sneer."
3. "People who defer inquiry on the subject of religion seldom find the favorable period arrive. Those who propose to examine its doctrines at a future time often do it to avoid the inconvenience of becoming Christians now, and as a plausible and easy way of rejecting the gospel altogether, without appearing to be rude, or to give offence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Resurrection. This word was the signal for a derisive outburst from the crowd."
2. "In this remarkable speech of Paul are to be noted: his prudence and tact in not needlessly offending his hearers; his courtesy and spirit of conciliation in recognizing their piety toward their gods."
3. "His boldness in proclaiming Jesus and the resurrection among those to whom these truths were foolishness."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this we see how great the carelessness of men is, whom neither the tribunal-seat of God, nor the majesty of the highest [supreme] Judge, doth make afraid." (Commentary, 32)
2. "This doctrine, which they go about to make of none effect, shall so gird them, that they shall at length perceive that they have striven in vain with their snare." (Commentary, 307)
3. "Surely this desire was contrary to loathsomeness." (Commentary, 308)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter." 
2. "The Areo-pagites seem to have been divided, some openly mocking Paul and his doctrines; some in doubt seemingly wishing to hear him again, after probably his strange revelation had been discussed in private."
3. "The mockers, however, and the men who feared lest their interests should suffer if these new things were publicly taught, prevailed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Greeks believed that the souls of men lived on, but they had no conception of resurrection of the body."
2. "Some mocked... In contempt at Paul's statement they declined to listen further to 'this babbler' who had now lost what he had gained with this group of hearers."
3. "They were unconvinced, but had better manners and so were in favour of an adjournment. This was done, though it is not clear whether it was a serious postponement or a courteous refusal to hear Paul further."

### John Gill:
1. "It is a doctrine of pure revelation, and what the light of nature never taught men, and by which men being only guided, have declared against, and have treated it with the utmost ridicule and contempt."
2. "Some think these were of the Stoic sect, who held a future state, and that the soul would live after the body, and had some notions which looked inclining to this doctrine: however, these thought there might be something in what the apostle said; they could not receive it readily, and yet could not deny it."
3. "They were willing to take time to consider of it; and were desirous of hearing him again upon that subject; in which they might be very open and upright; and this might not be a mere excuse to shift off any further hearing at that time."

### John Wesley:
1. "Some mocked â€” Interrupting him thereby."
2. "They took offence at that which is the principal motive of faith, from the pride of reason."
3. "And having once stumbled at this, they rejected all the rest."
