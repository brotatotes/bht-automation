# Acts 17:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this state of the popular mind, the speech of Paul in Athens may not have been quite complete. Whether he intended to open up the Gospel scheme before being interrupted or reserved it for later exposition to earnest inquirers is unclear. As he walked out of Athens never to return, questions arise. Did Paul fail to make an impact, or was there simply little hope of saving the Athenians? It is worth noting that Paul was alone in Athens, and the report of his speech must have been given by the apostle himself.
