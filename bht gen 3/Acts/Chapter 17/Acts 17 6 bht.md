# Acts 17:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Politarchs, the rulers of Thessalonica, governed the city with precision and accuracy, as confirmed by an inscription found on the spot. The Christian believers, with their message of the gospel, had already made a significant impact, as rumors of them turning the world upside down had reached the inhabitants of Thessalonica. Despite facing hostility and being dragged before the rulers of the city, it is important to note that the purpose of the gospel is to bring peace and reconciliation with God, rather than to incite disorder and conflict.

2. "Thessalonica was not a colony, but a free city (see on colony, ch. 16 12), and was governed by its own rulers, whose titles accordingly did not follow those of Roman magistrates."
3. "The word occurs only here and verse 8, and has been found in an inscription on an arch at Thessalonica, where the names of the seven politarchs are mentioned."

### John Calvin:
1. "The gospel is not preached to this end that it may set men together by the ears; but rather that it may keep them in peace, being reconciled to God."

2. "The power of life and death, for instance, so jealously withheld from the Jerusalem Jews, belonged to the local magistrates of a 'free city.'"
3. "These that have turned the world upside down. These strange words, Alford remarks, presuppose some rumour of Christianity and its spread having before reached the inhabitants of Thessalonica."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They dragged (ŒµœÉœÖœÅŒøŒΩ). Imperfect active, vivid picture, they were dragging (literally)." 
2. "Before the rulers of the city (ŒµœÄ œÑŒøœÖœÇ œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒ±œÅœáŒ±œÇ). This word does not occur in Greek literature and used to be cited as an example of Luke's blunders. But now it is found in an inscription on an arch in the modern city preserved in the British Museum."

The use of ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ (supply Œ≥ŒµŒΩ or œáœâœÅŒ±ŒΩ, the inhabited earth, present passive participle of ŒøŒπŒ∫Œµœâ) means the Roman Empire, since it is a political charge, a natural hyperbole in their excitement, but the phrase occurs for the Roman Empire in Luke 2:1."

### John Gill:
1. "These that have turned the world upside down: the apostles, according to the cry of these men, had thrown the whole world into disorder." 
2. "They had made disturbances in kingdoms and cities, wherever they came; and had made innovations in religion, and turned men from their old way of worship to another."
3. "To make the like disorders and disturbances, as elsewhere."
