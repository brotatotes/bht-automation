# Acts 17:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews accused the Christians of declaring that there is another king, one Jesus, based on Paul's preaching about the kingdom of Christ. This charge of treason against Caesar was serious, as the law was elastic and could be applied to both a licentious republic and a despotic usurper. Going against the decrees of Caesar was considered a sure way to get a conviction. However, the accusation missed the true grounds of discontent and Jason's hospitality towards Christ was also mentioned. Paul's preaching on the royal state of Christ's second advent had an impact.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law of treason, by which the ancient legislators of the republic had sought to protect popular liberty from the encroachments of tyranny,... was gradually concentrated upon the emperor alone, the sole impersonation of the sovereign people."
2. "The accusation substituted is that of treason against the emperor; that of which Jesus was accused before Pilate."
3. "The definition of the crime itself was loose and elastic, such as equally became the jealousy of a licentious republic or of a despotic usurper."

2. "The Papists know full well, and they be sufficiently convict before God, that that is more than false which they lay to our charge..."
3. "If at any time religion enforces us to resist tyrannical edicts and commandments which forbid us to give due honor to Christ, and due worship to God; we may then justly say for ourselves, that we are not rebellious against kings, for they be not so exalted, that they may go about like giants to pull God out of his seat and throne."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is observable that the complaint did not touch the real ground of discontent." 
2. "The accusation...charged an obnoxious person with treason against Caesar."

Note the very order of the words in the Greek indirect discourse with the accusative and infinitive after ŒªŒµŒ≥ŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ. ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒ± ŒµœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ comes first, a different king, another emperor than Caesar."
