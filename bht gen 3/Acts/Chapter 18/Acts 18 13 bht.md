# Acts 18:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusation against Paul was that he acted contrary to the law, specifically the Mosaic law and Roman law, with the intention of introducing new deities and teaching people to worship in an unlawful and irregular way. However, the accusation lacked evidence and was false, as Moses himself wrote about Christ and commanded the Israelites to listen to him. The Jews may have been cautious when dealing with Gallio, a Roman proconsul, but their accusations were baseless, and Paul's actions did not violate any legitimate laws.
