# Acts 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The governor Gallio's indifference towards the complaints and persecutions brought against Paul by the Jews reflects his contempt for them and his general religious indifference. This indifference is seen in his lack of interference when Sosthenes, the chief complainant and ruler of the synagogue, is beaten by the Greeks. It is noteworthy that Sosthenes, who initially sought to persecute Paul, eventually becomes a Christian himself, highlighting the ironic turn of events in which the persecutor becomes a follower.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Sosthenes, as the ruler of the synagogue, had been the chief of the complainant Jews, and therefore, on their cause being rejected, and themselves ignominiously dismissed, was roughly treated by the mob."
2. "The carelessness of Gallio about the matter clearly seems to be a further instance of his contempt for the Jews, and indisposition to favour them or their persecution of Paul."
3. "'So little did the information against Paul prosper that the informers themselves were beaten without interference of the judge.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And Gallio cared for none of those thingsâ€”nothing loath, perhaps, to see these turbulent Jews, for whom probably he felt contempt, themselves getting what they hoped to inflict on another, and indifferent to whatever was beyond the range of his office and case." 
2. "His brother eulogizes his loving and lovable manners." 
3. "Religious indifference, under the influence of an easy and amiable temper, reappears from age to age."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Greeks would feel no small measure of indignation at these disturbers of the public peace, and they took this opportunity to express their rage."
2. "By the testimony of ancient writers he was a most mild and amiable man, arid an upright and just judge."
3. "That he did not deem it to be his duty, or a part of his office, to settle questions of a theological nature that were started among the Jews."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Cared for none of these things. Not said to indicate his indifference to religion, but simply that he did not choose to interfere in this case.


### John Calvin:
1. "And though there be no mention made of him before among the faithful, yet it is to be thought that he was then one of Paulâ€™s companions and advocates."
2. "The frowardness of manâ€™s nature is depainted out unto us as in a table. Admit we grant that the Jews were hated everywhere for good causes, yet why are the Grecians rather displeased with Sosthenes, a modest man, than with the authors of the tumult, who troubled Paul without any cause?"
3. "The Romans could have wished that the remembrance of the true God had been buried. And, therefore, when as it was lawful for them to vow their vows, and to pay them to all the idols of Asia and Greece, it was a deadly fact to do sacrifice to the God of Israel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The better MSS. simply read, â€˜Then all took,â€™ etc.; the Greeks was a later interpolation."
2. "The utter indifference of these great Roman officials to all religion is well painted in these few words."
3. "Pilateâ€™s celebrated words, â€˜What is truth?â€™ betray the same utter carelessness and indifference to religion and religious truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is violent hostile reaction against their leader who had failed so miserably."
2. "The beating did Sosthenes good for he too finally is a Christian, a co-worker with Paul whom he had sought to persecute."
3. "Gallio looked the other way with a blind eye while Sosthenes got the beating which he richly deserved."

### John Gill:
1. "Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes.... and beat him before the judgment seat." 
2. "Gallio cared for none of these things." 
3. "Though it did not become him, as a magistrate, to act such a part, whose business it was to keep the public peace, to quell disorders, to protect men's persons, and property, and prevent abuse and mischief, and to correct and punish for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then they all took Sosthenes...and beat him - It seems because he had occasioned them so much trouble to no purpose."
2. "And it seems to have had a happy effect. For Sosthenes himself was afterward a Christian."
3. "For Sosthenes himself was afterward a Christian, 1 Corinthians 1:1."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The governor Gallio showed indifference towards the complaints and persecutions brought against Paul by the Jews, caring little for what they sought to achieve. His unconcern for these matters may have stemmed from his likely contempt for those who brought the accusations, as well as his general religious indifference. This indifference extended to a case where Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue and chief complainant against Paul, was beaten by the Greeks without Gallio's interference. Interestingly, Sosthenes, who initially sought to persecute Paul, eventually became a Christian himself. In this incident, we witness the violent reaction against Paul's failure and the ironic turn of events wherein the persecutor becomes a follower.
