### Henry Alford:
1. "From this, certainly the right explanation, has arisen the explanatory gloss, 'the Greeks.'"
2. "But, not to insist on the improbability of the party driven from the tribunal having beaten one of their antagonists in front of the tribunal,â€”why did they not beat Paul himself?"
3. "The carelessness of Gallio about the matter clearly seems to be a further instance of his contempt for the Jews, and indisposition to favour them or their persecution of Paul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And beat him before the judgment-seatâ€”under the very eye of the judge."
2. "And Gallio cared for none of those thingsâ€”nothing loath, perhaps, to see these turbulent Jews, for whom probably he felt contempt, themselves getting what they hoped to inflict on another."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The Greeks would feel no small measure of indignation at these disturbers of the public peace, and they took this opportunity to express their rage."
3. "There is not the least evidence that he was indifferent to the religion of his country, or that he was of a thoughtless and skeptical turn of mind."

1. "And though there be no mention made of him before among the faithful, yet it is to be thought that he was then one of Paulâ€™s companions and advocates."
