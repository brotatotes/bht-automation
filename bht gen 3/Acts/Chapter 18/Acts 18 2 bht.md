## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It appears that Aquila and Priscilla were not Christians at this time: it is the similarity of employment only which draws them to St. Paul." 
2. "From the notices of Aquila and Priscilla in the Epistles, they appear to have travelled, fixing their abode by turns in different principal cities for the sake of their business." 
3. "The edicts soon became invalid, or the prohibition was taken off: we find Aquila at Rome, Rom. xvi. 3, and many Jews resident there, ch. xxviii. 17 ff."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From these Latin names one would conclude that they had resided so long in Rome as to lose their Jewish family names."
2. "Whether this couple were converted before Paul made their acquaintance, commentators are much divided."
3. "They appear to have been in good circumstances, and after traveling much, to have eventually settled at Ephesus. The Christian friendship now first formed continued warm and unbroken, and the highest testimony is once and again borne to them by the apostle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though a Jew by birth, yet it is evident that he became a convert to the Christian faith."
2. "Though the command of Claudius extended only to Rome, yet it was probably deemed not safe to remain, or it might have been difficult to procure occupation in any part of Italy."
3. "Claudius, the emperor, might suppose that such tumults endangered the peace of the city, and resolve to remove the cause at once by the dispersion of the Jews."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lately [œÄœÅŒøœÉœÜŒ±œÑœâœÇ]. It is derived from fenw, to slay, and the adjective means, originally, lately slain; thence, fresh, new, recent." 


### John Calvin:
1. "The power of the Spirit of God shall [more] plainly appear."
2. "The Lord, by his singular counsel, turneth those things to his glory."
3. "The Lord doth often better provide for when he doth sharply punish us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Only among Christians could the apostle feel himself at home."
2. "These devoted friends laid down their necks for his (Paul‚Äôs) life."
3. "It is more than probable, considering the constant communication that was taking place between Rome and Antioch and C√¶sarea, that Christianity had been introduced into Rome by travelling Syriac Jews long before this (A.D. 51)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Aquila (ŒëŒ∫œÖŒªŒ±ŒΩ). Luke calls him a Jew from Pontus, apparently not yet a disciple, though there were Jews from Pontus at the great Pentecost who were converted (Acts 2:9)." 
2. "Aquila who made the famous A.D. translation of the O.T. was also from Pontus." 
3. "Her name comes before his in verses Acts 18:18; Acts 18:26; Romans 16:3; 2 Timothy 4:9."

### John Gill:
1. "This seems to have been his Roman name, which he had took, or was given him, while he was at Rome; very likely his Jewish name was ◊†◊©◊ì, 'Nesher', which signifies an eagle, as 'Aquila' does: unless it should rather be thought to be a Greek name; and as 'Olympas' is from 'Olympios', and 'Nymphas' from Nymphios'; so 'Akilas', as it in the Greek text, from Akylios', and this from Œ±Œ∫œÖŒªŒøœÇ, 'Akylos', which signifies an acorn."
2. "This is said to be afterwards bishop of Heraclea; but that is not to be depended upon."
3. "It must be something that was very provoking to him, otherwise before he had shown much favour to the Jews; for he not only granted to the Jews at Alexandria, that they should continue in the observance of their laws and customs, but permitted the same to them in all parts of the empire."

### John Wesley:
1. "Claudius, the Roman emperor, had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome." 
2. "All who were Jews by birth." 
3. "Whether they were Jews or Christians by religion, the Romans were too stately to regard."
