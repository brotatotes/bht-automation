### Henry Alford:
1. "Apollos had received (from his youth?) the true doctrine of the Messiahship of Jesus, as pointed out by John the Baptist."

3. "By these words is imported that he knew and taught accurately the facts respecting Jesus, but of the consequences of that which he taught, of all which may be summed up in the doctrine of Christian baptism, he had no idea."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "But let us remember that Luke putteth the knowledge of the Scripture in the first place, which must be the moderation of zeal, for we know that many are fervent without consideration." (quote 3)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The grand thought, that the dwellers in the countless isles of the Gentiles, too, were now fellow-heirs of the kingdom, was a thought which never occurred to one trained like Apollos."
2. "But a short intercourse with souls like Priscilla and Aquila, on whom a portion of Paul‚Äôs broad generous spirit had fallen, threw a flood of light into the heart of Apollos."
3. "He spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord... but though he knew the main facts of the gospel story, he was in ignorance of the special teaching which belonged to the later scenes of the Lord‚Äôs life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
