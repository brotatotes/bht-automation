### John Calvin:
1. "By this it appeareth to what use that ability which Apollos had (in that he was mighty in the Holy Scriptures) did serve; to wit, because he had a strong and forcible proof to reprove and overcome the enemies withal."
2. "For our faith should not otherwise be firm enough, unless there were an evident demonstration extant there of those things which are necessary to be known for salvation."
3. "Surely, if the law and the prophets had so great light, that Apollos did thereby prove manifestly that Jesus is Christ, as if he did point out the matter with his finger, the adding of the gospel must bring this to pass at least, that the perfect knowledge of Christ may be let [sought] from the whole Scripture."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Powerfully (ÎµÏ…Ï„Î¿Î½Ï‰Ï‚). Adverb from ÎµÏ…Ï„Î¿Î½Î¿Ï‚ (ÎµÏ…, well, Ï„ÎµÎ¹Î½Ï‰, to stretch), well-strung, at full stretch."
2. "Confuted (Î´Î¹Î±ÎºÎ±Ï„Î·Î»ÎµÎ³Ï‡ÎµÏ„Î¿). Imperfect middle of the double compound verb Î´Î¹Î±-ÎºÎ±Ï„-ÎµÎ»ÎµÎ³Ï‡Î¿Î¼Î±, to confute with rivalry in a contest, here alone. The old Greek has Î´Î¹ÎµÎ»ÎµÎ³Ï‡Ï‰, to convict of falsehood, but not this double compound which means to argue down to a finish."
3. "Shewing (ÎµÏ€Î¹Î´ÎµÎ¹ÎºÎ½Ï…Ï‚). Present active participle of ÎµÏ€Î¹Î´ÎµÎ¹ÎºÎ½Ï…Î¼, old verb to set forth so that all see."
