# Acts 18:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, like all Jewish youth, was taught a trade, despite his future path as a minister of Christ. He worked as a tentmaker, which was a trade that wasn't highly regarded or well-paid. However, Paul saw it as necessary, not only to support himself, but also to maintain his integrity and prevent his motives from being misunderstood. He found fulfillment in his trade, and it was a testament to his commitment to honest industry, proving that a minister of the gospel shouldn't be ashamed to work with his own hands.
