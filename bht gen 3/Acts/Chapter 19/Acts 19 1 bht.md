2. "certain disciples] These seem to have been in the same situation as Apollos, see on ch. xviii. 25."
3. "They cannot have been mere disciples of John, on account of when ye believed, which can bear no meaning but that of believing on the Lord Jesus: but they had received only John‚Äôs baptism, and had had no proof of the descent of the Holy Spirit, nor knowledge of His gifts."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The writer refers here particularly to the provinces of Phrygia and Galatia, Acts 18:23. These regions were called upper, because they were situated on the high table-land in the interior of Asia Minor, while Ephesus was in the low maritime regions, and called the low country."

3. "It is not to be doubted but that they were Jews, because they had received the baptism of John."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The eastern districts of Asia Minor were known by the appellation of the upper districts or country. The English word 'coasts' is liable to mislead."
2. "Ephesus was one of the great commercial cities of the world, singularly adapted both for inland and maritime commerce; it lay on the main road of traffic between the east and west."
3. "In Christian story it was famous not only for the long residence of Paul and Timothy, but subsequently it was known as the abode of the Virgin Mary, and the home of the old age of the Apostle John."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word for 'upper' (Œ±ŒΩœâœÑŒµœÅŒπŒ∫Œ±) is a late form for Œ±ŒΩœâœÑŒµœÅŒ±...

Instead he took the more direct road through the Cayster Valley to Ephesus."

2. "...he was set up, though not with his will, at the head of a party, in opposition to the chief of the apostles, Peter and Paul..."
3. "...such as believed in Christ, made a profession of him, and had been baptized in his name, for such were commonly called disciples..."
