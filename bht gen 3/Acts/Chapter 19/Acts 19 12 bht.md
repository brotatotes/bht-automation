## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Without His special selection and enabling, all instruments were vain; with these, all are capable."
3. "To argue by analogy from such a case,‚Äîto suppose that because our Lord was able, and Peter, and Paul, and in Old Test. times Elisha, were enabled, to exert this peculiar power, therefore the same will be possessed by the body or relics of every real or supposed saint, is the height of folly and fanaticism."
