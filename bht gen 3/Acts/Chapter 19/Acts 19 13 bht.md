# Acts 19:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These men, seeing the success of Paul's agency in casting out devils, imitated him by adopting the name of Jesus in their own exorcisms. However, they were ignorant of the true power behind the name. They thought that success turned on the correct use of the magical formula, treating Paul's words as a charm or spell to drive out evil spirits. Yet, they failed to understand that it was faith in Christ and not mere incantations that enabled miracles to be performed.
