# Acts 19:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul questioned the believers if they received the Holy Spirit when they believed, implying that belief and the reception of the Holy Spirit do not always occur simultaneously. The believers responded that they hadn't even heard about the Holy Spirit, indicating their limited understanding of John's message and the presence of the Holy Spirit on earth. This suggests that receiving the Holy Spirit is not dependent on having a comprehensive knowledge of religious doctrines, as God can work in the hearts and lives of sinners in ways that may surpass their understanding.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Received ye the Holy Ghost when ye believed?" implying, certainly, that the one did not of necessity carry the other along with it.
2. We did not even hear whether the Holy Ghost was (given).
