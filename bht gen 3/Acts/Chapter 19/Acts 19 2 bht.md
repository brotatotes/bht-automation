# Acts 19:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers in question were asked if they had received the Holy Spirit upon believing, to which they replied that they hadn't even heard of His existence.

2. "On the contrary, not even...we did not hear, at the time of our conversion: Our reception into the faith was unaccompanied by any preaching of the office or the gifts of the Spirit, our baptism was not followed by any imparting of His gifts: we did not so much as hear Him mentioned."
3. "So for from receiving the Holy Ghost, they did not even hear of His existence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The believers in Acts 19:2 were asked by Paul, Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed? This question implies that their belief did not necessarily ensure the reception of the Holy Spirit and His gifts. In fact, not only did they not receive the Holy Spirit, but they didn't even hear about Him at the time of their conversion. They were completely unaware of His existence and the baptism of the Spirit on earth. This lack of knowledge revealed their poor understanding of John's message and the significance of the Holy Spirit.
