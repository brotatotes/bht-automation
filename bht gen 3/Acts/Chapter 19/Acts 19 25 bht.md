# Acts 19:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The craftsmen of Artemis, including Alexander the coppersmith, were manufacturers of memorials and amulets associated with the goddess's worship. They were called together by Demetrius, the chief of the guild of silversmiths, to protest against the preaching of Paul, whose teachings threatened their business. These artisans relied on their craft for their livelihood and feared the impact of Paul's message. While personal profit is permissible, it is unjust to disrupt public peace and commit violence for one's gain. Demetrius's argument revealed that his primary concern was his own worldly interest rather than true religious devotion.
