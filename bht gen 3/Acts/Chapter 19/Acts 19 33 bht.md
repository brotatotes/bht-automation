As the chaos unfolded in Ephesus, the Jews put Alexander forward, likely to distance themselves from the riot and show their opposition to Paul and his followers.

This scene serves as a reminder to believers to walk carefully, guarding against apostasy like Alexander, who later became a venomous adversary of the apostle.
