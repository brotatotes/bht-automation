# Acts 19:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Ephesus, Paul exercised caution not to demean the worship of Artemis, only exposing the falsity of idols as necessary. He had friends among the Asiarchs, indicating his respectful approach. The accusation of robbing temples was baseless, as Paul and his companions conducted themselves blamelessly. This serves as a lesson for missionaries and ministers to avoid insulting the beliefs of others. Paul directed his righteous anger towards those who claimed to follow God while disregarding His will. Their message did not blaspheme the goddess, but rather emphasized the truth of the one God and the futility of idols.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul had proceeded at Ephesus with the same caution as at Athens, and had not held up to contempt the worship of Artemis, any further than unavoidably the truths which he preached would render it contemptible."
2. "This is also manifest from his having friends among the Asiarchs."
3. "The sentence implies that they were then actually going on. They were the periodical assizes of the district, held by the proconsul and his assessors."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess." 
2. "This is a remarkable testimony, showing that the apostle had, in preaching against idolatry, studiously avoided insulting the feelings of those whom he addressed."
3. "A lesson this to missionaries and ministers in general."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'churches' we now apply to edifices reared for purposes of Christian worship. Since no such churches had then been built, this translation is unhappy, and is not at all demanded by the original."
2. "The meaning here is that Paul and his companions had not been guilty of robbing the temple of Diana, or any other temple. The charge of sacrilege could not be brought against them."
3. "People should employ reason, and not harsh or reproachful language against a pervading evil; and that the way to remove it is to enlighten the minds of people, and to convince them of the error of their ways."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Robbers of churches [ŒπŒµœÅŒøœÉœÖŒªŒøœÖœÇ] . The A. V. puts a droll anachronism into the mouth of the town - clerk of a Greek city. Render, rather, as Rev., robbers of temples.

2. "He hurt no ancient prejudices, no time-honoured customs, by rude invective."
3. "His fiery wrath was especially reserved for those who knew their Lord‚Äôs will and only pretended to do it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The ancients felt as strongly about temple-robbing as westerners used to feel about a horse-thief."
2. "That is to say, these men (Gaius and Aristarchus) as Christians had so conducted themselves that no charge could be placed against them either in act or word."
3. "Paul had used tact in Ephesus as in Athens in avoiding illegalities."

### John Gill:
1. "They have not stolen anything out of the temple of Diana, nor any other." 
2. "They have not made mention of her name, much less said anything against her."
3. "He did not stick to tell an officious lie to screen them, as did the Egyptian midwives in favour of the Hebrew women."

### John Wesley:
