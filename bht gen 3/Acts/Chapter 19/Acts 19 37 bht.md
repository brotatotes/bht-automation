What they had done, they had done peaceably."
2. "They had not used harsh or reproachful language of Diana. This had not been charged on them, nor is there the least evidence that they had done it. They had opposed idolatry; had reasoned against it; and had endeavored to turn the people from it."

3. "St. Paul and his immediate followers no doubt owed not a little of their wonderful influence over men‚Äôs hearts to their winning and graceful courtesy, to their chivalrous consideration for the feelings of others."
