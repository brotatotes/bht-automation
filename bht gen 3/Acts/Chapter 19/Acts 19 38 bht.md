# Acts 19:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If Demetrius or anyone else has a complaint against someone, they should bring it before the court, for the law is open and court days are being kept. Let them accuse one another and present their cases in a fair and orderly manner, for there are certain times fixed for the hearing and trying of causes. Tradesmen like Demetrius should not take it upon themselves to judge what is right or wrong. Instead, let the plaintiff bring his accusation and charge, and let the others defend themselves in accordance with the due course of law.
