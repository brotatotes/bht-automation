If there are any questions or concerns regarding other matters of a public nature, they should be settled in the regularly recurring assembly, as it is the lawful and appropriate forum for such deliberations. The solution to these matters will not be found in the chaotic and riotous gathering that had taken place, but rather in the proper assembly recognized by the Roman officials. It is in this lawful assembly, not in a mob, that the decisions will hold weight and have the necessary authority.
