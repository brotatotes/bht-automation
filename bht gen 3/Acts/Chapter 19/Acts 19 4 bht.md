# Acts 19:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples in question were unenlightened, having missed the point of John's baptism. John's baptism was not about John or personal contrast with Christ, but rather about the difference between water baptism and the promised baptism of the Spirit. These disciples were unprepared for John's baptism and lacked knowledge of the Holy Spirit and a Messiah, specifically Jesus. The baptism from Paul represented regeneration and newness of life rooted in faith in Christ. John's role had ended, yielding completely to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "These simple disciples were unenlightened." 
3. "The baptism... made the whole life and work of Christ another thing from what it was conceived to be before it was vouchsafed."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "Jesus is the Messiah for whom John came to prepare the way; and as you have embraced John‚Äôs doctrine, you ought now publicly to acknowledge that Redeemer by baptism in his name."

### John Calvin:
1. "Therefore know ye that you must go farther forward; because ye be far from the mark."
2. "And even by this also are we taught that the baptism of John was a token of repentance and remission of sins and that our baptism at this day doth not differ any thing from it, save only that Christ is already revealed, and in his death and resurrection our salvation is made perfect."
3. "Paul showeth plainly that that was the baptism of regeneration and renovation as is ours. And because both purging and newness of life doth flow from Christ alone he saith that it was grounded in his faith."
