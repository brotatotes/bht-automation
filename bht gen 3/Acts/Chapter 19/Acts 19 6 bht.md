# Acts 19:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul laid his hands upon them, they immediately began speaking in tongues, just as the believers did in Jerusalem at Pentecost and in Caesarea before baptism. This speaking in tongues and prophesying served as undeniable proof that the Holy Spirit had come upon these twelve disciples, confirming their commitment to Jesus as the Messiah. The visible presence of the Holy Spirit through supernatural gifts was a direct result of their baptism, and the gift of speaking in tongues was an ecstatic utterance of rapturous devotion rather than a proficiency in a language they had not studied.
