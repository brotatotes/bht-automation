# Acts 19:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of growing opposition, Paul found solace and freedom in the school of Tyrannus, likely a private synagogue, where he could assemble believing Jews and invite Gentiles to hear the word. Undeterred by the hardened hearts and disobedience of some, Paul separated the disciples and continued to reason and preach daily. Through this separation, Paul not only provided for the weak but also stopped false teachings from subverting their godliness. The power of the heavenly doctrine either made the reprobate mad or more obstinate, as it brought life to some but death to others.
