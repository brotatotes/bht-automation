# Acts 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These men are mocking, accusing the disciples of being intoxicated with new wine. The term used for new wine refers to a sweet, intoxicating wine made from small grapes. Those who were mocking sought to belittle the spiritual manifestations of the Holy Spirit's power by attributing them to mere drunkenness. Such mockery has often hindered people from embracing faith, using derision as a means to deter rather than engage in honest discourse. However, these mockers fail to recognize that what fills the disciples is not physical wine, but rather the spiritual wine of the Holy Spirit's gifts.
