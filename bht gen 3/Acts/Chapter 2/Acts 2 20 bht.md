# Acts 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the Church and the Lord enter into a period of waiting before the arrival of the notable day of the Lord, which refers to the second coming of Christ. This day is characterized by the darkening of the sun and the moon appearing as blood, representing calamity and the impending judgment upon the enemies of God. Peter interprets the symbolism of Joel metaphorically and implies that these signs are associated with the end times and the manifestation of God's glory in taking vengeance upon His adversaries.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not the first coming of Christ,â€”which interpretation would run counter to the whole tenor of the Apostleâ€™s application of the prophecy but clearly, His second coming: regarded in prophetic language as following close upon the outpouring of the Spirit, because it is the next great event in the divine arrangements." 
2. "Their days witnessed the Pentecostal effusion, which was the beginning of the signs of the end: then follows the period, KNOWN TO THE FATHER ONLY, of waitingâ€”the Church for her Lord,â€”the Lord Himself till all things shall haye been put under His feet,â€”and then the signs shall be renewed, and the day of the Lord shall come."
3. "The gates of Godâ€™s mercy are thrown open in Christ to all people:â€”no barrier is placed,â€”no union with any external association or succession required: the promise is to individuals, AS individuals: whosoever."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 14-21. Peter, standing up with the

3. "The meaning of the quotation by Peter in this place therefore is, that what occurred on the day of Pentecost was the beginning of the series of wonders that was to take place during the times of the Messiah."
