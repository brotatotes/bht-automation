## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words of (by) God, belong to approved, and denote the source whence the proof came. approved must be taken in its fuller and stricter meaning: viz. as importing,â€”shewn to be that which He claimed to be."
2. "The Man Jesus of Nazareth was by God demonstrated, by God wrought in among you, by Godâ€™s counsel delivered to death, by God raised up..."
3. "This was the process of argument then with the Jews,â€”proceeding on the identity of a man whom they had seen and known,â€”and then mounting up from His works and His death and His resurrection, to His glorification,â€”all THE PURPOSE AND DOING OF GOD."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "authenticated," "proved," or "demonstrated to be from God."
2. "This is not a low view of our Lord's miracles, as has been alleged, nor inconsistent with... but is in strict accordance with His progress from humiliation to glory, and with His own words."
3. "This view of Christ is here dwelt on to exhibit to the Jews the whole course of Jesus of Nazareth as the ordinance and doing of the God of Israel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man approved of God - A man who was shown or demonstrated to have the approbation of God, or to have been sent by him."
2. "By miracles, and wonders, and signs - The first of these words properly means the displays of power which Jesus made; the second, the unusual or remarkable events which attended him, as suited to excite wonder or amazement; the third, the sights or proofs that he was from God."
3. "Which God did, by him - The Lord Jesus himself often traced his power to do these things to his commission from the Father, but he did it in such a way as to show that he was closely united to him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Approved [Î±Ï€Î¿Î´ÎµÎ´ÎµÎ¹Î³Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½] . The verb means to point out or shew forth. Shewn to be that which he claimed to be."
2. "Miracles [Î´Ï…Î½Î±Î¼ÎµÏƒÎ¹] . Better, Rev., mighty works."
3. "Lit., powers. See on Matthew 11:20."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let this, therefore, be the first member, that Jesus of Nazareth was a man approved of God by manifest testimonies, so that he could not be despised as some base and obscure person."
2. "And for this cause are they called signs, because the Lord will not have menâ€™s minds to stay there, but to be lifted up higher; as they are referred unto another end."
3. "Therefore, there is sufficient approbation of the doctrine and of the ministry in the miracles which God doth work, so that we be not blind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Peter declares the name of that Lord who will save all the children of men who choose to call upon Him."
2. "The words â€˜of Nazarethâ€™ are added as His usual designation among the Jews, the name â€˜Jesusâ€™ not being an uncommon one. It was the title affixed to the cross."
3. "That is, a man divinely accredited as Messiah by His wonderful works. Gloag well quotes Nicodemusâ€™ argument from John 3:2: â€˜We know that Thou art a Teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that Thou doest, except God be with him.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With unerring aim Peter has found the solution for the phenomena."
2. "He has found the key to God's work on this day in his words through Joel."
3. "Peter calls the audience to witness that his statements are true concerning 'Jesus the Nazarene.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus of Nazareth; first by his name Jesus, which the angel gave him before his birth; and that for this reason, because he is the Saviour of his people from their sins, and which his name signifies; and next by the place, not where he was born, for that was Bethlehem, but where he was educated and brought up, and where he lived the greatest part of his life, Nazareth, a city in Galilee."
2. "he was not a mere man, and much less a common and ordinary man: he was the famous son of man the Scriptures speak of; the man of God's right hand, the man his fellow, a great, mighty, and wonderful man: 'approved by God'; or shown, declared, and demonstrated by him, to be sent by him in human nature, to be the true Messiah and Saviour of the world."
3. "the meaning is, that his miracles were wrought by a divine power, and not by a diabolical influence, by Beelzebub the prince of devils, as the Pharisees blasphemously said of him; and these were done, not in a corner, but in the midst of them."
