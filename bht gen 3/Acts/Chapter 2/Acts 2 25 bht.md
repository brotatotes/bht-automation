## BHT:
When the Spirit spoke through David concerning Christ, it revealed that individuals, when speaking of themselves in a particular position, often speak in a way that applies to others in similar circumstances.

The Lord stands as an advocate at David's right hand, offering protection and support. Christ, in turn, always had Jehovah in view, making Him the true focus of the Psalm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To say, with De Wette, that Peterâ€™s proof lies not in any historical but only in an ideal meaning of the Psalm, is entirely beside the subject."
2. "Every one, placed in any given position, when speaking of himself as in that position, speaks what will refer to others similarly situated, and most pointedly to any one who shall in any especial and pre-eminent way stand in that position."
3. "David often spoke concerning himself: but THE SPIRIT WHO SPOKE IN DAVID, concerning Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a man approved of Godâ€”rather, 'authenticated,' 'proved,' or 'demonstrated to be from God.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To foresee the Lord always before us conveys no idea, though it may be a literal translation of the passage. The word means 'to foresee,' and then 'to see before us,' that is, 'as present with us, to regard as being near.'"
2. "As being always present to help me, and to deliver me out of all my troubles."
3. "In our dependence on God we should exalt him. We should not merely regard him as our help, but should at the same time give him the highest place in our affections."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not to see beforehand, but to see before one's self."
2. "Or be shaken. Generally so rendered in the New Testament."
3. "See Matthew 11:7; Matthew 24:29; Hebrews 12:26, etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "For freedom from corruption is promised by name. Neither do I pass for this, that ×©×—×ª (shachat) doth signify the grave, as ×¡×œ, (seol,) which is put in the former member. For although I do not stand nor contend about the words, yet must we respect the etymology. Therefore, forasmuch as the grave is called ×©×—×ª, (shachat) because it doth corrupt manâ€™s body with rottenness, it is not to be doubted but that David meant to note that quality. Therefore, the place is not so much expressed by this word, as the condition of rotting."
2. "Seeing that David doth not only affirm that God also shall be his deliverer, but doth express a singular way and means; namely, that he shall not be subject to the corruption of the grave, Peter doth for good causes gather, that that doth not properly appertain unto him, for that his body was corrupt in the grave."
3. "Faith, in hoping for the help of God, ought to prevent and overgo all experience, and whatsoever is perceived by the sense; but so soon as it shall give this glory to God, that it doth behold him in his Word, although he be absent, and so, consequently, invisible, it shall be overcome with the effect of the thing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To show it was no new idea of his, that death could not hold the â€˜Holy One of God,â€™ St. Peter quotes the words of Psalms 16:0."
2. "This sure hope of immortality is the spirit of the Psalm."
3. "This is what happened to Peterâ€™s crucified Master: therefore it was of Him that the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David wrote."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "David is giving his own experience which is typical of the Messiah."
2. "The Lord Jehovah like a defender or advocate stands at David's right hand."
3. "Moved (ÏƒÎ±Î»ÎµÏ…Î¸Ï‰). First aorist passive subjunctive of ÏƒÎ±Î»ÎµÏ…Ï‰, to shake like an earthquake."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ always had Jehovah in view throughout the whole of his life."
2. "Christ...had respect unto the glory of his perfections, as the ultimate end of his obedience and sufferings."
3. "He [God] is on my right hand; which expresses his nearness to him, his presence with him, his readiness to assist him, and his protection of him."

### John Wesley:
1.  Psalm 16:8.
