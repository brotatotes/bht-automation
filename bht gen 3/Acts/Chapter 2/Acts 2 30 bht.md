## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "a prophet, in the stricter sense, a foreteller of future events by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit."
2. "knowing that God had sworn."
3. "The words in this case are not cited from the LXX, but rendered from the Hebrew."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That David was inspired is clear, 2 Samuel 23:2. Many of the prophecies relating to the Messiah are found in the Psalms of David."
2. "Expressions like these are very remarkable. If the Messiah was only a man, they would be unmeaning. They are never used in relation to a mere man and they imply that the speaker or writer supposed that there pertained to the Messiah a nature which was not according to the flesh."
3. "In this sense the Messiah sits on the throne of David. He is his descendant and successor. He has an empire over all the friends of the Most High. And as that kingdom is destined to fill the earth, and to be eternal in the heavens, so it may be said that it is a kingdom which shall have no end."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. According to the flesh, he would raise up Christ. The best texts omit. Render as Rev., he would set one upon his throne.


### John Calvin:
1. "It were wickedness to measure their speeches according to the common manner and order which we use in measuring the speeches of other men, forasmuch as they go beyond the long courses of years, having the Spirit for their director."
2. "What notable or extraordinary thing soever they did utter, the Jews were commonly persuaded that it did agree with Christ."
3. "The sacred name of God is set forth unto us, that his words may carry the greater credit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜In the stricter sense, a foreteller of future events by the inspiration of the Holy Spiritâ€™ (Alford)."
2. "Jesus Himself expressly speaks of David writing â€˜in the Spiritâ€™ (Matthew 22:43)."
3. "We may conclude with certainty that the psalmist king did connect that descendant of his, of whom he spoke â€˜in the Spiritâ€™ in such strange grand terms, with the idea of the Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "Who could foretell things to come, as he did many things concerning the sufferings and death of Christ, and the circumstances attending it, concerning his resurrection, ascension, and session at the right hand of God." 
2. "Though the Jews do not allow him, nor Solomon, nor Daniel, to be strictly and properly prophets, they make a difference between prophecy, and the Holy Spirit."
3. "He would raise up Christ; would send him forth, according to the human nature; for this phrase respects not his resurrection from the dead, but his incarnation or exhibition in the flesh."
