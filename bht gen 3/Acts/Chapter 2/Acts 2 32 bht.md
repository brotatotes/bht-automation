## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. From ver. 25, the Apostle has been employed in substantiating the Resurrection as the act of God announced by prophecy in old time: now the historical fact of its accomplishment is affirmed, and the vouchers for it produced. (32.)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The number was such they could not be imposed on. If 120 persons could not prove a plain matter of fact, nothing could be established by testimony; there could be no way of arriving at any facts."
2. "The thing to be established was a plain matter. It was not that they 'saw him rise.' That they never pretended: Impostors would have done this."

3. "Notwithstanding he doth therewithal teach us, that he did not rise for his own sake alone, but that he might make the whole Church partaker of his life, having poured out the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This Jesus whom you all knew about so well as Davidâ€™s descendant has fulfilled all the varied details of this marvellous prophecy; for as you know He was dead, He is risen again."
2. "No doubt here pointing to the â€˜hundred and twentyâ€™ on whom the gift of the Spirit had fallen, who, to the astonishment of the crowds, had been speaking in the many tongues, and who all had seen the Lord after the resurrection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This Jesus whom ye crucified."
2. "Peter claims the whole 120 as personal witnesses to the fact of the Resurrection of Jesus from the dead."
3. "The direct evidence for the resurrection of Jesus piles up in cumulative force."

### John Gill:
1. "This Jesus hath God raised up....That is, from the dead."
