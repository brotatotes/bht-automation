## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word imports change of mind: here, change from thinking Jesus an impostor, and scorning Him as ore crucified, to being baptized in His name, and looking to Him for remission of sins, and the gift of the Spirit."
2. "The miserable absurdity of rendering this word by â€˜do penance,â€™â€”so the Rheims (Roman-Catholic) Version,â€”or understanding it as referring to a course of external rites, is well exposed by this passageâ€”in which the internal change of heart and purpose is insisted on, to be testified by admission into the number of Christâ€™s followers."
3. "Before, there had been the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, by John, Luke iii. 3; but now we have the important addition, in (or, on) the name of Jesus Christ,â€”in the Nameâ€”i. e. on the confession of that which the Name implies, and into the benefits and blessings which the Name implies."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Repentâ€”The word denotes change of mind, and here includes the reception of the Gospel as the proper issue of that revolution of mind which they were then undergoing."
2. "Baptized . . . for the remission of sinsâ€”as the visible seal of that remission."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "True repentance is the only thing in such a state of mind that can give any relief."
2. "A similar declaration is to be made to all who are inquiring the way to life. They are to exercise repentance; and then, without any unnecessary delay, to evince it by partaking of the ordinances of the gospel."
3. "The profession which they were to make amounted to this: a confession of sins; a hearty purpose to turn from them; a reception of Jesus as the Messiah and as a Saviour; and a determination to become his followers and to be devoted to his service."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Repent. See on Matthew 3:2. 
In the name [ÎµÏ€Î¹ Ï„Ï‰ Î¿Î½Î¿Î¼Î±Ï„Î¹] . Lit., upon the name. See on Matthew 28:19. 
Remission. See on Luke 3:3; James 5:15.


### John Calvin:
1. "Hereby we see that those do never go away empty which ask at the mouth of the Lord, and do offer themselves unto him to be ruled and taught."
2. "Let us suffer ourselves to be governed by the counsel and authority of those men whom he offereth unto us to teach us, for this ready obedience cometh thence so suddenly in those which addict themselves unto the apostles, because they are persuaded that they are sent of God, to show them the way of salvation."
3. "Therefore, that which Peter saith doth in some respect appertain unto all the whole Church: ye shall receive the gift of the Spirit. For although we do not receive it, that we may speak with tongues, that we may be prophets, that we may cure the sick, that we may work miracles; yet is it given us for a better use, that we may believe with the heart unto righteousness, that our tongues may be framed unto true confession, that we may pass from death to life, that we, which are poor and empty, may be made rich, that we may withstand Satan and the world stoutly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be baptized. The rite of baptism was well known to the Jews: they used to baptize proselytes and their children."
2. "Their belief in Jesus was the ground on which they were to be baptized."
3. "It has been suggested that the usual formula 'into' has been avoided here for the sake of euphony."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Change your mind and your life. Turn right about and do it now."
2. "The first thing to do is make a radical and complete change of heart and life."
3. "The name of Jesus Christ is the distinctive one in Christian baptism and really involves the Father and the Spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "Change your minds, entertain other thoughts, and a different opinion of Jesus of Nazareth, than you have done; consider him, and believe in him, as the true Messiah and Saviour of the world." 
2. "A change of mind will produce a change of actions in life and conversation: bring forth fruits meet for repentance; and make an open and hearty profession of repentance for this your sin."
3. "The end for which this was to be submitted to, is, for the remission of sins...ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."

### John Wesley:
1. "Repent - And hereby return to God: be baptized - Believing in the name of Jesus - And ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost - See the three-one God clearly proved." 
2. "The gift of the Holy Ghost does not mean in this place the power of speaking with tongues. For the promise of this was not given to all that were afar off, in distant ages and nations. But rather the constant fruits of faith, even righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."
3. "Whomsoever the Lord our God shall call â€” (Whether they are Jews or Gentiles) by his word and by his Spirit: and who are not disobedient to the heavenly calling. But it is observable St. Peter did not yet understand the very words he spoke."
