# Acts 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples began to speak in various languages, not of their own understanding, but through the gift and inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Their utterances were the praises of God in real, living languages that were previously unknown to them. Each disciple spoke in a language they had not acquired, yet it was a genuine and intelligible language, understood by those familiar with it. This remarkable event demonstrated the power and presence of the Holy Spirit, but it was not a permanent or universal gift of tongues.
