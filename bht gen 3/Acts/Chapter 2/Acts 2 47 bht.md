## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Praising God does not seem only to refer to giving thanks at their partaking of food, but to their general manner of conversation, including the recurrence of special ejaculations and songs of praise by the influence of the Spirit."
2. "Those who were being saved. Nothing is implied by this word, to answer one way or the other the question, whether all these were finally saved."
3. "Doubtless, some of them might have been of the class alluded to Heb. x. 26–29: at least there is nothing in this word to preclude it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy works."
2. "commending themselves by their lovely demeanor to the admiration of all who observed them."
3. "The young Church had but few peculiarities in its outward form, or even in its doctrine: the single discriminating principle of its few members was that they all recognized the crucified Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This whole phrase is a translation of a participle - τοὺς σωζομένους tous sōzomenous. It does not express any purpose that they should be saved, but simply the fact that they were those who would be, or who were about to be saved."
2. "It is clear, however, from this expression, that those who became members of the church were those who continued to adorn their profession, or who gave proof that they were sincere Christians."
3. "Two remarks may be made on the last verse of this chapter; one is, that the effect of a consistent Christian life will be to command the respect of the world; and the other is, that the effect will be continually to increase the number of those who shall be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Salvation is a thing of the present, as well as of the past and future."
2. "The idea of salvation as a rescue from sin, through the knowledge of God in Christ, and therefore a progressive condition, a present state, should not be obscured."
3. "The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved, where the Greek implies a different idea."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having favor... to find favor even amongst strangers."
2. "He showeth in these words that their diligence was not without profit."
3. "For he teacheth that this is the means to attain salvation if we be incorporate into the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ἰϰϰλησία, church, is a favourite one with the author of the Acts. It occurs in this book (says Wordsworth) about twenty times."
2. "The Greek word here, τοὺς σωζομένους, should be rendered simply the saved that is, those who were escaping day by day from the evil around them, and taking refuge in the Ark of the Church (Wordsworth)."
3. "The English Version has been charged here with a strong Calvinistic bias, implying that those who were predestined to be saved were being brought gradually into the pale of salvation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having favor (εχοντες χαριν). Cf. Luke 2:52 of the Boy Jesus."
2. "Added (προσετιθε). Imperfect active, kept on adding. If the Lord only always 'added' those who join our churches."
3. "Those that were being saved (τους σωζομενους). Present passive participle. Probably for repetition like the imperfect προσετιθε. Better translate it 'those saved from time to time.' It was a continuous revival, day by day."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only for their temporal mercies and enjoyments of life... but for their spiritual mercies."
2. "They gained the good will of the generality of the people."
3. "Those who were added to the church by the Lord... should certainly be saved."

### John Wesley:
1. The Lord added daily such as were saved — From their sins: from the guilt and power of them.
