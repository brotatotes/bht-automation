## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As in the raising of Jairusâ€™s daughter, our Lord commanded that something should be given her to eat, that nature might be recruited, so doubtless here rest and treatment were necessary, in order that the restored life might be confirmed, and the shock recovered."
2. "The time indicated by break of day must have been before or about 5 A.M.: which would allow about four hours since the miracle."
3. "Paul, we learn afterwards, ver. 13, intended to go afoot. And accordingly here we have it simply related that he started away from Troas before his companions, not remaining for the reintroduction of the now recovered Eutychus in ver. 12."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 10-12. Paul . . . fell on himâ€”like
	Elisha (2 Kings 4:34). 
	
his life is in himâ€”now
	restored; compare Mark 5:39.


### Albert Barnes:

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3.
