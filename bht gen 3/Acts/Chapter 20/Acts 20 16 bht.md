## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We see here that the ship was at Paul‚Äôs disposal, and probably hired at Philippi, or rather at Neapolis, for the voyage to Patara."
2. "The expression he had determined is too subjectively strong to allow of our supposing that the Apostle merely followed the previously determined course of a ship in which he took a passage."
3. "He may have been afraid of detention there, owing to the machinations of those who had caused the uproar in ch. xix."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For Paul had determined to sail by‚Äîor 'sail past.'"
2. "He was right opposite to it when approaching Chios."
3. "The words imply that there was considerable ground to doubt if he would attain this object‚Äîfor more than three of the seven weeks from Passover to Pentecost had already expired‚Äîand they are inserted evidently to explain why he did not once more visit Ephesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To sail by Ephesus - The word 'by' in our translation is ambiguous. We say to go by a place, meaning either to take it in our way and to go to it, or to go past it. Here it means the latter." 
2. "For he hasted ... - Had he gone to Ephesus, he would probably have been so delayed in his journey that he could not reach Jerusalem at the time of Pentecost."

3. "They come together when they be called, [which] is not only a token of concord, but also of modesty; for they were many; yet doth it not irk them to obey one apostle of Christ, whom they knew to be endued with singular gifts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He would not himself revisit the old scene of his ‚Äòtwo years‚Äô labour, lest the many friends and their pressing solicitations, and the varied questions they would of course have laid before him, should have delayed his voyage..."
2. "He knew such a mark of respect for the sacred Hebrew custom would be pleasing to the stricter Jewish Christians."
3. "...thus spread abroad in all lands the great fact that even the Gentile members of the new and suspected sect of Christians loved, with a deep love, their Jewish brethren who dwelt under the shadow of the temple on Mount Zion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either Paul controlled the ship or the captain was willing to oblige him."
2. "The verb œÑœÅŒπŒ≤œâ, to rub, to wear out by rubbing, lends itself to the idea of wasting time."
