# Acts 20:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul determined to sail past Ephesus and not spend time there, because he did not want to waste time. He was in a hurry to be at Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, not to keep the feast, but to have a chance to preach to a great number of Jews. His decision was motivated by his deep love for both Jewish and Gentile believers and his desire to edify the Church by preaching the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ship was at Paulâ€™s disposal, and probably hired at Philippi, or rather at Neapolis, for the voyage to Patara." 
2. "The expression he had determined is too subjectively strong to allow of our supposing that the Apostle merely followed the previously determined course of a ship in which he took a passage."
3. "He may have been afraid of detention there, owing to the machinations of those who had caused the uproar in ch. xix."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For Paul had determined to sail byâ€”or 'sail past.' Ephesusâ€”He was right opposite to it when approaching Chios." 
2. "because he would not spend time in Asiaâ€”the Asian province of which Ephesus was the chief city."
3. "for he hasted, if . . . possible . . . to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecostâ€”as a suitable season for giving in the great collection from all the western churches, for keeping the feast, and clearing his apostolic position with the Church, then represented in large number at Jerusalem."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To sail by Ephesus - The word 'by' in our translation is ambiguous. We say to go by a place, meaning either to take it in our way and to go to it, or to go past it. Here it means the latter."
2. "For he hasted ... - Had he gone to Ephesus, he would probably have been so delayed in his journey that he could not reach Jerusalem at the time of Pentecost."
3. "The day of Pentecost - See the notes on Acts 2:1."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word carries the suggestion of a waste of time, being compounded with tribw, to rub; to wear out by rubbing."
2. "The sense is nearly equivalent to our expression, fritter away time."
3. "To spend time."

### John Calvin:
1. "Forasmuch as he did hope that he might do some good in such a great assembly, he would not foreslow [neglect] the opportunity."
2. "Let us know that the worship of the law was not the cause that he made so great haste, but he set before his eyes the edifying of the Church."
3. "And whereas they come together when they be called, it is not only a token of concord, but also of modesty; for they were many; yet doth it not irk them to obey one apostle of Christ, whom they knew to be endued with singular gifts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He would not himself revisit the old scene of his â€˜two yearsâ€™ labour, lest the many friends and their pressing solicitations, and the varied questions they would of course have laid before him, should have delayed his voyage."
2. "He knew such a mark of respect for the sacred Hebrew custom would be pleasing to the stricter Jewish Christians."
3. "Even the Gentile members of the new and suspected sect of Christians loved, with a deep love, their Jewish brethren who dwelt under the shadow of the temple on Mount Zion, and refused to separate themselves from them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either Paul controlled the ship or the captain was willing to oblige him."
2. "That he might not have (Î¿Ï€Ï‰Ï‚ Î¼Î· Î³ÎµÎ½Î·Ï„Î± Î±Ï…Ï„Ï‰). Final clause (negative) with aorist middle subjunctive of Î³Î¹Î½Î¿Î¼Î± and dative 'that it might not happen to him.'"
3. "He was hastening (ÎµÏƒÏ€ÎµÏ…Î´ÎµÎ½). Imperfect active of ÏƒÏ€ÎµÏ…Î´Ï‰, old verb to hasten as in Luke 2:16; Luke 19:56."

### John Gill:
1. "For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus... but he chose not to stop there, fearing he should be detained."
2. "He hasted, if it were possible, for him to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost... that he might have an opportunity of preaching the Gospel to a great number of Jews."
3. "And his great desire to be at the feast of Pentecost was not in order to keep that feast... but that he might have an opportunity of preaching the Gospel."
