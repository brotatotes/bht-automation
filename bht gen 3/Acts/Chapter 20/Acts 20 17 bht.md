# Acts 20:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the early discrepancy between the views on prelatical episcopacy and the apostolic institution, which led to interpretations that obscured the true meaning of ecclesiastical questions. The fact that the terms 'elders' and 'bishops' were once synonymous has become less apparent to modern readers, but there is no reasonable dispute about their identity in the New Testament. By addressing the Ephesian elders, Paul bares his soul in a way that reveals his relatability and the depth of his connection to them.

2. "Of all the speeches in the Acts this contains most of Paul and least of Luke. ... It reveals Paul as nothing else does.

3. "He opens his heart to these men as he does not to the average crowd even of believers. It is Paul's Apologia pro sua Vita. He will probably not see them again and so the outlook and attitude is similar to the farewell discourse of Jesus to the disciples in the upper room."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 20:17, we see a glimpse of the growing debate around ecclesiastical questions and the role of bishops versus elders. The early interpretation of the term elders as synonymous with bishops can be seen as a way for interested parties to cloud the scriptural understanding of church leadership. The identity of presbyters and bishops in the New Testament is beyond dispute, and Paul's address to the elders in Ephesus reveals his intimate connection with them, akin to Jesus' farewell discourse to his disciples. The distance between Paul and the Ephesian church, about thirty miles, adds a sense of finality to his heartfelt message. The distinction between apostles, elders, and deacons is evident, as elders are referred to as bishops elsewhere in Scripture. Understanding the historical context and the development of the early church helps to shed light on the significance of this passage.
