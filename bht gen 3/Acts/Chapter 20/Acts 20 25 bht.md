## BHT:
I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. If he could regard the elders as the representatives of the various churches, why may he not have regarded the Ephesian elders as representatives of the churches of proconsular Asia? Or perhaps these words have an even wider application, to all who had been the subjects of his former personal ministry. Though this is not an inspired prediction, it is what the apostle Paul, in his peculiar circumstances, fully expected.

3. "So that he may here ground his expectation of never seeing them again, on the plan of making a journey into the west after seeing Rome, which he mentions Rom. xv. 24, 28, and from which, with bonds and imprisonment and other dangers awaiting him, he might well expect never to return."

- Attempt 5 BHT: Paul, in addressing the Ephesian elders, may have also viewed them as representatives of the churches in the region, and by speaking to them, he was addressing all those who had been the subjects of his previous ministry. With the expectation of never seeing them again, Paul likely based this on his plan to journey to the west after visiting Rome, where he may face imprisonment and other dangers. While this is not a definite prediction, it is what Paul anticipated under his unique circumstances. The emphasis on I signifies his personal knowledge, possibly through special revelations. This parting with the elders is a tender and affecting separation for both minister and people. Though apostles did not always possess Divine and unerring knowledge, in this instance, it seems Paul may have been mistaken in his expectation. Over time, early Christians came to realize that the return of the Master in judgment was a distant future event, not imminent.
