	from the blood of all men— ( :-; and compare 1 Samuel 12:3;
	1 Samuel 12:5; Ezekiel 3:17-21;
	Ezekiel 33:8; Ezekiel 33:9).


### Albert Barnes:
1. "If any of you are lost; if you prove unfaithful to God, I appeal to yourselves that the fault is not mine."
2. "Ministers who preach the gospel with fidelity may thus appeal to their hearers; and in the day of judgment may call on themselves to witness that the fault of the ruin of the soul is not to be charged to them."
3. "He had discharged his duty in faithfully warning and teaching them; and now, if they were lost, the fault would be their own, not his."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. This day [τη σημερον ημερα] . Very forcible. Lit., on today's day; this, our parting day.


### John Calvin:
1. "Let them leave that to God alone to be ordered at his pleasure. So shall it come to pass that the inventions of men shall have none entrance into the Church of God."
2. "Mortal man shall not be so bold as to mangle the Scripture and to pull it in pieces, that he may diminish − this or that at his pleasure, that he may obscure something and suppress many things; but shall deliver whatsoever is revealed in the Scripture, though wisely and seasonably for the edifying of the people, yet plainly and without guile."
3. "I do not doubt but that he had respect unto the place of Ezekiel, where God denounceth that his prophet shall be guilty of the blood of the wicked unless he exhort them unto repentance. For upon this condition doth he appoint pastors over his Church, that if anything perish through their negligence, an account may be required at their hands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men."
2. "His ceaseless, self-denying labours among the people at Ephesus would at least free him from that blood-guiltiness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I testify (μαρτυρομα). Elsewhere in the N.T. only in Paul's Epistles (Galatians 5:3; Ephesians 4:17; 1 Thessalonians 2:12). It means 'I call to witness' while μαρτυρεω means 'I bear witness.'"
2. "This day (εν τη σημερον ημερα). The today day, the last day with you, our parting day."
3. "I am pure from the blood of all men (καθαρος ειμ απο του αιματος παντων). Paul was sensitive on this point as in Corinth (Acts 18:6). It is much for any preacher to claim and it ought to be true of all. The papyri also give this use of απο with the ablative rather than the mere ablative after καθαρος."

### John Gill:
1. "I am pure from the blood of all men."
2. "They could only bear a testimony for him with respect to themselves."
3. "The ruin and destruction of no one of them could be laid to his charge."
