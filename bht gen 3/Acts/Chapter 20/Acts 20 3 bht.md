# Acts 20:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During his stay in Corinth, Paul faced a conspiracy against his life by his Jewish enemies, compelling him to change his plan of sailing to Palestine. Instead, he decided to return through Macedonia, which would allow him to visit the faithful disciples in Berea, Thessalonica, and Philippi one last time before bidding farewell to Corinth. This alteration in his route demonstrated Paul's prudence in evading the plot against him and safeguarding both himself and the churches where he ministered.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "During the 'three months' of his stay at Corinth, St. Paul wrote the great epistle to the Roman Church. The Galatian letter possibly was written, too, at this time; but it seems more likely that this shorter letter, in which the main arguments of the letter to the Church of Rome were first sketched out, was written during the stay at Ephesus in the course of the preceding year."
2. "All through his busy, anxious life their [the Jews'] terrible and sleepless hostility dogged his footsteps...they made use of certain fanatics of their race, and attempted by violent means to cut short the detested career of him they persisted in looking upon as the bitterest foe to the Jewish traditions."
3. "It was most likely that the Jews on this occasion, becoming aware of St. Paulâ€™s intention to sail from Cenchrea, one of the ports of Corinth, watched the harbour in order to surprise him and kill him."

2. "Upon which he purposed to return through Macedonia..."
3. "This wicked design being made known to him, obliged him, in point of prudence, and both for his own safety, and the good of the churches, to alter his scheme, and steer his course another way, to the disappointment of his enemies..."

### John Wesley:
1. An ambush being laid for him â€” In his way to the ship.
