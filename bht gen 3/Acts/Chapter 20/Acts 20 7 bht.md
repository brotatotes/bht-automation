# Acts 20:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The early Christian practice of observing the first day of the week, known as the Lord's Day, included the breaking of bread during the Holy Communion. This regular practice of gathering for worship and the sacrament of the Lord's Supper was already firmly established in the churches. The fervor and commitment of Paul in preaching and teaching until late into the night exemplify the importance of regular meetings for a flourishing church. The widespread adoption of the seven-day week among Gentile believers further confirms the significance of this day.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Perhaps the greatest proof of all, that this day was thus observed, may be found in the early (see 1 Cor. xvi. 2) and at length general prevalence, in the Gentile world, of the Jewish seven-day period as a division of time."
2. "But we find in the Christian Scriptures no trace of any sabbatical observance of this or any day: nay, in Rom. xiv. 5 (where see note), St Paul shews the untenableness of any such view under the Christian dispensation."
3. "The breaking of bread in the Holy Communion was at this time inseparable from the agapÃ¦ or love-feasts. It took place apparently in the evening (after the dayâ€™s work was ended), and at the end of the assembly, after the preaching of the word (ver. 11)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This, compared with :-, and other similar allusions, plainly indicates that the Christian observance of the day afterwards distinctly called 'the Lord's Day,' was already a fixed practice of the churches."
2. "Paul preachedâ€”discoursed."
3. "The tense implies continued actionâ€”'kept discoursing.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Showing thus that this day was then observed by Christians as holy time."
2. "So the Syriac understands it, by translating it, 'to break the eucharist'; that is, the eucharistic bread."
3. "Occasions may arise where it will be proper for Christians to spend a much longer time than usual in public worship."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "First [Ï„Î· Î¼Î¹Î±] . Lit., 'the one day.' The cardinal numeral here used for the ordinal."
2. "Week [ÏƒÎ±Î²Î²Î±Ï„Ï‰Î½] . The plural used for the singular, in imitation of the Hebrew form."
3. "Preached [Î´Î¹ÎµÎ»ÎµÎ³ÎµÏ„Î¿] . Better, as Rev., discoursed with them. It was a mingling of preaching and conference."

### John Calvin:
1. "Furthermore, it were too cold to expound this of any day. For to what end is there mentioned of the Sabbath, save only that he may note the opportunity and choice of the time?"
2. "And the zeal of them all is worth the noting, in that it was no trouble to Paul to teach until midnight, though he were ready to take his journey, neither were the rest weary of learning."
3. "Add also another conjecture, if the chamber had been empty, those which were present would not have suffered Eutychus to sit upon a window. For it had been filthy licentiousness in despising the heavenly doctrine to depart aside into a window, seeing there was room enough elsewhere."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We have here an unmistakable allusion to the practice, which began evidently immediately after the resurrection of the Lord, of assembling on the first day of the week for religious purposes."
2. "The 'breaking bread' can only signify the Lordâ€™s Supper, the communion of the body and blood of Christ, which, in these early days, seems to have been generally united with the Agape or love-feast."
3. "The disciples came together; and the especial object of their assembling was then, as now, the celebration of the sacrament of the Lordâ€™s Supper; then, as now, the prayers and sermon preceded the solemn breaking of bread."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Worship on the first day of the week instead of the seventh naturally arose in Gentile churches."
2. "It is impossible for a church to flourish without regular meetings."
3. "Paul's purpose to leave early next morning seemed to justify the long discourse."

### John Gill:
1. "On this day, it appears from hence, and from other places, that the apostles and primitive churches did meet together for religious exercises." 
2. "Not to eat a common meal, or to make a feast, or grand entertainment for the apostle and his company, before they departed; but... to break the eucharist, by which the Lord's supper was called in the primitive times."
3. "Which not only shows that he was full of matter, but that his affection for these saints, and his desire of doing them good, were very great, by imparting as much spiritual light and knowledge as he could unto them."

### John Wesley:
1. To break bread â€” That is, to celebrate the Lord's Supper; continued his discourse - Through uncommon fervour of spirit.
