# Acts 20:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The upper chamber was filled with an abundance of lights, which serves to show the vivid impression of the scene and the lack of secrecy or disorder during the meetings. The presence of many lights not only allowed for necessary uses such as reading the Word and administering the ordinance of the Supper, but also removed any suspicion or reproach of the gathering being associated with wicked practices. The lights likely increased the heat, contributing to the drowsiness that led to the young man's fall from the window.
