# Acts 20:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Eutychus, a young listener, fell down from the third story window and was taken up dead, which is seen as a miracle of raising the dead. The window, possibly closed with lattice-work, projected over the street or interior court, causing him to fall on the hard earth or pavement. Eutychus struggled to stay awake while Paul was preaching, vainly hoping for him to finish. The people considered him dead, and Luke the physician seemed to agree with that view.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "It seems to me, that the supposition of a mere suspended animation is as absurd here as in the miracle of Jairusâ€™s daughter."
3. "I would ask any unbiassed reader, taking these details into consideration, which of the two is the natural interpretation,â€”and whether there can be any reasonable doubt that the intent of St. Luke is to relate a miracle of raising the dead."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "He fell down from the third story."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The window was left open, probably to avoid the malice of their enemies, who might be disposed otherwise to charge them with holding their assemblies in darkness for purposes of iniquity."

3. "No practice is more shameful, disrespectful, and abominable than that so common of sleeping in the house of God."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "But to be overcome with sleep, sitting at a window, what other thing is it but without fault to yield to nature?"

3. "The Lord, by applying a remedy, doth forthwith rid the minds of his of all perturbation."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The facts related are perfectly simple, and admit of no explanation but one. The young man fell from the great height of a third storey on to the hard ground, or more probably pavement, below, and was killed by the fall."
3. "To the Lord her death, though real, was yet but as a sleep, out of which He was come to awaken her; and the servant, in this case, was conscious of possessing for a moment the same strange power which belonged to his Divine Master."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sitting in the window... Eutychus was sitting on the window sill." 
2. "Eutychus struggled bravely to keep awake, vainly hoping that Paul would finish. But he went on 'for more.'"

1. "Being fallen into a deep sleep... it seems evident that the providence of God was in it, and which overruled it for a good end..." 
2. "He either bowed down, or leaned backwards: and fell down from the third loft... and was taken up dead; not only for dead, or as one dead, but he really was dead..."
3. "This sleep seemed to come upon him at an unawares; what hand soever Satan might have in it, with a view to the young man's hurt, both as to soul and body, and to bring reproach and scandal upon the church, and the Gospel..."

### John Wesley:
1. In the window â€” Doubtless kept open, to prevent heat, both from the lamps and the number of people.
