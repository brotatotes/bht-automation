## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This Agabus in all probability is identical with the Agabus of ch. xi. 28."
2. "That there is no reference to that former mention of him, might be occasioned by different sources of information having furnished the two narratives."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Finding himself in good time for Pentecost at Jerusalem, he would feel it a refreshing thing to his spirit to hold Christian communion for a few days with such a family."
2. "The news of Paul's arrival having spread."
3. "No doubt the same [prophet] as in [previous verse]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. There came down - See the notes on Acts 15:1.
Named Agabus - See the notes on Acts 11:28.


### John Calvin:
1. "It was surely a profitable example of invincible constancy, seeing that he offered himself willingly and wittingly to the violence of the adversaries; and no less profitable is it for us at this day, that his apostleship should be confirmed with this voluntary and no less constant giving over of his life."
2. "The false prophets did afterward essay to delude the simple by this policy, as Satan is in a manner God‚Äôs ape, and his ministers do envy the servants of God."
3. "But, forasmuch as there was in them no force of the Spirit, their vanity did no whit hurt the faithful. This is also worthy to be noted, that Agabus doth not set before their eyes a dumb spectacle, but he coupleth therewith the word, whereby he may show to the faithful the use and end of the ceremony."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‚ÄòMany;‚Äô the Greek word thus rendered is in the comparative degree, and apparently signifies that Paul and his companions tarried in C√¶sarea ‚Äòmore days‚Äô than at first they had intended."
2. "He was now only two days‚Äô easy journey from Jerusalem, which he intended to reach by Pentecost."
3. "This is the same Agabus whom we read of in chap. Acts 11:28; we are sure of his identity with the foreteller of the famine in the days of Claudius C√¶sar the name, the office, and the residence being the same in both instances."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As we tarried (ŒµœÄŒπŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩœÑœâŒΩ Œ∑ŒºœâŒΩ). Genitive absolute. Note ŒµœÄ (additional) with ŒºŒµŒΩœâ as in Acts 12:16."
2. "Many days (Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±œÇ œÄŒªŒµŒπŒøœÖœÇ). More days (than we expected), accusative of time."
3. "A certain prophet named Agabus (œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ±œÑ ŒëŒ≥Œ±Œ≤ŒøœÇ). A prophet like the daughters of Philip, mentioned already in connection with the famine predicted by him (Acts 11:28), but apparently not a man of prominence like Barnabas, and so no allusion to that former prophecy."

### John Gill:
1. "How many days is not said, it could not be very many" 
2. "he had been many years going about from place to place prophesying"
3. "For between that and this account must be a space of about sixteen or seventeen years"

### John Wesley:
1. A certain prophet came ‚Äî The nearer the event was, the more express were the predictions which prepared Paul for it.
