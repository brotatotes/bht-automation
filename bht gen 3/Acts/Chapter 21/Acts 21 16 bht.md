# Acts 21:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word 'old' in this context means someone who has been a disciple since the beginning and accompanied Jesus during His ministry. Mnason of Cyprus, an important figure in the Jerusalem Church, had likely settled in Jerusalem after preaching to the Grecians in Antioch. Assisted by other disciples, Paul was brought to Mnason to introduce him and provide accommodation. This highlights the early Christians' practice of showing hospitality to fellow believers, while also revealing that Jesus' disciples extended beyond Galilee and Judaea to other regions.
