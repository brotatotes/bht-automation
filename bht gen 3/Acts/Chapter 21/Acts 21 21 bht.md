# Acts 21:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unfounded allegations circulated by the anti-Pauline Judaizers claimed that Paul taught Jews residing among the Gentiles to abandon Mosaic customs. These accusations were part of a coordinated effort to discredit Paul and portray him as an enemy of Jewish life and teachings. While Paul indeed taught that circumcision was unnecessary for salvation, he never instructed Jewish Christians to forsake their customs. It is astonishing that these accusers failed to grasp or openly communicate this truth to Jewish converts in Jerusalem.

1. "A widespread feeling existed in Jewish Christian communities that the famous apostle of the Gentiles taught the chosen people â€˜to forsake Moses,â€™ to give up their cherished rites and ceremonies, to discontinue in their children that peculiar and time-honoured custom of circumcision which for so many centuries had distinguished the child of Israel from the child of the Gentile foreigner."
2. "Paul never taught the Jewish Christian to abandon the law and the customs of his fathers."
3. "â€˜fanaticism is sometimes clear-sighted in its bitterness, and the Judaisers felt that when it was proclaimed that circumcision was nothing in its bearing on manâ€™s relations to God,â€™ the day would come at no far distant date when circumcision would cease to be practised, and the time-honoured ceremonial law of Moses, which enjoined it as the initial and principal rite, would become a dead letter."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The passage speaks of individuals who informed others that the apostle Paul taught Jews among the Gentiles to forsake Mosaic customs and traditions. These purported informants were likely the anti-Pauline Judaizers, who had diligently spread this message to undermine Paul's credibility. The charge against Paul was serious, as it painted him as an enemy of Jewish life and teachings. The reports about Paul's teachings seemed to have escalated over time, leading some Christians in Jerusalem to suspect him of opposing Jewish rites and customs. While Paul did not enforce the observance of Jewish laws on Gentile converts, he did not teach Jewish Christians to abandon the law and abandon their customs. Instead, he emphasized that circumcision was not necessary for salvation and that clinging to the ceremonial law would eventually fade away. It is remarkable how these accusers failed to grasp this truth or openly proclaim it to every Jewish convert in Jerusalem.
