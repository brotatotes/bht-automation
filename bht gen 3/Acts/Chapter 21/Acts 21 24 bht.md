# Acts 21:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul agreed to cover the expenses for the four Nazarites, making sure to do so without compromising his belief in justification by faith. His compliance was not meant to earn God's favor, but rather to affirm his respect for the Mosaic law. By generously supporting the Nazarites, Paul aimed to refute the accusations against him and show that he did not disregard Jewish customs. This act of kindness would not only dispel falsehoods about Paul but also gain the trust of the conservative Jewish Christians.
