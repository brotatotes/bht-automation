# Acts 21:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In purifying himself and notifying the priests, Paul aimed to break the power of false apostles over those who were deluded by Paul's accusers, rather than to please his opponents. Although he adhered to Jewish customs, Paul's actions did not mean he believed in the law's binding nature or that it was necessary for salvation. Instead, he wanted to remove prejudices and gain favor with weak-minded individuals, all while exemplifying the errors and weaknesses of the early Church.

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 21:26, Paul is seen purifying himself and declaring to the priests that the time of his purification is coming to an end. This act was not for the sake of appeasing his opponents or the Judaizers, but rather to demonstrate his adherence to the customs and authority of the Jewish-Christian mother Church. Paul's actions were not driven by a belief that he was bound by the law, but rather to satisfy weak minds and remove their prejudices, ultimately aiming to gain their favor and be of service to them. It is important to note that Paul's obedience to the law does not undermine his teachings against legalistic practices and his opposition to using the law as a means of salvation. By humbling himself and honoring the customs of the fathers, Paul depicted the early Church as it was, faults and all, providing a realistic portrayal of the believers of that time.
