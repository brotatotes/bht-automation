# Acts 21:27 Commentary Help Text

Paul, while intent on appeasing the believing Jews, incurs the furious hostility of his unbelieving enemies. In the very act of honoring the temple, the Jews from Ephesus raise a hue and cry that he is dishonoring it. These Jews had been watching Paul, with strange excited interest, as he passed in and out of the temple courts with the marks of his Nazariteâ€™s vow upon him, and at length, they saw him in the temple with a Gentile well known to them.
