# Acts 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sailing towards Tyre, the ship carrying Paul and his companions first came across Cyprus, steered southeast of it and left it on the northwest. They then sighted Tyre, a renowned seat of maritime commerce, where the ship unloaded its cargo. This gave the apostle time to engage in further ministry. The nautical language used reflects the act of bringing land to light, and it is interesting to note that the existence of Christians in Tyre was prophesied in the Psalms. Tyre, now lying in ruins beneath the sea, has become a desolate place inhabited by criminals.
