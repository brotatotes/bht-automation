# Acts 21:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Paul was being carried up the stairs from the temple-court to the tower, a coincidence of events led to a peculiar emergency and a perilous situation for him. The mob, cheated of their purpose to lynch Paul, was determined to have his blood, crying out and following after him. They shouted, Away with him, using the same words that were used by the mob when they chose Barabbas over Jesus. The sullen roar of their yells echoed in Paul's ears, as he began to understand what it truly meant to share in the sufferings of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. Away with him! - That is, to death. Compare Luke 23:18.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Stairs. Leading from the temple - court to the tower [...] the guard could go different ways among the cloisters in order to watch the people at the Jewish festivals."
2. "So it was [συνεβη] . Lit., it happened. The verb means, literally, to come together; hence, of a coincidence of events. [...] Things came to such a pass that he had to be carried up the stairs."
3. "The verb [συνεβη] is designedly introduced here to express more vividly the fact of the peculiar emergency and the peril of Paul 's situation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Followed after (ηκολουθε). Imperfect active of ακολυθεω, was following. Cheated of their purpose to lynch Paul, they were determined to have his blood."
2. "Crying out (κραζοντες). Construction according to sense, plural masculine participle agreeing with neuter singular substantive πληθος (Robertson, Grammar, p. 401)."
3. "Away with him (Αιρε αυτον). The very words used by the mob to Pilate when they chose Barabbas in preference to Jesus (Luke 23:18, Αιρε τουτον). He will hear it again from this same crowd (Acts 22:22). It is the present imperative (αιρε) as in Luke 23:18, but some may have used the urgent aorist active imperative as also in the case of Jesus John 19:15, αρον, αρον with σταυρωσον added). Luke does not say that this mob demanded crucifixion for Paul. He was learning what it was to share the sufferings of Christ as the sullen roar of the mob's yells rolled on and on in his ears."

### John Gill:
1. "For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, away with him." 
2. "Take him away, that is, by death."
3. "Crucify him, crucify him, as they said concerning Christ."
