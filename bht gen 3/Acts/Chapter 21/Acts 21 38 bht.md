## BHT:
The chief captain initially mistook Paul for the Egyptian who deceived people by claiming to be a prophet and gathering followers. This Egyptian led thousands, including Sicarii assassins, to Mount Olivet, convincing them that the city walls would fall. The Sicarii were known for their hidden short swords which they used to openly murder people in Jerusalem. However, Paul's ability to speak Greek proved he wasn't the Egyptian, exposing the chief captain's mistaken assumption and the dangerous nature of the Sicarii.
