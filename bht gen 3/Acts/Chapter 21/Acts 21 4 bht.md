# Acts 21:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul arrived in Tyre, he diligently searched for the disciples he had previously preached to, finding them and staying with them for seven days. These disciples, speaking through the Spirit, warned Paul not to go up to Jerusalem, foretelling the afflictions that awaited him there. However, duty called louder than the warning, and Paul's unwavering determination to fulfill his mission prevailed. Even though the prophetic impulse of the disciples suggested that Paul could avoid danger by not going, he chose to press on, steadfast in his resolve.

2. "The notice here is very important, that these Tyrian disciples said to St. Paul by the Spirit, that he should not go to Jerusalem,‚Äîand yet he went thither, and, as he himself declares, bound in spirit by the leading of God."
3. "We thus have an instance of that which Paul asserts 1 Cor. xiv. 32, that the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets, i.e. that the revelation made by the Holy Spirit to each man‚Äôs spirit was under the influence of that man‚Äôs will and temperament, moulded by and taking the form of his own capacities and resolves."

3. "who said to Paul . . . that he should not go up to Jerusalem‚Äî(See on Acts 11:19- :; also see on Acts 11:19- :)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not understood by Paul as a positive command that he should not go up to Jerusalem; for had it been, it would not have been disobeyed."

3. "Paul was simply apprised of the danger, and was then left to the free determination of his own will. He chose to encounter the danger of which he was thus apprised."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Finding disciples [Œ±ŒΩŒµœÖœÅŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑŒ±œÇ]. The verb means to discover after search; and the article, the disciples, refers to the disciples who lived and were recognized members of the church there." 
2. "The A. V. overlooks both the preposition and the article."
3. "The verb might be rendered strictly by our common phrase, 'having looked up the disciples.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Those alone are numbered in the flock of Christ who have embraced his doctrine by faith."
2. "Surely this was no small temptation to cause him not to finish the journey which he had taken in hand, seeing the Holy Ghost did dissuade him from the same."
3. "The Lord would have his servant admonished of purpose, partly, that through long meditation, he might be better furnished and prepared to suffer whatsoever should come, partly that his constancy might more plainly appear."
