## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We passed through the city to the western shore of the ancient island, now the peninsula, hoping to find there a fitting spot for the tent." 
2. "Yet had we looked a few rods further, we should have found a very tolerable spot by a threshing-floor, where we might have pitched close upon the bank, and enjoyed, in all its luxury, the cool sea-breeze, and the dashing the surge upon the rocky shore." 
3. "On the shore."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Observe here that the children of these Tyrian disciples not only were taken along with their parents, but must have joined in this act of solemn worship."
2. "children of these Tyrian disciples not only were taken along with their parents"
3. "joined in this act of solemn worship."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They all brought us on our way - They attended us. See the Acts 15:3 note; Romans 15:24 note; 1 Corinthians 16:6, 1 Corinthians 16:11 notes; 3 John 1:6 note. This was an expression of tender attachment, and of a deep interest in the welfare of Paul and his fellow-travelers." 
2. "Any place may be proper for prayer. See the notes on John 4:21-24. God is everywhere, and can as easily hear prayer on the seashore as in the most magnificent temple." 
3. "Scenes like this show more clearly than abstract arguments could do that such a form was not needed, and would not be used. Paul and his fellow-Christians, on the sand of the sea-shore, would pour forth the gushing emotions of their souls in language such as their circumstances would suggest, and no man can read this narrative in a dispassionate manner without believing that they offered an extempore prayer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Accomplished [ŒµŒæŒ±œÅœÑŒπœÉŒ±Œπ]. Only here and 2 Timothy 3:17, where it is used in the sense of equip or furnish."
2. "Children. The first time that children are mentioned in the notice of a Christian church."
3. "Shore [Œ±ŒπŒ≥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩ]. Rev., beach. See on Matthew 13:2."

### John Calvin:
1. "This was no small testimony of love, in that they accompanied Paul out of the city with their wives and children, which thing Luke doth report, partly that he might commend their godliness according as it deserved."
2. "Paul had that honor given him which was due to him."
3. "We must also note the solemn custom of praying in weightier affairs, and that being certified by God of the danger, they are more stirred up to pray."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The following extract of Biscoe contains several trustworthy allusions from ancient writers on this point: ‚ÄòThe sea-shore was esteemed by the Jews a place most pure, and therefore proper to offer up their prayers and thanksgiving to Almighty God."
2. "It is uncertain whether or no there was a proseucha or chapel, a temporary place of prayer, here on the shore for the Christian brotherhood of Tyre, or whether it was simply that, as the Christians of Tyre were bidding farewell to Paul and his companions, they knelt down and prayed together."
3. "And they all brought us on our way, with wives and children. Baumgarten observes that this is the first time, in the notice of a Christian Church, that children are mentioned that we have here the first recorded instance of Christianity pervading a whole family."

3. "and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed; which was agreeably to the custom of the Jews, who had, as Tertullian observes, their 'orationes litterales', their prayers at the sea shore."
