1. "The â€˜evangelistsâ€™ of the early church are thus described by Eusebius ( H. E., iii. 37): â€˜After laying the foundation of the faith in foreign parts, as the peculiar object of their mission, and after appointing others as shepherds to the flock, and committing to them the care of those that had been recently introduced, they went again to other regions and nations with the grace and co-operation of God.â€™"
2. "They were thus the missionaries of the first days, to use the words of Dr. Westcott ( Introduction to the Gospels, chap. 3): â€˜The evangelist was not the compiler of a history, but the missionary who carried the good tidings to fresh countries; the bearer and not the author of the message."
