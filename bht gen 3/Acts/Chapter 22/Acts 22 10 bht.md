# Acts 22:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This is the true turning unto the Lord; when laying away all fierceness and fury, we bow down our necks willingly to bear his yoke, and are ready to do whatsoever he commandeth us. Moreover, this is the beginning of well-doing, to ask the mouth of God; their labor is lost who think upon repentance without his word. Into Damascus, of all things which are appointed for thee, I said, what shall I do, Lord?
