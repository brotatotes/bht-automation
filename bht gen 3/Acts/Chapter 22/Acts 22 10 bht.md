# Acts 22:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And I said, What shall I do, Lord? This is the voice of a tamed man, who has truly turned to the Lord and seeks His guidance. Paul's response exemplifies the beginning of well-doing, for he asks the mouth of God for direction. It is a reminder to all that labor is futile if one attempts to embark on the path of repentance without consulting His word. God does not blind those whom He wishes to enlighten, but it is a reminder that we must humble ourselves and seek His wisdom, for anyone who strives to be wise in their own eyes will only become foolish in His sight.

### John Calvin:
1. "What shall I do, Lord? This is the voice of a tamed man, and this is the true turning unto the Lord."
2. "Moreover, this is the beginning of well-doing, to ask the mouth of God; for their labor is lost who think upon repentance without his word."
3. "God doth not indeed make blind all those whom he will lighten; but there is a general rule prescribed to all men, that those become foolish with themselves who will be wise to him."

2. "Of all things which (œÄŒµœÅ œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œâŒΩ). HœâŒΩ, relative plural attracted to genitive of antecedent from accusative Œ±, object of œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÉŒ± (do)." 
3. "Are appointed for thee (œÑŒµœÑŒ±Œ∫œÑŒ± œÉŒø). Perfect passive indicative of œÑŒ±œÉœÉœâ, to appoint, to order, with dative œÉŒø. Compare with ŒøœÑ œÉŒµ Œ¥Œµ of Acts 9:6. The words were spoken to Paul, of course, in the Aramaic, Saoul, Saoul."
