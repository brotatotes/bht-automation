- Attempt 1 BHT: Paul, in recalling his former zeal against Christ and his consent to Stephen's death, uses his past as a means to undo the damage he had done among the Jews in Jerusalem. He emphasizes his conversion and his subsequent presence in the temple to demonstrate his continued connection with the faith, even after his encounter with the glorified Redeemer. Paul pleads with God to allow him to work in Jerusalem among his own people, appealing to the fact that his former staunchness as a Pharisee should make the Jews more receptive to his message. However, Christ flatly answers that He has a different purpose for Paul and crushes his hope of winning the Jews over. This exchange exposes the stubbornness and pride of the Jews and highlights the difficulty of breaking through their unbelief. It becomes clear that Paul's expectation of their acceptance, based on his own conversion, is futile in the face of their hardened hearts.
