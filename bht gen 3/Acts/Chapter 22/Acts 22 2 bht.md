# Acts 22:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul addressed the crowd in their holy mother tongue, the Hebrew language, the sound of their language awed them into deeper silence. They would have understood Paul's Greek, but they much preferred hearing their own language, and Paul's choice to speak in their own language engaged their attention all the more. It is indeed an unusual thing that when men of diverse languages are together, we hear those who speak our own language more willingly.
