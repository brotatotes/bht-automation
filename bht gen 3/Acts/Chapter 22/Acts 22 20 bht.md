## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle may have here used the word (speaking in Hebrew) in its strict primary sense; for a view of Christ in His glory was vouchsafed to Stephen, and it was by bearing witness of that manifestation that he hastened his death."
2. "The present meaning of the word martyr did, however, become attached to it at a very early period, and is apparently of apostolic authority."
3. "Many who had only seen with the eye of faith, suffered persecution and death as a proof of their sincerity. For such constancy the Greek had no adequate term. It was necessary for the Christians to provide one. None was more appropriate than ‚Äòwitness‚Äô (martyr), seeing what had been the fate of those whom Christ had appointed to be His witnesses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed."
2. "I also was standing by - Acts 7:58."
3. "And consenting unto his death - Acts 8:1."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Martyr. Better, as Rev., witness."
2. "Standing by."
3. "Consenting [œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫œâŒΩ]. See on allow, Luke 11:48; and compare Acts 8:1."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is hardly likely that the sense in which we understand the word 'martyr'... belonged as yet to the Greek word ŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅ or ŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÇ." 
2. "Probably the transition from the general sense of 'witness' to the specific meaning of 'martyr' is traceable to its use in such passages as this and Revelation 2:13; Revelation 11:3; Revelation 17:6." 
3. "'The transition from the first sense (witness) to the second sense (martyr) may be easily accounted for. Many, who had only seen with the eye of faith, suffered persecution and death as a proof of their sincerity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was shed...was being shed."
2. "And 'martyr' also as in Revelation 2:13; Revelation 17:6."
3. "He did not like the idea of running away to save his own life right where he had helped slay Stephen."

### John Gill:
1. "Stephen was a martyr for Christ, both by confession with his mouth, and by the effusion of his blood."
2. "nor was he an idle and indifferent spectator."
3. "and these things he mentions to suggest that surely the Jews would receive his testimony, since they knew what a bitter enemy he had been to this way."

### John Wesley:
1. "A real convert still retains the remembrance of his former sins."
2. "He confesses them and is humbled for them."
3. "All the days of his life."
