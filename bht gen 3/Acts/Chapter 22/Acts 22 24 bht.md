# Acts 22:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tribune, unable to understand Paul's language but seeing the fervor of the Jews against him, resorted to illegal means by ordering him to be examined through scourging. This was contrary to Roman law, as Augustus had explicitly stated that legal examinations should not begin with torture. The tribune, being in the dark about Paul's speech in Aramaic, was perplexed by the intense reaction and assumed that Paul must have been guilty of some crime. Thus, he opted for this severe and dishonorable punishment to extract a confession and gain favor with the Jews.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This verb does not occur in the old Greek (which used ÎµÎ¾ÎµÏ„Î±Î¶Ï‰ as in Matthew 2:8), first in the LXX, in the N.T. only here and verse Acts 22:29, but Milligan and Moulton's Vocabulary quotes an Oxyrhynchus papyrus of A.D. 127 which has a prefect using the word directing government clerks to 'examine' (Î±Î½ÎµÏ„Î±Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½) documents and glue them together into volumes (Ï„Î¿Î¼Î¿).
