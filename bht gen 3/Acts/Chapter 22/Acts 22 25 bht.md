# Acts 22:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Paul was bound with thongs, in a position bent forward and tied with gear made of leather to an inclined post, he questioned the centurion, asking if it was lawful to scourge a man who was a Roman and uncondemned. By invoking his Roman citizenship, Paul reminded them of the laws that protected citizens from being condemned without proper hearing or pleading their case, thus using the privilege of his citizenship to shield himself from the intended injury.
