The captain, aware of the Roman practice of examining by scourging, questioned Paul's actions and wanted to understand the reason behind the outcry. He suspected Paul must have been guilty of some crime based on the horror it sparked among the audience. Cautioning the captain, Paul asked, What art thou about to do? as a sharp warning. It was essential for the captain to verify Paul's claim of Roman citizenship to prevent any unjust punishment, as it could never be justified to bind and beat a Roman, let alone a servant of God.
