# Acts 22:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief captain was afraid after realizing that he had bound a Roman citizen, fearing the consequences of his actions. The soldiers were about to torture Paul by scourging him, but upon hearing that he was a Roman, they immediately stopped and backed off. It is notable that the old magical power of the words Civis Romanus sum still held weight, as Paul's status as a Roman citizen had a significant impact, prompting fear and causing the soldiers to cease their actions.
