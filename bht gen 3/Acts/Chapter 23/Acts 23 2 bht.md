# Acts 23:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest, Ananias, who had a reputation for being revengeful and rapacious, was provoked by Paul's assertion of his integrity during his trial before him. This act of smiting Paul on the mouth was not only illegal but extremely offensive to a Jew, and it was meant to silence him. However, this kind of insult was not uncommon among the Jews and was similar to the treatment Jesus received before the same council. The Lord allows the wicked to be carried away by Satan, exposing their lack of equity and temperance, as was the case with Ananias.
