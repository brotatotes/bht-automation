# Acts 23:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's nephew, who may have been studying in Jerusalem, obtained inside information about the conspiracy against his uncle. It is suggested that the conspirators might have belonged to the Zealots, reflecting the prevailing sentiment against Paul in Jerusalem. By using the singular form, the nephew displays deference to Lysias' authority and implies that the conspirators' plans were not entirely baseless. Though the exact source of the young man's intelligence remains uncertain, it is likely that he learned it from a mentor or teacher. This knowledge indicates that the plot was not as closely guarded as one might assume.
