# Acts 23:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is suggested that Paul's nephew may have gotten hints of the conspiracy against Paul from the schools he was attending in Jerusalem for his education. The conspirators may have been representatives of the Jewish sentiment towards Paul in Jerusalem, and they may have belonged to the Zealots. The use of the singular by the young man may indicate his deference to Lysias' authority and modifies the scheming of the conspirators. Though it is not clear how the young man obtained this information, it is speculated that he may have learned it from one of his Jewish teachers. Ultimately, it is implied that the Jews, referring to the Jewish sanhedrin, had agreed to desire Paul's downfall, and this young man, possibly a student under one of the council's leaders or doctors, came to know of their plans.
