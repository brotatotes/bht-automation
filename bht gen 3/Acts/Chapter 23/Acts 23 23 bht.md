The soldiers mentioned here were the heavy-armed legionary soldiers, accompanied by light-armed troops who carried a lance in their right hand. The force at Jerusalem was large enough to spare nearly 500 men to guard Paul as he left Jerusalem. The Roman officials felt it was important to protect the prisoner and preserve public peace, considering the danger of a rescue. This large and powerful escort set out in secrecy, at nine o'clock in the evening, to ensure they were unobserved.
