# Acts 23:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief captain's attempt to conceal his faults is evident in his assertion that he rescued Paul with an army, when in reality, Paul was about to be killed. The captain conveniently neglects to mention that he had already bound and ordered Paul to be scourged before discovering his Roman citizenship. By reversing the order of events and presenting himself as Paul's protector, the captain manipulates the facts to appear as a defender of fellow Roman citizens. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Lord used this situation for Paul's benefit.
