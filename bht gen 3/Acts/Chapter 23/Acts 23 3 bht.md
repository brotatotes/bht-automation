# Acts 23:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our blessed Saviour serves as the perfect pattern for us, and by emulating His words and actions, we can navigate any circumstance. Although Paul's fervent response may justify a similar reply, it should not be used as a model. However, Paul's conviction that God's just punishment would befall Ananias for his unjust deeds proved true, as he was later killed during the Jewish war. Despite the accuracy of calling him a hypocrite, it was not a wise approach for a prisoner to address a judge.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our blessed Saviour is to us, in all His words and acts, the perfect pattern for all under all circumstances: by aiming at whatever He did in each case, we shall do best." 
2. "That Paul thus answered, might go far to excuse a like fervent reply in a Christian or a minister of the gospel,â€”but must never be used to justify it: it may serve for an apology, but never for an example." 
3. "God shall (is about to, literally) smite thee] Some have seen a prophetic import in these words;â€”see above on the death of Ananias. But I would rather take them as an expression founded on a conviction that Godâ€™s just retribution would come on unjust and brutal acts."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God shall smite theeâ€”as
	indeed He did; for he was killed by an assassin during the Jewish war." 
2. "Thou whited wallâ€”that is, hypocrite."
3. "This epithet, however correctly describing the man, must not be defended as addressed to a judge, though the remonstrance which followsâ€”"for sittest thou," &amp;c.â€”ought to have put him to shame."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God shall punish thee. God is just; and he will not suffer such a manifest violation of all the laws of a fair trial to pass unavenged."
2. "This expression of Paul, 'God shall smite thee,' is not to be regarded in the light of an imprecatio, or as an expression of angry feeling, but of a prediction, or of a strong conviction on the mind of Paul that a man so hypocritical and unjust as Ananias was could not escape the vengeance of God."
3. "Thou whited wall - This is evidently a proverbial expression, meaning thou hypocrite."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall smite thee...is about to smite...a prophecy of punishment for his violent dealing."
2. "Thou whited wall."
3. "Contrary to the law...transgressing the law."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ will have those that be his to be ready to suffer another injury after that they have already received one; and by this means he represseth all desire of revenge."
2. "This is a brief and true definition of patience which beseemeth all the faithful, that they break not out into wrathfulness, that they do not one evil turn for another; but that they overcome evil with goodness."
3. "So Paul did not speak for his own sake, that he might, with sharp words, requite the injury done to him by the high priest; but because he was a minister of the word of God, he would not wink at an offense which did deserve sharp and serious reprehension."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prophecy was fulfilled to the letter."
2. "Thou whited wall; although it is possible the allusion was simply to a wall roughly and coarsely built of clay."
3. "...the noble Luther (quoted by Lange) thus writes of the transaction: â€˜If St. Paul in this manner assails the priest who was appointed by the law of Moses, why should I hesitate to assail those painted bishops and monks that come from the pope, without any authority from God or from man.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou whited wall...a hypocrite, undoubtedly true, but not a particularly tactful thing for a prisoner to say to his judge." 
2. "And thou (being what thou art) art sitting...judging me." 
3. "Contrary to the law...acting contrary to the law."

### John Gill:
1. "God shall smite thee... a retaliation would be made, and that the measure he meted, would be measured to him again." 
2. "May God smite thee... this is a curse written in the law. Though this instance of the apostle ought not to be drawn into example, any more than those of other saints..."
3. "Thou whited wall... hypocrite, in like manner as Christ compares the hypocritical Scribes and Pharisees to whited sepulchres."

### John Wesley:

- Attempt 1 BHT: Our blessed Saviour is the perfect pattern for us in all circumstances, and by aiming at whatever He did, we shall do best. Although Paul's fervent reply might excuse a similar response, it must never be used to justify it. Paul's words of admonition to Ananias were not only an apology, but a conviction that God's just retribution would come on unjust and brutal acts. Calling Ananias a hypocrite can undoubtedly be seen as a true descriptor, but it is not a particularly tactful thing for a prisoner to say to his judge. Nonetheless, Paul's prophecy of punishment for Ananias' violent dealing was fulfilled, as God did indeed smite him for his unjust actions.
