# Acts 23:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it was shown that there would be a plot, I gave commandment to his accusers to say before thee, charging his accusers also. Though I thought him innocent, yet, hearing of this further plot against the life of a Roman citizen, I judged it wise to refer the whole matter to you, as they went about to kill Paul treacherously. It appears they have no reason, seeking to kill him without any cause, and I sent him to Felix, the governor, lest he should incur blame and disgrace.
