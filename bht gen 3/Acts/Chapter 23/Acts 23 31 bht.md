# Acts 23:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers, as commanded, took Paul on a hard night's ride, travelling forty miles to Antipatris. This town, built by Herod the Great, was located in a fine plain and watered with many springs and fountains. It was about thirty-eight miles northwest of Jerusalem and still had twenty-six miles left to travel before reaching CÃ¦sarea. Interestingly, it was the same town where Simon the Just had once met Alexander the Great after a night of travel. Although the apostle couldn't stay to preach the Gospel there, a church was established in Antipatris in the fifth century.
