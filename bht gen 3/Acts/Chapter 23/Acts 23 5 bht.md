## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I believe that the only rendering open to us, consistently with the simple meaning of the words, and the facts of history is, I did not know that it (or he) was the high priest."
2. "The objection stated by Dr. Wordsworth...would of course he easily answered by supposing that Paul...may not...have known him at all personally."
3. "Even in this we see the consummate skill of St. Paul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle's long absence from Jerusalem, and perhaps the manner in which he was habited or the seat he occupied, with other circumstances to us unknown, may account for such a speech."
2. "What can surpass the grace with which he recovered his self-possession, and the frankness with which he acknowledged his error?"
3. "If his conduct in yielding to the momentary impulse was not that of Christ Himself under a similar provocation, certainly the manner in which he atoned for his fault was Christ-like."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The true interpretation... shows that Luke, in this account, accords entirely with the truth of history."
3. "Paul declares here that he would not be guilty of showing disrespect for [the office of high priest], or of using reproachful language in regard to it."

1. "I wist not ( Î¿Ï… Ì“ Îº á¼¤ Í… Î´ÎµÎ¹Î½ ) that he was the high priest." 
2. "Paul on this occasion â€˜spoke unadvisedly with his lips,â€™ a fault which the noble-hearted man was himself, as we shall see, swift to acknowledge."
3. "I spake the angry words without reflection. I thought at that moment of bitter indignation nothing of high priest or president of the supreme council of Israel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Greek naturally means that Paul did not know that it was the high priest who gave the order to smite his mouth." 
2. "Another way of explaining it is to say that Paul was so indignant, even angry, at the command that he spoke without considering who it was that gave the order."
3. "Paul at once recognizes the justice of the point made against him. He had been guilty of irreverence against the office of high priest as the passage from Exodus 22:18 (LXX) shows and confesses his fault, but the rebuke was deserved."

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. "I did not advert to it, in the prophetic transport of my mind..."
2. "...his not adverting to it proceeded from the power of the Spirit coming upon him; as knowing they were not able to bear it."
3. "This answer admirably shows the situation of mind he was then in, partly with regard to the bystanders, whom he thus softens, adding also the title of brethren..."
