## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All prospect of a fair trial was hopeless: he well knew from fact, and present experience, that personal odium would bias his judges, and violence prevail over justice: he therefore uses, in the cause of Truth, the maxim so often perverted to the cause of falsehood, 'divide, and govern.'"
2. "In one tenet above all others, did the religion of Jesus Christ and the belief of the Pharisees coincide: that of the resurrection of the dead."
3. "The belief was commonâ€”in the truest sense it was the hope of Israelâ€”in the truest sense does Paul use and bring it forward to confound the adversaries of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee [...] of the hope and resurrection of the dead." 
2. "[...] the doctrine of a resurrection being common to both, though they would totally differ in their application of it." 
3. "This was, of course, quite warrantable, and the more so as it was already evident that no impartiality in trying his cause was to be looked for from such an assembly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Knowing, therefore, how sensitive they were on the subject of the resurrection, he seems to have resolved to do what he would not have done had they been disposed to hear him according to the rules of justice - to abandon the direct argument for his defense, and to enlist a large part, perhaps a majority of the council, in his favor. Whatever may be thought of the propriety of this course, it cannot be denied that it was a masterstroke of policy, and that it evinced a profound knowledge of human nature."
2. "Of the hope and resurrection of the dead - That is, of the hope that the dead will be raised. This is the real point of the opposition to me."
3. "With great propriety, therefore, he might address the Pharisees and say, 'Brethren, the doctrine which has distinguished you from the Sadducees is at stake. The doctrine which is at the foundation of all our hopes - the resurrection of the dead; the doctrine of our fathers, of the Scriptures, of our sect, is in danger... For my zeal in that I have been opposed. I have excited the ridicule of the Gentile and the hatred of the Sadducee. I have thus been persecuted and arraigned; and for my zeal in urging the argument in defense of it which I have deemed most irrefragable - the resurrection of the Messiah - I have been arraigned, and now cast myself on your protection against the mad zeal of the enemies of the doctrine of our fathers.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Perceiving the impossibility of getting a fair hearing, Paul, with great tact, seeks to bring the two parties of the council into collision with each other."
2. "The resurrection. A main point of contention between the Pharisees and Sadducees, the latter of whom denied the doctrine of the resurrection, of a future state, and of any spiritual existence apart from the body."

### John Calvin:
1. "He knew that those who had conspired together against him were enemies also one to another."
2. "We must note that Paul did so begin, as that he was desirous truly and plainly to unfold the whole matter."
3. "So we see that the factions which are in Popery hot, âˆ’ (532) are quiet only so long as they join hand in hand to oppress the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Surely no defence of Paul for adopting this course is required, but our admiration is due to his skill and presence of mind." 
2. "He well knew, from past and present experience, that personal odium would bias his judges, and violence prevail over justice; he therefore uses in the cause of truth the maxim so often perverted to the cause of falsehood, Divide et impera."
3. "The hope of the fathers fulfilled by the coming of Jesus the Messiah, and the resurrection of the dead sealed by the resurrection of Christ, these two themes were the groundwork of all Paulâ€™s preaching."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul, with great tact, seeks to bring the two parties of the council into collision with each other."
2. "Paul knew, of course, that the Sanhedrin was nearly evenly divided between Pharisees and Sadducees, for he himself had been a Pharisee."
3. "The chief point of difference between Pharisees and Sadducees was precisely this matter of the resurrection. And this was Paul's cardinal doctrine as a Christian minister."

### John Gill:
1. "men and brethren, I am a Pharisee...the apostle still retained; 
as the belief of the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the dead, and a future state, and strict holiness of life and conversation."
2. "he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees, as well as an Hebrew of the Hebrews; 
and this is said to show that he was by education of that sect."
3. "for the hope of eternal life, and happiness in a future state, and the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead... 
that there was hope of eternal life and salvation by him."

### John Wesley:
1. I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I called in question â€” So he was in effect; although not formally, or explicitly.
