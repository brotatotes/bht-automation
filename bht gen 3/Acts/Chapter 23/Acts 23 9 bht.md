2. "By this adroit stroke, Paul engages the whole Pharisaic section of the council in his favor; the doctrine of a resurrection being common to both."  
3. "This was, of course, quite warrantable, and the more so as it was already evident that no impartiality in trying his cause was to be looked for from such an assembly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We find no evil in this man - No opinion which is contrary to the Law of Moses; no conduct in spreading the doctrine of the resurrection which we do not approve."

### John Calvin:
1. "This place doth teach what mischief disagreements bring with them. For because they take their beginning for the most part of ambition, men proceed thence unto contention, and straightway stubbornness breaketh out."
2. "For so soon as it is apparent that any doctrine is revealed from heaven, those do wickedly resist God who do not receive the same."

2. "If a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God."

2. "The Pharisees definitely take Paul's side."
3. "This is aposiopesis, not uncommon in the N.T., as in Luke 13:9; John 6:62 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1203). See one also in Exodus 32:32."

### John Gill:
1. "And there arose a great cry,.... Or noise, a loud clamour; they began to be very noisy, and to talk loud, and in high spirits, one against another." 
2. "But if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him; that is, if the Holy Spirit, as the Ethiopic version reads, has inspired him, or God by an angel has revealed anything to him, who has to say anything against it?" 
3. "Let us not fight against God; as in Acts 5:39."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every sect contains both learned and unlearned."
2. "They construe it in their own way, putting an angel or spirit for Jesus."
3. "They add nothing, only they construe it in their own way."
