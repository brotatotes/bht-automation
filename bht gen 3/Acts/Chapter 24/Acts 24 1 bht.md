# Acts 24:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After five days, Ananias and the elders, representing the Sanhedrin, informed the Roman governor against Paul, hiring Tertullus, a Roman advocate, to contend with him. This choice of a Roman lawyer was necessary because the Jews were not familiar with Roman legal procedure. Their aim went beyond proving Paul's guilt; they sought to oppress him and dampen his ability to defend himself. The high priest, aware of his illegal actions, and the elders, conscious of their involvement in the conspiracy to harm Paul, employed a rhetorician to further their oppressive intentions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "After five days" - This would be the natural point from which to date the proceedings of the High Priest, &c.
2. "Tertullus" - Many Roman youths, who were studying for the bar, were in the habit of accompanying the magistrates into the provinces, to practice themselves in pleading the causes of the provincials.
3. "Informed" - They laid information; and, as it seems, not by writing, but by word of mouth, since they appeared in person, and Paul was called to confront them.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "after five days‚Äîor, on the
	fifth day from their departure from Jerusalem." 
2. "Ananias . . . with the
	elders‚Äîa deputation of the Sanhedrim."
3. "a certain orator‚Äîone of
	those Roman advocates who trained themselves for the higher practice
	of the metropolis by practicing in the provinces, where the Latin
	language, employed in the courts, was but imperfectly understood and
	Roman forms were not familiar."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ananias, the high priest - See the notes on Acts 23:2."
2. "Descended - Came down from Jerusalem. This was the usual language when a departure from Jerusalem was spoken of. See the notes on Acts 15:1."
3. "Who informed the governor against Paul - Who acted as the accuser, or who managed their cause before the governor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. An orator [œÅŒ∑œÑŒøœÅŒøœÇ] . An advocate. The Jews, being little acquainted with Roman forms and laws, had to employ Roman advocates.


### John Calvin:
1. "Forasmuch as Paul did use no eloquence, they had no need to hire a rhetorician to contend with him in eloquence. Moreover, they did exceed both in dignity and also in multitude, so that it was an easy matter for them to oppress a poor man, and such a one as was destitute of man‚Äôs help." 
2. "Therefore it was a sign of an evil conscience, in that seeing they were men of great experience, exercised in public affairs, and skillful in matters pertaining to courts, they hire a rhetorician." 
3. "And Luke declareth this, therefore, that we may know that the Jews did omit nothing whereby they might oppress Paul; and that they might not only prove him guilty, but so dash him out of countenance, that he might not be able to defend himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Roman usage required that a case referred to the higher tribunal like this should be proceeded with as soon as possible."
2. "The ‚Äòorator‚Äô or rhetorician was an advocate acquainted with the forms of Roman law, employed by the Sanhedrim to conduct their cases in the governor‚Äôs court at C√¶sarea."
3. "The alleged Latinisms of the speech of Tertullus sprang naturally from the forms of procedure and certain of the technical terms being originally derived from Rome."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The employment of a Roman lawyer (Latin orator) was necessary since the Jews were not familiar with Roman legal procedure and it was the custom in the provinces."
2. "Tertullus is a diminutive of Tertius (Romans 16:22)."
3. "Informed (ŒµŒΩŒµœÜŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒ±ŒΩ). Same verb as in Acts 23:15; Acts 23:22, somewhat like our modern 'indictment,' certainly accusations 'against Paul' (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±œÖŒªŒøœÖ)."

### John Gill:
1. "The high priest must be conscious to himself that he had acted in an illegal manner, in ordering Paul to be smitten on the mouth, in the midst of the council."
2. "And the elders knew what a hand they had in the conspiracy against his life; and they were sensible that this plot was discovered, and Paul was secretly conveyed away."
3. "This man's title, in the Greek text, is œÅŒ∑œÑœâœÅ, 'Rhetor', a rhetorician; but though with the Latins an 'orator' and a 'rhetorician' are distinguished, an orator being one that pleads causes in courts, and a rhetorician a professor of rhetoric; yet, with the Greeks, the 'Rhetor' is an orator."
