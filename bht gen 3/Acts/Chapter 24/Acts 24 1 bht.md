# Acts 24:1 Commentary Help Text

After five days since leaving Jerusalem, Ananias and the elders, led by the high priest, appeared before the governor with accusations against Paul. Lacking familiarity with Roman legal procedures, they enlisted the help of Tertullus, a Roman orator, to present their case. This hiring of a Roman lawyer was necessary, as it was the custom in the provinces and the Jews were not well-versed in Roman law. Their actions revealed their evil intentions and the extent of their plot against Paul, but he can find encouragement in this history, knowing that justice will prevail.
