## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The abandonment of a man‚Äôs national worship and attaching himself to strange gods and modes of worship was regarded unfavourably by the Romans."
2. "The word is capable of an indifferent or of a bad sense. Tertullus had used it in the latter. Paul explains what it really was."
3. "The term was one well known to the Greeks and Romans, and which would carry with it its own justification."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our nation is divided into what they call sects‚Äîthe sect of the Pharisees, and that of the Sadducees‚Äîall the difference between them and me is, that I belong to neither of these, but to another sect, or religious section of the nation, which from its Head they call Nazarenes: for this reason, and this alone, am I hated."
2. "The Roman law allows every nation to worship its own deities; I claim protection under that law, worshipping the God of my ancestors, even as they, only of a different sect of the common religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A sect... in a bad sense - a schisomatic sect." 
2. "Worship [ŒªŒ±œÑœÅŒµœÖœâ] . Better, as Rev., serve."
3. "God of my fathers [œÑœâ œÄŒ±œÑœÅœâœâ Œ∏Œµœâ]. A familiar classical phrase, and therefore well known to Felix."

3. "By this let us learn that God is not rightly worshipped, so that our obedience can please him, unless it be of faith, which is the only ground-work of godliness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul here defends himself against the second accusation, ‚Äòthe being a ringleader of the Nazarene sect.‚Äô He boldly and gladly at once proclaims, as a long line of glorious confessors have done since his day, that he is a Christian."
2. "For fidelity to this worship surely he deserves no punishment at the hands of the government, for the Jewish religion was countenanced and protected by Rome."
3. "In this faith of his he followed out the words of the Master: ‚ÄòThink not that I am come to destroy the Law and the Prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil‚Äô (Matthew 5:17). In other words, Paul denied that in becoming a Christian or a Nazarene he had in any way apostatized from the faith of his fathers. Christianity to him was but the fulfilment of Judaism."

3. "He reasserts his faith in all the law and the prophets, holding to the Messianic hope."

### John Gill:
1. "What was truth he was not ashamed of, but ready to own, and bear his testimony for, whatever was the consequence of it."
2. "By embracing Christianity, he had not denied, and gone off from the worship of the one, only, living, and true God, the God of Israel."
3. "Since he believed whatever was contained in the sacred writings, he could not be charged justly with heresy; and as he believed, so he taught nothing but what was agreeably to the Scriptures of the Old Testament."

### John Wesley:
1. "This appellation St. Paul corrects. Not that it was then an odious word; but it was not honourable enough."
2. "A party or sect (so that word signifies) is formed by men. This way was prescribed by God."
3. "Believing all things which are written ‚Äî Concerning the Messiah."
