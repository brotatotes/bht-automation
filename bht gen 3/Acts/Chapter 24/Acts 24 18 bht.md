# Acts 24:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of my vow, engaged in the sacred service of the temple, and presenting my offerings, I was found purified and quiet by certain Jews from Asia. They falsely accused me of raising a tumult and polluting the temple, yet they failed to produce legal officers or any substantiation for their charges. Contrary to their claims, I neither gathered a crowd nor caused a stir, but instead conducted myself in a manner that was honorable and befitting the worship and service of the temple.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Amidst which they found me purified in the temple, none who detected me in the act of raising a tumult." 
2. "This would leave it to be inferred that no legal officers had apprehended him, but certain private individuals, illegally."
3. "Who besides had not come forward to substantiate any charge against him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "found me purified in the temple‚Äînot polluting it, therefore, by my own presence"
2. "neither gathering a crowd nor raising a stir"
3. "why are they not here to substantiate it?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They found me engaged in the sacred service of completing the observance of my vow."
2. "Not having introduced a multitude with me - in a quiet and peaceful manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Whereupon [ŒµŒΩ ŒøŒπœÇ] . More correctly, in which (occupation); while so engaged."
2. "The best texts, however, read ejn ai=v, in which, the pronoun agreeing in gender with offerings."
3. "The sense, according to this, is, as Rev., margin, in presenting which (offerings)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reading of the greater number of the more trustworthy MSS. here is ·ºêŒΩ Œ±·º∑œÇ instead of the received text Œµ Ãì ŒΩ Œø·º∑œÇ. This feminine form of the relative pronoun agrees with œÄœÅŒøœÉœÜŒøœÅŒ±œÇ, offerings; and thus the meaning of Paul‚Äôs words was as follows: ‚ÄòThese busybody strangers from Asia [Ephesus] found me in the temple certainly, but, far from profaning it, positively engaged in performing the rites and ceremonies which belonged to the fulfilment of a Nazarite‚Äôs vow.‚Äô"
2. "In the midst of which occupations they‚Äô (that is, the Jews) ‚Äòfound me purified‚Äô (as a Nazarite) ‚Äòin the temple, neither with multitude nor with tumult; but certain Jews from Asia.‚Äô Here a verb is wanting to make the sense perfect."
3. "The explanation of the omission is found, no doubt, in the speaker‚Äôs earnestness, Luke having given us the very words (and no more) of this remarkable defence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Purified in the temple... the very opposite of the charges made."
2. "Not with a crowd."
3. "Till they made the stir, all was quiet."

### John Gill:
1. "Certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple; and therefore could not be said to profane it." 
2. "Not profaning the temple, as they pretended, but acting according to the worship and service of it."
3. "Neither with a multitude; for there were but four men with him; nor with tumult; making any noise and riot, or stirring up persons to sedition and rebellion."
