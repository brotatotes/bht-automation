## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly Tertullus fulfils and overacts the precept, for his exordium is full of the basest flattery."
2. "Contrast with his 'great quietness' and 'worthy deeds,' the description of Tacitus, where he says that Felix, and Ventidius Cumanus, who ruled in Galilee, emulated one another in crimes and enormities."
3. "There was just enough foundation for the flattery, to make the falsehood of its general application to Felix more glaring."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness." 
2. "Felix acted with a degree of vigor and success in suppressing lawless violence."
3. "By thy providence‚Äîa phrase applied to the administration of the emperors."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though it was said for flattery, and though Felix was in many respects an unprincipled man, yet it was true that his administration had been the means of producing much peace and order in Judea." 
2. "He referred to those which have just been mentioned as having been accomplished by Felix, particularly his success in suppressing riots and seditions."
3. "By thy providence - By thy foresight, skill, vigilance, prudence."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the rhetorician doth insinuate himself under false praises, that he may darken the matter which is called in question."
2. "Therefore we see how shamefully this orator did lie. And seeing all Paul‚Äôs adversaries sing the same song, we see that they be blinded with hatred and malice, and that they treacherously betray the state of their country; neither do they pass what befall them so Paul may die the death."
3. "Therefore Tertullus commendeth the industry of Felix, because he had cleansed Judea from many corruptions, and he restored many things which would otherwise have decayed; to wit, to the end he may the more greedily seek to purchase the favor of the nation by the death of one man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Felix, during his long and burdensome administration, had at least distinguished himself by his strong measures to put down brigandage and deeds of violence in Judaea, and had waged ceaseless warfare against those wandering bands of Sicarii (assassins) which had begun to infest the country."
2. "Yet, on the other hand, this cruel and ambitious man kept in his pay a number of Sicarii himself, fanning instead of really quelling the seditious spirit then everywhere abroad."
3. "It was a skilful and delicate piece of flattery, to weave this well-known phrase of imperial adulation into his words of praise on this occasion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Obtaining much peace by thee."
2. "Forethought, old Greek word from œÄœÅŒøŒΩŒøŒøœÇ (œÄœÅŒøŒΩŒøŒµœâ in 1 Timothy 5:8; Romans 12:17; 2 Corinthians 8:21), in N.T. only here and Romans 13:14."
3. "Reform continually taking place for this nation."

### John Gill:
1. "very likely he might refer to his purging the country of robbers; he took Eleazar, the chief of them, who had infested the country for twenty years, and many others with him, whom he sent bound to Rome, and others of them he crucified."
2. "he sent armed men, horse and foot, and destroyed great numbers of them; and particularly he put to flight the Egyptian false prophet, who had collected thirty thousand men together, and dispersed them."
3. "witness the murder of Jonathan the high priest, by a sort of cutthroats, who were connived at by him; particularly by the means of Dora his friend, whom he corrupted."
