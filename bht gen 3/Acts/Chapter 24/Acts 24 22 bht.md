# Acts 24:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Felix delayed the case purposely, not because he needed more information, but to put off the Jews.

Fear of the Jews likely influenced Felix, who would have released Paul had it not been for them. The way was a term used for the disciples of Christ in the early days.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He adjourned the case purposely, not because he wanted information, but because he wished to put off the Jews."
2. "The simplest explanation is that given by De Wette: He put them off to another time, not as requiring any more information about 'the way,' for that matter he knew before,‚Äîbut waiting for the arrival of Lysias."
3. "Not literally and absolutely, for he was in military custody, but it was relaxed as much as was consistent with safe custody. Remission, or relaxation, would perhaps be a better rendering than 'liberty.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Felix might have dismissed the case as a tissue of unsupported charges."
2. "But if from his interest in the matter he really wished to have the presence of Lysias and others involved, a brief delay was not unworthy of him as a judge."
3. "Certainly, so far as recorded, neither Lysias nor any other parties appeared again in the case."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Although he had a more perfect knowledge of the Christian doctrine than Paul‚Äôs accusers had, yet he deferred the hearing of the cause until Lysias had come down."
2. "He deferred them, and said, after I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias has come down, I will hear the cause."
3. "I will know the uttermost ... - I shall be fully informed, and prepared to decide the cause."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Deferred [Œ±ŒΩŒµŒ≤Œ±ŒªŒµœÑŒø] . Adjourned the case. Only here in New Testament. 
I will know the uttermost [Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒøŒºŒ±Œπ] . Better, as Rev., I will determine. See on ch. Acts 23:15.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is little doubt but that Felix would have liberated the prisoner after hearing his defence, had not the same motives fear of the Jews influenced him at this juncture which induced him two years later, when he was removed from his office, still to leave Paul bound."
2. "The procurator, after hearing publicly the accusation and the prisoner‚Äôs defence, as he could not possibly gratify the powerful Jewish party by condemning him, endeavoured to conciliate them by remanding the prisoner until such time when he should obtain further details respecting the case."
3. "Here, as in chap. Acts 9:2, Acts 19:9; Acts 19:23, Acts 22:4, occurs the famous term which, in the early days of the faith, was evidently used familiarly as a synonym for the disciples of Christ ‚Äòthe way.‚Äô"
