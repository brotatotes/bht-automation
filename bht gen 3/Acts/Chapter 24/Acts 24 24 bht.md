## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Drusilla...was betrothed at six years old...she was married to the more obsequious Azizus, king of Emesa." 
2. "Felix, being enamoured of her beauty, persuaded her...to leave her husband and live with him."
3. "Both mother and son perished in an eruption of Vesuvius, in the reign of Titus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Felix . . . with his wife Drusilla . . . a Jewessâ€”This beautiful but infamous woman was the third daughter of Herod Agrippa I, who was eaten of worms... She was 'given in marriage to Azizus, king of the Emesenes, who had consented to be circumcised for the sake of the alliance. But this marriage was soon dissolved... persuaded her to desert her husband, transgress the laws of her country, and marry himself' [JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 20.7.1,2]. Such was this 'wife' of Felix."
2. "he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christâ€”Perceiving from what he had heard on the trial that the new sect which was creating such a stir was represented by its own advocates as but a particular development of the Jewish faith, he probably wished to gratify the curiosity of his Jewish wife, as well as his own, by a more particular account of it from this distinguished champion."
3. "And no doubt Paul would so far humor this desire as to present to them the great leading features of the Gospel. But from Acts 24:25 it is evident that his discourse took an entirely practical turn, suited to the life which his two auditors were notoriously leading."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "She was, therefore, living in adultery with him, and this was probably the reason why Paul dwelt in his discourse before Felix particularly on 'temperance,' or chastity."
2. "He sent for Paul, and heard him - Perhaps he did this in order to be more fully acquainted with the case which was submitted to him."
3. "Concerning the faith in Christ - Concerning the Christian religion. Faith in Christ is often used to denote the whole of Christianity, as it is the leading and characteristic feature of the religion of the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Princess Drusilla occupied no unimportant position among the women of the middle of the first century of the Christian era."
2. "Endowed, like her sister Bernice, whose name was a name of shame even in the careless and profligate Roman society of that age, with the often dangerous gift of extreme beauty..."
3. "She must have heard of the death of James and of the imprisonment of Peter in her girlhood; and she may have connected her fatherâ€™s tragic end at the games of CÃ¦sarea with the part he had taken in persecuting the very sect to which the prisoner now in custody in her husbandâ€™s palace belonged."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "She was one of three daughters of Herod Agrippa I (Drusilla, Mariamne, Bernice). Her father murdered James, her great-uncle Herod Antipas slew John the Baptist, her great-grandfather (Herod the Great) killed the babes of Bethlehem." 
2. "Perhaps the mention of Drusilla as 'his own wife' is to show that it was not a formal trial on this occasion."
3. "Page thinks that she was responsible for the interview because of her curiosity to hear Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "This woman was the daughter of Herod Agrippa, who was eaten by worms...but though she was born of Jewish parents, and so a Jewess, as she is here called, yet her name was a Roman name."
2. "Herod Agrippa left three daughters...Mariamne and Drusilla were virgins, but were promised in marriage by their father."
3. "Felix...seeing Drusilla, was enamoured with her beauty; and by the means of one of his friends...he enticed her from her husband, and prevailed upon her to marry him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Felix persuaded her to forsake her husband... and to be married to himself, though a heathen." 
2. "She was afterward, with a son she had by Felix, consumed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius."
3. "Concerning the faith in Christ â€” That is, the doctrine of Christ."
