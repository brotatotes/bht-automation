# Acts 24:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's imprisonment in Caesarea under Felix was marked by a state of the province riddled with robbers and false prophets, causing unrest among the people. Eager to please the Jews and earn their thanks, Felix left Paul in military custody, enabling him to continue communicating with the churches and realizing that he himself was not essential to the cause of Christ. However, Felix's attempts to curry favor with the Jews through his treatment of Paul ultimately failed, leading to his downfall.
