# Acts 24:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We always accept it, not only here in your presence but also at all times and in all places, most noble Felix. The Jews, even though they deemed you the embodiment of cruelty, lust, and greed, commended your conduct and spoke well of you to flatter your ego. However, this was nothing more than a refinement of flattery. They observed with pleasure the provident care you took of their nation, claiming that many reforms and amendments occurred through your providence.
