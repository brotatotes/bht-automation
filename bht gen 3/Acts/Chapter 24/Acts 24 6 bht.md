# Acts 24:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Considerable difficulty arises from the omission of the words in brackets, as it is hard to imagine so little assigned to the speaker without them. The charge of attempting to profane the temple is entirely false, but it was used as a accusation against Paul. The unfair and untruthful gloss with which the advocate covers the transaction aligns with the false tone of his whole speech. The word profane comes from pro fanum, meaning in front of the sanctuary; that which is kept outside the fane because unholy.
