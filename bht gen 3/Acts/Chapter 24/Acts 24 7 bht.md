# Acts 24:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The false accusation against the public officer was a calculated attempt to harm his reputation. However, instead of addressing the issue, the people turned on each other, putting the prisoner in grave danger. Thankfully, the officer fulfilled his duty and rescued him from their grasp. The Sanhedrim meeting was intended solely to judge the prisoner according to their own laws, but these additional words were likely added to prejudice Felix against Lysias. Yet, the account shows that Paul was released without violence once the Roman soldiers arrived, contradicting Tertullus' misrepresentation of the facts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a wilful falsehood and calumnious charge against a public officer."
2. "only when, instead of doing so, they fell to disputing among themselves, and the prisoner was in danger of being 'pulled in pieces of them'...did he rescue him, as was his duty, 'by force' out of their hands."
3. "He had commanded the Sanhedrim to meet for no other purpose than to 'judge him according to their law'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tertullus pretends that they would have judged Paul righteously if Lysias had not interposed..."
2. "The truth was, that, without regard to law or justice..."
3. "...they would have murdered him on the spot."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Sanhedrim council were extremely bitter against Claudius Lysias, and the intention evidently of their advocateâ€™s words here (if we admit them as genuine), was to insinuate that all was going on in order and in strict conformity to the law, until the commander in the castle of Antonia violently and oppressively interfered."
2. "Tertullus misstates the facts. When the Roman soldiers came on the scene, the Jews evidently at once released Paul without further violence: â€˜When they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paulâ€™ (chap. Acts 21:32)."
3. "Here again Tertullus misstates the facts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is beyond doubt a later addition to the incomplete report of the speech of Tertullus."
2. "The motive of the added words is clearly to prejudice Felix against Lysias and they contradict the record in Acts 24:21."
3. "More likely they are a clumsy attempt to complete the speech of Tertullus."

### John Gill:
1. "But the chief captain Lysias came upon us...suddenly, and with great haste, before they could execute their designs." 
2. "...and with great violence took him away out of our hands; for he came with an army, and rescued him." 
3. "Some copies add, 'and sent him to thee'; and so the Syriac version reads."
