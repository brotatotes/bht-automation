# Acts 24:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tertullus falsely accuses Paul of being a threat to the public and claims the Sanhedrin intended to judge him according to their law. These words appear to be a later addition, made to prejudice Felix against Lysias and contradict the record. The Jews, disregarding justice, would have killed Paul if Lysias had not intervened. Lysias, fulfilling his duty, rescued Paul with force and haste. The Sanhedrin's bitterness towards Lysias is evident in their attempts to portray him as the oppressor, although historical facts disprove this portrayal.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
