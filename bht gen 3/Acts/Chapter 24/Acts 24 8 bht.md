# Acts 24:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Certainly it might be said that Tertullus would hardly refer the governor to Lysias, whose interference he had just characterized negatively. By examining whom‚ÄîLysias. By examining him thyself, not by torture, but by hearing what Paul has to say in defense of himself. The English reader should be cautioned against one mistake: the referring whom to the accusers. This cannot be, as the relative 'whom' is singular.

- Attempt 3 BHT: It could be argued that Tertullus, in his attempt to shift blame from the accusers to the governor, suggests that it was unnecessary for Felix to trouble himself with the case and that he should have left it to the Jewish tribunal instead. However, it is likely that Tertullus was insinuating that Felix, by examining Lysias, would come to know the truth and see that Paul was guilty of the accusations against him. Despite the accusations, it is important to note that Paul, as a Roman citizen, was to be examined fairly and thoroughly, without the use of torture.
