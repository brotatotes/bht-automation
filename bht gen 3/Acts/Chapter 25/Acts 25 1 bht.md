After three days, Festus, the new governor, entered upon his province in Jud√¶a to make himself acquainted with the great central city of his government. Although Jud√¶a was only a procuratorship attached to the province of Syria, it was loosely referred to as a province due to its importance. The decision to journey from Caesarea to Jerusalem allowed Festus to gain a deeper understanding of the affairs of the nation. This demonstrates the significance of Jerusalem in shaping the political landscape during that time.
