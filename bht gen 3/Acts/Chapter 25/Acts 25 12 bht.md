# Acts 25:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ruling on Paul's appeal to Caesar, Festus may have felt a mix of surprise and resentment. Little expecting such an appeal, Festus was obliged to respect it, but as a Roman citizen, Paul had the right to appeal. Festus, exercising his discretion, conferred with his council, an assembly of counsellors that often advised the governor. Perhaps with a hint of derision, Festus delivered the sentence, knowing the weary delays and harsh treatment that Paul would likely encounter in Caesar's court.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Festus, taken by surprise by Paul's appeal to Caesar, was obligated to honor it. However, there was some discretion given to governors in admitting such appeals. Festus, therefore, consulted with his council, which acted as an assembly of counsellors. This council was made up of officials who advised the governor in matters of judgment. Festus, in a manner to rid himself of the trouble in Paul's case, allowed the appeal, thus freeing himself from any objections. While it is unclear if Festus fully believed in Paul's innocence, he may have harbored a sense of derision when he pronounced that Paul would be sent to Caesar's court, knowing the harsh treatment and delays he would likely face.
