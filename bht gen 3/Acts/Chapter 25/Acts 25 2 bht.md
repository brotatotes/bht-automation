3. "They kept on beseeching as a special favor to the Jews."

### John Gill:

2. "They took the first opportunity of waiting upon him, when he was come to Jerusalem; hoping it might be a favourable one to them."
3. "They brought a bill of information against Paul, and gave a large account of him, what a wicked man he was, and what evils he had committed."
