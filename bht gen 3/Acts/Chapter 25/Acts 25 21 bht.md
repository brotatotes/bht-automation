## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Augustus implies that he was something more than man: for all most revered and sacred things are called august." 
2. "Whence also they called him Sebastos, after the Greek manner, as one to be adored, from sebazomai, to adore."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 21. the hearing of Augustus—the
	imperial title first conferred by the Roman Senate on Octavius.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "To be reserved - To be kept; not to be tried at Jerusalem, but to be sent to Rome for trial."
2. "Unto the hearing - Margin, 'the judgment.' That Augustus might hear and decide the cause."
3. "The name Augustus Σεβαστός Sebastos properly denotes 'what is venerable, or worthy of honor and reverence.' It was first applied to Caesar Octavianus, who was the Roman emperor in the time when our Saviour was born, and who is usually nailed Augustus Caesar."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of the Emperor [του σεβαστου] . Lit., the august one; hence a translation of Augustus, which was not a proper name, but a title of the Roman emperors.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is evidently in Festus’ words an under-current of a not unnatural displeasure at the appeal to Cæsar."
2. "The Greek word translated ‘Augustus’ ( Σεβαστου ͂) is an adjective signifying venerable ( venerandus), and is the Greek equivalent for Augustus a title of pre-eminent honour and dignity."
3. "It is curious that of these two world-famous titles, while the higher, ‘Augustus,’ now belongs to the storied past, the lower and less distinguished has been adopted not by the Roman, but, singularly enough, by the Teutonic and Slavonic peoples, as the designation of their supreme magistrate, under the very slightly altered ‘Kaiser’ and ‘Czar.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Greek term Σεβαστος has the notion of worship (cf. σεβασμα in Acts Acts 17:25). In the N.T. only here, verse Acts 25:25; Acts 27:1 (of the legion). It was more imposing than 'Caesar' which was originally a family name (always official in the N.T.) and it fell in with the tendency toward emperor-worship which later played such a large part in Roman life and which Christians opposed so bitterly."
2. "Instead of 'the Emperor' it should be 'the Augustus,' as Σεβαστος is simply the Greek translation of Augustus, the adjective (Revered, Reverent) assumed by Octavius B.C. 27 as the αγνομεν that summed up all his various offices instead of Rex so offensive to the Romans having led to the death of Julius Caesar."
3. "Here 'Caesar' is used as the title of Nero instead of 'Augustus' as Κυριος (Lord) occurs in verse Acts 25:26."

### John Gill:
1. "to have his cause heard, tried, and judged of, by the Roman Emperor Nero, here called Augustus"
2. "his original surname was Thurinus, but this being objected to him as a reproachful one, he afterwards took the name of Caesar, and then of Augustus"
3. "till he could have an opportunity of sending him to Rome, to take his trial before the emperor."
