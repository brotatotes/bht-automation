# Acts 25:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus confesses the uncertainty and vagueness of the charges against Paul due to the Jews' exaggerations and fictions. Despite this, he suggests sending Paul to Caesar without any definite accusations, exposing his insincere intentions. The title Lord was rejected by Augustus and Tiberius, but subsequent emperors accepted it. During Domitian's reign, it became an established imperial title. Christians, however, held firmly to their faith, refusing to say Lord Caesar and instead affirming Lord Jesus even in the face of persecution. Festus's examination of Paul was more for his own convenience than a fair trial.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Festus admits that the charges against Paul are unclear and indefinite, filled with exaggerations and fictions from the Jews. However, he proposes to send Paul to Caesar without any certain crime or accusation against him. This confession exposes Festus's insincerity and his desperate attempt to get himself out of a predicament. The title Lord was accepted by the emperors who followed Augustus and Tiberius, and it became a recognized imperial title during the time of Domitian. The Christians, on the other hand, refused to say Lord Caesar and insisted on saying Lord Jesus, even if it meant certain death. This examination of Paul by Festus was not a fair trial, but rather a convenient way for Festus to handle the situation.
