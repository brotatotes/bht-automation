# Acts 25:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The king's curiosity to see and hear Paul, the man who had caused such commotion and was reshaping Jewish life, was piqued. Festus, however, regarded Christianity as irrelevant, not concerning himself with its truth or falsehood.

Festus hoped that by listening to the proceedings, he would become better acquainted with the hidden history of the case and provide a clear and definite report to the authorities.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I would also hearâ€”"should like to hear."
2. "The king knoweth of these things . . . for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."
3. "Hence his curiosity to see and hear the man who had raised such commotion and was remodelling to such an extent the whole Jewish life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the case of Agrippa, we have an instance of the reasons which induce many people to hear the gospel. He had no belief in it; he had no concern for its truth or its promises; but he was led by curiosity to desire to hear a minister of the gospel of Christ."
2. "In Festus we have a specimen of the manner in which the great, and the rich, and the proud usually regard Christianity. They esteem it to be a subject in which they have no interest...Whether he be alive or not; whether Christianity be true or false, they suppose is a question which does not pertain to them."
3. "In Paul we have the example of a man unlike both Festus and Agrippa. He felt a deep interest in the subject...He was willing not only to look at it, but to stake his life, his reputation, his all, on its truth...Before any tribunal; before any class of people; in the presence of princes, nobles, and kings, of Romans and of Jews, he was ready to pour forth irresistible eloquence and argument in defense of the truth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Crimes [Î±Î¹Ï„Î¹Î±Ï‚] . Rev., more correctly, charges. 


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Festus hoped, and not without reason, that the examination before so great a man as Agrippa one, too, who was so well versed in the difficult question of Jewish law and tradition would elicit fresh facts hitherto kept in the background."
2. "By listening to the proceedings, the Roman official felt he personally would become better acquainted with the secret history of the whole affair, and more competent to write a clear and definite report to the authorities at home."
3. "He had newly come into office, and he was aware that a confused, contradictory statement might seriously injure him at Rome."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unreasonable (Î±Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Î½). Old word from Î± privative and Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Ï‚ (reason, speech). 'Without reason' as of animals (Judges 1:10; 2 Peter 2:12), 'contrary to reason' here." 
2. "In sending (Ï€ÎµÎ¼Ï€Î¿Î½Ï„Î±). Note accusative case with the infinitive ÏƒÎ·Î¼Î±Î½Î± though Î¼Î¿ (dative) just before. Cf. same variation in Acts 15:22; Acts 22:17."
3. "The charges (Ï„Î±Ï‚ Î±Î¹Ï„Î¹Î±Ï‚). This naive confession of Festus reveals how unjust has been his whole treatment of Paul. He had to send along with the appeal of Paul litterae dimissoriae (Î±Ï€Î¿ÏƒÏ„Î¿Î») which would give a statement of the case."

### John Gill:
1. "For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner... and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him."
2. "It seemed to Festus an absurd thing... mere madness and folly; to send him a prisoner, and not signify in his letter to him, what was laid to his charge."
3. "He hoped therefore, upon this re-examination of Paul before Agrippa, he should come to a more certain knowledge of this affair, and be better furnished to give Nero an account of it, to whom the apostle had appealed."
