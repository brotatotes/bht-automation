# Acts 25:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amid grievous complaints and heavy accusations, Paul boldly challenged his opponents to substantiate any of their charges, whether political or religious. The repetition and vehemence they displayed only served as a substitute for actual proof. Festus recognized the lack of evidence for their claims and saw through their attempt to intimidate Paul. His enemies gathered menacingly, hoping to discredit him, but his unwavering commitment to moral conduct and obedience to both divine and earthly laws ultimately revealed their false accusations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From his reply, and Festus' statement of the case before Agrippa, these charges seem to have been a jumble of political and religious matter which they were unable to substantiate..." 
2. "Paul's reply, not given in full, was probably little more than a challenge to prove any of their charges, whether political or religious."
3. "clamorously, as at Jerusalem"

### Albert Barnes:
1. Grievous complaints - Heavy accusations. Doubtless the same with which they had charged him before Felix, Acts 24:5-6. Compare Acts 25:19.
Which they could not prove - Acts 24:13, Acts 24:19.


### John Calvin:
1. "And this is almost always the estate of the servants of Christ, wherefore they must be the more courageous, to pass valiantly through evil report and good report."
2. "Furthermore, let us note that the wicked can never be bridled, but they will speak evil of good men, and will impudently slander them; for they resemble the nature of Satan, by whose spirit they are led."
3. "But the defense of Paul doth show what things the Jews laid principally to his charge. The first crime was ungodliness against God, that he overthrew the law and polluted the temple; the other, rebellion against Caesar and the Roman empire, because he raised tumults everywhere."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His enemies in the meantime had also arrived, and they seem to have gathered round the prisoner in the judgment-hall in a menacing manner, probably hoping to intimidate him."
2. "The Thessalonian outbreak and the old charge that the apostle had been teaching that allegiance was due to another king than CÃ¦sar (Acts 17:6-8), were raked up, perhaps this time with witnesses; but all these things were untrue and unreal, and the Roman saw through the attempt, and listened and evidently believed Paulâ€™s denial of any treasonable designs against the emperor."
3. "But in spite of his conviction of the prisonerâ€™s innocence of what he naturally deemed the graver charge, he seems to have felt that in some way or another the accused had transgressed some of the regulations and laws of his own strange people, and that it would be well if he would agree (he never forgot the prisoner was a citizen of Rome) to be handed over to the national Jewish courts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They have no lawyer this time, but they mass their forces so as to impress Festus."
2. "This word Î±Î¹Ï„Î¹Ï‰Î¼Î± for old form Î±Î¹Ï„Î¹Î±Î¼Î± is found in one papyrus (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary) in sense of 'blame.'"
3. "Repetition and reiteration and vehemence took the place of proof."

### John Gill:
1. "For his moral conversation, both before and after conversion, was very strict and conformable to the laws of God and man."
2. "And yet as pure and inoffensive as he was, he was not exempt from the calumnies of men."
3. "It was his happiness, and to his honour through the grace of God, that his enemies could not make good anyone thing against him."

### John Wesley:
1. Bringing many accusations â€” When many accusations are heaped together, frequently not one of them is true.
