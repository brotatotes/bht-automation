# Acts 25:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus, seeking to please the Jews and gain favor, asked Paul if he would agree to be tried by the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. Although Festus seemed to offer a change of location, his true motive was to shift the blame onto Paul and avoid the responsibility of denying the trial in Jerusalem. Paul, having faced the mob and the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem before, knew that he would not receive justice there. Little did Festus know that God was orchestrating these events, as Paul's refusal would lead to his appeal to Rome.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The question is asked of Paul as a Roman citizen, having a right to be tried by Roman law..."
2. "It seems to propose only a change of place; but doubtless in it was contained by implication a sentence pronounced by the Sanhedrim."
3. "Festus may very probably have anticipated the rejection of this proposal by Paul, and have wished to make it appear that the obstacle in the way of Paul being tried by the Sanhedrim arose not from him, but from the prisoner himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Desirous of securing their favor, as he had just entered on his administration."
2. "In this he evinced rather a desire of popularity than an inclination to do justice."
3. "As the question which he asked Paul was one on which he was at liberty to take his own course, and as Paul had no reason to expect that his going to Jerusalem would facilitate the cause of justice, it is not remarkable that he declined the offer."

### Marvin Vincent:

1. "He felt clearly that there was no sufficient evidence to prove the charge of treason or sedition, which was really all he, as an official of the Empire, had to take cognisance of."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Festus, like Felix, falls a victim to fear of the Jews."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Festus, the Roman official, asked Paul if he would be willing to be tried by the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. This proposal was most likely insincere, as Festus wanted to appease the Jews without actually granting their request. He knew Paul would reject the offer, but he wanted to avoid the backlash of denying the trial in Jerusalem. Festus, like Felix before him, was swayed by fear of the Jews and was more concerned with gaining favor than seeking justice. Paul had already endured years of deception and now faced Festus's cunning tactics, which only added to his frustration. However, unbeknownst to Festus, God was using this situation to fulfill His plan, as Paul's refusal would ultimately lead to his appeal to Rome.
