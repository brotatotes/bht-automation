# Acts 26:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The significance of the word holy in this context cannot be overlooked, as it carries a deeper meaning in the New Testament and the Septuagint compared to the external practices of pagans. Interestingly, it is the standard word for holiness even in the Old Testament, which emphasizes externality. Paul's confession of voting against the early Christians reveals his past as a persecutor of the saints, emphasizing the mercy of God. His confident and bold tone in this speech before Agrippa and Festus resembles that of a fearless advocate rather than a powerless prisoner.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the history of those transactions, there is no account of any Christian being put to death except Stephen, Acts 7:0. But there is no improbability in supposing that the same thing which had happened to Stephen had occurred in other cases." 
2. "Stephen was the first martyr, and as he was a prominent man his case is particularly recorded."
3. "It is evident, also, that Paul instigated them in this persecution, and urged them on to deeds of blood and cruelty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "On this word agiov, holy, which occurs over two hundred times in the New Testament, it is to be noted how the writers of the Greek scriptures, both in the New Testament and, what is more remarkable, in the Septuagint, bring it out from the background in which it was left by classical writers, and give preference to it over words which, in pagan usage, represented conceptions of mere externality in religion."
2. "Even in the Old Testament, where externality is emphasized, agiov is the standard word for holy."
3. "The phrase may be taken as expressing merely moral assent and approval."

### John Calvin:
1. "He doth not spare his own estimation, but doth willingly utter his own shame, that the mercy of God may the more plainly appear thereby."
2. "Though Paul might have retained the fame of a courageous man, yet he confesseth he was a madman."
3. "Though the very denial itself containeth an horrible blasphemy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Before the Jews he shrank from using any expression of reverential admiration which might arouse his angry countrymen‚Äôs wrath against the sect of whom they were already so unreasonably jealous; but now, speaking before men of the world like Agrippa and Festus, he gives these noble martyrs, long since in Paradise, a title of honour which aggravated his own guilt as their persecutor."
2. "Indeed, as it has been well remarked, the confident, bold tone of the whole of this speech sounds less like the words of a prisoner defending himself, than of a fearless advocate pleading before a tribunal."
3. "This assertion by Paul of his having voted for the death of certain of the 'saints' in the early Church, has been taken as a proof of his having been, in his Pharisee days, a member of the supreme council of the Sanhedrim. This is possible, but is by no means certain."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I both shut up many (œÄŒøŒªŒªŒøœÖœÇ œÑŒµ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµŒ∫ŒªŒµŒπœÉŒ±)."
2. "Having received authority from the chief priests (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒ± œÑœâŒΩ Œ±œÅœáŒπŒµœÅŒµœâŒΩ ŒµŒæŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ±ŒΩ ŒªŒ±Œ≤œâŒΩ)."
3. "I gave my vote against them (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑ŒΩŒµŒ≥Œ∫Œ± œàŒ∑œÜŒøŒΩ)."

### John Gill:
1. "He held the clothes of the witnesses while they stoned him."
2. "He haled men and women out of their houses, and committed them to prison."
3. "He made havoc of the church of Christ, and destroyed the faith, and those that professed it, as much as in him lay."

### John Wesley:
1. "I shut up many of the saints ‚Äî Men not only innocent, but good, just, holy."
2. "I gave my vote against them ‚Äî That is, I joined with those who condemned them."
3. "Perhaps the chief priests did also give him power to vote on these occasions."
