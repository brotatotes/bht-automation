## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "punished them] viz. by scourging; comp. Matt. x. 17." 
2. "I compelled them to blaspheme does not imply that any did blaspheme."
3. "The persecuting the Christians even to foreign cities forms the transition to the narrative following."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not to make them blaspheme or reproach God, but to deny that Jesus was the Messiah, and to reproach him as a deceiver and an impostor."
2. "None but a madman will persecute people on account of their religious opinions; and all persecutions have been conducted like this, with the violence, the fury, and the ungovernable temper of maniacs."
3. "Unto foreign cities; cities out of Judea. The principal instance of this was his going to Damascus; but there is no evidence that he did not intend also to visit other cities out of Judea and bring the Christians there, if he found any, to Jerusalem."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I punished them oft in every synagogue." - Some would try and explain away the sorrowful thoughts suggested by this "memory," by supposing that all Saul did was to try to induce them to deny the faith they once said they loved; but it would be very hazardous to conclude that, among the many of different sexes, of varied ranks and ages, none swerved from their fidelity to Christ.
2. "Being exceedingly mad against them." - No language seems too strong for the brave Christian advocate to use concerning himself and his former conduct towards those men and women, whose brother and fellow-believer he now professed himself to be.
3. "Even unto strange cities." - He had done the Sanhedrim's work well and thoroughly in the 'home' district, and as far even as foreign cities.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Punishing (œÑŒπŒºœâœÅœâŒΩ). Old word œÑŒπŒºœâœÅŒµœâ originally to render help, to succor (œÑŒπŒºœâœÅŒøœÇ, from œÑŒπŒºŒ∑ and ŒøœÖœÅŒøœÇ), then to avenge (for honour)."
2. "I strove to make them blaspheme (Œ∑ŒΩŒ±Œ≥Œ∫Œ±Œ∂ŒøŒΩ Œ≤ŒªŒ±œÉœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµŒπŒΩ). Conative imperfect active of Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥Œ∫Œ±Œ∂œâ, old verb from Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥Œ∫Œ∑ (necessity, compulsion)."
3. "I persecuted (ŒµŒ¥ŒπœâŒ∫ŒøŒΩ). Imperfect active again, repeated attempts. The old verb Œ¥ŒπœâŒ∫œâ was used to run after or chase game and then to chase enemies. The word 'persecute' is the Latin persequor, to follow through or after."

### John Gill:
1. "And I punished them oft in every synagogue.... and compelled them to blaspheme..."
2. "being exceeding mad against them; full of malice, envy, and hatred"
3. "I persecuted them even to strange cities; particularly Damascus..."

### John Wesley:
1. "I compelled them ‚Äî That is, some of them; to blaspheme - This is the most dreadful of all!" 
2. "Repent, ye enemies of the Gospel."
3. "If Spira, who was compelled, suffered so terribly, what will become of those who compel, like Saul, but do not repent like him."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Driven by an intense determination, Saul relentlessly pursued the Christians, even going so far as to persecute them in foreign cities. His zealous actions included punishing them in synagogues, striving to make them blaspheme, and compelling them to deny their faith in Jesus. The depths of Saul's fury and madness were evident in his relentless pursuit of those he considered his enemies. Yet, even in the midst of his vehemence, one cannot help but reflect on the possibility that some may have faltered in their allegiance to Christ under the pressure imposed by Saul. But, as we consider Saul's own conversion and repentance, we are reminded that even the most vehement opposition to the Gospel can be transformed into unwavering devotion. May this serve as a cautionary tale for those who would persecute the followers of Christ, urging them to repent before it is too late.
