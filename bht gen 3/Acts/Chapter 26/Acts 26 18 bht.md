## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The great object of Paul's preaching was to awaken and show the necessity and efficacy of faith that is in Christ."
2. "They had their sense as applied to Jews,â€”who were in spiritual darkness and under Satanâ€™s power, however little they thought it."
3. "The epistles to the Galatians and Romans are two noble monuments of the APOSTLE OF FAITH."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ignorance is represented by the eyes being closed, and the instruction of the gospel by the opening of the eyes." 
2. "From the darkness of paganism and sin to the light and purity of the gospel." 
3. "The pagan world, lying in sin and superstition, is represented as under his control; and this passage teaches, doubtless, that the great mass of the people of this world are the subjects of the kingdom of Satan, and are led captive by him at his will."

### John Calvin:
1. "But this is a common thing, that God doth translate unto his ministers that honor which is due to himself alone, not that he may take any thing from himself, but that he may commend that mighty working of his Spirit which he doth show forth in them."
2. "Therefore, teachers are sent, not to utter their words in vain in the air, or to beat the ears only with a vain sound, but to bring lively light to the blind, to fashion again menâ€™s hearts unto the righteousness of God, and to ratify the grace of salvation which is gotten by the death of Christ."
3. "For it teacheth in other places how little manâ€™s industry can do of itself. For they must plant and water, but it is God alone which giveth the increase."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two great features in Jesus Christâ€™s life and work which shocked His own people and drove them into fierce rebellion, were (1) In His life, He presented, the true image of a suffering Messiah. (2) In His work, begun by Himself and faithfully carried on by His disciples, He showed that the kingdom of the future was not intended to be confined to the old chosen race, nor to the old Holy Land, but that the chosen race of the future was to be made up of all mankind, and the Holy Land of the future was to consist of all the countries of the world."
2. "The purpose and end of Saulâ€™s life-work is here sketched out. The peoples who had hitherto sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, were to be guided into a knowledge of their state, of their slavery to sin, of the impossibility of their being able to help or redeem themselves, of their utter hopelessness as regards the future."
3. "The third step was to show what would be the result of this opening the blind eyes and this seeing their real state, and of their turning to God. Forgiveness of all sin would follow, and they would win a place among the sanctified, a home in one of the many mansions of the redeemed and restored."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "And they are sanctified internally by the Spirit of God, who in regeneration produces principles of grace and holiness in them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Their eyes - Both of the Jews and Gentiles: that they may turn - Through the power of the Almighty, from the spiritual darkness wherein they were involved, to the light of Divine knowledge and holiness." 
2. "That they may receive through faith - (He seems to place the same blessings in a fuller light,) pardon, holiness, and glory."
