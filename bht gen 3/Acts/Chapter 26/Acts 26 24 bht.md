# Acts 26:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Festus, unfamiliar with Paul's character, accused him of madness due to the contrast of their dispositions. Festus believed that Paul's extensive learning had turned him insane. Although Paul's eloquence in Greek and knowledge of sacred writings were unfamiliar to the Romans, it was his deep religious earnestness that provoked this sudden exclamation. Festus failed to recognize that Paul's fervor was not a result of intellectual pursuits, but rather the power of God's truth that animated him in his proclamation of the Gospel.
