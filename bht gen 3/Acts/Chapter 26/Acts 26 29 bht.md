### Henry Alford:

2. "He understands the saying just as Agrippa had uttered it, viz. that he was calculating on making him a Christian, easily, ‚Äòwith little trouble,‚Äô ‚Äòwith slight exertion or persuasion:‚Äô and contrasts with it, with difficulty, ‚Äòwith great trouble,‚Äô ‚Äòwith much labour.‚Äô"
3. "except these bonds. He shews the chain, which being in military custody, he bore on his arm, to connect him with the soldier who had charge of him. This exception may be regarded as a proof of the perfect courtesy of the great Apostle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "except these bonds‚Äîdoubtless holding up his two chained hands . . . which in closing such a noble utterance must have had an electrical effect."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Almost and altogether [ŒµŒΩ ŒøŒªŒπŒ≥œâ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµŒΩ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±Œªœâ] . Lit., in little and in great; i.e., with little or with great pains." 
2. "Were [Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ] . Better, as Rev., might become. Agrippa 's word, 'to become a Christian,' is repeated."
3. "Except these bonds. An exquisite touch of Christian courtesy."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I would to God (ŒµœÖŒæŒ±ŒπŒºŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±ŒΩ œÑœâ Œ∏Œµœâ). Conclusion of fourth-class condition (optative with Œ±ŒΩ), undetermined with less likelihood, the so-called potential optative."
2. "Whether with little or with much (Œ∫Œ± ŒµŒΩ ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœâ Œ∫Œ± ŒµŒΩ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±Œªœâ). Literally, 'both in little and in great,' or 'both with little and with great pains' or 'both in some measure and in great measure.'"
3. "Except these bonds (œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ œÑœâŒΩ Œ¥ŒµœÉŒºœâŒΩ œÑŒøœÖœÑœâŒΩ). Ablative case with œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ (late preposition for the old œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ∫). Paul lifts his right manacled hand with exquisite grace and good feeling."

### John Gill:
1. "His wish was that not only Agrippa, but that all that were present, were not only within a little, or in some low degree, but entirely, in the highest and fullest sense, Christians, as he was."
2. "his sense is, he wished that they were as he, regenerated by the Spirit of God, new creatures in Christ, called by the grace of God with an holy calling, believers in Christ, lovers of him, pardoned by his blood, justified by his righteousness, sanctified by his grace, children of God, and heirs of eternal life"
3. "from the whole of this it appears, that a person may arrive to true satisfaction of his own state; and that it is an evidence of grace, when the heart is drawn out in desires, after the salvation of others; and that altogether Christians are the only desirable ones"
