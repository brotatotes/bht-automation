- Attempt 1 BHT: As the apostle Paul addresses King Agrippa and his audience, he challenges their skepticism towards the resurrection by asking, Why is it judged a thing incredible if God raises the dead? Paul reminds them that their own Scriptures testify to God's power to raise the dead, as demonstrated in the resurrection of Jesus. The fact that God can bring the dead back to life should not be deemed unbelievable or unfaithful, for it is within His capacity.

Thus, Paul urges his listeners to consider God's omnipotence and transcend beyond their limited understanding to embrace the truth of the resurrection.
