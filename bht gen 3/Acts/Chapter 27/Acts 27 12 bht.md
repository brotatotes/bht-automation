# Acts 27:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The harbor of Lutro, also known as Phenix, was not well situated for anchorage and was unfit for wintering due to its vulnerability to the southwest and northwest winds. The majority of the ship's company agreed with the master and owner, and they recommended seeking a more suitable port like Phoenix, which offered shelter from the south and east winds. This harbor was unexpectedly revealed, like a change of scenery, with the town of Loutro appearing within the basin.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Bible verse references a harbor called Lutro, also known as Phenix, that was not well situated for anchorage, especially during winter. It faced the southwest and northwest winds, which meant that it was vulnerable to storms and not a suitable place for the ship to winter. The majority of the ship's company agreed with the master and owner and advised sailing from the harbor in search of a better port. This harbor was, however, unexpectedly revealed like a change of scenery, with the town of Loutro appearing within the basin. The recommendation for another harbor, such as Phoenix, was based on the fact that it offered shelter from the south and east winds, making it a more secure place for the ship to wait out the winter.
