# Acts 27:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With the south wind blowing gently, the crew aboard the ship, confident in their purpose, set sail without a hint of danger. Towing a small boat behind them, they coasted close by Crete, in no fear of being dashed upon the land due to the soft gentle wind. However, little did they know that their expectations would soon be shattered as a sudden change in wind direction brought a violent typhoon upon them, causing chaos and turmoil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The wind blew down (from) Crete, 'down the high lands forming the coast.' It is a common expression in lake and coasting navigation, that 'a gust came down the valleys.' And this would be exactly the direction of the wind in question." 
2. "When they had doubled, or perhaps were now doubling, Cape Matala, the wind suddenly changed, and the typhoon came down upon them from the high lands;‚Äîat first, as long as they were sheltered, only by fits down the gullies, but as soon as they were in the open bay past the cape, with its full violence."
3. "The sudden change from a south wind to a violent northerly wind, is a common occurrence in these seas. The term 'typhonic' indicates that it was accompanied by some of the ph√¶nomena which might be expected in such a case, viz. the agitation and whirling motion of the clouds caused by the meeting of the opposite currents of air when the change took place, and probably also of the sea, raising it in columns of spray."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 13. when the south wind blew softly,
	supposing they had attained their purpose‚ÄîWith such a wind they
	had every prospect of reaching their destination in a few hours.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The wind before had probably been a head-wind, blowing from the west."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Supposing that they had attained their purpose. The phrase expresses the utmost confidence."
2. "A vessel that could sail within seven points of the wind would have no difficulty in rounding Cape Matala."
3. "In this confidence they were coasting 'close by Crete,' and, as we find afterwards (Acts 27:16), with so little fear that the boat was towing behind."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Supposing that they had obtained their purpose... things would succeed according to their wish."
3. "They came near, or they sailed close by Crete... in no danger of being dashed upon it, it being a soft gentle wind."
