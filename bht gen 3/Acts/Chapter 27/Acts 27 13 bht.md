# Acts 27:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a soft south wind began to blow, the crew on the ship saw it as a favorable sign that they had achieved their desired outcome. With confidence in their decision, they sailed close by Crete, coasting along the island without fear of danger. This gentle southerly wind provided a stark contrast to the violent winds they had previously faced, and they continued on their journey with optimism.
