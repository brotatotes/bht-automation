# Acts 27:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A tempestuous wind called Euroclydon, resembling a typhonic wind, arises and causes a whirling of the clouds due to opposing currents of air. This violent and turbulent wind exhibits the characteristics of a hurricane or whirlwind, agitating and exciting the waves. Its direction is a combination of the Greek word for east wind and the Latin word for northeast. As the storm rages for many days, it tosses the ship back and forth, reminding us of the power and unpredictability of nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a tempestuous‚Äî'typhonic' wind‚Äîthat is, like a typhon or tornado, causing a whirling of the clouds, owing to the meeting of opposite currents of air."
2. "called Euroclydon‚ÄîThe true reading appears to be Euro-aquilo, or east-northeast, which answers all the effects here ascribed to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A tempestuous wind - Turbulent - violent - strong."
2. "The most probable supposition is, that it denotes 'a wind not blowing steadily from any quarter, but a hurricane, or wind veering about to different quarters.'"
3. "The name euroclydon is derived probably from two Greek words, ŒµœÖÕÇœÅŒøœÇ euros, 'wind,' and Œ∫ŒªœÖÃÅŒ¥œâŒΩ kludoÃÑn, 'a wave'; so called from its agitating and exciting the waves."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb ballw is also used intransitively in the sense of to fall; thus Homer (" Iliad, "11, 722), of a river falling into the sea." 
2. "A tempestuous wind [Œ±ŒΩŒµŒºŒøœÇ œÑœÖœÜœâŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ] . Lit., a typhonic wind."
3. "The best texts read Eujrakulwn, Euraquilo : i.e., between Eurus, 'the E.S.E. wind,' and Aquilo, 'the north-wind, or, strictly, N. 1/3 E.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "How suddenly violent changes may take place when we least expect them, and when we have thought that already we have ‚Äògained our purpose‚Äô!"
2. "The meaning is that the storm came ‚Äòdown from the island.‚Äô The land here is very high, and the gale suddenly swept down one of the gullies among the mountains, in a south-westerly direction."
3. "Whatever may be our conclusion in this matter, two things are clear, first, either word shows that the gale blew more or less from the east; while, secondly, the fact that it came ‚Äòdown from‚Äô the island, and drove the ship to the southward (see below), shows that it blew more or less from the north."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Litotes again."
2. "The ŒïœÖœÅŒ±Œ∫œÖŒªœâŒΩ has not been found elsewhere. Blass calls it a hybrid word compounded of the Greek ŒµœÖœÅŒøœÇ (east wind) and the Latin Œ±Œ∏œÖŒπŒªŒø (northeast)."
3. "Here the name gives the direction of the wind."

### John Gill:
1. "The wind Typhon never blew in the northern parts." 
2. "This storm of wind was a settled and lasting one, it continued many days." 
3. "This wind may very well be thought to be the same which is called Typhon, and is by writers represented as a very tempestuous one, as a sort of whirlwind or hurricane, a violent storm."

### John Wesley:
1. "There arose against it ‚Äî The south wind; a tempestuous wind, called in those parts Euroclydon."
2. "This was a kind of hurricane, not carrying them any one way, but tossing them backward and forward."
3. "Furious winds are now called levanters, and blow in all directions from the northeast to the southeast."
