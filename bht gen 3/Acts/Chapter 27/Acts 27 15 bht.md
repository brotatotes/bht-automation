# Acts 27:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ship was caught by the wind and could not bear up against it, so they let her drift before the gale. The wind seized the ship and drove it with such violence that it became unmanageable. The sailors did not attempt to control the ship as they were carried along by the wind. It was as if the ship was being seized by a great monster, and they had no choice but to let her be driven.
