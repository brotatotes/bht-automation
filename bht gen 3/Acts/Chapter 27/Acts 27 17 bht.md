## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To frap a ship (ceintrer un vaisseau) is to pass four or five turns of a large cable-laid rope round the hull or frame of a ship, to support her in a great storm, or otherwise, when it is apprehended that she is not strong enough to resist the violent efforts of the sea." 
2. "Fearing a certain danger, they deprived themselves of the only possible means of avoiding it." 
3. "They sent down upon deck the gear connected with the fair-weather sails, such as the topsails."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "undergirding the shipâ€”that is, passing four or five turns of a cable-laid rope round the hull or frame of the ship, to enable her to resist the violence of the seas, an operation rarely resorted to in modern seamanship."
2. "fearing lest they should fall into the quicksandsâ€”'be cast ashore' or 'stranded upon the Syrtis,' the Syrtis Major, a gulf on the African coast, southwest of Crete, the dread of mariners, owing to its dangerous shoals."
3. "sailâ€”This cannot be the meaning, for to strike sail would have driven them directly towards the Syrtis. The meaning must be, 'lowered the gear' (appurtenances of every kind); here, perhaps, referring to the lowering of the heavy mainyard with the sail attached to it [SMITH]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When they had raised up the boat into the ship, so as to secure it."
2. "The ancients were accustomed to pass cables or strong ropes around a vessel to keep the planks from springing or starting by the action of the sea."
3. "The ship was unmanageable, and they suffered it to be driven before the wind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Undergirding: passing cables or chains round the ship's hull in order to support her in a storm." 
2. "The word [Quicksands] is a proper name, and has the article. There were two shoals of this name - the 'Greater Syrtis' (Syrtis Major), and the 'Smaller Syrtis' (Syrtis Minor)."
3. "Lit., as Rev., lowered the gear. It is uncertain what is referred to here. To strike sail, it is urged, would be a sore way of running upon the Syrtis, which they were trying to avoid."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They artificially strengthened the vessel by passing ropes round it over the gunwale and under the keel, and tightening them on deck by levers." 
2. "To avoid [the danger of being driven into the Syrtis], they adopted the plan which is described in the next words."
3. "Here, then, we have the ship under the lee of Clauda made ready as well as possible for the contingencies of the storm, with the boat taken on board, undergirded or frapped, laid to on the starboard tack, and drifting west by north at the rate of a mile and a half an hour."

### John Gill:
1. "they used helps; the mariners made use of other persons, called in the assistance of the soldiers, and passengers, and prisoners; or for the help of the ship, they made use of cords, chains, and such like things"
2. "undergirding the ship: with cords and ropes, which they drew under the keel of the ship, and so bound both sides of the ship, that it might not split and fall to pieces"
3. "and so were driven; about in the sea, wheresoever the winds and waves carried them"
