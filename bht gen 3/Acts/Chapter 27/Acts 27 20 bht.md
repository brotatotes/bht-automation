## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sun and stars were the only guides of the ancients when out of sight of land."
2. "The expression, all hope was taken away, seems... to betoken that a greater evil... was afflicting them, viz. the leaky state of the ship."
3. "The leaky state of the ship... increased upon them, as is shewn by their successive lightenings of her."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This continued thickness of the atmosphere prevented their making the necessary observations of the heavenly bodies by day or by night; so that they could not tell where they were." 
2. "Their exertions to subdue the leak had been unavailing; they could not tell which way to make for the nearest land... Their apprehensions, therefore, were not so much caused by the fury of the tempest, as by the state of the ship."
3. "From the inferiority of ancient to modern naval architecture, leaks were sprung much more easily, and the means of repairing them were fewer than now. Hence the far greater number of shipwrecks from this cause."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As they could see neither sun nor stars, they could make no observations."
2. "They had no compass, they would be totally ignorant of their situation."
3. "They gave up all as lost."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When neither sun nor stars in many days appeared. This was a most serious aggravation of the danger."
2. "All hope was now taken away...we come to the third stage, which is absolute despair."
3. "It was precisely at this time...that St. Paul interposed with Divine encouragement."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For many days...No small tempest." 
2. "All hope that we should be saved was now taken away." 
3. "Despair was beginning to settle like a fog on all their hopes."

### John Gill:
1. "And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared,.... The Syriac version adds, 'nor moon'; which is an usual description of dark, cloudy, and tempestuous seasons..."
2. "...the sun, moon, and stars, are useful to sailors, to steer their course by; especially they were to the ancients, before the invention and use of the loadstone..."
3. "The apostle himself knew indeed, that though the ship would be lost, every man's life would be saved; and yet he could have no hope of this, as to the outward appearance of things, but on account of the revelation which the Lord had made to him, and he believed..."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither sun nor stars appeared for many days â€” Which they could the less spare, before the compass was found out.
