## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That a vessel can anchor by the stern is sufficiently proved (if proof were needed) by the history of some of our own naval engagements."
2. "And when ships are about to attack batteries, it is customary for them to go into action prepared to anchor in this way."
3. "Uncertain, whether their ship might not go down at her anchors: and, even supposing her to ride out the night safely, uncertain whether the coast to leeward might not be iron-bound, affording no beach where they might land in safety."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The very best thing they could do was to anchor by the stern." 
2. "Wishedâ€”'anxiously' or 'devoutly wished.'" 
3. "Hence their anxious longing for day, and the ungenerous but natural attempt, not peculiar to ancient times, of the seamen to save their own lives by taking to the boat."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They cast four anchors - On account of the violence of the storm and waves, to make, if possible, the ship secure."
2. "And wished for the day - To discern more accurately their situation and danger."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks. It might seem now that they not only heard breakers at a distance, but now heard them directly ahead. Such is Mr. Smithâ€™s view. This is not, however, necessarily the meaning of the words, which may express only a general tear."
2. "They cast four anchors out of the stern. It is customary, for very good reasons, to anchor from the bow:â€™ Anchora de prorÃ¢ jacitur.â€™ But it is quite possible to anchor from the stern; and on emergency this has often been done."
3. "Wished for the day. Literally, â€˜prayed that the day might come on;â€™ and some commentators have supposed that actual prayers to this effect were offered up whether by Christians or by Heathens on board. This supposition is hardly natural."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lest somewhere we should fall out down against rocky places."
2. "With a view to running the ship ashore anchoring from the stern would, it is said, be best."
3. "Imperfect middle, kept on praying for 'day to come' before the anchors broke under the strain of the storm or began to drag."

### John Gill:
1. "According to Pliny, the Tyrrhenians first invented the anchor; though Pausanias ascribes the invention of it to Midas, the son of Gordius."
2. "The most ancient ones were made of stone, as was the anchor of the Argonautes; afterwards they were made of wood."
3. "The modern anchor is a large strong piece of iron, crooked at one end, and formed into two barbs, resembling a hook, fastened at the other end by a cable."
