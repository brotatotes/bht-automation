## BHT:
The officers of the ship, detected by St. Luke's nautical skill, attempted to escape under a pretense of carrying anchors ahead of the ship. However, St. Paul, with great presence of mind, thwarted their plan by realizing that they needed the boat to stretch out the anchors in front. The sailors' attempt to flee was due to their belief in the ship's imminent danger, despite the anchors already cast out. St. Paul's wise admonishment prevented them from casting themselves away in an uncertain escape.
