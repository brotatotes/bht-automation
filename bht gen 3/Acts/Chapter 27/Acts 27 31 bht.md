## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I answer, that Paul is not here treating accurately of Godâ€™s power, distinct from human will and means."
2. "God does not offer His help to the faithful that they may despise means of safety, and indulge torpor and sloth, where there is a plain way of caution."
3. "But it does not therefore follow, that the hand of God is tied to means or assistances; but when God ordains this or that way of acting, He curbs the inclinations of men that they transgress not His appointed bounds."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The flight of the crew, therefore, might well be regarded as certain destruction to all who remained."
2. "In full assurance of ultimate safety, in virtue of a DIVINE pledge, to all in the ship, Paul speaks and acts throughout this whole scene in the exercise of a sound judgment as to the indispensable HUMAN conditions of safety."
3. "Divine agency and human instrumentality are in all the events of life quite as much as here. The only difference is that the one is for the most part shrouded from view, while the other is ever naked and open to the senses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The certainty of an event does not render it improper to use means to obtain it."
2. "The doctrine of the divine purposes or decrees, making certain future events, does not make the use of man's agency unnecessary or improper."
3. "A belief that God has purposes of mercy; that he designs, and has always designed, to save some, will prompt to the use of all proper means to secure it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Paul said nothing to the sailors, but spoke at once to his friend the centurion; and he used with him and the soldiers the argument which is of greatest weight in such a case, the appeal to self-preservation."
2. "Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved."
3. "Much has been written on this in connection with the assurance previously given that they should all certainly be saved. It is quite useless to write any more on the subject. The same difficulty meets us everywhere."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Except these abide in the ship. Paul has no hesitancy in saying this in spite of his strong language in verse Acts 27:24 about God's promise."
2. "He has no notion of lying supinely down and leaving God to do it all."
3. "Without the sailors the ship could not be properly beached."

### John Gill:
1. "The end and means, in the decrees of God, are not to be separated; nor is any end to be expected without the use of means; and means are as peremptorily fixed, and are as absolutely necessary, and must as certainly be accomplished, as the end."
2. "Thus spiritual and eternal salvation is a certain thing; it is the appointment of God, which is absolute and unconditional, immutable and unfrustrable."
3. "Without perseverance in faith and holiness, there is no salvation; wherefore the Lord puts his grace into the hearts of his people to cause them to persevere."

### John Wesley:
1. "Unless these mariners abide in the ship â€” Without them ye know not how to manage her, ye cannot be saved." 
2. "We may learn hence, to use the most proper means for security and success, even while we depend on Divine Providence, and wait for the accomplishment of God's own promise."
3. "To expect the accomplishment of any promise, without exerting these, is at best vain and dangerous presumption, if all pretence of relying upon it be not profane hypocrisy."
