## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "St. Paul‚Äôs Bay is remote from the great harbour, and possesses no marked features by which it might be recognized."
2. "What is meant is a creek with a smooth, sandy beach, as distinguished from a rocky inlet."
3. "They were minded, not ‚Äòto thrust in, as A.V., but to strand, to run aground, their ship."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Immediately on landing they knew where they were."
2. "But the meaning is, a practicable shore, in a nautical sense, that is, one with a smooth beach."
3. "This was their one chance of safety."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They knew not the land - They had been driven with a tempest, without being able to make any observation, and it is probable that they were entire strangers to the coast and to the whole island."
2. "A certain creek with a shore - Greek: a certain bosom Œ∫ŒøÃÅŒªœÄŒøœÇ kolpos or bay. By its having a shore is probably meant that it had a level shore, or one that was convenient for landing. It was not a high bluff of rocks, but was accessible."
3. "Were minded - Were resolved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Bay [Œ∫ŒøŒªœÄŒøŒΩ] . See on bosom, Luke 6:38. 
Shore [Œ±ŒπŒ≥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩ] . See on Matthew 13:2. Better, as Rev., beach. 
They were minded [ŒµŒ≤ŒøœÖŒªŒµœÖœÉŒ±ŒΩœÑŒø] . Better, as Rev., took counsel. See on Matthew 1:19.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "At first sight this may cause surprise; for Melita was a well-known island, a distinct part of a Roman province, having an admirable harbour, familiar to Alexandrian sailors." 
2. "An English seaman might have made many voyages between New York and Liverpool, and yet might be puzzled (even with the help of such charts as the old Greek sailors did not possess) if he found himself, in foggy weather, off a part of the coast of North Wales which he had never seen before."
3. "They were not quite sure that they would be able to accomplish their purpose. How the matter was managed is described in the following verses."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They knew not. Probably conative, tried to recognize and could not."
2. "They perceived. This beach seemed their only hope."
3. "Whether they could drive. This use of the optative with Œµ in questions of this sort is a neat Greek idiom."

### John Gill:
1. "And when it was day they knew not the land..."
2. "...they discovered a certain creek with a shore..."
3. "...they had a mind, and consulted to run the ship..."

### John Wesley:
