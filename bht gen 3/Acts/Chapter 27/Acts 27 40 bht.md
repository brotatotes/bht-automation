# Acts 27:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a display of quick thinking and foresight, the crew of the ship swiftly cut away the four anchors, released the ropes that held the rudders, and raised their 'artƒïmon' sail to the wind. The crew's coordinated actions were vital for the safety of all on board, ensuring they were unencumbered and able to navigate efficiently. By removing the anchors, loosing the rudder bands, and hoisting up the sail, they made the necessary adjustments to steer the ship towards a safer course.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "They let loose the ropes which tied up the rudders."
3. "They raised their 'artƒïmon' to the wind."

3. "How necessary must the crew have been to execute all these movements, and how obvious the foresight which made their stay indispensable to the safety of all on board."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Had taken up the anchors - The four anchors with which they had moored the ship... This is the most probable interpretation." (Acts 27:40)
2. "And loosed the rudder bands... they had in this ship more than one rudder." (Acts 27:40)
3. "The mainsail... The Syriac and Arabic understand it of a 'small sail,' that was hoisted for a temporary purpose." (Acts 27:40)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Taken up [œÄŒµœÅŒπŒµŒªŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ]. Wrong. The word means to remove..."
2. "Committed themselves [ŒµŒπœâŒΩ]. Wrong. The reference is to the anchors."
3. "The bands were now loosened, in order that the ship might be driven forward."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They committed them (i.e. the anchors) to the sea...these anchors were of no further use, for it was known that the ship would be destroyed."
2. "The rudders were now absolutely necessary in order to steer the ship precisely...the anchors themselves could now be of no further use, the destruction of the ship being inevitable."
3. "The sail which would have been the most useful for the purpose in hand would have been the foresail; and it is probable that this sail is meant...toward that particular beach (œÑŒø ÃÄ ŒΩ Œ±Œπ Ãì Œ≥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒø ÃÅ ŒΩ) which had been observed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having taken away from around, that is all four anchors from around the stern."
2. "They let the anchors go and the ropes fell down into the sea."
3. "Hoisting up the foresail to the wind. It is not clear what 'sail' is meant by 'Œ±œÅœÑŒµŒºœâŒΩŒ±.' No other example in Greek is known, though the scholiast to Juvenal XII. 68 explains œÇŒµŒªŒø œÄœÅŒøœÅŒ± œÉœÖŒø by artemone solo. Hence 'foresail' is probably correct."

### John Gill:
1. "And when they had taken up the anchors,.... The four anchors they cast out of the stern... they committed themselves unto the sea... and loosed the rudder bands..." 
2. "The rudder, in navigation, is a piece of timber turning on hinges in the stern of a ship... turns or directs the vessel this way or that... The aftmost part of the rudder is called the 'rake' of the rudder."
3. "And hoised up the main sail to the wind... The main sail is that which is upon the main mast... And made toward the shore."

### John Wesley:
1. "Loosing the rudder bands... were now loosened, when they had need of them to steer her into the creek."
2. "Their ships had frequently two rudders, one on each side."
3. "They let the ship drive... when they had need of them to steer her into the creek."
