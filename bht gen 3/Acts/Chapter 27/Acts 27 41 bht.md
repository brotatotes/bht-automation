As the ship neared the island, it encountered a place where two seas met, causing it to run aground. The fore part of the ship became immovable in the tenacious clay, while the hinder part began to break up. This meeting of two seas refers to a narrow channel separating the island of Salmone from Malta. The shipwreck occurred in a spot with a sandy shelf, leaving behind broken pieces and planks. Despite the challenging circumstances, God's miraculous deliverance unfolded in the midst of despair.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Just within this island, in all probability, was the place where the ship struck, in a place where two seas met."
2. "A ship therefore, impelled by the force of the gale into a creek with a bottom such as that laid down in the chart, would strike a bottom of mud, graduating into tenacious clay, into which the fore part would fix itself and be held fast, while the stern was exposed to the force of the waves."
3. "Some of the things from the ship:‚Äîprobably, as A.V., broken pieces of the ship:‚Äîsome of the parts of the ship: the others mentioned being whole planks, perhaps of the decks."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "falling into a place where two seas met‚ÄîSMITH thinks this refers to the channel, not more than one hundred yards broad, which separates the small island of Salmone from Malta, forming a communication between the sea inside the bay and that outside."
2. "the fore part stuck fast, and remained immovable‚Äî"The rocks of Malta disintegrate into extremely minute particles of sand and clay, which, when acted upon by the currents or surface agitation, form a deposit of tenacious clay; but... in creeks, where there are no currents, and at such a depth as to be undisturbed by the waves, that the mud occurs. A ship, therefore, impelled by the force of a gale, into a creek, with such a bottom, would strike a bottom of mud, graduating into tenacious clay, into which the fore part would fix itself, and be held fast while the stern was exposed to the force of the waves" [SMITH].
3. "hinder part was broken‚ÄîThe continued action denoted by the tense here is to be noted‚Äî"was fast breaking," going to pieces."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Falling - Being carried by the wind and waves."
2. "Into a place where two seas met - Greek: into a place of a double sea."
3. "The hinder part was broken - The stern was broken or staved in."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was meet that when the ship was broken, they should be so discouraged, and that their souls should so melt, that despair might increase the glory of the miracle."
2. "For God useth to moderate and govern his works so, that he maketh some show of difficulty by reason of many lets [hindrances] which fall out."
3. "This is the reason why he had lieffer [rather] draw Paul and his companions to the shore after that the ship was lost, than bring the ship whole to land."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word Œ¥ŒπŒ∏Œ± ÃÅ ŒªŒ±œÉœÉŒøœÇ denotes that which is intermediate between two broad surfaces of sea."
2. "This connecting link may be either land or water."
3. "The Greek word here is one of those many technical naval terms which are used in this narrative with strict accuracy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
"Where two seas met... They ran the vessel aground... Struck... Unmoveable... Began to break up."

### John Gill:
1. "The meeting of these two seas might occasion a great rippling in the sea like to a large eddy, or counter tide..." (26 words)
2. "But must rather mean a shelf of sand, opposite, or near the entrance into the bay, and where the shipwreck was." (27 words)
3. "By which means there were boards and broken pieces for the company to get ashore upon." (17 words)

### John Wesley:
