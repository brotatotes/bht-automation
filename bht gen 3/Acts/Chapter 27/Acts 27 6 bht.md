## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ships, particularly those of the ancients, unprovided with a compass, and ill calculated to work to windward, would naturally stand to the N. till they made the land of Asia Minor, which is peculiarly favourable for such a mode of navigation" (Mr. Smith, p. 32).
2. "the coast is bold and safe, and the elevation of the mountains makes it visible at a great distance; it abounds in harbours, while the sinuosities of its shores and the westerly current would enable them, if the wind was at all off the land, to work to windward" (Mr. Smith, p. 32).
3. "Myra lies due N. from Alexandria, and its bay is well calculated to shelter a wind-bound ship" (Mr. Smith, p. 32).

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As Egypt was the granary of Italy, and this vessel was laden with wheat, we need not wonder it was large enough to carry two hundred seventy-six souls, passengers and crew together."
2. "Besides, the Egyptian merchantmen, among the largest in the Mediterranean, were equal to the largest merchantmen in our day."
3. "It may seem strange that on their passage from Alexandria to Italy they should be found at a Lycian port. But even still it is not unusual to stand to the north towards Asia Minor, for the sake of the current."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Alexandria was in Egypt, and was founded by Alexander the Great."
2. "It is well known that great quantities of wheat were imported from Egypt to Rome."
3. "Why the ship was on the coast of Asia Minor is not known. But it is probable that it had been driven out of its way by adverse winds or tempests."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. A ship of Alexandria. Employed in the immense corn trade between Italy and Egypt. See verse 38. The size of the vessel may be inferred from verse 37.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is a popular fallacy to suppose that the trading ships of the Mediterranean, under the Roman Empire, were necessarily small craft."
2. "This would especially be the case with the great corn ships of Alexandria, which took grain from Egypt to Rome and the other large towns of Italy."
3. "A vessel bound from Egypt to Italy should stand to the north, where the Asiatic coast is high and easily seen, where good harbours are abundant, and where the above described advantages as to wind and water would be found."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This was the opportunity for which Lysias had been looking." 
2. "So he put prisoners and soldiers on board." 
3. "Such grain ships usually carried passengers."

### John Gill:
1. "The top sail was a distinguishing sign of a ship of Alexandria, for none might spread their top sails but ships of Alexandria."
2. "A ship of Alexandria with them was a ship that went from the land of Israel to Alexandria; whereas here it seems to design one that belonged to Alexandria, and went from thence to other parts."
3. "The centurion removed Paul and his companions, and the rest of the prisoners, with whatsoever soldiers were under his care, out of the ship of Adramyttium, into the ship of Alexandria."
