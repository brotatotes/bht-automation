# Acts 27:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ship in question encountered numerous difficulties while sailing from Myra to Cnidus due to contrary winds. These opposing winds, specifically the prevailing northwesterly winds during the summer months, hindered their progress, forcing them to sail slowly and with great effort for multiple days. To find some respite from the wind, they opted to sail under the lee of Crete, benefiting from the relative shelter and favorable current. Nonetheless, despite the challenging conditions, the crew did not abandon their determination to continue the voyage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We learn from the sailing directions for the Mediterranean, that, throughout the whole of that sea, but mostly in the eastern half, including the Adriatic and Archipelago, N.W. winds prevail in the summer months..."
2. "With N.W. winds the ship could work up from Myra to Cnidus; because, until she reached that point, she had the advantage of a weather shore, under the lee of which she would have smooth water, and as formerly mentioned, a westerly current; but it would be slowly and with difficulty."
3. "At Cnidus that advantage ceased."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "sailed slowly many days‚Äîowing to contrary winds." 
2. "scarce‚Äîwith difficulty." 
3. "But for the contrary wind they might have made the distance from Myra (one hundred thirty miles) in one day."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Had sailed slowly - By reason of the prevalence of the western winds."
2. "The wind not suffering us - The wind repelling us in that direction; not permitting us to hold on a direct course, we were driven off near to Crete."
3. "We sailed under Crete - See Acts 27:4. We lay along near to Crete, so as to break the violence of the wind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is not that they had scarcely reached Cnidus when the wind became contrary, nor that they had come only as far as Cnidus in many days; but that they were retarded by contrary winds between Myra and Cnidus." 
2. "Such a contrary wind would have been the northwesterly, which prevails during the summer months in that part of the Archipelago."
3. "They were retarded by contrary winds between Myra and Cnidus, a distance of about one hundred and thirty miles, which, with a favorable wind, they might have accomplished in a day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question arises as to the cause of this slow sailing. It must have been either from lack of wind, or because the wind was contrary."
2. "The wind not suffering us ... does not appear that at this time they had relinquished their intention of prosecuting their voyage."
3. "Sailed under Crete, i.e. under its lee. Here they would obtain the same advantages as before, under the shore of Asia Minor, as to comparative shelter and a favourable current."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When we had sailed slowly (Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ¥œÖœÄŒªŒøŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒµœÇ). Literally, 'sailing slowly,' not 'having or had sailed slowly.'"
2. "With difficulty (ŒºŒøŒªŒπœÇ). Used in old Greek, like ŒºŒøŒ≥ŒπœÇ (Luke 9:39) from ŒºŒøŒªŒøœÇ, toil."
3. "We sailed under the lee of Crete (œÖœÄŒµœÄŒªŒµœÖœÉŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒöœÅŒ∑œÑŒ∑ŒΩ). Instead of going to the right of Crete as the straight course would have been they sailed southwest with Crete to their right and got some protection against the wind there."

### John Gill:
1. "And when we had sailed slowly many days...the ship being laden with goods." 
2. "Cnidus...was the birthplace of Eudoxus, a famous philosopher, astrologer, geometrician, physician and lawgiver." 
3. "We sailed under Crete...over against Salmone; now called Capo Salamone: this...island of Crete."

### John Wesley:
1. Cnidus ‚Äî was a cape and city of Caria.
