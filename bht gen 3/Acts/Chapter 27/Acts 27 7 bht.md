# Acts 27:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ship's journey from Myra to Cnidus was impeded by contrary winds, causing them to sail slowly for many days. Seeking shelter, they sailed under the protection of Crete to ease the impact of the wind. The prevailing N.W. winds in the Mediterranean during that season created challenges for their progress. Had it not been for the opposing wind, they could have completed the distance in a single day. Understanding these geographical and meteorological obstacles enhances our comprehension of their arduous voyage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We learn from the sailing directions for the Mediterranean, that, throughout the whole of that sea, but mostly in the eastern half, including the Adriatic and Archipelago, N.W. winds prevail in the summer months..." (commentary)
2. "With N.W. winds the ship could work up from Myra to Cnidus; because, until she reached that point, she had the advantage of a weather shore, under the lee of which she would have smooth water." (commentary)
3. "At Cnidus that advantage ceased." (commentary)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "sailed slowly many days‚Äîowing to contrary winds." 
2. "and scarce-"with difficulty." 
3. "But for the contrary wind they might have made the distance from Myra (one hundred thirty miles) in one day."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Had sailed slowly - By reason of the prevalence of the western winds."
2. "The wind not suffering us - The wind repelling us in that direction; not permitting us to hold on a direct course, we were driven off near to Crete."
3. "We sailed under Crete - See Acts 27:4. We lay along near to Crete, so as to break the violence of the wind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is not that they had scarcely reached Cnidus when the wind became contrary, nor that they had come only as far as Cnidus in many days; but that they were retarded by contrary winds between Myra and Cnidus, a distance of about one hundred and thirty miles, which, with a favorable wind, they might have accomplished in a day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Greek word ŒºœåŒªŒπœÇ, translated 'scarce,' really expresses difficulty and struggle."
2. "The wind not suffering us."
3. "Here they would obtain the same advantages as before, under the shore of Asia Minor, as to comparative shelter and a favourable current."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Many days (ŒµŒΩ ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ±ŒπœÇ Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±ŒπœÇ). Literally, 'in considerable days.'" 
2. "With difficulty (ŒºŒøŒªŒπœÇ). Used in old Greek, like ŒºŒøŒ≥ŒπœÇ (Luke 9:39) from ŒºŒøŒªŒøœÇ, toil (see Acts 14:18)."
3. "We sailed under the lee of Crete (œÖœÄŒµœÄŒªŒµœÖœÉŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒöœÅŒ∑œÑŒ∑ŒΩ). See under verse Acts 27:4. Instead of going to the right of Crete as the straight course would have been they sailed southwest with Crete to their right and got some protection against the wind there."

### John Gill:
1. "It was a city and promontory in Doris, in the Chersonese or peninsula of Caria, famous for the marble statue of Venus made by Praxiteles"
