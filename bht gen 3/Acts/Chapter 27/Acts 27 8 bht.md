# Acts 27:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ship struggled to pass by the Fair Havens due to the westerly current and head winds, and they had to coast along it with great difficulty. Fair Havens, a small bay near Cape Matala, was the suitable anchorage for the ship. Although the city of Lasea near Fair Havens is lost, it was once well-known and mentioned by ancient writers. This incident supports the Bible's geographical accuracy, as confirmed by the discovery of a Scottish yachting party.
