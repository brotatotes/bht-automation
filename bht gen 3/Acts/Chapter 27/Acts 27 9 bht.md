### Logs

Paul, who had experience in navigating those waters, strongly urged them to winter where they were, but they disregarded his advice. Unfortunately, the further they progressed in their dangerous voyage, the more apparent it became that they were risking their lives. Thankfully, they did not lose any lives, although they lost everything else.
