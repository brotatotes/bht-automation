# Acts 28:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During their stay, the people of Malta honored the Apostle Paul and his companions with many distinctions and attentions. They provided what was necessary and loaded them with honors upon their departure. This was not taking hire for miracles, but rather grateful expressions of feeling that showed the value they placed on Paul's presence and labors. While it is uncertain if any lasting effects remained in Malta, the beginnings of the Christian Church there likely emerged from this memorable visit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The other meaning, that these were really honours, is rendered probable by the form of the sentence, which opposes to these 'honours,' bestowed on them during their whole stay, such things as were necessary, with which they were loaded at their departure."
2. "Render it therefore honored us with many honours (or 'distinctions,' or 'attentions')."
3. "The ordinary interpretation of this as rewards, gifts, may be right, but is not necessary."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But though little dependence is to be placed upon the tradition that Publius became bishop of Malta and afterwards of Athens, we may well believe the accredited tradition that the beginnings of the Christian Church at Malta sprang out of this memorable visit."
2. "This was not taking hire for the miracles wrought among them, but such grateful expressions of feeling, particularly in providing what would minister to their comfort during the voyage, as showed the value they set upon the presence and labors of the apostle among them."
3. "Whether any permanent effects of this three months' stay of the greatest of the apostles were left at Malta, we cannot certainly say."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who also honoured us - As people who were favored by heaven, and who had been the means of conferring important benefits on them in healing the sick, etc."
2. "Probably the word 'honors' here means 'gifts, or marks of favor.'"
3. "They laded us - They gave us, or conferred on us. They furnished us with such things as were necessary for us on our journey."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word was applied to payments for professional services."
2. "It is evidently not used in that sense here."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In 1 Timothy 5:3; 1 Timothy 5:17, the word (Ï„Î¹Î¼Î®) used here is employed to denote the material support of religious ministers."
2. "St. Paul did not refuse elsewhere to accept the gifts which were freely offered to him."
3. "When they were preparing to set sail, gifts for the wants of the voyage were lavishly pressed upon them."

### John Gill:
1. "Not with divine honours, with religious adorations, as if they had been so many deities; but civil honours, expressions of respect and gratitude."
2. "They provided a proper supply of food for them, which they put into the strip, for their use in their voyage; by which they expressed their gratitude for the favours they received from Paul."
3. "For whose sake not only his company, but the whole ship's company fared the better: and very likely many of them were converted under the apostle's ministry."
