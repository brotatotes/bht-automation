# Acts 28:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The officials who had examined me, such as Felix and Festus, had wished to let me go, for they found no reason to charge me with a crime worthy of death. They had acquitted me of sedition and wrong-doing, just as other great Roman officials like Sergius Paulus, Gallio, Claudius Lysias, and Agrippa had done. Their acquittals demonstrated that there was no cause of death in my case, as the various examinations revealed no evidence of any crime that would warrant such a punishment.
