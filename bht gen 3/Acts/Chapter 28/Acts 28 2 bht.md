# Acts 28:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul and the others were shipwrecked on Malta, they were graciously received by the barbarous people, who demonstrated no common kindness. These Phoenician colonists, though considered foreign and unintelligible by the Greeks and Romans, exhibited extraordinary compassion by welcoming the shipwrecked group and providing them with much-needed hospitality and the warmth of a large fire. The generosity shown by these uncultivated inhabitants of Malta was indeed more valuable than any polished education could offer.
