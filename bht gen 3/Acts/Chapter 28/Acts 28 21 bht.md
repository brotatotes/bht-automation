# Acts 28:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before his appeal, the Jews in Jud√¶a had no reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome about Paul. Since his appeal, it would have been difficult for them to send messengers before him. However, there was no dishonest concealment. The distinction made between Paul, against whom they heard nothing, and his sect, which was spoken against everywhere, suggests their sincerity. It seems that no information about the case traveled from Jerusalem to Rome before Paul himself. The Roman Jews' denial of any knowledge of Paul's reputation is disingenuous.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Before his appeal, the Jews in Jud√¶a had no definite reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome respecting him, having no expectation that Paul...would ever go to Rome." 
2. "Since his appeal, it would have been hardly possible for them to have sent messengers who should have arrived before him." 
3. "Still, as casual, non-official tidings might have reached them, Paul shewed this anxiety. It appears, however, that none had come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We need not suppose (with THOLUCK and others) that there was any dishonest concealment here."
2. "The distinction made between himself, against whom they heard nothing, and his 'sect,' as 'everywhere spoken against,' is a presumption in favor of their sincerity."
3. "There is ground to think that as the case took an unexpected turn by Paul's appealing to C√¶sar, so no information on the subject would travel from Jerusalem to Rome in advance of the apostle himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why the Jews in Judea had not forwarded the accusation against Paul to their brethren at Rome, that they might continue the prosecution before the emperor, is not known."
2. "Paul had been acquitted successively by Lysias, Felix, Festus, and Agrippa; and as they had not succeeded in procuring his condemnation before them, they saw no prospect of doing it at Rome, and resolved, therefore, not to press the prosecution any further."
3. "There was a very constant contact between Judea and Rome, but it seems that the Jews who had come before Paul had arrived had not mentioned his case, so as to prejudice them against him."

### John Calvin:
1. "For they did lord it no less carelessly than proudly, so that nobody did trouble them at home."
2. "Furthermore, though the Jews come not altogether rightly prepared to hear, yet they show some desire to learn, when as they do not refuse to hear the defense of his doctrine, which is spoken against everywhere."
3. "But we must note the state of the disputation, which Luke saith is double. For Paul taught first, after what sort the kingdom of God was amongst them, and principally what manner [of] chief felicity and glory that was which was promised to them, which the prophets do so highly extol."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This reply of the Roman Jews was more courteous than honest."
2. "It was clearly disingenuous for them on their part to deny any knowledge of his evil fame among the rulers of the people."
3. "The result of the earnest and impassioned pleading of the Christian apostle...points to the conclusion we have arrived at, that the courteous reply of the Roman Jews to Paul (Acts 28:21) was hollow and false."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Letters (Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒ±). Official documents from the Sanhedrin about the charges against Paul."
2. "Any harm of thee (œÑ œÄŒµœÅ œÉŒøœÖ œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅŒøŒΩ)."
3. "Evil (œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅŒøŒΩ). The three aorists (ŒµŒ¥ŒµŒæŒ±ŒºŒµŒ∏Œ±, Œ±œÄŒ∑Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒπŒªŒµŒΩ, ŒµŒªŒ±ŒªŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ) cover the past."

### John Gill:
1. "Which was very much, that the high priest and sanhedrim had not wrote to the principal men of their religion at Rome; giving an account of the apostle, and his case unto them, in order to prejudice them against him."
2. "So that it looks as if they did make mention of him, but did not charge him with anything that was wicked and criminal."
3. "This they said, to show that they were not prejudiced against him by any person or means; and which carried in it a very considerable testimony of the apostle's innocence."

### John Wesley:
1. "There must have been a peculiar providence in this."
2. "How must the bridle then have been in their mouth!"
