# Acts 28:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many have questioned the credibility of the Acts due to the absence of any mention of Paul's work among the Christian church in Rome. However, the Acts primarily focuses on Paul's mission to preach the Gospel to the Jews and Gentiles. It is natural that upon arriving in Rome, Paul would gather and speak to the Jews. The Jews expressed an unbiased desire to hear Paul's thoughts, likely to prevent further conflicts. The opposition faced by Christianity does not diminish its divine nature; rather, it upholds the fundamental articles of true religion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Many Commentators have noticed the omission of all mention of the Christian church at Rome, and of Paulâ€™s connexion with or work among them. And some recently in Germany have called in question the credibility of the Acts on this account."
2. "But without any reason: for the work of the Apostle among churches already founded is not the subject of our history, and is seldom related by Luke, without a special reason."
3. "Besides, one great object of this history is to shew forth Paul as working out the Lordâ€™s implied command to preach the Gospel â€˜to the Jew first, and also to the Gentileâ€™ (ch. i. 8), and, having every where done this, it is but natural that he should open his commission in Rome by assembling and speaking to the Jews."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest." 
2. "The apparent freedom from prejudice here expressed may have arisen from a prudent desire to avoid endangering a repetition of those dissensions about Christianity."
3. "Which had led to the expulsion of the Jews under Claudius."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What thou thinkest - What your belief is; or what are the doctrines of Christians respecting the Messiah."
2. "This sect - The sect of Christians."
3. "Spoken against - Particularly by Jews. This was the case then, and, to a great extent, is the case still. It has been the common lot of the followers of Christ to be spoken 'against.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. We desire [Î±Î¾Î¹Î¿Ï…Î¼ÎµÎ½] . Rather, we think it fitting. Compare ch. 14 38. Sect. See on heresies, 2 Peter 2:1.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "For instance, the Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote in the days of the Emperor Nero, speaks of the Christian religion as â€˜a detestable superstitionâ€™ ( exitiabilis superstitio), and calls attention to â€˜the atrocious and shameful crimes condemned by the hatred of mankind.â€™"
2. "The jealous and angry Jew joined hands here with the Pagan in fostering untrue and utterly baseless rumours respecting the worship and practice of men whose doctrines were gradually penetrating into all classes and orders of the Empire."
3. "Already men had begun to whisper abroad the dark calumnies which we know were universally circulated through the Roman world concerning the innocent Christians."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They think it only fair to hear Paul's side of his case."
2. "Paul had identified Christianity with Judaism in its Messianic hope."
3. "The line of cleavage between Jew and Christian was now sharply drawn everywhere."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel, or Christian religion, is not an human device, the choice and option of man's free will, and what he pleases himself with, as an opinion and invention of his own, or of other men, as 'heresy' signifies; but it is of God, and by revelation of Jesus Christ, and is a doctrine of the highest wisdom."
2. "Nor does it deny or take away any fundamental article of true religion; either natural, as known by the Gentiles, or as revealed, with which the Jews were made acquainted, under the former dispensation; but establishes every such article."
3. "The Christian religion, and the doctrines of it, are not of men, are contrary to the lusts of men, and particularly to the pride of men; they subject them to reproach and persecution, and gather men out from among them."

### John Wesley:
1. This sect we know is every where spoken against â€” This is no proof at all of a bad cause, but a very probable mark of a good one.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Many commentators have brought up the absence of any mention of the Christian church in Rome or of Paul's connection with them, but there is no reason to doubt the credibility of the Acts on this basis. The purpose of the Acts is not to chronicle Paul's work among established churches, but to emphasize his fulfillment of the command to preach the Gospel first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles. Therefore, it is only natural for him to assemble and speak to the Jews upon his arrival in Rome. The Jews in Rome express a seemingly unbiased desire to hear Paul's thoughts, perhaps out of a prudent wish to prevent the conflicts that led to the expulsion of Jews under Claudius. This demonstrates that the line between Jew and Christian was now clearly drawn everywhere, but the Jews still considered it fair to hear Paul's side of the story. The Christian religion has faced opposition from both Jews and Gentiles, with rumors and false accusations spread against its followers throughout the Roman Empire. Despite such opposition, the Gospel is not a human invention or heresy, but a divine revelation that establishes and upholds the fundamental articles of true religion. The fact that Christianity is widely spoken against is not evidence of a bad cause, but rather a likely indication of a good one.
