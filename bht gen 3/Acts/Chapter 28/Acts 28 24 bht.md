# Acts 28:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The diverse responses to the Gospel have been repeated throughout history, where earnest seekers, frivolous worldlings, and prejudiced bigots all gather. Witnessing this, we see how some hearts are persuaded while others remain in disbelief. The Apostle Paul, endowed with great spiritual grace, exhausted his patience pleading and testifying. Despite his efforts, some hearts were blinded and hardened, while others truly believed in Christ with all their being. This difference in response is not due to the power or free will of man, but to the distinguishing grace of God.

2. "these were not of Christ's sheep, their eyes were blinded, and their hearts were hardened, as was prophesied of them"
3. "this difference among them, some believing and some not believing, was not owing to the power and free will of man, as if some of themselves would, and did believe, and others would not, but to the distinguishing grace of God"

### John Wesley:
1. And some believed the things that were spoken â€” With the heart, as well as understanding.
