## BHT:
Amidst a divided discussion, the apostle offers a final testimony from the Scriptures, acknowledged by both sides as the Holy Ghost speaking to Israel. However, the hearts of the people have become fat and stupefied, absorbed in earthly matters, and hardened against spiritual truths. Their ears are heavy, hearing with difficulty, and they willingly close their eyes to the evidence presented. The understanding of spiritual things is often gained through hearing the preached Gospel, as the Holy Spirit enlightens sinners and reveals their lost state, impurity, and imminent danger.
