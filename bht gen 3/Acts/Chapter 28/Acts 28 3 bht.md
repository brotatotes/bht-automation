## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We find the Apostle doing the office of a prisoner, serving the wants of others."
2. "Perhaps there is nowhere a surface of equal extent in so artificial a state as that of Malta at the present day,‚Äîand nowhere has the aboriginal forest been more completely cleared. We need not therefore be surprised that, with the disappearance of the woods, the noxious reptiles which infested them should also have disappeared."
3. "The narrative leaves no doubt that the bite did veritably take place."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The vigorous activity of Paul's character is observable in this comparatively trifling action."
2. "Having laid itself up among the sticks on the approach of the cold winter season, it had suddenly recovered from its torpor by the heat."
3. "Vipers dart at their enemies sometimes several feet at a bound."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The viper was doubtless in the bundle of sticks or limbs of trees which Paul had gathered, but was concealed, and was torpid."
2. "But when the bundle was laid on the fire, the viper became warmed by the heat, and came out and fastened on the hand of Paul."
3. "It is not expressly affirmed that Paul was bitten by the viper, yet it is evidently implied; and it is wholly incredible that a viper, unless miraculously prevented, should fasten himself to the hand without biting."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of sticks [œÜœÅœÖŒ≥Œ±ŒΩœâŒΩ] . Only here in New Testament. From ajpo to roast or parch. Hences dry sticks. 
Out of [ŒµŒ∫] . The best texts read ajpo, by reason of.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "We see the apostle here helping with his own hands to improve the fire... Such incidents are part of that natural framework which gives life and reality to the biographies of the New Testament."
2. "It is true that there are no poisonous serpents now in Malta... but with the increase of population, wood has been cleared away, and with the clearing away of wood noxious reptiles have disappeared."
3. "The impression given by these words is, that St. Paul was bitten by the viper; and this, no doubt, is the true impression. We gain nothing in such a case by attenuating a miracle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Few things show Paul to better advantage than this incident."
2. "The heat wakened him."
3. "The viper has also disappeared from Arran as the island became more frequented."

### John Gill:
1. "Had picked up some sticks, and put them in a bundle fit for the fire, as everyone was busy to assist in this extremity; nor did the apostle think such an action below him, who in all things was a man of great humility and condescension."
2. "It is said that this remarkable reptile has the biggest and flattest head of all the serpent kind; its usual length is about half an ell, and its thickness an inch; its snout is not unlike that of a hog; it has sixteen small immovable teeth in each jaw, besides two other large, sharp, hooked, hollow, transparent, canine teeth, situate at each side of the upper jaw, which are those that do the mischief..."
3. "Now when this viper here is said to come out of the heat, the meaning is, that it came out from the sticks, which were laid upon the fire, being forced from thence by the heat of it: and so the Syriac version renders it, 'there came out of them' (the sticks) 'a viper, because of the heat of the fire'; it lay quiet among the sticks, among which, and such like things, this creature often lies; but when the fire began to heat it, it sprung out."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 28:3, we see the Apostle Paul, despite being a prisoner, serving the needs of others by gathering sticks and tending to the fire. As he laid the sticks on the fire, a viper that had been concealed among them became warmed by the heat and fastened onto Paul's hand, leaving no doubt that he was truly bitten. This incident reveals Paul's character in action, and the fact that he was unharmed by the venomous snake shows the hand of God at work. This miracle is even more astounding considering that vipers were once commonly found in Malta but have since disappeared due to the clearing of the land. Such incidents, though seemingly trivial, lend authenticity to the biographies of the New Testament and offer a glimpse into the remarkable life of the apostle.
