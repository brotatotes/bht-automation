# Acts 28:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Still under custody, Paul resided in his own hired house, where he received all who came to him. Although he did not go to the synagogue or anywhere else, Paul believed it was his duty to teach all who were willing to learn. For two years, in this large house, he freely preached the Gospel. The progress of Christianity during this time was evident, as it resulted in four of his Epistles and the spread of the Gospel beyond Rome.

1. "Hired house [Î¼Î¹ÏƒÎ¸Ï‰Î¼Î±Ï„Î¹] . Probably different from the xenia, or lodging - place, where he resided for the first few days, perhaps as the guest of friends, though under custody, and where he received the Jews (ver. 23)."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Paul, still a prisoner in Rome, resided in a hired house, receiving all who came to him. He did not venture to the synagogue or anywhere else. It is clear that his appeal to Rome had not garnered support, and perhaps his adversaries hoped to quell the hatred by his silence. Nevertheless, Paul believed it was not lawful for him to withdraw from anyone who was ready to learn. For two years, he freely preached the Gospel to those who came, making use of the large house he had rented. This period of captivity yielded four of his Epistles, written while chained to a soldier during the day and watched by two soldiers at night. The Gospel had reached Rome, and the progress of Christianity extended even beyond Paul's own imprisonment.
