## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus closes this most precious monument of the beginnings of the Christian Church in its march from east to west, among the Jews first, whose center was Jerusalem; next among the Gentiles, with Antioch for its headquarters; finally, its banner is seen waving over imperial Rome, foretokening its universal triumphs."
2. "Had the case come on for hearing during this period, much more if it had been disposed of, it is hardly conceivable that the History should have closed as it does."
3. "That the appeal which brought him to Rome issued in his liberation, that he was at large for some years thereafter and took some wide missionary circuits, and that he was again arrested, carried to Rome, and then executedâ€”was the undisputed belief of the early Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who can but be deeply affected when he comes to the conclusion of this inspired book recording the history of the spread of the Christian religion, and the labors and trials of that wonderful man, the apostle Paul."
2. "Perhaps there could be no more appropriate close to the book of the inspired history than thus to have conducted the apostle of the Gentiles to the capital of the Roman world."
3. "To Paul now, what are all his sorrows, and persecutions, and toils in the cause of his Master? What but a source of thanksgiving that he was permitted thus to labor to spread the gospel through the world?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is something musical in the cadence of this word reserved for the end of the Book."
2. "The Roman authorities no doubt at this time viewed the intense hatred which existed between the more rigid Jews and the rapidly-increasing Christians, with considerable favour."
3. "Statesmen of the type of Burrhus, the praetorian prÃ¦fect, and Seneca, at that time the friend of the Emperor Nero, would ever be ready to encourage and protect a sect like the Christians, which taught its disciples an unswerving loyalty to the existing government."

### John Gill:
1. "He preached up Jesus as the King Messiah, and declared that his kingdom was come, and opened the nature of it; that it consisted not in meats and drinks, but in righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."
2. "Without regeneration and sanctification, no one could be meet for [the kingdom of glory]; and without the justifying righteousness of Christ, no man could have a right unto it, or be possessed of it."
3. "He began at Damascus with preaching Jesus as the Son of God and the true Messiah; and he ends at Rome, with teaching the things concerning him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Such was the victory of the word of God."
2. "The Gospel shone with its highest lustre."
3. "Here therefore the Acts of the Apostles end; and end with great advantage."
