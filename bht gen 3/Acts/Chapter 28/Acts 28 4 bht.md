# Acts 28:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The natives, who were sure to know, declared the serpent to be venomous and concluded that the man must be a murderer. They had a belief in a Supreme, Avenging Eye and Hand, though their understanding may have been vague. The Greeks worshipped abstractions, referring to the goddess ŒîŒπŒ∫Œ∑. These people held the mistaken belief that calamity is proof of guilt, showing poor philosophy and theology. The word 'beast' can refer to any animal, including a serpent. While we cannot always attribute specific calamities to divine judgments, their innate moral sense led them to this conclusion.

2. "Why they thought he was a murderer rather than guilty of some other crime is not known. It might have been: (1) Because they inferred that he must have been guilty of some very atrocious crime, and as murder was the highest crime that man could commit, they inferred that he had been guilty of this."
3. "The general proposition that all sin will be punished at some time is true, but we are not qualified to affirm of particular calamities always that they are direct judgments for sin.
