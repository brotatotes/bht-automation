## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The chief, or first man of the Melit√¶ans, was probably an official title."
2. "If so (and his Roman name further confirms it), Publius was legate of the Pr√¶tor of Sicily, to whose province Malta belonged."
3. "The three days were probably till they could find a suitable lodging."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "of the island‚ÄîHe would hardly be so styled in the lifetime of his father, if his distinction was that of the family."
2. "But it is now ascertained that this was the proper official title of the Maltese representative of the Roman pr√¶tor to Sicily, to whose province Malta belonged."
3. "and lodged us three days courteously‚Äîtill proper winter lodgings could be obtained for them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. In the same quarters - In that place, or that part of the island,
Possessions - Property. His place of residence.
The chief man - Greek: the first man. Probably he was the governor of the island,


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The chief man [œÑœâ œÄœÅœâœÑœâ]. Official title, without reference to his rank and possessions."
2. "Though not occurring as the official designation of the governor of Malta in any ancient author, it has been found in two inscriptions discovered in the island."

### John Calvin:
1. "And it is scarce probable that all the whole multitude of Grecians was lodged there three days. I do rather think, that, when he entertained the centurion, he did also honor Paul and his companions, because, being admonished by the miracle, he did believe that he was a man beloved of God."
2. "Notwithstanding, howsoever it be, his hospitality was not unrewarded. For shortly after the Lord restored his father to health by the hand of Paul, who was indeed sick of a dangerous disease."
3. "Luke mentioneth the kind of disease that he may the better set forth the grace of God. For seeing it is an hard matter to cure a bloody flux, especially when the ague is joined therewith, the old man was cured thus suddenly only by the laying on of hands and prayer, not without the manifest power of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A question still remains as to the precise meaning of this title, though this does not affect the value of the historical coincidence."
2. "The natural view is that Publics was the Roman governor of the island; and this has been the common opinion."
3. "It is to be observed that the Greek word here translated 'courteously' is not the same that is so rendered in Acts 27:3."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An official title correct in Malta."
2. "Here it is plainly a title and not the common use seen in Acts 13:50; Acts 25:2; Acts 28:17."
3. "In a kindly or friendly manner, all the more so because of the original suspicion of Paul as a criminal."

### John Gill:
1. "it may be reasonably thought that he was the richest man in the island, and in the greatest honour and dignity"
2. "this was a very considerable instance of humanity and hospitality, to receive so many strangers at once into his houses...in such a kind, friendly, and cheerful manner"
3. "Publius, though ignorant of it, entertained an apostle of Christ among those strangers; the benefit of which he afterwards enjoyed, and which was a compensation for his liberality and beneficence."

### John Wesley:
1. The chief man of the island ‚Äî In wealth if not in power also.
Three days ‚Äî The first three days of our stay on the island.
