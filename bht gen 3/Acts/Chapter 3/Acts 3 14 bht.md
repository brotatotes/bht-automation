# Acts 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The murderers' moral impurity is starkly contrasted with Jesus as the Holy and Just One, the Prince of life, and the Author of life. The believers acknowledge their role as mere agents of Jesus, recognizing that the miracle of healing was solely His doing. The phrase desired to be granted underscores the distinction between the favor sought for Barabbas and the rejection of Jesus. By denying the Holy and Just One, even after His proven innocence, they compound their guilt and reveal the purity of Christ in comparison to their wickedness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "This last title given to our Lord implics... 'the Author of life.'" 
3. "It is possible, that the words 'Prince of life' may contain an allusion to the great miracle which was the immediate cause of the enmity of their rulers to Jesus. But of course St. Peter had a higher view in the title than merely this."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Miracles are marvels only in relation to the limited powers of man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Holy One ... And the Just - The word 'just' here denotes 'innocent,' or 'one who was free from crime.'"
