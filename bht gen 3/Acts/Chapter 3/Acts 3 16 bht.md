## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His name (the efficient cause), by means of, or on account of (our) faith in his name (the medium), &c. yea, the faith which is [wrought] by him‚Äînot ‚Äòfaith in Him;‚Äô which is an inadmissible rendering."
2. "Certainly it is according to analogy to suppose that he had such faith, from and after the words of Peter:‚Äîbut, as certainly, there is no allusion to it in this verse, and the thread of Peter‚Äôs discourse would be broken by any such."
3. "It is the firm belief in His name on the part of us His witnesses, of which he is here speaking, as the medium whereby His name (the Power of the great dignity to which He has been exalted, the authorship of life) had in this case worked."
