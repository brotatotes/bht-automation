# Acts 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rulers of the Jews, from the unlearned to the most learned, were ignorant of Jesus' true identity. Even Caiaphas, who played a role in Jesus' crucifixion, may not have fully understood the significance of his actions. However, Peter's purpose in highlighting their ignorance was not to absolve them of guilt, but to offer them hope of repentance. By emphasizing their ignorance, Peter showed that their sin, while serious, could have been even more heinous if they had knowingly crucified the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There need be no difficulty in the application of the term 'ignorance' to even the rulers of the Jews. It admits of all degreesâ€”from the unlearned, who were implicitly led by others, and hated Him because others did,â€”up to the most learned of the scribes, who knew and rightly interpreted the Messianic prophecies, but from moral blindness, or perverted expectations, did not recognize them in our Lord." 
2. "Even Caiaphas himself, of whom apparently this could least be said, may be brought under it in some measure: even he could hardly have delivered over Jesus to Pilate with the full consciousness that He was the Messiah, and that he himself was accomplishing prophecy by so doing." 
3. "Some degree of ignorance there must have been in them all."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His heaviest charges are prompted by love, which now hastens to assuage the wounds it was necessary to inflict."
2. "I wotâ€”'know.'"
3. "Through ignorance ye did it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had indeed stated and proved their wickedness. The object now was to bring them to repentance for it; and this was to be done by tenderness, kindness, and love. People are melted to contrition, not by reproaches, but by love."
2. "Ignorance, therefore, is a circumstance which must always be taken into view in an estimate of crime."
3. "The speech of Peter, however, is not intended to free them entirely from blame; nor should it be pressed to show that they were innocent. It is a mitigating circumstance thrown in to show them that there was still hope of mercy."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must so temper our sermons that they may profit the hearers, for unless there be some hope of pardon left, the terror and fear of punishment doth harden menâ€™s hearts with stubbornness."
2. "Thus doth Peter lessen the sin of his nation, because of their ignorance; for it had been impossible for them to have suffered and endured this conscience, if they had denied the Son of God, and delivered him to be slain, wittingly and willingly."
3. "This is, therefore, Peterâ€™s meaning, that they did it rather through error and a blind zeal, than through any determined wickedness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And now, brethren... affectionately as â€˜brethren.â€™"
2. "Through ignorance ye did it... the triumphant King who should restore the never-forgotten glories of David and Solomon."
3. "It was our Lordâ€™s words on the cross which suggested the beautiful thought of this 17th verse: â€˜Father, forgive them; for they know not what they doâ€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I wot. Old English for 'I know.'"
2. "If they had known what they were doing, they would not knowingly have crucified the Messiah."
3. "They had sinned, but their sin was not of so deep a dye that it could not have been still more heinous."

### John Gill:
1. "And now, brethren...to testify his cordial love and affection for them."
2. "I wot, or 'I know', that through ignorance ye did it..."
3. "And so sinning against light and knowledge, in such a malicious manner, sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost..."

### John Wesley:
1. "A word full of courtesy and compassion."
2. "He speaks to their heart."
3. "The prejudice lying from the authority of the chief priests and elders, he here removes, but with great tenderness."
