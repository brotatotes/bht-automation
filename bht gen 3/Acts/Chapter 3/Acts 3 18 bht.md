# Acts 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophets together prophesied of the Messiah's suffering, a truth that clashed with the Jewish Church's beliefs and initially troubled even the Twelve. Yet, Peter confirms it to be the fundamental truth of ancient prophecy, divinely ordained and realized through the unwitting actions of the Jews. Their guilt in rejecting and crucifying Christ was part of God's plan. This immense paradox, still a stumbling block, shows God's power and mercy in using the wickedness of the rulers to fulfill His purpose of redemption and bring life to the world.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The doctrine of a SUFFERING MESSIAH was totally at variance with the current views of the Jewish Church, and hard to digest even by the Twelve, up to the day of their Lord's resurrection."
2. "Our preacher himself revolted at it, and protested against it, when first nakedly announced, for which he received a terrible rebuke."
3. "Here he affirms it to be the fundamental truth of ancient prophecy realized unwittingly by the Jews themselves, yet by a glorious divine ordination."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "He has caused to be fulfilled in this manner; that is, by the rejection, the denial, and the wickedness of the rulers." (28 words)

### John Calvin:
1. "Ignorance, saith he, hath made you guilty, yet God hath brought that to pass which he had determined, that Christ should redeem you by his death."
2. "This is a most notable consideration, when as we ponder and consider with ourselves, that through the wonderful counsel of God our evils are turned to another end to us."

1. "In reference to God, the sin of Israel, consisting in the rejection and murder of Messiah, may be forgiven, in so far as it at the same time involved the fulfilment of the divine decree made mention of by all the prophets, â€˜that Messiah should suffer.â€™"
2. "â€˜Omnes prophetae in universum non prophetarunt nisi de diebus Messiaeâ€™ ( Sanhedr. 99, 1, quoted by Alford). These words of Peterâ€™s are not to be understood as a hyperbole (Kuinoel), or in the sense given to them by Olshausen, who, looking upon the entire history of the Jews as typical, in that view maintains that all the ancient prophets prophesied of Christ."
3. "Very many of the prophets describe with more or less distinctness the sufferings and the death of Messiah all of them looked on with sure hope to the times of restoration and redemption. This longed-for restoration and redemption was only to be won by the sufferings and death of Messiah."

3. "So wisely and surprisingly are things ordered and overruled by the wise providence of God, who is a God of knowledge, and by whom all actions are weighed."

### John Wesley:
1. But God â€” Who was not ignorant, permitted this which he had foretold, to bring good out of it.
