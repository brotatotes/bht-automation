# Acts 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, a man who had been lame from his mother's womb would be carried daily. This gate, also known as Nicanor's gate, existed on the eastern side of the Temple and led from the court of the Gentiles to the inner court of the Israelites. Made of Corinthian brass, the gate was magnificent in its appearance, with plates of gold and silver. The man's condition of being lame from birth made the subsequent miracle even more extraordinary.
