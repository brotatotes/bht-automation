# Acts 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Acts 3:21 speaks of the heavens receiving Christ until the appointed time of the restitution of all things. The restitution mentioned here is not just a restoration of created beings to their original state but encompasses the fulfillment of promises and prophecies. This sense of restoration is confirmed by the fact that God has spoken through his holy prophets since the world began. The hope of Christ's return to bring about this restoration should comfort us in the midst of confusion, for God's word and the course of time itself affirm this truth.
