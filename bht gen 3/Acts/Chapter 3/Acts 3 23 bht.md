# Acts 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who refuse to 'hearken' to Moses and now, to Christ, shall be utterly destroyed, facing exclusion from the kingdom of God and eternal death. By quoting the words of their favorite prophet, Peter warns the Jews of the dreadful consequence of their infidelity, urging them to listen to the prophet sent by God and accept Jesus as their Master. This refusal to hear Christ is tantamount to refusing to hear God Himself, resulting in exclusion from life and the sentence of eternal death.
