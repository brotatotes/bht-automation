# Acts 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. How sublimely does the apostle shut up these rulers to Jesus for salvation, declaring the necessity of salvation in the name of Jesus Christ and in no other. Salvation is found in no one else but Jesus Christ. He is the only name upon which humanity can rely for eternal deliverance. The adoption of this truth proclaims separation from all other means of salvation.
