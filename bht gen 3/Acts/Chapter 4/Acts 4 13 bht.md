### Albert Barnes:
1. "Boldness - This word properly denotes 'openness' or 'confidence in speaking.' It stands opposed to 'hesitancy,' and to 'equivocation' in declaring our sentiments." 
2. "This same character is uniformly attributed to the early preachers of Christianity. The Galileans were regarded by the Jews as particularly rude and uncultivated."
3. "Boldness and success in the ministry, as well as in everything else, will depend far more on honest, genuine, thorough conviction of the truth than on the endowments of talent and learning, and the arts and skill of eloquence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Perceived [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπ] . The word, meaning originally to seize upon or lay hold of, occurs frequently in the New Testament in different phases of this original sense."
2. "Unlearned [Œ±Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒøŒπ] . Or, very literally, unlettered. With special reference to Rabbinic culture, the absence of which was conspicuous in Peter's address."
3. "Ignorant [ŒπŒ¥ŒπœâœÑŒ±Œπ] . Originally, one in a private station, as opposed to one in office or in public affairs. Therefore one without professional knowledge, a layman."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here may we see an evil conscience; for being destitute of right and reason, they break out into open tyranny, the hatred whereof they had essayed to escape."
2. "In as much as they know that Peter and John were men unlearned and ignorant, they acknowledge that there was somewhat more than belongeth to man in their boldness; therefore they are enforced to wonder whether they will or no."
3. "For after they have put two simple men to silence, shall the arm of God be broken?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Unlearned. Observing from the language and arguments used that Peter and John were untaught in the rabbinical learning of the Jewish schools."
2. "And obscure, or common. Men of no mark."
3. "They marvelled. The rulers were evidently astonished that one so unlearned and undistinguished should address them in such moving, powerful language."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Unlettered men without technical training in the professional rabbinical schools of Hillel or Shammai." (Commentary)
3. "Peter and John were men of ability and of courage, but they did not belong to the set of the rabbis." (Commentary)

### John Gill:
1. "They observed their elocution, the justness of their diction, the propriety of their language, and the strength and nervousness of their reasoning."
2. "They were informed that they were 'unlearned' men, or who did not understand letters; not but that they had learned their mother tongue, and could read the Scriptures; but they had not had a liberal education."
3. "They were mean and abject, poor fishermen, men of no name and figure, that were in no office, and exalted station of life, nor versed in Jewish learning, but common private men."

### John Wesley:
1. Illiterate and uneducated men ‚Äî Even by such men (though not by such only) hath God in all ages caused his word to be preached before the world.
