# Acts 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Unaware of the fire burning within the heroic disciples, the council attempted to quell the spreading of the gospel by strictly threatening them to no longer speak in the name of Jesus. Their futile efforts were in vain as the people, reminded of Jesus' words and works through the miraculous healing, stood firmly on the side of the accused apostles. Like charges against Jesus, their attempt to silence the disciples was destined to fail, unable to hinder the unstoppable spread of the message of Jesus.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Failing to understand the fire within the apostles, the council tried to suppress the spreading of the gospel, strictly threatening them to speak no longer in the name of Jesus. But their weak and futile attempt was in vain, for the people, who had witnessed Peter and John's miracles and heard their teachings, were on the apostles' side. Just as the charges against Jesus failed to gain traction due to the good sense of the people, so too were the council's efforts to silence the disciples futile. The council's arrogance blinded them to the fact that the message of Jesus could not be contained or hindered - it would continue to spread, despite their threats.
