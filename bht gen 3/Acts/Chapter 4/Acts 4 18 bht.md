# Acts 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious authorities ordered them not to make the name of Jesus the subject of their discourses, not to speak at all or teach in his name. The disciples were faced with a choice: to obey the authorities or to listen to God. But the message of Jesus was not something they could keep silent about. They understood that they were not only being told not to speak publicly, but also to withhold the doctrine of Jesus. However, they could not stay silent about the person, incarnation, offices, sufferings, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
