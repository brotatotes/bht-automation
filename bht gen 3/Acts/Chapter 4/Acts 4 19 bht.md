### Albert Barnes:

2. "It is, to lay their safety, reputation, and life out of view, and bring everything to the test whether it will please God. If it will, it is right; if it will not, it is wrong."
3. "As a mere historical fact, therefore, it is interesting to contemplate this, and still more interesting in its important bearings on human liberty and human happiness."

### John Calvin:
1. "But because they do abuse their authority, the apostles say flatly that they are not to be obeyed."
2. "The obedience which men use toward evil and unfaithful pastors... is contrary to God."

### John Gill:
1. "With great boldness and courage, and without any fear of man, but in the true fear of God."
2. "Whether it be right in the sight of God; who is omniscient, and sees, and knows all things, all the actions of men, and the springs of them; who is holy, just, and true, and sits and judges among the gods, that which is right."
3. "To hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye: it is not denied that magistrates are to be hearkened to, and obeyed: but not more than God, or in things that are contrary to his nature, will, law, honour, and glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whether it be just to obey you rather than God, judge ye."
