# Acts 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the evening, the officials put Peter and John in custody, possibly in one of the chambers of the temple, so that they could not escape until they were brought before the council the next day. This violated the regulation of not holding a trial at night, as seen in the case of Jesus. The decision to hold them in custody until the next day may have been due to the fact that it was the time for the evening prayer or sacrifice, and it was not usual to convene the Sanhedrin at that hour.
