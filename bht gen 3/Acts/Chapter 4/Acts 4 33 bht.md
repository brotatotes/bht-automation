3. "He declareth afterward, after what sort they had their goods common, which he had touched before, to wit, that the rich men sold their lands and houses, that they might relieve the poverty of the poor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is again and again mentioned as the groundwork of the apostolic teaching; it was the column upon which their strong patient faith rested; they knew they had seen their Master after He had risen; they told it out to others that men might grasp the mighty issues which this victory of Jesus over death involved for every man and woman."
2. "And great grace was upon them all... it is obvious that the 'grace of God' was upon the apostles and brethren: they were filled, we read, with the Holy Ghost."
3. "There was scarcely any need for the writer of the 'Acts' specially to mention, further, how Godâ€™s favour was resting upon them; but the fact of their standing high in popular estimation was an important one: it showed under whose protection and by whose favour their public preaching and work went on after the threats of the supreme council."
