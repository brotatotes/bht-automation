# Acts 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Annas and Caiaphas, both high priests, were influential figures in the Jewish court, the Sanhedrim. Annas, an ex-high priest and father-in-law of Caiaphas, held authority among the chief priests. Caiaphas held the high-priestly title by Roman law, and they both led the charge against Peter and John. The involvement of John and Alexander, although less known, accentuates the significance of this event. As leaders among the Sadducees, they played a crucial role in pressing the case against the disciples.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Sanhedrim was the supreme court in the Jewish nation. Its decrees apparently were respected beyond Palestine... Its powers embraced all matters, civil as well as religious." 
2. "The Idumean rulers, and after them the Roman Government, not un-frequently would arbitrarily depose the high priest, and could set up another in his room. But with the people, the deposed functionary kept his title, and even still wore the high-priestly garments."
3. "Nothing positively certain is known of these two [John and Alexander]. Lightfoot would identify John with Rabbi Johanan ben Zaccai, who is mentioned in the Talmud: after the fall of Jerusalem, he obtained permission from the Roman Government that the Sanhedrim might be settled at Japhneh."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Annas (HÎ±Î½Î½Î±Ï‚). One of the rulers or chief priests, ex-high priest (A.D. 7-14) and father-in-law of Caiaphas (ÎšÎ±Î¹Î±Ï†Î±Ï‚)..."
2. "Caiaphas so by Roman law, Annas so in the opinion of the Jews."
3. "They with John and Alexander are the leaders among the Sadducees in pressing the case against Peter and John."

### John Gill:
1. "Annas the high priest,.... So called, either because he had been an high priest, though he was not now, but Caiaphas his son-in-law; or because he was the Sagan of the high priest, and had all the other priests under his government..."
2. "the chief objection to him, as that learned writer observes, is, that he lived and died a Pharisee, whereas this John seems to have been a Sadducee"
3. "and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest; by whose means they were become members of the sanhedrim"

### John Wesley:
1. Annas, who had been the high priest, and Caiaphas, who was so then.
