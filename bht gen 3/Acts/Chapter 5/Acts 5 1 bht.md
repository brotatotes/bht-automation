2. "Sapphira is probably a Greek name for the precious stone sapphire."
3. "The crime of these two is well described by Meyer: â€˜By the sale of their field, and the bringing in of the money, they in fact professed to give the whole price as a gift of brotherly love to the common stock: but their aim was to get for themselves the credit of holy love and zeal by one portion of the price, whereas they had selfishly kept back the other portion for themselves. They wished to serve two masters, but to appear to serve only One.â€™"
