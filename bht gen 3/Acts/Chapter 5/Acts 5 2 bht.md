# Acts 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ananias and his wife were not only guilty of keeping a portion for themselves after selling their possessions, but they also planned the deception with calmness, aggravating the severity of their guilt. They deliberately separated this portion for their own use, while pretending to donate the entire proceeds. Joseph's admirable example seemed to be too much for Ananias to live up to, leading him to hold back part of the proceeds. His wife, fully aware of the deceit, was also complicit in their actions.
