## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Or perhaps the expression may import, that the religion of Jesus had its issue in life."
3. "The deliverance, here granted to all the Apostles, was again vouchsafed to Peter in ch. xii., and is there related more in detail."

3. "God delivers us from dangers sometimes that we may plunge 'into' new dangers; he preserves us from one form of calamity that we may be tried in some new furnace of affliction; he calls us to encounter trials simply 'because' he demands it, and as an expression of gratitude to him for his gracious interposition."

### John Calvin:
1. "That is worth the marking, because we see many men, who, after they have escaped out of persecution, do afterwards keep silence, as if they had done their duty towards God, (and were no more to be troubled;) other some, also, do escape away by denying Christ; but the Lord doth deliver his children, not to the end they may cease off from the course which they have begun, but rather that they may be the more zealous afterward."
2. "The apostles might have objected, It is better to keep silence for a time, forasmuch as we cannot speak one word without danger; we are now apprehended for one only sermon, how much more shall the fury of our enemies be inflamed hereafter if they shall see us make no end of speaking? But because they knew that they were to live and to die to the Lord, they do not refuse to do that which the Lord commanded."
3. "The words of this life. A singular commendation of the gospel, that it is a lively doctrine, bringing salvation unto men; for the righteousness of God is revealed unto us in it, (Romans 1:17;) and in it Christ offereth himself unto us with the sacrifice of his death, with the Spirit of regeneration, with the earnest of our adoption."

### John Gill:
1. "They were not delivered out of prison, in order to go and secure themselves from danger; but to go about the work they were called to, to preach the Gospel 'in the temple', the place of worship..."
