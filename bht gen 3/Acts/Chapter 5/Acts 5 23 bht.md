# Acts 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The authenticity of the narrative is emphasized through the reluctance to explicitly mention Jesus and the spread of his teachings, indicated by the use of phrases like 'this name' and 'this man's blood'. In contrast, Peter fearlessly acknowledges and celebrates Jesus. The mention of divine vengeance is not suggesting punishment for Jesus' murder but rather serves as a caution that the people might seek retribution against the Sanhedrin. The astonishing escape from a securely locked prison parallels the miraculous catch of fish in John 21:11, demonstrating divine intervention.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The High Priest will not name Jesus: Peter names and celebrates Him, reflecting the shyness of openly discussing Jesus and his teachings, which adds truth and detail to the narrative. As a result, divine vengeance is not declared upon the High Priest but rather a warning that the people may seek retribution for the murder of Jesus. The miraculous escape of the prisoners is an opposite outcome to the usual circumstances, analogous to the miraculous draughts of fishes. Similar to John 21:11, where the nets were filled with an abundance of fish, this event serves as clear evidence of divine intervention and protection, as the prison was securely locked when the guards arrived, but the prisoners were gone upon entering. Overall, this verse portrays a powerful demonstration of God's ability to defy earthly restraints.
