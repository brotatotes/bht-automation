# Acts 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why hast thou allowed Satan to fill thine heart and lie to the Holy Ghost? Satan had entered into Judas and now he has filled the heart of Ananias with a lie. The Holy Spirit had been given to guide them into truth, yet Ananias yielded to the temptation. This instance was such that none but Satan could have put him upon, or emboldened him to have done; he lied against the Holy Ghost by keeping back part of the price the land was sold for when he had declared he sold it with this view to give the whole for charitable uses.
