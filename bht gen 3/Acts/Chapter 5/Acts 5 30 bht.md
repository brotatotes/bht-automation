# Acts 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The God of our fathers, binding Christ to the covenant, was slain by their own hands, ignominiously and barely described, to waken compunction. They killed him, manhandling and managing his crucifixion on the tree, an expression entailing curse and disgrace. Peter charges them with guilt, accusing them of murdering their own Messiah, identifying himself with the glorious line of patriarchs, prophets, and kings. Emphasizing the beloved name of Jesus, the accused apostle highlights the central point: the cross as a tree, a death pronounced accursed in their sacred law.

### John Calvin:
1. "For this speech is common, that God raised up prophets or judges, or rather ministers, whom he determined to use into some great work; which importeth as much as that all excellency of nature is weak, unless God do furnish those with singular gifts whom he preferreth unto any excellent office."
2. "Not that they allow all that worship which was used by the fathers, as profane men are content with this only argument, that the fathers taught thus, that they do all things according to the custom and decree of their ancestors..."
3. "...lest any part of Christ‚Äôs glory should seem to be diminished because he suffered a slanderous death upon the cross; as if it had been said, You have slain him. Neither was your cruelty satisfied with a plain and common death; for he was hanged upon a tree. But neither could death extinguish his power; neither could that shame and reproach which he suffered amongst you take away his honor."

3. "And hanged on a tree. The cross is here called 'a tree,' a well-known expression to those learned Jewish priests and rabbis who sat in the great council; they would too well remember how, in their sacred law, this death was pronounced accursed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:

2. "To show that they did not bring in and worship any strange God; nor introduce any novel doctrine; or speak of any other Saviour or Redeemer, than he whom the God of their fathers had appointed."
3. "They therefore insist upon it that they had slain Jesus whom God raised up, inasmuch as they had condemned him to death in their sanhedrim, and had urged and importuned Pilate to crucify him, and had imprecated his blood upon them and on their children."

### John Wesley:
