# Acts 5:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is highly unlikely that St. Luke would have fabricated the words attributed to Gamaliel, especially considering the historical accuracy of Luke's other writings and his connection to St. Paul, who was a pupil of Gamaliel. Gamaliel's reference to impostors named Simon and Judas, who incited rebellion, adds credibility to his advice to let the apostles go. This cautionary tale serves as a reminder that those who advance themselves unadvisedly often face unfortunate consequences by the just judgment of God. While Gamaliel's mention of Theudas might have been historically contested, it serves to demonstrate that impostors and troublemakers often failed in their attempts. In the face of persecution and unmerited suffering, the apostles' unwavering dedication is truly commendable. Their steadfastness is all the more remarkable, considering the exemplary faith they exhibited after Gamaliel's advice of caution.

3. "Yet he speaketh doubtfully, because he provideth only for quietness, all inquiry being set apart. This is only to be allowed in his speech, that he feareth [deterreth] the wicked from wicked boldness, because there is nothing more to be feared than to strive against God."

3. "Just as Theucharis is put for Theocharis, and Theudosia for Theodosia: but it seems rather to be an Hebrew name; and so Jerom i took it to be, who renders it 'praise': but who the man was is not certain; however, he rose up, as Gamaliel says, and made an insurrection."
