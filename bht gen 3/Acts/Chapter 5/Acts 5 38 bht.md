# Acts 5:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Refrain from interfering with these men and let them be; their work, part of a divine plan, cannot be nullified by human deception. Although neutrality may have been wise for the council, Jesus teaches that neutrality towards him is hostility. If this counsel or work is of human origin, it will fail, as Theudas and Judas's plans did. Therefore, discern whether a cause is good or evil and act accordingly. The apostles were mere instruments in God's hands, without their own plans.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Refrain [Œ±œÄŒøœÉœÑŒ∑œÑŒµ] . Lit., stand off."
2. "Of men [ŒµŒæ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄœâŒΩ] . Out of men, proceeding out of their devices."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Refrain from (Œ±œÄŒøœÉœÑŒ∑œÑŒµ Œ±œÄŒø). Second aorist (ingressive) active imperative of Œ±œÜŒπœÉœÑŒ∑Œº of verse Acts 5:37. Do ye stand off from these men. 'Hands off' was the policy of Gamaliel."
2. "For if--be (ŒøœÑ ŒµŒ±ŒΩ--Œ∑). HŒøœÑ gives the reason for the advice. Gamaliel presents two alternatives in terms of two conditional clauses. The first one is stated as a condition of the third class, ŒµŒ±ŒΩ with the present subjunctive Œ∑, undetermined with prospect of determination."

### John Gill:
1. "Refrain from these men, and let them alone; keep your hands off of them, do not attempt to take away their lives, but dismiss them quietly..." 
2. "For if this counsel, or this work be of men; if the doctrine these men preach is an human device; or this business they are engaged in is only an human affair..." 
3. "It will come to nought; as did the designs of Theudas and Judas."

### John Wesley:
1. "In a cause which is manifestly good, we should immediately join."
2. "In a cause, on the other hand, which is manifestly evil, we should immediately oppose."
3. "For the apostles had no counsel, plan, or design of their own; but were mere instruments in the hand of God."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Refrain from opposing these men and let them be; their work, which is part of a divine plan, cannot be thwarted by human deception or wickedness. While neutrality may have been the wise approach for the council at that time, Jesus teaches that being neutral towards him is the same as being against him. If this counsel or work is of human origin, it will ultimately fail, just as the endeavors of Theudas and Judas did.

The apostles themselves were not driven by their own schemes, but merely instruments in the hands of God.
