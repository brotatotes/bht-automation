The deaths of Ananias and Sapphira were supernaturally inflicted by Peter, acting in the power of the Holy Spirit.

The fear that came upon those who heard of these events was not mockery, but a deep awe of the manifest presence of Divinity among them. Ananias brought his own end upon himself, and it was God's judgment.
