The young men in the congregation, not distinguishing between younger men and elders, promptly responded to the Apostle's instruction, wrapping up the body of Ananias for burial.

The Greek word ÏƒÏ…Î½ÎµÏƒÏ„ÎµÎ¹Î»Î±Î½ suggests wrapping or tucking, possibly reflecting the practice of wrapping cloaks or garments. The expedited burial was likely influenced by health concerns and the desire to avoid ceremonial impurity in Jerusalem.

3. "The immediate burial in this case adds to the probability that the young men obeyed an intimation from the Apostle."

3. "In medical language, of bandaging a limb; of the contraction of tumors, and of organs of the body, etc."

### Philip Schaff:
