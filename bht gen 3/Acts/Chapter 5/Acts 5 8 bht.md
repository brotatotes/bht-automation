# Acts 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Ananias' wife was questioned by Peter about the amount they received for selling their land, her entrance into the assembly functioned as a powerful statement. Perhaps Peter even gestured towards the money still lying at his feet as he asked her. However, instead of confessing the truth and finding salvation, she stubbornly clung to her deceit, reaffirming the lie in the presence of the Church and apostles. In His mercy, God thoroughly examined the matter before delivering punishment. This episode serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of our accountability before God's judgment seat.
