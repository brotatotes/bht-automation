## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To try the omniscience of the Spirit then visibly dwelling in the Apostles and the church, was, in the highest sense, to tempt the Spirit of God."
2. "Peter characterizes the sin more solemnly this second time, because by the wifeâ€™s answer it was now proved to be no individual lie of a bad and covetous man, but a preconcerted scheme to deceive God."
3. "This word, spoken before her death, decisively proves that death to have been not a result merely of her detection, but a judicial infliction."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "to tempt the Spiritâ€”try whether they could escape detection by that omniscient Spirit of whose supernatural presence with the apostles they had had such full evidence."
2. "feet of them that buried thy husband are at the doorâ€”How awfully graphic!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was important that sudden and exemplary punishment should follow it, because the society of Christians was just then organized, and it was designed that it should be a 'pure' society, and should be regarded as a body of holy men."
2. "In a particular manner, no small part of the preaching of the Saviour was employed in detecting the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees, and denouncing heavy judgments on them."
3. "And on no point should Christians more faithfully examine themselves than in regard to the professed devotion of their 'property' to God. If God punished this sin in the beginning of the Christian church, he will do it still in its progress; and in nothing have professed Christians more to fear his wrath than on this very subject."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "It was close to the unpardonable sin which was attributing the manifest work of the Holy Spirit to Beelzebub."
3. "Graphic picture by Peter as he heard the steps of the young men at the door."

### John Gill:
1. "For husband and wife to agree together in what is good, in things civil, honest, and lawful, and in religious matters, is very commendable; but to agree in a fraud, in a lie, is very dreadful."
2. "To tempt the Spirit of the Lord; to try whether the apostles had the Spirit of the Lord, or not; and whether the Spirit of the Lord that was in them was omniscient and omnipotent, would take any notice of it, and inflict punishment for it."
3. "Which Peter knew either by hearing the sound of their feet, as Ahijah the prophet heard the sound of the feet of Jeroboam's wife, as she came in at the door... or by the same spirit as Elisha knew that Gehazi ran after Naaman, and received money and garments from him."
