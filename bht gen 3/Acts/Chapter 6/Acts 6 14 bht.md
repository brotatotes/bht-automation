# Acts 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They accused him of teaching that the form of worship should be changed, which they interpreted as blasphemy against God and Moses. However, the charge was false, as Stephen had caught the spirit of Jesus about worship - that God is spirit and can be worshipped anywhere, not just in the temple. The false witnesses brought the same charge against Jesus during his examination, claiming he would destroy the temple and change the customs. The Jews themselves acknowledged that these changes would occur in the times of the Messiah. Nonetheless, their accusation was based on a flawed inference and lacked validity.
