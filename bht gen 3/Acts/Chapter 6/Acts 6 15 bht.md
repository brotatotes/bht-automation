## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But both from the plain language of our text, well understood among the Jews to signify supernatural brightness, and from the fact that in St. Lukeâ€™s own narrative we have supernatural brightness associated with angelic appearances more than once (see Luke ii. 9; ch. xii. 7), I should be inclined to think that the face of the martyr was lighted up with a divine radiance."
2. "That the effect on those present was not such as to prevent the examination proceeding, is no argument against this view: in the very mildness of the question of the High Priest which follows, I see the trace of some unusual incident exercising an influence over him."
3. â€œGod seems to me to have made him beautiful to look at, perhaps to prepare the way for his speech, and that he might immediately strike them with his look. For there is, yea there is, in faces full of spiritual grace that which is lovely to those that love them, and strikes awe and fear into those that hate them."
