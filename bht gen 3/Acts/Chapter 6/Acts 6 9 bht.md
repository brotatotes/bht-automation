# Acts 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There were Jewish freedmen who had been expelled from Rome by Tiberius and sought refuge in Jerusalem, possibly in three synagogues. These Libertines, descendants of freed slaves, were among the chief opponents of Stephen's preaching because they feared the endangerment of their faith. When Stephen proclaimed Jesus as the Messiah in these synagogues, disputations arose. However, Stephen's wisdom and power, empowered by the Spirit of God, confounded his adversaries and left them thoroughly amazed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Here then we have abundant reason for numbers of these Jews of libertine race having come to Jerusalem, being among the rest, who were ordered to quit Italy: and what place so likely a refuge for Jews as Jerusalem?"
2. "But none of their suppositions will bear examination, and the best interpretation is the usual oneâ€”that they were the descendants of Jewish freedmen at Rome, who had been expelled by Tiberius."

1. "Of the synagogue - See the notes on Matthew 4:23. The Jews were scattered in all parts of the world. In every place they would have synagogues."
2. "Of the Libertines - There has been very great difference of opinion about the meaning of this word... Many have supposed that these persons were manumitted slaves of Roman origin... This opinion is not very probable."
3. "Disputing with Stephen - Doubtless on the question whether Jesus was the Messiah. This word does not denote 'angry disputing,' but is commonly used to denote 'fair and impartial inquiry'..."

2. "For Luke meant to express that they fought not on both sides as men; but that the enemies of the gospel were therefore discouraged and overcome, because they did strive against the Spirit of God, which spake by the mouth of Stephen."
3. "So the Spirit was as effectual in our time in the mouth of the martyrs which were burnt, and it uttereth the like force now daily, that though they were ignorant men, yet did they make the chief divines which maintained Popery no less astonished with their voice only, than if it had thundered and lightned."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The teaching and work of Stephen struck a new chord in the heart of the people."
2. "The success stirred up a new hindrance."
3. "Stephen came in contact with the teachers of these different schools of Jewish thought."

2. "Certain of them 'arose' (Î±Î½ÎµÏƒÏ„Î·ÏƒÎ±Î½) 'stood up' after they had stood all that they could from Stephen, 'disputing with Stephen' (ÏƒÏ…Î½Î¶Î·Ï„Î¿Ï…Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚ Ï„Ï‰ Î£Ï„ÎµÏ†Î±Î½Ï‰)."
