### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 7:15, the verse refers to the patriarchs' envy towards Joseph, which led to him being sold into Egypt. However, despite this opposition, God was still with him. This is just one example that Stephen gives to illustrate Israel's resistance to God's purposes, yet how those purposes were ultimately fulfilled through these very obstacles. It is worth noting that while Jacob and his twelve sons died in Egypt, only Jacob and Joseph's deaths are mentioned in the Bible, with the statement that Joseph's brothers and the entire generation also passed away.

- Attempt 3 BHT: Stephen's example in Acts 7:15 highlights how the patriarchs' envy resulted in Joseph being sold into Egypt, yet God never abandoned him.

- Attempt 4 BHT: In Stephen's account, the envy of the patriarchs led to Joseph being sold into Egypt, but it is crucial to recognize that God remained faithfully by Joseph's side throughout it all. This early example demonstrates how Israel repeatedly opposed God's plans, yet paradoxically, through these very adversities, His purposes were ultimately accomplished. Although the Bible only explicitly mentions the deaths of Jacob and Joseph, it is reasonable to infer that the other brothers and that entire generation have followed suit in passing away.

- Attempt 5 BHT: In Acts 7:15, Stephen highlights the patriarchs' envy towards Joseph, resulting in his sale into Egypt, yet he emphasizes that God never abandoned him. This example underscores Israel's resistance to God's plans, but interestingly, these very obstacles ultimately served to fulfill His purposes. Although the Bible specifically records the deaths of Jacob and Joseph, it does not provide details about the other brothers or that entire generation, suggesting that they too have passed away.
