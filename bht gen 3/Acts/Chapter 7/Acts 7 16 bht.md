## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The facts, as related in the Old Testament, were these: Jacob, dying in Egypt, was taken into the land of Canaan, and buried in the cave of Macpelah, before Mamre..."
2. "Joseph, dying also in Egypt, was taken in a coffin at the Exodus and finally buried at Shechem."
3. "These traditions probably Stephen followed; and, in haste or inadvertence, classed Jacob with the rest."

### John Calvin:
1. "Some answer, that Moses speaketh of Joseph for honorâ€™s sake, because he had given express commandment concerning his bones."
2. "I can affirm nothing concerning this matter for a certainty, save only that this is either a speech wherein is synecdoche, or else that Luke rehearseth this not so much out of Moses, as according to the old fame."
3. "And whereas he saith afterward, they were laid in the sepulcher which Abraham had bought of the sons of Hemor, it is manifest that there is a fault [mistake] in the word Abraham."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Possibly only 'our fathers' without Jacob is the subject of 'were carried.'"
2. "If 'Jacob' is substituted for 'Abraham,' the matter is cleared up."

### John Gill:
1. "Joseph and the rest of the patriarchs, who died in Egypt, when the children of Israel came out from thence, they brought their bones along with them, and buried them in Sichem."
2. "Since they buried the bones of Joseph in Sichem, it is most reasonable to believe that the rest were buried there likewise."
3. "Upon the whole, the charge of several errors brought against Stephen appears to be groundless."

### John Wesley:
1. "This concise manner of speaking, strange as it seems to us, was common among the Hebrews; particularly, when in a case notoriously known, the speaker mentioned but part of the story, and left the rest, which would have interrupted the current of his discourse, to be supplied in the mind of the hearer."
2. "The first land which these strangers bought was for a sepulchre. They sought for a country in heaven."
3. "Perhaps the whole sentence might be rendered thus: So Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers, and were carried over to Shechem, and laid by the sons (that is, descendants) of Hamor, the father of Shechem, in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 7:16, Stephen includes Jacob among our fathers who were carried over to Shechem and buried in the sepulchre that Abraham bought. However, the first-tier commentators suggest that this may have been a mistake on Stephen's part, as Jacob was actually buried in the cave of Macpelah. Another possibility is that Stephen only meant to refer to our fathers without including Jacob. Nevertheless, the presence of Jacob in this context can be reconciled by substituting Jacob for Abraham, which clarifies the matter. Regardless, it is clear that the bones of Joseph and the other patriarchs who died in Egypt were indeed taken and buried in Shechem. Overall, despite the criticisms of Stephen's accuracy, it seems that the charge of errors against him is unfounded.
