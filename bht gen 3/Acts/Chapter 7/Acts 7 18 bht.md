# Acts 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A different kind of king, belonging to a new dynasty, arose in Egypt. This new ruler did not recognize the significance of Joseph's history and services, showing no respect for his people. The previous dynasty, which was that of the Hyksos, was expelled by this new king, Ahmes. It is uncertain if the new king genuinely didn't know about Joseph or if he deliberately dissembled his ignorance. Nevertheless, his lack of acknowledgement of Joseph's merits foreshadowed the difficult times that awaited the Israelites under his reign.
