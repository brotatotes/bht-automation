3. "This is easily answered, for Moses reciteth not in this latter place what happened after the departure of Abraham; but lest any man should think that Abraham wandered into other countries, having unadvisedly forsaken his own house, he showeth the cause of his departure, to wit, because he was commanded by God to flit into another place."
