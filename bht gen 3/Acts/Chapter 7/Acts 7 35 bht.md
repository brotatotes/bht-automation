## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words, this Moses, are repeated emphatically again and again, to impress on them God‚Äôs choice of one whom they rejected." 
2. "The rejecter of Moses there is regarded as the representative of the nation."
3. "The difficulty of hath God sent: has caused it to be altered into the historic tense, 'did God send.' But the perfect tense sets forth not only the fact of God‚Äôs sending Moses then, but the endurance of his mission till‚Äîhim hath God sent: with a closer reference than before, to Him whom God had now exalted as the true Ruler and Deliverer."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge, &amp;c.‚ÄîHere, again, 'the stone which the builders refused is made the head of the corner' (Psalms 118:22)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Stephen introduces and dwells upon this refusal in order, perhaps, to remind them that this had been the character of their nation." 
2. "It properly means one who redeems a captive or a prisoner by paying a 'price' or 'ransom.'"
3. "It is used here, however, in a more 'general' sense to denote 'the deliverance,' without specifying the manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Deliverer [ŒªœÖœÑœÅœâœÑŒ∑, ŒΩ] . Strictly, a ransomer or redeemer."
2. "By the hand [ŒµŒΩ œáŒµŒπœÅŒπ] The best texts read sun ceiri, 'with the hand;' i.e., in association with the protecting and helping power of the angel."


### John Calvin:
1. "Stephen passeth over many things, because he maketh haste unto this stun, that the Jews may understand that the fathers were not delivered therefore, because they had deserved that with their godliness, but that this benefit was bestowed upon them, being altogether unworthy."
2. "That which is added touching miracles and wonders, serveth as well to the setting forth of the grace of God, as to make known the calling of Moses."
3. "God doth not so give and resign unto man that honor which is due to himself, that he loseth any whit of his authority thereby. For doubtless Moses was not called a redeemer or deliverer in any other respect save only because he was the minister of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This Moses...whom the children of Israel refused, but whom God marked with such distinguished honour." 
2. "By men rejected, but by God exalted to be ruler and deliverer; the miracle-worker...the one among men whom the great Prophet (the Messiah) afterwards to be raised up, should resemble."
3. "The parallel between the great Hebrew lawgiver and his own crucified Master...becomes closer and more marked...caused him to become 'redeemer' of the whole nation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They in Egypt denied Moses as now you the Jews denied Jesus."
2. "Those in Egypt scouted Moses as 'ruler and judge' and God 'hath sent' Moses 'both a ruler and a deliverer' as Jesus was to be."
3. "Stephen here answers that slander by showing how Moses led the people out of Egypt in co-operation with the hand of the Angel of Jehovah."

### John Gill:
1. "He was an eminent type of the Messiah; and the redemption of the people of Israel out of the Egyptian bondage, by him, was emblematical of redemption from the bondage of sin, Satan, and the law by Jesus Christ."
2. "Moses was despised by his brethren, and yet made the ruler and deliverer of them, so, though Jesus was set at nought by the Jews, yet he was made both Lord and Christ, and exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour."
3. "The Father sent him [Moses] by the Son, not as an instrument, but as having the power and authority over him, to govern, direct, and assist him."

### John Wesley:
1. "So God frequently imputes the sins of the fathers to those of their children who are of the same spirit."
2. "Him did God send to be a deliverer ‚Äî Which is much more than a judge; by the hand of."
3. "It was therefore the Son of God who delivered the law to Moses, under the character of Jehovah, and who is here spoken of as the angel of the covenant, in respect of his mediatorial office."
