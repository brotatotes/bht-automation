# Acts 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses, as the mediator between the Angel of the covenant and the people, was in the church or assembly held at Mt. Sinai, where he faithfully reported the living oracles and set up the prescribed institutions. Through this high testimony to Moses, Stephen rebutted the main charge against him. The word 'lively' or 'living' denotes that the commands given by God to Moses were vigorous and efficacious, securing attention and producing obedience. This occurrence in the wilderness establishes that God's church is not limited to a specific place or time, but endures through all circumstances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That Moses conversed with both the Angel of the covenant and our fathers, implies that he was the mediator between them." 
2. "The word rendered the church means, probably, the assembly held for the promulgation of the law at Mt. Sinai, not ‚Äòthe Church‚Äô generally." 
3. "Living oracles, see reff. not ‚Äòlife-giving:‚Äô still less to be understood ‚Äògiven viv√¢ voce.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "in the church‚Äîthe collective body of God's chosen people; hence used to denote the whole body of the faithful under the Gospel, or particular sections of them."
2. "This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel . . . and with our fathers‚Äîalike near to the Angel of the Covenant, from whom he received all the institutions of the ancient economy, and to the people, to whom he faithfully reported the living oracles and among whom he set up the prescribed institutions."
3. "By this high testimony to Moses, Stephen rebuts the main charge for which he was on trial."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'church' means literally 'the people called out,' and is applied with great propriety to the assembly or multitude called out of Egypt, and separated from the world."
2. "It is clear, therefore, that by 'the angel' here, Stephen intends to designate him who was God. The essential idea is, that God did it by a messenger, or by mediators."
3. "The word 'lively,' or 'living,' stands in opposition to what is dead, or useless, and means what is vigorous, efficacious; and in this place it means that the commands were of such a nature, and given in such circumstances, as to secure attention; to produce obedience; to excite them to act for God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Lively. Better, living, as Rev. Compare 1 Peter 2:4, 1 Peter 2:5.


### John Calvin:
1. "This doth greatly augment the greatness of the offense, where Stephen saith that Moses was then with them in the wilderness. For besides that there appeareth here rare goodness and long-sufferance of the Lord, in bearing with them, they make themselves to be without all excuse, whilst that being beset on every side with so many straits, being brought into so great distress; having Moses to be their guide in their journey, and the faithful keeper of their life, they fall away nevertheless treacherously from God."
2. "And this is a general way to establish doctrine, when men teach nothing but that which is commanded them by God. For what man dare make Moses inferior to him, who (as the Spirit affirmeth) ought only to be believed for this cause, because he faithfully unfolded and delivered the doctrine which he had received of God?"
3. "Therefore, it is deadly in respect of men alone. Though Stephen had respect unto a farther thing in this place; for he doth not only speak of the bare commandments, but comprehendeth all Moses‚Äô doctrine, wherein the free promises are included, and so consequently, Christ himself, who is the only life and health of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God‚Äôs church,‚Äô writes Wordsworth here, ‚Äòis not limited to Jud√¶. It was in the wilderness; and there Moses, your great lawgiver, was with it; and remember he died there in the wilderness, and was never permitted to enter the Promised Land, to which you would restrain the favours of God."
2. "The second special instance of Divine favour was his solitary communing with the great covenant Angel, the Almighty Being who, under the name Jehovah (the Eternal One), chose Israel as His peculiar people."
3. "He it was who, from the Eternal of hosts on Sinai, received that sacred law, those living words, the deathless charge which should endure as long as the world endures."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the church in the wilderness (ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ ŒµŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπŒ± ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ ŒµœÅŒ∑Œºœâ). Better rendered 'congregation' here as in Hebrews 2:12 (Psalms 22:22), the people of Israel gathered at Mt. Sinai, the whole nation."
2. "Moses is here represented as receiving the law from an angel as in Hebrews 2:2; Galatians 3:19 (Deuteronomy 33:2, LXX) and so was a mediator (ŒºŒµœÉŒπœÑŒ∑œÇ) or middle man between the angel and the people whereas Jesus is the Mediator of a better covenant (Hebrews 8:6)."
3. "The words from God to Moses are still 'living' today."

### John Gill:
1. "God always had, and will have a church, though that is sometimes in the wilderness."
2. "This has a particular respect to the time when all Israel were encamped at the foot of Mount Sinai, when Moses was not only in the midst of them, and at the head of them; but was with the angel which spake to him in the Mount Sina."
3. "The law, to deliver to the children of Israel; which is called 'the oracles,' because it came from God, and contained his mind and will, and was a sure and infallible declaration of it; and 'lively' ones because delivered 'viva voce', with an articulate voice, and in audible sounds, and because it is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who received the living oracles ‚Äî Every period beginning with, And the Lord said unto Moses, is properly an oracle. But the oracles here intended are chiefly the ten commandments." (Quote 1)
2. "These are termed living, because all the word of God, applied by his Spirit, is living and powerful, Hebrews 4:12, enlightening the eyes, rejoicing the heart, converting the soul, raising the dead." (Quote 2)
3. "Exodus 19:3." (Quote 3)
