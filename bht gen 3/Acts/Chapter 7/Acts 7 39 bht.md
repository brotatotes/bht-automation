# Acts 7:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of Moses and their desire to turn back to the idolatrous ways of Egypt demonstrated the nation's disobedience and lack of honor towards God's appointed servant. They were not merely wishing to physically return to Egypt, but rather succumbing to the allure of Egyptian idolatries in their hearts. Despite proclaiming to honor Moses, their actions showed otherwise as they thrust him away and longed for the indulgent and sinful practices associated with Egyptian worship.
