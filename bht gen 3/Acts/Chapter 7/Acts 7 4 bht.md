2. "Assuredly, it does not mean that all were born precisely at the time when Terah was 70 years of age."

3. "The plain obvious meaning, in spite of the chronological difficulty which it involves, must be maintained that is, after his father‚Äôs death, Abraham removed into Canaan."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In Genesis 11:32 it is stated that Terah died at Haran at the age of 205. There are various explanations of the discrepancy, but no one that seems certain."

### John Gill:
