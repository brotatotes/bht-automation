# Acts 7:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Israelites worshiped idols and offered sacrifices, God was provoked and delivered them up to their own ways, a judicial act rather than simply letting them be. They erroneously believed they were offering sacrifices to God, but in reality, they were offering to idols. This idolatrous worship, called Sabaeanism, involved the adoration of stars. As a consequence of their rebellion, God allowed them to be consumed by their own desires. Therefore, it is crucial to diligently follow God's rule and have genuine, wholehearted devotion in our worship.

### John Calvin:
1. "This example teacheth us to be careful to follow the rule which God hath set down; because, so soon as we are turned even but a little aside from the same, we must needs be carried to and fro with divers dotings, we must needs be entangled in many superstitions, and be utterly drowned in the huge sink of errors."

- Attempt 1 BHT: When the Israelites worshiped idols and offered sacrifices to them, God was provoked and delivered them up to their own ways. This was not a mere act of letting them alone; it was a judicial delivering up. They thought they were offering sacrifices to God, but in reality, they were offering to idols. This form of idolatry, known as Sabaeanism, involved the worship of the stars. The worship of the host of heaven, instead of the Lord of hosts, was a common form of idolatry among the Israelites. Their rebellion and idolatry led God to give them up to their lusts. This example teaches us to be careful to follow God's rule and to seek His guidance, for when we turn aside even a little from His path, we can easily be led into error and trapped in various superstitions. Idolatry is a fertile ground for errors to multiply, and when God's face is turned away from us, we run into grave mistakes. Thus, we must remember that true worship requires a wholehearted devotion and a sincere offering to God.
