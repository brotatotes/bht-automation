### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is customary for idolatrous nations to bear their idols about with them, enclosed in cases or boxes of various sizes, usually very small, as their idols are commonly small."
2. "Moloch - This word comes from the Hebrew word signifying 'king.' This was a god of the Ammonites, to whom human sacrifices were offered."

### John Calvin:
1. "If I shall rip up from the beginning, (O house of Jacob,) how your kindred hath behaved itself toward me; your fathers began to overthrow and corrupt, even in the wilderness, that worship which I had commanded; but you have far passed their ungodliness, for you have brought in an infinite company of gods."
2. "The prophet condemneth expressly the figures [types] which the Jews had made. Why so? Because God will not be worshipped under a visible and external form."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Moloch was the god of the Amorites to whom children were offered as live sacrifices, an ox-headed image with arms outstretched in which children were placed and hollow underneath so that fire could burn underneath."
2. "The star of the god Rephan (œÑŒø Œ±œÉœÑœÅŒøŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ Œ°ŒøŒºœÜŒ±). Supposed to be Coptic for the star Saturn to which the Egyptians, Arabs, and Phoenicians gave worship."
3. "Beyond Babylon (ŒµœÄŒµŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩŒ± ŒíŒ±Œ≤œÖŒªœâŒΩŒøœÇ). The Hebrew and the LXX have 'beyond Damascus.' An adverbial preposition (ŒµœÄ' ŒµŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩŒ± with ŒºŒµœÅŒ∑ understood) used in the old Greek and the LXX with the ablative case and meaning 'beyond.' Here only in the N.T. in quotation from Amos 5:27."
