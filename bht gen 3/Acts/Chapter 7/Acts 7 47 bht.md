# Acts 7:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accusations against Stephen for speaking against the Temple are misguided, as he points out that both the Tabernacle and the Temple were temporary structures, not meant to endure forever. Stephen reminds the people that God cannot be confined to a physical building and must be sought in heaven with faith. Although Solomon built the Temple, it was David who desired it, but was not allowed to construct it. The Temple, like the Tabernacle, served its purpose in its time, but God's worship is not limited to these physical structures.

2. "He reproveth the blockishness of the people, which abused the temple, as if it had had God tied to it." (Commentary)
3. "This was almost a common error in all ages; because men thought that cold ceremonies were sufficient enough for the worship of God.

(Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Temple, against which you accuse me of having spoken blasphemous words, because I pointed out [as did my Master] that it was a building which would not endure for ever, was first built, not by David, the man after Godâ€™s own heart, but by Solomon..."
