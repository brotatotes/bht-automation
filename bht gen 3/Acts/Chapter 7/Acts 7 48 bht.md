# Acts 7:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Solomon's impressive temple does not confine God, for the Most High cannot be contained within earthly spots or structures made by human hands. As Isaiah proclaimed, the Most High does not dwell in temples constructed by man. This truth reveals that God's presence transcends physical buildings, where pagan gods were believed to be confined. Stephen fearlessly preached this revolutionary message, knowing that he would face persecution, just like the prophets before him, who were also put to death for challenging the people's attachment to the temple and its rituals.
