# Acts 7:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The temple built by Solomon was never intended to confine the presence of God, but rather to signify the universal and spiritual nature of Christianity.

- Attempt 1 BHT: What manner of house or temple can confine the all-encompassing presence of God? Stephen, in his discourse, reveals that the temple built by Solomon was not meant to restrict God's dwelling, but rather to symbolize the universality and spirituality of Christianity. As Isaiah declared, Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool. God is not limited by physical structures, for he already fills the heavens and the earth.

May we not be like the stiff-necked and uncircumcised, who resist the Holy Spirit and refuse to receive the truth of God's word.
