# Acts 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The God of glory, whose manifestations were regarded by every Jew as the fundamental ones, called Abraham without even the stepping of a foot. Abraham was promised the land and the child, but he did not receive a permanent possession or residence in that land; he did not even have so much as to set his foot on. The field purchased by Abraham was not a gift from God, but rather a testament to his faith as he bought it, showing that he was a stranger in the land.
