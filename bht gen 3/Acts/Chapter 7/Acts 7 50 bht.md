# Acts 7:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True worship of God is not confined to lavish ceremonies or material offerings. God does not require gold or precious furniture, nor does he desire sacrifices for his own sake. Instead, he desires our devotion and the cultivation of godliness in our lives. We must understand that God seeks us, not our possessions, and that true religion is distinct from merely human inventions. After all, God is the creator of everything - the heavens, the earth, and everything in them - and nothing made by human hands can ever truly be fitting for him.
