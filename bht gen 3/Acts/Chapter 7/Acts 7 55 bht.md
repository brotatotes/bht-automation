## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly, in so far as the vision of Stephen was supernatural, it was not necessary that the material heavens should have been visible to him: but from the words looked up steadfastly into [the] heaven, it would seem that they were."
2. "Why standing and not sitting? that He may shew His attitude of help to the martyr. For of the Father also it is said, ‚ÄòArise, O God.‚Äô"
3. "Stephen, under accusation of blaspheming the earthly temple, is granted a sight of the heavenly temple; being cited before the Sadducee High Priest, who believed neither angel nor spirit, he is vouchsafed a vision of the heavenly HIGH PRIEST, standing and ministering at the Throne, amidst the angels and just men made perfect."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "You who can transfer to canvas such scenes as these, in which the rage of hell grins horribly from men, as they sit condemned by a frail prisoner of their own, and see heaven beaming from his countenance and opening full upon his view‚ÄîI envy you, for I find no words to paint what, in the majesty of the divine text, is here so simply told."
2. "As the sight was witnessed by Stephen alone, the opened heavens are to be viewed as revealed to his bright beaming spirit."
3. "Clearly, to express the eager interest with which He watched from the skies the scene in that council chamber, and the full tide of His Spirit which He was at that moment engaged in pouring into the heart of His heroical witness, till it beamed in radiance from his very countenance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When dangers threaten us, our hope of safety lies in heaven. When people threaten our persons, reputation, or lives, it becomes us to fix our eyes on the heavenly world; and we shall not look in vain."
2. "In the case of Stephen there is every indication of a vision or supernatural representation of the heavenly objects; something in advance of mere 'faith' such as dying Christians now have."
3. "It was such an elevation of view - such a representation of truth and of the glory of God, as to be denoted by the word 'see'; though it is not to be maintained that Stephen really saw the Saviour with the bodily eye."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being [œÖœÄŒ±œÅœáœâŒΩ] ."
2. "Looked up steadfastly."
3. "Standing. Rising from the throne to protect and receive his servant."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must first note this, that Stephen did look unto God, who is the judge of life and death, (turning his eyes from beholding the world,) when he was brought into extreme despair of all things, whilst that there is nothing but death before his eyes."
2. "But as for us, it is no marvel if Christ do not show himself to us, because we are so set and tied upon the earth. Hereby it cometh to pass, that our hearts fail us at every light rumor of danger, and even at the falling of a leaf."
3. "Whence we must gather a general comfort, that God will be no less present with us, if, forsaking the world, all our senses strive to come to him; not that he appeareth unto us by any external vision, as he did to Stephen, but he will so reveal himself unto us within, that we may indeed feel his presence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The scene before his eyes was no longer the council hall at Jerusalem... but he gazed up into the endless courts of the celestial Jerusalem, with its innumerable company of angels, and saw Jesus..." 
2. "This vision of the splendour of the glory of the Shekinah, Stephen might have beheld as he gazed through the window of the judgment hall... it is by no means necessary to assume that he was gazing into the open sky at all." 
3. "Many rationalistic attempts have been made to explain away this vision of Stephen... but such attempts have all signally failed, and only contradict the plain text."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus 'standing' as if he had risen to cheer the brave Stephen."
2. "He is pictured as sitting at the right hand of God (the Session of Christ)."
3. "The Session of Christ as in Matthew 26:64; Mark 16:19; Acts 2:34; Ephesians 1:20; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 1:3."

### John Gill:
1. "Being under the influences of the Spirit of God, and filled with his divine comforts, and strong in the faith of Jesus Christ, [Stephen]...looked up steadfastly to heaven."
2. "[Stephen] saw the glory of God...and Jesus standing on the right hand of God; of that glory which was a Symbol of him."
3. "Jesus being risen from the dead, and ascended on high, was set at the right hand of God, in human nature, and so was visible to the corporeal eye of Stephen; whose visual faculty was so extraordinarily enlarged and assisted."

### John Wesley:
1. "But he looking steadfastly up to heaven, saw the glory of God ‚Äî Doubtless he saw such a glorious representation, God miraculously operating on his imagination..." 
2. "...as on Ezekiel's, when he sat in his house at Babylon, and saw Jerusalem, and seemed to himself transported thither, Ezekiel 8:1-4."
3. "And probably other martyrs, when called to suffer the last extremity, have had extraordinary assistance of some similar kind."
