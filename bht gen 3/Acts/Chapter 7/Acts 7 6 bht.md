### Albert Barnes:
1. "Should sojourn - This means that they would have a 'temporary residence there.' The word is used in opposition to a fixed, permanent home, and is applied to travelers, or foreigners."
2. "All this period was properly the period of 'promise,' not of 'possession.' In this respect the wanderings of Abraham and the oppressions of Egypt came under the same general description."
3. "It should be added, that difficulties of chronology are more likely to occur than any others; and it should not be deemed strange if there are perplexities of this kind found in ancient writings which we cannot explain. It is so in all ancient records; and all that is usually expected in relation to such difficulties is that we should be able to present a 'probable' explanation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Bondage is of itself hard and bitter; but when cruelty of masters is added thereunto, it seemeth to be intolerable."
2. "Let us know that this was done, (not once only,) for God dealeth oftentimes with us thus, so that he may seem contrary to himself."
3. "We must not be discouraged if the like condition be prepared for us at this day. For it is no new thing, neither any unwonted thing, for the Church of God to lie oppressed under tyranny, and to be, as it were, trodden under foot of the wicked."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stephen here quotes the passage to which he had been previously alluding, with a very slight variation, from the LXX." 
2. "It was a touching reminder to his hearers, how mistaken they were to set so superstitious a value on ground of which their great ancestors the friends and specially-protected ones of God had no tenure."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A stranger, foreigner, old word, often in LXX, temporary residence without full rights of citizenship."
2. "One dwelling near one's home, but not of it, so a stranger, foreigner."
3. "In a land not one's own, that belongs to another, alien."

### John Gill:
1. "That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; or 'be a stranger in a land not theirs'; first in the land of Canaan, and then in Egypt, which were possessed by other persons, the natives of them."
2. "And that they should bring them into bondage; that is, the inhabitants of the lands, and particularly Egypt, should bring the seed of Abraham into bondage, as they did; and very hard bondage it was, at least some part of it."
3. "The sojourning and evil entreating of Abraham's seed are not to be confined to the land of Egypt, but belong to other lands, where they were within this time, though that land is more especially intended."

### John Wesley:
1.  Genesis 15:13.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: For four hundred years, Abraham's descendants would dwell as strangers and foreigners in a land that did not belong to them. This period was one of promise, not possession, characterized by temporary residence and oppression. The reference to the sojourn in Egypt was a poignant reminder that their esteemed ancestors, who were dear friends of God, had no secure claim on the land. Bondage in itself is bitter, but when cruelty is added, it becomes unbearable. Yet, we should not be disheartened by such conditions, for it is not uncommon for the Church of God to be oppressed and trodden underfoot. We must remember that God often allows us to face similar trials, even when it seems contrary to His nature.

- Attempt 4 BHT: For four hundred years, Abraham's descendants were strangers and foreigners, dwelling in lands that did not belong to them. Theirs was a temporary residence without full rights of citizenship. This period was a time of promise, not possession, as they experienced the wanderings of Abraham and the oppressions of Egypt. The quotation Stephen references from the LXX serves as a poignant reminder to his listeners that their superstitious attachment to the land was misplaced, for their ancestors had no true claim to it. Just as Abraham's seed sojourned in a strange land and endured bondage, we must not be discouraged if we find ourselves oppressed and trodden underfoot. It is not surprising that God deals with us in this way, for it has been the experience of the Church throughout history.
