### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 7:6, it is mentioned that Abraham's descendants would be sojourners in a foreign land for four hundred years. This means that they would have a temporary residence there, not fully belonging to that land. The time of four hundred years is a rounded number, as seen in Genesis 15:13. It is important to note that the 430 years mentioned by Paul in Galatians 3:17 includes both the period in Canaan and the stay in Egypt.
