# Acts 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Here we see the first instance of Israel's rebellious spirit, as the patriarchs were driven by envy to sell Joseph into Egypt. Stephen uses this example to showcase Israel's opposition to God's purposes, which were ultimately accomplished through Joseph's suffering. Joseph's brothers were dissatisfied with their father's favoritism and envious of Joseph's dreams. However, God was with Joseph, protecting and prospering him even in the midst of his trials. This serves as a reminder that God's presence is not limited to a specific location or circumstance.
