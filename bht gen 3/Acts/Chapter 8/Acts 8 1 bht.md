## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Cannot have happened on the same day, but would take some little time."
2. "It may describe the general dispersion, without meaning that every individual fled."
3. "This word is not without importance, as introducing the next step in the dissemination of the Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was the first persecution against Christians; the first in a series that terminated only when the religion which they wished to destroy was fully established on the ruins of both Judaism and paganism."
2. "They resolved at once to put a period to their progress and success."
3. "Good thus came out of evil; and the first persecution resulted, as all others have done, in advancing the cause which was intended to be destroyed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Death [Œ±ŒΩŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœÉŒµŒπ] . Lit., taking off. See on Luke 23:32.


### John Calvin:
1. "For the wicked are like brute beasts, for when they have once tasted blood they are more desirous thereof, and become more cruel through committing murder."
2. "If the furiousness of our enemies seem at any time to be as it were fallen on sleep, so that it casteth not out flames far, let us know that the Lord provideth for our weakness; yet, let us not in the mean season imagine that we shall have continual truce, but let us be in readiness to suffer sorer brunts, as often as they shall break out suddenly."
3. "Seeing they see the gospel so mightily resisted at Jerusalem, they dare go to no other place until such time as they have broken that first huge heap of straits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And Saul was consenting unto his death. These words were no doubt often heard by Luke from the Paul of later days, for we find them repeated by the missionary apostle himself years after (Acts 22:20)." 
2. "Returning from the scene of blood, Saul, armed with the authority of the jealous Sanhedrim, at once commenced his savage work, and in a very short time the little flourishing Church of Jerusalem was dispersed."
3. "But whether or no they were exposed to danger, they felt they had no right to quit the holy city, which they regarded as their post of duty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul himself will later confess that he felt so (Acts 22:20), coolly applauding the murder of Stephen, a heinous sin (Romans 1:32). It is a gruesome picture." 
2. "On that definite day, that same day as in Acts 2:41." 
3. "It remains a bit of a puzzle why the Pharisees spared the apostles. Was it due to the advice of Gamaliel in Acts 5:34-40? Or was it the courage of the apostles? Or was it a combination of both with the popularity of the apostles in addition?"

### John Gill:
1. "...Saul consented to the death of Stephen, and approved of that barbarous action, is evident from his taking care of the clothes of the witnesses that stoned him; but the word here used signifies not a bare consent only, but a consent with pleasure and delight; he was well pleased with it, it rejoiced his very heart..."
2. "...this violent persecutor was afterwards converted, and became an eminent preacher of the Gospel; and these accounts serve to set off and illustrate the grace of God, which was abundant towards him."
3. "...this persecution was for the furtherance and spread of the Gospel: that upon this dispersion any of them came into France and England, or into any other parts of Europe, is not probable; since the particular places they went to are mentioned; and since they preached to Jew only..."
