Simon, a magician, witnessed the genuine miracles performed by Philip in the name of Christ and became amazed.

He clung to Philip, not only to learn the secret of his power, but also to meet his own selfish desires. Simon's belief was historical and temporary, lacking true faith that resulted in a genuine transformation.
