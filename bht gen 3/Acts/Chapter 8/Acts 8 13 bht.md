# Acts 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon joined Philip and was baptized, but it's important to understand that this act did not result in a genuine change of heart for him. He saw baptism as a way to gain power and manipulate it for his own purposes. However, not all who are baptized receive the grace that baptism symbolizes, highlighting the importance of true faith in Christ. Despite being amazed by Philip's miracles, Simon's wonder didn't lead to a genuine belief in the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He attached himself to Philip, and was baptized like the rest: but we are not, as the sequel shews, to understand that the preaching of the Gospel had made any impression on his heart, but that he accounted for what he saw in his own fashion."
2. "He was convinced, from the works which Philip did, that he was in league with some powerful spirit: he viewed baptism as the initiation into communion with that spirit, and expected that he should be able to make use of the higher power thus gained for his own purposes, and unite this new magical power to his own."
3. "It is plain...that the grace which is figured in Baptism is not conferred on all indifferently...it is for us to know, that we are offered by God in the Sacraments whatever the promises annexed to them contain, and this in no empty words merely, provided we are led by faith to Christ, and seek from Him what the Sacraments promise."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What a light does this throw on what is called Baptismal Regeneration!"
2. "Left without followers, he thinks it best to join the man who had fairly outstripped him, not without a touch of real conviction."
3. "He continued with Philip - 'was in constant attendance upon' him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It might have injured his popularity, moreover, if he had taken a stand in opposition when so many were professing to become Christians."
2. "The fact that many others were becoming Christians; and 'he' went in with the multitude. This is often the case in revivals of religion."
3. "Hypocrites will sometimes be greatly attentive to the external duties of religion, and will be greatly surprised at what is done by God for the salvation of sinners."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Miracles and signs. Lit., signs and powers."
2. "Which were done. The present participle. Lit., are coming to pass."
3. "He was amazed. After having amazed the people by his tricks."

### John Calvin:
1. "He which had boasted himself to be the principal power of God submitteth himself to God, [Christ; ] though he were brought to the knowledge of the gospel, not so much for his own sake alone, as for the whole countryâ€™s sake..."
2. "...there is some mean between faith and mere dissimulation..."
3. "...all men have not that grace given them in baptism, which grace is there figured."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is not necessary to assume that the unhappy man was simply moved by the persuasion that Philip was a greater magician than himself, though no doubt this thought influenced him."
2. "He seems to have accepted the fact that Philipâ€™s Master was in some way or other the long-looked-for Messiah."
3. "Still he only admitted this belief as a matter of history; it had no effect, as we shall see presently, on his life, his heart all the while, though receiving the historic fact, remaining utterly unchanged and hardened."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He wanted this power that Philip had to add to his own pretensions."
2. "So he submitted to baptism, clear proof that baptism does not convey salvation."
3. "The more he watched the more the wonder grew."

### John Gill:
1. "With an historical and temporary faith..."
2. "He was as much amazed at the miraculous performances of Philip..."
3. "...he knew that what he did were only sham performances, and legerdemain tricks."

### John Wesley:
