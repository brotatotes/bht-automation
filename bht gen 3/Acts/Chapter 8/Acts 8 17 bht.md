# Acts 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this account, the apostles Peter and John laid hands on the believers in Samaria, not to assert superiority, but rather to invoke God's blessing through prayer. Laying on of hands was not limited to the apostles and did not guarantee the reception of the Holy Spirit. It served as a sign of God's grace, with its efficacy not dependent on the external ceremony itself. While it is unclear who exactly received this act, it likely included individuals who would play significant roles in proclaiming the gospel. The connection between this practice and confirmation remains inconclusive. The effects and ministry gifts associated with the laying on of hands have now ceased, rendering the ceremony devoid of substance.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 8:17, we see that the apostles Peter and John laid hands on the believers in Samaria, not because they considered themselves superior, but as an act of prayerful invocation to God. This practice of laying on of hands was not limited to the apostles and did not guarantee the reception of the Holy Spirit; rather, it served as a sign and testimony of God's grace. While the laying on of hands followed prayers, it is important to understand that the external ceremony itself did not contain the grace of the Spirit. It is worth noting that the laying on of hands was selective, possibly done on individuals who were to play key roles in proclaiming and witnessing the gospel. Although some have drawn parallels between this practice and confirmation, such connections are inconclusive. Ultimately, it is clear that the effects and extraordinary ministry gifts associated with the laying on of hands have ceased, rendering the ceremony no more than an empty ritual devoid of substance.
