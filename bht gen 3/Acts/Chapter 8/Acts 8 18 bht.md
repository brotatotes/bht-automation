# Acts 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon, having witnessed the power of the Holy Spirit, mistakenly believed that he could obtain this power through external means instead of an inward disposition. This erroneous belief led him to commit the sin of simony, attempting to purchase the ability to bestow the Spirit on others. Simon saw Peter and John as magicians who could sell their tricks for money, failing to understand that the gifts of the Holy Spirit were not commodities that could be bought. This incident gave rise to the term simony, which refers to the buying and selling of church offices and spiritual favors.
