# Acts 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thy gold and thou are equally on the way to corruption. Let thy lot be destruction, and that because thou thoughtest, &c. to acquire. It is the language of mingled horror and indignation, not unlike our Lord's rebuke of Peter himself. Perish with thee, be along with thee unto destruction. The natural meaning of Peter's language is that Simon was on the road to destruction, a warning and almost a curse on him, though there was still room for repentance. It was impious to think of attempting to buy with worthless gold what was of so inestimable value.
