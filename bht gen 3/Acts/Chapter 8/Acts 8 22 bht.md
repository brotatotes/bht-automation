### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Repent... pray... if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven" - This expression of doubt being designed to impress upon him the greatness of his sin, and the need of alarm on his part.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are not to be told to 'wait,' and 'read,' and 'pray,' in the expectation that repentance will be 'given' them. With such helps as they can obtain, they are to 'do the thing.'" 
2. "Prayer will not be acceptable or heard unless the sinner comes 'repenting'; that is, unless he regrets his sin, and 'desires' to forsake it."
3. "They are to be directed to repent; not because they have the 'promise' of forgiveness, and not because they 'hope' to be forgiven, but because sin 'is a great evil,' and because it is 'right' and 'proper' that they should repent, whether they are forgiven or not."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If perhaps. The doubt suggested by the heinousness of the offense."

### John Calvin:
1. "Repent, therefore... no man shall ever be touched with any desire of repentance, save only he which shall believe that God will have mercy upon him; on the other side, despair will always carry men headlong unto boldness."
2. "Therefore, until such time as even the most wicked men do by manifest signs betray themselves to be reprobates, no one of them is to be handled so sharply but that remission of sins is to be set before him."
3. "For the very difficulty doth not a little serve to stir us up; because when we see the thing at hand, we are too careless and sluggish. Therefore Peter doth not terrify Simon, that he may overthrow or trouble all hope of obtaining in his heart, but putting him in sure hope if he shall crave pardon humbly and from his heart, he telleth him only that pardon is hard to be gotten, by reason of the greatness of his offense, to the end he may provoke him unto ferventness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee."
2. "The apostle was ignorant whether the state of heart which prompted such a request as Simon‚Äôs was capable of true repentance, but he doubtless spoke these grave, solemn words to stir up any feelings of remorse which might still be lingering in that hard, covetous heart."
3. "This verse is important taken in connection with John 20:23, 'Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them,' etc., as showing how completely the apostles themselves referred the forgiveness of sins to, and left it in the sovereign power of God, and not to their own delegated power of absolution."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Wickedness (Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒπŒ±œÇ). Only here in Luke's writings, though old word and in LXX (cf. 1 Peter 2:1; 1 Peter 2:16)."
2. "If perhaps (Œµ Œ±œÅŒ±). Si forte. This idiom, though with the future indicative and so a condition of the first class (determined as fulfilled), yet minimizes the chance of forgiveness as in Mark 11:13."
3. "The thought (Œ∑ ŒµœÄŒπŒΩŒøŒπŒ±). Old Greek word from ŒµœÄŒπŒΩŒøŒµœâ, to think upon, and so purpose. Only here in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "For a great piece of wickedness it was, to offer money for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and to imagine, that could be purchased with money."

3. "Though this sin of Simon's was a very heinous one, and came very near unto, and looked very much like the sin against the Holy Ghost, yet it was not the unpardonable one; it might be pardoned by the grace of God, and through the blood of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Repent ‚Äî if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee - Without all doubt if he had repented, he would have been forgiven. The doubt was, whether he would repent."
2. "Thou art in the gall of bitterness ‚Äî In the highest degree of wickedness, which is bitterness, that is, misery to the soul."
3. "in the bond of iniquity - Fast bound therewith."
