# Acts 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In response to Peter's rebuke, Simon's words resemble Pharaoh's hardened heart, displaying a distinct lack of genuine repentance. Simon is focused solely on avoiding punishment and seeks the intercession of the wonder-working men, having no confidence in the power of faith-filled prayer. Although Christianity still maintains a hold on him, his response reveals no personal transformation or remorse for his sins. Simon's request for others to pray for him reflects fear of consequences rather than true repentance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Simon speaks here much as Pharaoh...who yet hardened his heart afterwards." 
2. "It is observable also that he wishes merely for the averting of the punishment." 
3. "The words, 'that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me,' seem remarkably to set forth the mere terror of the carnal man, without any idea of the me becoming another man in thoughts and aims."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Pray ye to the Lord for me." - Peter had urged him to pray for himself: he asks those wonder-working men to do it for him; having no confidence in the prayer of faith, but thinking that those men possessed some peculiar interest with heaven.
2. "Having no confidence in the prayer of faith." -...he asks those wonder-working men to do it for him; having no confidence in the prayer of faith, but thinking that those men possessed some peculiar interest with heaven.
3. "Christianity, as something divine, still retained its hold of him." - While this throws great light on Peter's view of his melancholy case, it shows that Christianity, as something divine, still retained its hold of him.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sinners will often ask others to pray for them, when they are too proud, or too much in love with sin, to pray for themselves."
2. "Simon did not regard this, but looked only to the punishment. He was terrified and alarmed; he sought to avoid future 'punishment,' but he had no alarm about his 'sins.'"
3. "If people expect to be saved, they must pray 'for themselves'; and pray not chiefly to be freed from 'punishment,' but from the 'sin which deserves hell.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Simon answered. Hereby we gather that he did not so take that which Peter had threatened unto him, but that he did consider that his salvation was sought."
2. "Whereas he yieldeth when he is reproved, and being touched with the feeling of his sin, feareth the judgment of God; and that done, flieth unto the mercy of God, and commendeth himself to the prayers of the Church; these are assuredly no small signs of repentance; therefore we may conjecture that he repented."
3. "Nothing is more safe than bidding adieu to uncertain opinions, simply to embrace that which is set down in the Scriptures."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He confesses his fear of punishment, not horror of guilt."
2. "The history of the Acts never refers again to this episode; so, as far as the New Testament records are concerned, we are left in doubt whether or no St. Peterâ€™s solemn words had any effect on the subsequent life and conduct of Simon."
3. "This gifted but deeply erring man seems, after his meeting with the apostles, to have gone on from bad to worse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Simon is thoroughly frightened by Peter's words, but shows no sign of personal repentance or change of heart." 
2. "He wants to escape the penalty for his sin and hopes that Peter can avert it."
3. "Peter had clearly diagnosed his case. He was an unconverted man in spite of his profession of faith and baptism."

### John Gill:
1. "pray ye to the Lord for me...but whether he was serious, and in good earnest in this, is a question;"
2. "he did not take Peter's advice to pray for himself; nor did he declare any repentance for his sin;"
3. "his desire that the apostles would pray for him, might not be from any sense he had of the evil of his sin, but from a slavish fear"

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Acts 8:24, Simon's response to Peter's rebuke reveals his true nature. His words echo Pharaoh's hardened heart, and he only seeks to avoid punishment without any real repentance or change of heart. Simon's lack of confidence in the prayer of faith leads him to ask the wonder-working men to pray for him, as if they have a special connection with heaven. However, his request exposes his fear and alarm about the consequences of his sin, rather than genuine remorse. While Christianity still holds some influence over him, Simon shows no sign of personal repentance or a desire to change his ways.
