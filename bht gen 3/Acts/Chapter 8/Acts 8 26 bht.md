# Acts 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ministration of angels introduces and brings about several occurrences in the beginning of the church. The words will refer to the way: and denote, the way of which I speak to thee is desert. There was such a road, across Mount Hebron, which Philip might take without going to Jerusalem. To go from a city, where his hands had been full of work, so far away on a desert road, could not but be staggering to the faith of Philip. But like Paul, he 'was not disobedient to the heavenly vision'; and like Abram, 'he went out not knowing whither he went'.
