## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "his generation] i.e. the age in which he shall liveâ€” â€˜the wickedness of his contemporaries.â€™"
3. "The fathers, and Bede and some modern Commentators, explain â€˜His generationâ€™ of His eternal Sonship and His miraculous Incarnation. But the Hebrew does not seem to bear this out."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'from prison' may mean, as has been remarked, however, from 'oppression,' and this does not differ materially from 'humiliation'; and in this sense the Septuagint understood it."
2. "His judgment - Justice, a just sentence, was denied him, and he was cruelly condemned."

### John Calvin:
1. "For Christâ€™s judgment was exalted in his humility or casting down; because at such time as he might seem to be cast down and oppressed, the Father maintained his cause." 
2. "Therefore the meaning of the words is, that Christ must first have suffered death, before the Father should exalt him unto the glory of his kingdom; which doctrine must be translated unto the whole body of the Church; because all the godly ought wonderfully to be lifted up with the hand of God, that they be not swallowed up of death." 
3. "But this was done by the wonderful counsel of God, that hell should be a ladder, whereby Christ should ascend into heaven; that reproach should be unto him a passage into life; that the joyful brightness of salvation should appear out of the horror and darkness of the cross; that blessed immortality should flow from the deep pit of death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By an oppressive, unrighteous, judicial proceeding he was dragged to punishment."
2. "Jesus appeared in a form so humble, a man so poor and insignificant, that Pilate, though convinced of His innocence, thought it not worth while to hazard anything to preserve His life."
3. "Its beginning and end were alike incomprehensible best described in His sacred words addressed to His own in that last evening: â€˜I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; again, I leave the world, and go unto the Fatherâ€™."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Justice was withheld, done away with, in his death, as it certainly was in the death of Christ."
2. "It is not clear what the meaning is here either in the Hebrew or the LXX."
3. "The idea is that justice was withheld, done away with, in his death."

### John Gill:
1. "In his humiliation his judgment was taken away."
2. "When he was taken and bound by the Jews, and detained by them a prisoner, and arraigned before the high priest, and at Pilate's bar, and false witnesses suborned, which was his time of humiliation and affliction; when he was reproached, blasphemed, buffeted, and spit, upon, justice was not done him, right did not take place, but was removed from him, and he was treated in a most unjust and unrighteous manner."
3. "His life is taken from the earth, not in a common, but in a judicial way; in the most cruel, barbarous, and unjust manner, in a violent way; though not without his Father's will, and his own consent; and though his life was taken from the earth, he now lives in heaven, and that for evermore."

### John Wesley:
1. "In his humiliation his judgment was taken away â€” That is, when he was a man, he had no justice shown him." 
2. "To take away a person's judgment, is a proverbial phrase for oppressing him."
3. "And who shall declare, or count his generation â€” That is, who can number his seed, Isaiah 53:10; which he hath purchased by laying down his life?"
