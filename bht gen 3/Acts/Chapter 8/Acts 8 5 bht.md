## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And it is probable, that the persecution should have been directed especially against the colleagues of Stephen." 
2. "As the words stand here, seeing that Samaria signifies the district, I should be inclined to believe that Sychem is here also intended." 
3. "It was a place of rising importance, and in after-times eclipsed the fame of its neighbour Samaria."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The city of Samaria... 'It furnished the bridge between Jerusalem and the world'" [BAUMGARTEN].
2. "It was the deacon of that name, who comes next after Stephen in the catalogue of the seven, probably as being the next most prominent" [MEYER].
3. "Besides that the apostles remained at Jerusalem, they would in that case have had no occasion to send a deputation of their own number to lay their hands on the baptized disciples" [GROTIUS].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His coming was attended with a remarkable 'revival of religion.'"
2. "The word translated 'preach' here is not what is used in the previous verse. This denotes to 'proclaim as a crier,' and is commonly employed to denote the preaching of the gospel."
3. "It has been argued that because 'Philip' is said thus to have preached to the Samaritans, that 'therefore' all 'deacons' have a right to preach, or that they are, under the New Testament economy, an 'order' of ministers. But this is by no means clear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Philip. The deacon (Acts 6:5). Not the apostle."

2. "When he saith that Philip preached Christ, he signifieth that the whole sum of the gospel is contained in Christ." 
3. "The sum is this, that Christ doth repair with his grace the world, being destroyed; which cometh to pass when he reconcileth us to the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Philip is called the evangelist [...] partly to the fact that he was the first who, outside the holy city, proclaimed the Evangel, good news of Christ."
2. "Philip appears at once to have gone down to this old city [Samaria], once the capital of the kingdom."
3. "It never regained anything of its old importance until the days of Herod the Great, who restored it to its ancient splendour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Samaria is the name of the city here. This is the first instance cited of the expansion noted in verse Acts 8:4."
