# Acts 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of Samaria, possibly in Sychem, eagerly received the proclamation of the Christ brought by Philip, a Greek Jew, in a remarkable display of unity and attentiveness. This warm welcome can be understood through the parallel with Jesus' previous visit to Sychar, which likely influenced the Samaritans' readiness. The providence of God is apparent in sending Philip, an outsider, to a people who may have been hesitant to listen to a native of Judea. Furthermore, Philip's authentic miracles disrupted the plans of Simon Magus, solidifying the credibility and impact of his message.
