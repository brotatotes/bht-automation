# Acts 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon Magus, a Samaritan from Gitton, was an impostor who practiced sorcery and used his magical arts to deceive and amaze the people. He claimed to be a great power of God, but in reality, he was a fraud exploiting the gullibility of the people. Simon's existence posed a challenge to early Christianity, as he sought to acquire the powers of the believers and spread his superstition. His deceptive influence over the minds of the people made it difficult to uproot the deeply entrenched error he perpetuated.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Simon is stated by Justin Martyr, himself a Samaritan, to have been 'a Samaritan, from a village called Gitton.' But it has struck me that either Justin, or perhaps more probably Josephus, may have confounded Ghittim with Chittim, i.e. Citium in Cyprus."
2. "The history of Simon is full of legend and fable. He is said to have studied at Alexandria, and to have originally been, with the heresiarch Dositheus, a disciple of John the Baptist."
3. "The fathers generally regard him as the founder of Gnosticism: this may be in some sense true: but, from the very little authentic information we possess, it is impossible to ascertain how far he was identified with their tenets."

### John Wesley:
