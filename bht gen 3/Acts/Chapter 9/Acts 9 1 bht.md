# Acts 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Saul, in his blind persecuting rage against the disciples of the Lord, breathed out threats and slaughter. His violent anger and desire for vengeance were like the very air he inhaled and exhaled. The taste of blood and the death of Stephen brought him pleasure, as he reveled in the slaughter of the saints. Yet, through God's wonderful intervention, Saul would go from being a wolf to a sheep, from a persecutor to a shepherd, and would avidly proclaim the Gospel of the grace of God.
