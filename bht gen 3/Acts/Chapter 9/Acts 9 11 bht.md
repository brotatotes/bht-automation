## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are allowed to bear in mind that the ‚Äòstraight street,‚Äô which still extends through Damascus... is the street where Ananias spoke to Saul."
2. "In the long degradation of Christianity in the East, most of such identities must have been lost; and imposture is so easy, that it is hardly possible to cherish the thought that the spots now pointed out can be the true ones."
3. "Never to lose sight of, nor to treat contemptuously at first sight, a local belief."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Beautiful note of encouragement as to the frame in which Ananias would find the persecutor."
3. "He prayeth‚Äî'breathing out' no longer 'threatenings and slaughter,' but struggling desires after light and life in the Persecuted One."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "One indication of conversion to God is real prayer. A Christian may as well be characterized by that as by any single appellation - 'a man of prayer.'"
2. "It is always the attendant of true conviction for sin that we pray. The convicted Sinner feels his danger, and his need of forgiveness."
3. "It is a sufficient indication of the character of any man to say, 'Behold, he prays.' It at once tells us, better than volumes would without this, what is his real character."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Street [œÅœÖŒºŒ∑ŒΩ] . See on Luke 14:21. A narrow street or lane."
2. "Straight. So called from its running in a direct line from the eastern to the western gate of the city."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke showeth that Paul gave himself to prayer those three days."
2. "Christ doth assuredly speak of no short prayer in this place, but he doth rather show that Paul continued in this kind of exercise until he should be more quiet in mind."
3. "But this was the reason why the Lord caused him to wait three days, that he might the more kindle in him an earnest desire to pray."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "the street called 'Straight,' so called from its running in a direct line from the eastern to the western gate."
2. "Tarsus was originally of great extent, and was built on both sides of the river Cydnus, and from its consisting of two distinct wings, divided by the Cydnus, took the plural name 'Tarsoi,' the wings."
3. "This fact of Saul‚Äôs praying seems mentioned by the Lord to reassure Ananias. The 'persecutor' was praying to the God of the 'persecuted.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "So were the narrow lanes or alleys called streets and finally in later Greek the word is applied to streets even when broad."
2. "Most of the city lanes were crooked like the streets of Boston (old cow-paths, people say), but this one still runs 'in a direct line from the eastern to the western gate of the city' (Vincent)."
3. "Since the ancients usually rebuilt on the same sites, it is probable that the line of the street of that name today is the same, though the actual level has been much raised."

### John Gill:
1. "Whether or no this was one of the streets which Benhadad allowed Ahab to make in Damascus, 1 Kings 20:34 cannot be said."
2. "God has no stillborn children; as soon as any are quickened by his grace, they cry unto him; prayer is the breath of a regenerate man, and shows him to be alive."
3. "He who before was breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of Christ, now breathes after communion with Christ and them."

### John Wesley:
1. Behold he is praying ‚Äî He was shown thus to Ananias.
