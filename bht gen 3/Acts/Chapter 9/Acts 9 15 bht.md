# Acts 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus chose Saul (who would later be known as Paul) as a man of His choice, a chosen vessel for His purpose. This concept of being chosen can be found throughout the Bible, illustrating God's sovereign power in election. Saul's selection as a vessel by God was not initially understood, but it was later affirmed to him by the Lord in a vision. Ananias was told to go and do as he was bidden, without questioning, for Saul was indeed a chosen vessel. Paul himself would later acknowledge that he was chosen by God in his writings. The chosen vessel was destined to be an apostle to the Gentiles, communicating the knowledge of Jesus to all nations. This command from the Lord, repeated and accompanied by promises of success, dispelled any doubts and uncertainty. Just as a potter molds clay into vessels of honor or dishonor as it pleases him, so God had chosen Saul to fulfill His great cause. Paul's subsequent life-work and his own words further confirm the significance of his calling and mission as an apostle to the Gentiles.
