## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The recovery of sight is plainly related as miraculous, the consequence of the divinely-appointed laying on of the hands of Ananias." 
2. "And this scaly substance which fell from his eyes was thrown off in the process of the instantaneous healing."
3. "Great honor was here placed upon the sacrament of baptism, inasmuch as not even Saul, who had seen the Lord in special revelation and was an elect vessel, was permitted to dispense with this, the Lordâ€™s appointed way of admission into His Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This shows that the blindness as well as the cure was supernatural."
2. "Substances like scales would not form naturally in so short a time."
3. "And the medical precision of Luke's language here is to be noted."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word Ï‰Ì”ÏƒÎµÎ¹Ì€ hoÌ„sei, 'as it had been,' is designed to qualify the following word. It is not said that scales literally fell from his eyes, but that an effect followed as if scales had been suddenly taken off."
2. "The cure was as sudden, the restoration to sight was as immediate, as if such an interposing substance had been suddenly removed."
3. "The 'blindness' was the natural effect of the light. The 'cure' was by miraculous power. This is evident: Because there were no means used that would naturally restore the sight."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There fell - scales [Î±Ï€ÎµÏ€ÎµÏƒÎ¿Î½ - Î»ÎµÏ€Î¹Î´ÎµÏ‚] ."
2. "The mention of the scales, or incrustations, such as are incidental to ophthalmia, is characteristic of the physician."
3. "We may suppose that Luke had often heard Paul relate how he felt at that moment."

### John Calvin:
1. "He is deprived of the sight of his body three days, that he may begin to see with his mind; for those must become fools, whosoever they be, which seem to themselves wise, that they may attain to true wisdom."
2. "For seeing that Christ is the Sun of righteousness, in seeing without him we see not; it is he also which openeth the eyes of the mind."
3. "He refreshed not his body with meat until his soul had received strength."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whether or not some scaly substance which had spread over his eyes fell off at the command of Ananias, is of little importance. We know after the Lord met him, and appeared to him in the way near Damascus, the eyes of Saul were sightless."
2. "It is surely impossible to entertain for a moment the idea that he was a fanatic, when we read his letters, and his story in these â€˜Acts,â€™ and consider fairly his calmness, his wisdom, his prudence, his humility."
3. "If, then, the conversion of this man be the act neither of a fanatic nor of an impostor, to what was it due? He himself often answers the question: It arose from a miraculous appearance of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke does not say that actual 'scales' fell from the eyes of Saul, but that it felt that way to him as his sight returned, 'as if' (Ï‰Ï‚)."
2. "Luke may have heard Paul tell of this vivid experience."
3. "Apparently by Ananias (Acts 22:16) as a symbol of the new life in Christ already begun, possibly in the pool in the house of Judas as today water is plentiful in Damascus or in Abana or Pharpar (Furneaux), better than all the waters of Israel according to Naaman (2 Kings 5:12)."

### John Gill:
1. "These, as soon as Ananias put his hands upon him, dropped off; which were an emblem and representation of the scales of ignorance, of himself, of sin, of righteousness, of the law, of the Gospel, and of Jesus as the Messiah."
2. "and he received sight forthwith; his corporeal sight, which was an emblem of that spiritual sight he had also received."
3. "And this also may suggest to us, that only enlightened persons are the proper objects of this ordinance; such as have the scales of darkness, ignorance, and unbelief removed from them, and have a spiritual sight and sense of divine things."
