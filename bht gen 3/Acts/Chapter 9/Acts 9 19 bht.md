## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A few days; of quiet, and becoming acquainted with those as brethren, whom he came to persecute as infidels." 
2. "Not to learn from them the gospel, nor was the time longer than to admit of straightway being used."
3. "The same word is used of the whole space (including his preaching in our vv. 20, 21) preceding the journey to Arabia."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When he had received meat, he was strengthened‚Äîfor the exhaustion occasioned by his three days' fast would not be the less real, though unfelt during his struggles." 
2. "Then was Saul certain days with the disciples at Damascus‚Äîmaking their acquaintance, in another way than either he or they had anticipated, and regaining his tone by the fellowship of the saints."
3. "Not certainly in order to learn from them what he was to teach, which he expressly disavows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His conversion has always been justly considered as a strong proof of the Christian religion."
2. "If Paul was sincere; if his conversion was genuine, the Christian religion is true."
3. "The example of Saul does not stand alone. Hundreds and thousands of enemies; persecutors, and slanderers have been changed, and every such one becomes a living witness of the power and truth of the Christian religion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul, in his Galatian Epistle (Acts 1:16-18), tells how, shortly after his conversion, he went into Arabia, then returned to Damascus, and after a space of three years went up to Jerusalem." 
2. "From the time when the word ‚ÄòArabia ‚Äòwas first used by any of the writers of Greece and Rome, it has always been a term of vague and uncertain import."
3. "It is, however, possible that Saul, after the first excitement wrought by his conversion had in some measure passed away, longed for solitude, for a time of meditation before setting out on his great life‚Äôs work."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was strengthened (ŒµŒΩŒπœÉœáœÖŒ∏Œ∑). First aorist passive indicative of ŒµŒΩŒπœÉœáœÖœâ, to receive strength (ŒπœÉœáœÖœÇ), comparatively late verb and here only in the N.T. save Luke 22:43 where it is doubtful."
2. "This clause belongs in sense to verse Acts 9:18."
3. "Some days (Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±œÇ œÑŒπŒΩŒ±œÇ). An indefinite period, probably not long, the early period in Damascus before Saul left for Arabia (Galatians 1:13-24)."

### John Gill:
1. "He was strengthened; in body, being before very weak and feeble; not so much through fatigue of his journey, as through the fear and surprise the appearance of Christ to him, and his words, threw him into."
2. "These disciples, with the new converts afterwards, it is highly probable, formed a church state in Damascus."
3. "Ulid, the prince of the Saracens, took away the temple from the Christians of this place, and dedicated it to Mahomet; after which we hear no more of the church at Damascus."
