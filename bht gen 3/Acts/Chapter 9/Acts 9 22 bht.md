2. "So that Paul tried [found] by experience, that that was most true which he himself affirmeth, that the Scripture is profitable to convince."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul mentions this journey with no obscure hint that to it was to be assigned the reception by him of the Gospel which he preached, and such a reception would certainly give rise to the great accession of power here recorded."
2. "The omission of any mention of this journey here can only arise from one or two causes: (1) Whether Paul himself were the source of the narration or some other narrator, the intentional passing over it as belonging more to his personal history than to that of his ministry. (2) On the supposition of Paul not having been the source of the narrative, the narrator having not been aware of it."
