## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These facts, coupled with that of no Damascene coins of Caligula and Claudius existing (which might he fortuitous, but acquires force when thus combined), make it probable that about this time Damascus, which belonged to the predecessors of Aretas, was granted to Aretas by Caligula."
2. "The other suppositions,‚Äîthat the Ethnarch was only visiting the city (as if he could then have guarded the city to prevent Paul‚Äôs escape),‚Äîor that Aretas had seized Damascus on Vitellius giving up the expedition against him (as if a Roman governor of a province would, while waiting for orders from a new emperor, quietly allow one of its chief cities to be taken from him),‚Äîare in the highest degree improbable."
3. "This would at once solve the difficulty."
