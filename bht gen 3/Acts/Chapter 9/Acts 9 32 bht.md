# Acts 9:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the events of Saul's conversion, Peter undertook a journey to visit the churches that were now in a state of peace after the persecution. Peter traveled throughout all quarters, including Lydda, where the saints resided. It is likely that this journey took place before Saul's arrival, and it was important for Peter to visit these churches and free the early Christian society from the burdens of Mosaic laws and traditions. As the apostles had no permanent abode, it was suitable for them to wander and take charge of various places, such as Peter in Lydda.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: After the events of Saul's conversion, Peter embarked on a journey to visit the churches that had found peace after the persecution. Making his way throughout all quarters, Peter arrived at Lydda, a town situated on the road from Jerusalem to Caesarea Philippi. Once known as Lod, it was now a place where saints, or Christians, were dwelling. This journey of Peter's was separate from the events chronicled earlier and likely took place before Saul's arrival. By visiting these churches, Peter played a crucial role in loosening the Mosaic laws and traditionary customs that had long bound the early Christian society. And it was fitting for the apostles, who had no certain place of abode, to wander as opportunities arose, with Peter taking charge in Lydda.
