# Acts 9:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A certain man, whether a believer or not, had been bedridden for eight years. Peter, unaware of who this man was, visited him and announced a free and unexpected gift. This duration of illness, along with the fact that he had been confined to his bed for the entire time, indicates the detailed narrative of a physician. Aeneas, the Greek name of the man, was likely a Hellenistic Jew. The name itself means worthy of praise, and his condition, being sick with palsy, seemed incurable and robbed him of hope for recovery.
