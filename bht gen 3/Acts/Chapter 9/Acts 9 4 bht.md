3. "There seems to be a considerable emphasis on the word 'me'; 'me', who have been they surety from everlasting; 'me', who hath loved thee and given myself for thee; 'me', who have shed my blood, laid down my life, and died for thee; 'me', who am now at my Father's right hand, interceding for thee, that grace might be bestowed upon thee, the set time being now come."

### John Wesley:
1. He heard a voice â€” Severe, yet full of grace.

- Attempt 1 BHT: In this verse, we witness a remarkable illustration of the solemn question that Jesus posed in Matthew 25:45. There is no doubt that the lack of emphasis on Saul's name as it is repeated, Saul, Saul, adds to the tenderness and weight of the moment. Even years later, when he narrates this scene, Paul does not alter the overpowering words addressed to him. It is truly indescribable to fathom how this question, spoken from the right hand of the Majesty on high to a persecutor like Saul, could be so affecting. It must be noted that Saul's persecution of the disciples was, in fact, persecution of Jesus Himself, for they are one.
