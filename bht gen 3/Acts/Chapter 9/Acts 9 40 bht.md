2. "The graphic minuteness of detail here imparts to the narrative an air of charming reality."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But Peter put them all forth - From the room. See a similar case in Matthew 9:25. Why this was done is not said. Perhaps it was because he did not wish to appear as if seeking publicity. If done in the presence of many persons, it might seem like ostentation." 
2. "Others suppose it was that he might offer more fervent prayer to God than he would be willing they should witness Compare 2 Kings 4:33."
3. "Tabitha, arise - Compare Mark 5:41-42."

### John Calvin:

2. "Kneeling in time of prayer is a token of humility."
3. "This speaking unto the dead corpse was one point of the vehemency whereunto the Spirit of God enforced Peter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus, without any preceding prayer, restored to life the son of the widow of Nain and the little daughter of Jairus. In the case of the raising of Lazarus, His action was still more remarkable; then He thanked the Father beforehand for His power over life and death, so confident was Jesus that, though He had laid aside His robe of glory, He still possessed the keys of death and the grave."
2. "A â€˜new lifeâ€™ had been pointed out to and quietly adopted by the women of the new society... the holy influence which the â€˜sisters in Christâ€™ quietly exercised in the Jerusalem Church... another advance in the position of women as fellow-workers for Jesus, had silently been brought about."
3. "In this little band of faithful women gathered together in Joppa by Dorcas, we see the germ of that more elaborately-constituted body of female workers at Ephesus alluded to twenty-five years later by St. Paul (1 Timothy 5:9). It is, indeed, a specially interesting episode this visit of Peter to Joppa, for it is the first and earliest mention of the noble work left by the Redeemer to be done by Christian women."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Put them all forth (ÎµÎºÎ²Î±Î»Ï‰Î½ ÎµÎ¾Ï‰ Ï€Î±Î½Ï„Î±Ï‚). Second aorist (effective) active participle of ÎµÎºÎ²Î±Î»Î»Ï‰, a rather strong word, perhaps with some difficulty."
2. "With sublime faith like Î¤Î±Î»ÎµÎ¹Î¸Î± ÎºÎ¿Ï…Î¼ of Jesus in Mark 5:41."
3. "She sat up (Î±Î½ÎµÎºÎ±Î¸Î¹ÏƒÎµÎ½). Effective aorist active indicative of Î±Î½Î±ÎºÎ±Î¸Î¹Î¶Ï‰. Often in medical writers, only here in the N.T. and Luke 7:15 where Westcott and Hort have in the margin the uncompounded form ÎµÎºÎ±Î¸Î¹ÏƒÎµÎ½. Vivid picture."

### John Gill:
1. "but Peter put them all forth.... and kneeled down and prayed"
2. "which words were spoken in the name and faith of Christ... for to his power, and not to the apostles, is the following miracle to be ascribed"
3. "and when she saw Peter; whom she might know: she sat up"

### John Wesley:
1. "Who can imagine the surprise of Dorcas, when called back to life?"
2. "For the sake of themselves, and of the poor, there was cause of rejoicing, and much more, for such a confirmation of the Gospel."
3. "Yet to herself it was matter of resignation, not joy, to be called back to these scenes of vanity."
