## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The question, 'What shall I do, Lord?' or, 'Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?' indicates a state of mind singularly interesting."
2. "As a consequence of this, that not only all his religious views, but his whole religious character, had been an entire mistake; that he was up to that moment fundamentally and wholly wrong."
3. "He had absolute confidence in Him who had so tenderly arrested him in his blind career, and was ready both to take in all His teaching and to carry out all His directions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not remarkable that a sinner trembles when he sees his guilt and danger."
2. "The sinner follows his own; the first act of the Christian is to surrender his own will to that of God, and to resolve to do what he requires."
3. "Those who are converted, in however striking a manner it may be, should be willing to seek the counsel of those who are in the church before them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Trembling and astonished. The best texts omit.


### John Calvin:
1. "For doubtless the Lord doth not so bring us into the way, that he leaveth us either before we begin our course, or in the midst thereof; but he bringeth us unto the very mark by little and little."
2. "For if Christ made Paul subject to the teaching of a common disciple, which of us can grudge to hear any teacher, so that he be appointed by Christ, that is, he declare himself to be his minister in deed?"
3. "Therefore we must always use this moderation, that we hear God alone in Christ, and Christ himself alone, yet as he speaketh by his ministers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The best MSS. do not have 'trembling and astonished,' and 'What wilt thou have me to do, Lord?' The Textus Receptus put these words in here without the authority of a Greek codex." 
2. "It shall be told thee (Î»Î±Î»Î·Î¸Î·ÏƒÎµÏ„Î±). Future passive indicative of Î»Î±Î»ÎµÏ‰. It is hardly likely that Luke records all that Jesus said to Saul, but more was to come on his arrival in Damascus."
3. "What (Î¿Ï„). Rare in Koine use of this indefinite neuter relative in an indirect question, the only example in the N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 731). Human agents like Ananias can finish what Jesus by supernatural manifestation has here begun in Saul."

### John Gill:
1. "So persons under first convictions 'tremble' at the sight of their sins, which rise up like so many ghosts, and stare them in the face, and load their consciences with guilt."
2. "They are 'astonished' at their own wickedness and vileness, which they had no conception of before; at the sparing mercy and forbearance of God, who has continued them in being, and not sent them to hell."
3. "He was willing to do anything he should him to, whereby he might make satisfaction for the injury he had done him, and by which he might be saved; for he was still upon the covenant of works, as persons under first convictions commonly are."

### John Wesley:
1. "Admirable condescension! that the Lord deals with us by men, like ourselves."
