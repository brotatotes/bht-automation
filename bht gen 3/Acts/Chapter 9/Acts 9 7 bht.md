# Acts 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seemingly discrepant accounts of the event in Acts 9:7 are actually instructive when compared. The absence of any attempt to revise these apparent inconsistencies confirms the authenticity of the narrative. While the companions of Saul heard the voice that spoke to him, they did not understand the words. They were speechless, astounded by what they saw and heard, and rooted to the spot. The miracle was meant to impress upon Paul alone what he must do, while the others only received an indefinite impression.

2. "...these men heard the voice that spake to Saul, but heard not the articulate words."
3. "Apparent discrepancies like these, in the different narratives of the same scene in one and the same book of Acts, furnish the strongest confirmation both of the facts themselves and of the book which records them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'speechless' properly denotes 'those who are so astonished or stupefied as to be unable to speak.'"

3. "Paul alone is taught what he must do."

### Philip Schaff:
