# Acts 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Saul's eyes were opened, he found himself blind, his vision gone after encountering the glorious Person of the Lord Jesus. This temporary blindness was not a punishment, but rather a proof of the reality of his encounter. Overwhelmed by the intense light, Saul had involuntarily closed his eyes to protect them from the glare and, on opening them again, discovered his loss of sight. Helpless and trembling, Saul sought refuge in the house of Judas, a stark contrast to his former role as a victorious persecutor.
