# Colossians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Christ, we have our redemption and the remission of our sins, the release and payment of a ransom. The Gnostics distorted the concept of redemption, but it is clear that it is obtained through the blood of Christ, which expiated all the sins of the world. Through this redemption, we are also delivered from the law, its curse, and bondage. Reconciliation is solely achieved through the sacrifice of Christ, debunking the idea of satisfactions. Forgiveness is the beginning of redemption, and the completion is found in the resurrection of Christ.
