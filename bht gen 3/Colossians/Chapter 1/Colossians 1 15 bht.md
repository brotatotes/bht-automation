## BHT:
Paul declares that Christ is the image of the invisible God and the first-born of all creation. This means that Christ is not just a resemblance to God, but the very stamp of God the Father Himself.

Through Christ, we are able to see and know God, as He is the perfect manifestation of the invisible God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the image of the invisible God"
2. "the first-born of all creation"
3. "Christ was not only first-born of His mother in the world, but first-begotten of His Father, before the worlds"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They who have experienced in themselves 'redemption,' know Christ in the glorious character here described, as above the highest angels." 
2. "Image' (eicon) involves 'likeness' (homoiosis); but 'likeness' does not involve 'image.' 'Image' always supposes a prototype, which it not merely resembles, but from which it is drawn: the exact counterpart, as the reflection of the sun in the water: the child the living image of the parent." 
3. "English Version might seem to favor Arianism, as if Christ were a creature. Translate, 'Begotten (literally, 'born') before every creature,' as the context shows, which gives the reason why He is so designated."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that he represents to mankind the perfections of God, as an image, figure, or drawing does the object which it is made to resemble."
 
2. "In what Christ is, and has done in the works of creation and redemption, we have a fair and full representation of what God is."
3. "He does not say that, in all respects, he resembled the first-born in a family; nor does he say that he himself was a creature, for the point of his comparison does not turn on these things, and what he proceeds to affirm respecting him is inconsistent with the idea of his being a created being himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Image is more than likeness which may be superficial and incidental. It implies a prototype, and embodies the essential verity of its prototype." 
2. "The first-born of all creation... implies sovereignty. He is exalted above all thrones, etc., and all things are unto Him, as they are elsewhere declared to be unto God."
3. "The true sense is, born before the creation. Compare before all things, ver. 17."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls him the image of the invisible God, meaning by this, that it is in him alone that God, who is otherwise invisible, is manifested to us."
2. "That, therefore, we may not receive anything but what is solid, let us take notice, that the term image is not made use of in reference to essence, but has a reference to us; for Christ is called the image of God on this ground â€” that he makes God in a manner visible to us."
3. "The first-born of every creature. The reason of this appellation is immediately added â€” For in him all things are created, as he is, three verses afterwards, called the first-begotten from the dead, because by him we all rise again."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The image of the invisible God. This indicates the relation to God, immanent and permanent."
2. "The firstborn of (or, â€˜beforeâ€™) every creature (or, â€˜all creationâ€™). 'The first born with respect to every creature; He was born before every creature.'"
3. "While His priority in time shows His independence of creation, creation is not independent of Him, as He is here described."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is the very stamp of God the Father as he was before the Incarnation and is now."
2. "But the one who sees Jesus has seen God."
3. "Paul is here refuting the Gnostics who pictured Christ as one of the aeons by placing him before 'all creation' (angels and men)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not of deity, though the fulness of it dwells in him; nor of himself, though he is the true God, and eternal life; nor of the Spirit, who also is God, and the Spirit of the Son; but the Father, called 'God', not to the exclusion of the Son or Spirit, who are with him the one God." 
2. "But the Father is said to be invisible, because he did not appear to Old Testament saints; as his voice was never heard, so his shape was never seen; he never assumed any visible form; but whenever any voice was heard, or shape seen, it was the second person that appeared, the Son of God, who is here said to be his 'image'."
3. "Also, this may be understood of him as Mediator, in whom, as such, is a most glorious display of the love, grace, and mercy of God, of his holiness and righteousness, of his truth and faithfulness, and of his power and wisdom."

### John Wesley:
1. "By describing the glory of Christ, and his pre-eminence over the highest angels, the apostle here lays a foundation for the reproof of all worshippers of angels."
2. "The image of the invisible God â€” Whom none can represent, but his only begotten Son; in his divine nature the invisible image, in his human the visible image, of the Father."
3. "The first begotten of every creature â€” That is, begotten before every creature; subsisting before all worlds, before all time, from all eternity."
