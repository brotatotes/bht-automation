## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "and He Himself (emphatic, His own person) is... before (in time; bringing out one side of the primo-genitive above: not in rank, as the Socinians), all things" (Colossians 1:17) 
2. "...in Him (as its conditional element of existence, see above on 'in him,' ver. 16) the universe subsists ( 'keeps together,' 'is held together in its present state:')" (Colossians 1:17)
3. "Not only did He call it out of nothing into being, but He also holds it together now." (Colossians 1:17)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And He Himself (the great HE) is (implying divine essential being) before all things."
2. "Since He is before all things, He is before even time, that is, from eternity."
3. "The Son of God is the Conserver, as well as the Creator of all things."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair and proper meaning of the word 'before' is, that he was before all things in the order of existence."
2. "It is equivalent to saying that he was eternal - for he that had an existence before anything was created, must be eternal."
3. "If this be the proper interpretation, then it is the ascription to Christ of infinite power - for nothing less could be sufficient to uphold the universe; and of infinite wisdom - for this is needed to preserve the harmonious action of the suns and systems of which it is composed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He emphasizes the personality, is the preexistence."
2. "Christ not only creates, but maintains in continuous stability and productiveness."
3. "He, the Wisdom of God, holds the universe in tune together."

### John Calvin:
1. "He places angels in subjection to Christ, that they may not obscure his glory." 
2. "He sustains them by his power, and upholds them in their condition." 
3. "He places the Son of God in the Highest seat of honor, that he may have the pre-eminence over angels as well as men, and may bring under control all creatures in heaven and in earth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He (emphatic) is before all things. â€˜Beforeâ€™ in time, preexistent to â€˜all things,â€™ not simply â€˜all beings.â€™ He did not become thus preexistent, but â€˜isâ€™ prior in time."
2. "And in him all things subsist, more literally, â€˜stand together.â€™ This is not a repetition of the first clause of Colossians 1:16: there the fact of creation is mentioned; here a more permanent relation is set forth. He keeps in organic permanence what was created in Him, through Him and unto Him; comp. Hebrews 1:3."
3. "â€˜Christ is the Living Centre, to which all things in creation converge, the Divine Keystone in the arch of the universe, on which the whole fabric leansâ€™ (Chrysostom)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The precedence of Christ in time and the preeminence as Creator are both stated sharply."
2. "Christ is the controlling and unifying force in nature."
3. "The Son of God's love is the Creator and the Sustainer of the universe which is not evil."

### John Gill:
1. "He is before all things...he must needs be, since they are all made by him; ...and therefore must be God, who is from everlasting to everlasting."
2. "He upholds all things by the word of his power...the whole frame of nature would burst asunder and break in pieces, was it not held together by him."
3. "All the affairs of Providence relating to all creatures are governed, directed, and managed by him, in conjunction with the Father and the blessed Spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he is before all things â€” It is not said, he was: he is from everlasting to everlasting."
2. "And by him all things consist â€” The original expression not only implies, that he sustains all things in being, but more directly, All things were and are compacted in him into one system."
3. "He is the cement, as well as support, of the universe. And is he less than the supreme God?"
