## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "Grace&c." 
3. "Thanksgiving for the faith, hope, and love of the Colossians, announced to him by Epaphras."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fatal to vegetation, these incrustations spread like a stony shroud over the ground. Gleaming like glaciers on the hillside, they attract the eye of the traveler at a distance of twenty miles, and form a singularly striking feature in scenery of more than common beauty and impressiveness."
2. "To the saints. A mode of address which characterizes Paul 's later epistles. The word is to be taken as a noun, and not construed as an adjective with faithful brethren: to the holy and faithful brethren."
3. "Our Father. The only instance in which the name of the Father stands in the opening benediction of an epistle without the addition and Jesus Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the inscription of the epistle, in which the persons wrote unto are described as 'saints', or holy men; not by birth, for all are unholy and unclean by nature; nor by baptism, for that neither takes away sin, nor gives grace; nor merely externally, by an outward reformation; but by separation, being by an act of eternal election set apart for God, for holiness, and happiness."
2. "And as 'faithful' ones; true and sincere believers in Christ, constant and persevering in the faith of him; faithful to the Gospel, and their profession of it, and to Christ, whose name they bore, and to one another, to whom they stood in the relation of brethren."
3. "They were saints in him; they were chosen in him, and sanctified in him their head, and received all their holiness from him; they were brethren in him the firstborn of them; his God being their God, and his Father their Father; and had their faith and faithfulness from him, as well as it was exercised towards, and on him."

### John Wesley:
1. The saints-This word expresses their union with God. And brethren â€” This, their union with their fellow-Christians.
