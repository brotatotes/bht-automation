## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostleâ€™s meaning clearly is, that by the blood of Christâ€™s Cross, reconciliation with God has passed on all creation as a whole, including angelic as well as human beings, unreasoning and lifeless things, as well as organized and intelligent."
2. "Every such nearer approach to Him may without violence to words be so described, in comparison with that previous greater distance which now seems like alienation."
3. "All creation subsists in Christ: all creation therefore is affected by His act of propitiation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Scripture phrase, 'God reconciles man to Himself,' implies that He takes away by the blood of Jesus the barrier which God's justice interposes against man's being in union with God."
2. "All creation subsists in Christ, all creation is therefore affected by His propitiation: sinful creation is strictly 'reconciled' from its enmity; sinless creation, comparatively distant from His unapproachable purity, is lifted into nearer participation of Him, and in this wider sense is reconciled."
3. "Sin introduced discord not only on earth, but also in heaven, by the fall of demons; it brought into the abodes of holy angels, though not positive, yet privative loss, a retardation of their highest and most perfect development, harmonious gradation, and perfect consummation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By his blood shed on the cross. That blood, making atonement for sin, was the means of making reconciliation between God and man." 
2. "It can mean then, only, that he had executed a plan that was adapted to this; that if fairly and properly applied, the blood of the cross was fitted to secure entire reconciliation between heaven and earth."
3. "The only effect of the blood of the atonement on the 'things' of heaven in effecting the reconciliation is, to render it consistent for God to be at peace with sinners."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Having made peace...marks peace-making and reconciliation as contemporaneous." 
2. "The compounded preposition ajpo gives the force of back, hinting at restoration to a primal unity."
3. "All things [Ï„Î± Ï€Î±Î½Ï„Î±]...the whole universe, material and spiritual."

### John Calvin:
1. "He declares, accordingly, that we are blessed through Christ alone, inasmuch as he is the bond of our connection with God, and, on the other hand, that, apart from him, we are most miserable, because we are shut out from God."
2. "For it was necessary that the Son of God should be an expiatory victim, and endure the punishment of sin, that we might be the righteousness of God in him."
3. "Hence it is with propriety that Paul declares, that the grace of Christ does not reside among mankind alone, and on the other hand makes it common also to angels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Through Christ the entire universe is reconciled with God" (Meyer).
2. "The absolute totality of created things shall be restored into its primal harmony with its Creator" (Ellicott).
3. "Apart from His Person there is no efficacy in the shedding of blood" (commentary).

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This double compound (Î±Ï€Î¿, ÎºÎ±Ï„Î± with Î±Î»Î»Î±ÏƒÏƒÏ‰) occurs only here, verse Colossians 1:22; Ephesians 2:16, and nowhere else so far as known."
2. "The use of Ï„Î± Ï€Î±Î½Ï„Î± (the all things, the universe) as if the universe were somehow out of harmony reminds us of the mystical passage in Romans 8:19-23 which see for discussion."
3. "This for the benefit of the Docetic Gnostics who denied the real humanity of Jesus and as clearly stating the causa medians (Ellicott) of the work of reconciliation to be the Cross of Christ, a doctrine needed today."

### John Gill:
1. "Reconciliation supposes a former state of amity and friendship, and in such an one man was originally with God; and a breach of that friendship, which was made and issued in real enmity in the heart of man; and also a restoration to friendship again." 
2. "Reconciliation...is a reconciliation of [people] not to the love of God, which his elect always shared in, but to the justice of God, offended by the transgression of a righteous law...it is indeed properly a reconciliation, atonement, and satisfaction for their sins, and so of their persons, and whereby all the perfections of God are reconciled to and agree with each other in the salvation of such sinners."
3. "This peace [made by Christ] he has made by his 'blood', that is, by the shedding of it, by his death as a sacrifice, which he underwent on the cross; partly to denote the shame, and chiefly to signify the curse he endured in the room of his people: all which shows the malignant nature of sin, the strictness of justice, and that peace is made in a way of full satisfaction, is upon honorable terms, will be lasting, as it is joyful, being attended with a train of blessings."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through the blood of the cross â€” The blood shed thereon."
2. "Whether things on earth â€” Here the enmity began: therefore this is mentioned first."
3. "Or things in heaven â€” Those who are now in paradise; the saints who died before Christ came."
