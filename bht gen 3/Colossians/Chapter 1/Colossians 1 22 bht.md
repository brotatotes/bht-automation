# Colossians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reconciliation with God is solely attributed to Jesus Christ, who took on flesh to atone for our fallen state. Through His sacrificial death on the cross, believers experience complete purity and separation unto God, eradicating all sins and bringing us into a state of unblemished sanctification. This sanctification, already begun in us, will be perfected upon Christ's return. The words holy, without blame, and unreprovable beautifully depict the complete purity and separation unto God that believers enjoy through Christ's work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He found occasion enough to write of the reconciliation as he does here and ver. 20, in the angel-following of his readers, in which they ascribed reconciling mediatorship with God partly to higher spiritual beings, who were without a body of flesh."
2. "The question whether inherent or imputed sanctity is here meant, is best answered by remembering the whole analogy of St. Paulâ€™s teaching, in which it is clear that progressive sanctification is ever the end, as regards the Christian, of his justification by faith."
3. "It is... a passage worthy of observation, testifying that no gratuitous righteousness is conferred upon us in Christ, but that we must be born again by the Spirit to the obedience of righteousness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Angels who have not a 'body of flesh' are not in any way our reconciling mediators, as your false teachers assert, but He, the Lord of angels, who has taken our flesh, that in it He might atone for our fallen manhood."
2. "Flesh is the sphere in which His human sufferings could have place."
3. "Irreproachable (the Greek for the second word, one who gives no occasion for his being brought to a law court) is in relation to the world without."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The death of his body, or his death in making an atonement, has been the means of producing this reconciliation."
2. "No means ever used to produce reconciliation between two alienated parties has had so much tenderness and power as those which God has adopted in the plan of salvation."
3. "When the redeemed enter heaven, all their sins will have been taken away; not a spot of the deep dye of inquiry will remain on their souls."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fundamental idea of the word is separation unto God and from worldly defilement."
2. "Unblamable, Rev. much better, without blemish."
3. "The simple ejnwpion before, is used in the former sense, Luke 12:9."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Son of God had put on the same nature with us, that he took upon him this vile earthly body, subject to many infirmities, that he might be our Mediator." 
2. "For the entire blessing of redemption consists mainly in these two things, remission of sins, and spiritual regeneration."
3. "This holiness is nothing more than begun in us, and is indeed every day making progress, but will not be perfected until Christ shall appear for the restoration of all things."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the body of his flesh. Historically and locally 'in' the human body of the Son of God made flesh, the reconciliation was effected."
2. "His sacrificial death on the cross was the means of reconciliation."
3. "Holy and without blame and unreprovable, i.e., unaccusable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Now" being not at the present moment, but in the present order of things in the new dispensation of grace in Christ. 
2. "He reconciled" - First aorist (effective, timeless) active indicative. 
3. "These three adjectives give a marvellous picture of complete purity (positive and negative, internal and external)."

### John Gill:
1. "These words express the means by which that reconciliation was made, which in the virtue and efficacy of it was applied particularly to these Colossians at their conversion whereby their minds were actually reconciled to God." 
2. "[Christ's body] is so called either to distinguish it from his mystical and spiritual body the church... or from his glorious and immortal body, as now raised and exalted at God's right hand; and to denote the truth of his human body, that it was a real fleshly body, consisting of flesh and blood as ours does... and also to signify the infirmity and mortality of it."
3. "This presentation of the saints by Christ is... in this present state, they being considered by him both as sanctified and as justified; he taking delight in the graces of his Spirit, and the exercise of them on himself, though imperfect, and in them as clothed with his spotless righteousness, in which they are perfectly comely, all fair, and without spot."

### John Wesley:
1. "By the body of his flesh â€” So distinguished from his body, the church. The body here denotes his entire manhood."
2. "Through death â€” Whereby he purchased the reconciliation which we receive by faith."
3. "Unreprovable â€” As to your neighbour."
