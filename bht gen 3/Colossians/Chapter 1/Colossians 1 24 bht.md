# Colossians 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, as every suffering saint of God fills up, in his place and degree, the afflictions of Christ, for the body of Christ. Believers should regard their sufferings less in relation to themselves as individuals, and more as parts of a grand whole, carrying out God's perfect plan. Paul attaches no atoning value to his own sufferings, but sees them as necessary for the Church's example, perfecting of the saints, and increasing their reward.
