## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mystery which hath been hidden from the ages and the generations."
2. "But now was manifested unto His saints."
3. "All believers, not merely as in Eph. iii. 5, where the reference is different, the Apostles and prophets."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mystery, once hidden, now revealed, is redemption for the whole Gentile world, as well as for the Jews, 'Christ in you (Gentiles) the hope of glory.'"
2. "The 'ages' are the vast successive periods marked by successive orders of beings and stages of creation."
3. "The Spirit by Paul presciently, in opposition to Gnostic error already beginning, teaches, that the mystery of redemption was hidden in God's purposes in Christ, alike from the angelic beings of the pre-Adamic 'ages,' and from the subsequent human 'generations.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Even the mystery - To make that mystery fully known."
2. "The great doctrine that salvation was to be proclaimed to all mankind, Paul says, had been concealed for many generations."
3. "Paul says that he regarded himself as specially called to make this truth known, as far as possible, to mankind."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here we have a commendation of the gospel â€” that it is a wonderful secret of God."
2. "For the first is â€” that whereas God had, previously to the advent of Christ, governed his Church under dark coverings, both of words and of ceremonies, he has suddenly shone forth in full brightness by means of the doctrine of the gospel."
3. "Lest any one should turn aside to another meaning the term mystery, as though he were speaking of a thing that was still secret and unknown, he adds, that it has now at length been published, that it might be known by mankind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even the mystery, etc. Comp. Ephesians 1:9; Ephesians 3:4-9. Here as there the reference is not merely to the salvation of the Gentiles, but to Redemption in Christ as belonging to the eternal plan of God."
2. "Hath been hid from the ages and from the generations. This particular phrase is peculiar (but comp. Ephesians 3:5). 'Beside the ages of the world, the generations of men living in them are brought into special prominence, and thus the concealment from the beginning of human history is marked' (Braune)."
3. "But now it hath been made manifest. 'Now,' in this present dispensation, it was made manifest. The tense points to the single past act, but our English idiom requires 'hath been.' In Ephesians 3:5 the contrast is one of degree; here it is absolute. Moreover the change of construction (not indicated in the E. V.) sharpens the contrast. Since 'made manifest' is more general than 'revealed,' or, 'made known,' it is properly referred to the entire historical manifestation, which took place in different ways, partly by revelation, partly by preaching and exposition, and partly by all combined (Meyer). This is favored by the mention of Paulâ€™s preaching (Colossians 1:28)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Gnostics talked much of 'mysteries.' Paul takes their very word and uses it for the gospel." 
2. "Which hath been hid." 
3. "But now it hath been manifested."

### John Gill:
1. "the Gospel, called 'the mystery', as it often is; because it contains things, which, though revealed, are mysteries to a natural man"
2. "the Gospel mystery in general which was first hid in the heart of God, in his thoughts and purposes, in his counsel and covenant, and in his Son, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge"
3. "now under the Gospel dispensation, since the coming of Christ; there is an external revelation of the Gospel by him, more clearly, by whom grace and truth came, called the revelation of Christ; and an internal revelation of it by his Spirit"

### John Wesley:
1. The mystery â€” Namely, Christ both justifying and sanctifying gentiles, as well as Jews. Which hath been comparatively hid from former ages and past generations of men.
