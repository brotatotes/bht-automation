## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The facts which he heard, not the fact of his hearing, were the ground of his thanksgiving." 
2. "Your faith in Christ Jesus." 
3. "The love which ye have towards all the saints."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Having heard." The language implies that he had only heard of, and not seen, them.
2. "Compare Romans 1:8, where like language is used of a Church which he had not at the time visited."
3. "Love . . . to all‚Äîthe absent, as well as those present."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This does not prove that Paul had never been at Colossae, or that he did not establish the church there, for he uses a similar expression respecting the church at Ephesus Ephesians 1:15, of which he was undoubtedly the founder."
2. "The meaning is, that he had heard of their faith at that time, or of their perseverance in faith and love."
3. "Nothing could be more acceptable information respecting them to one who himself so ardently loved the church; and nothing could have furnished better evidence that they were influenced by the true spirit of religion; compare 1 John 3:14."

### John Calvin:
1. "Gifts of God that are so excellent ought to have such an effect upon us as to stir us up to love them wherever they appear."
2. "He employs the expression, love towards the saints, not with the view of excluding others, but because, in proportion as any one is joined to us in God, we ought to embrace him the more closely with special affection."
3. "True love, therefore, will extend to mankind universally, because they all are our flesh, and created in the image of God, but in respect of degrees, it will begin with those who are of the household of faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having heard. 'After hearing,' rather than, 'since we heard,' or, 'because we heard.'" 
2. "Your faith in Christ Jesus. He is the sphere and object of the faith; comp. Ephesians 1:15." 
3. "The love which ye have to all the saints. The Italics of the E. V. are unnecessary, since the better supported reading gives 'which ye have,' thus emphasizing the tact that they possess it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Aorist active participle of Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÖœâ of antecedent action to ŒµœÖœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩ." 
2. "No article is needed before ŒµŒΩ as it is a closely knit phrase and bears the same sense as the objective genitive in Galatians 2:16 (Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖ, by faith in Christ Jesus)." 
3. "There is a real distinction here between ŒµŒΩ (sphere or basis) and ŒµŒπœÇ (direction towards), though they are often identical in idea."

### John Gill:
1. "Their faith in Christ...their soundness and steadfastness in it, and their sincere and constant profession of it."
2. "The grace of love itself, which is a fruit of the Spirit implanted in regeneration, and is an evidence of the new birth."
3. "The effects of love...in serving one another in love, by relieving in necessity, sympathizing in distress, praying with and for one another."
