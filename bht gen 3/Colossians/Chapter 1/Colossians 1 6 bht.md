## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Seeing that men are most confirmed by having many companions in their tenets, he adds as in all the world. It every where prevails: it every where stands firm."
2. "The expression to all the world is no hyperbole, but the repetition of the Lordâ€™s parting command. Though not yet announced to all nations, it is present in all the world,â€”the whole world being the area in which it is proclaimed and working."
3. "Bearing fruit and increasing, as also [it doth] in you, from the day when ye heard (it) (the Gospel), and came to know the grace of God in truth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Which is present among you, that is, which has come to, and remains with, you." 
2. "The Gospel...is bearing fruits of righteousness, and growing in numbers of its converts...throughout, all the world." 
3. "Came to know; became fully experimentally acquainted with the grace of God in its truth, and with true knowledge."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It has not been confined to the Jews, or limited to the narrow country where it was first preached, but has been sent abroad to the Gentile world."
2. "The gospel was not without effect wherever it was preached. The same results were observable everywhere else as in Colossae, that it produced most salutary influences on the hearts and lives of those who received it."
3. "Ever since they had heard the gospel it had been producing among them abundantly its appropriate fruit, and that the same thing had also characterized it wherever it had been dispensed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Has come and is present."
2. "The best texts omit and. Some join esti is with the previous clause, as it is in all the world, and take bearing fruit as a parallel participle. So Rev."
3. "Not like those plants which exhaust themselves in bearing fruit. The external growth keeps pace with the reproductive energy" (Lightfoot).

### John Calvin:
1. "The faith of it does not, it is true, depend on its success, as though we should believe it on the ground that many believe it. Though the whole world should fail, though heaven itself should fall, the conscience of a pious man must not waver, because God, on whom it is founded, does nevertheless remain true."
2. "Is it a trivial or common aid to faith, to see accomplished before our eyes what the Prophets long since predicted as to the extending of the kingdom of Christ through all countries of the world?"
3. "It is of great importance that faithful ministers should be distinguished from the less upright. For it is not enough to hold the term gospel unless we know that this is the true gospel - what was preached by Paul and Epaphras."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This need not be limited to the Roman world, or the chief places, nor be taken literally. â€˜The expression is no hyperbole, but the repetition of the Lordâ€™s command. Though not yet announced to all nations, it is present in all the world." 
2. "The former word refers to the faith, the love, the Christian virtues, which the gospel produces in the internal and external life; the latter to the extension and the multiplication of its adherents."
3. "'The grace of God' forms the contents of the gospel; by hearing the gospel they came to know this grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In all the world (ÎµÎ½ Ï€Î±Î½Ï„ Ï„Ï‰ ÎºÎ¿ÏƒÎ¼Ï‰). A legitimate hyperbole, for the gospel was spreading all over the Roman Empire."
2. "The growing and the fruit-bearing go on simultaneously as always with Christians (inward growth and outward expression)."
3. "They fully apprehended the grace of God and should be immune to the shallow vagaries of the Gnostics."

### John Gill:
1. "And a wonderful instance of the free grace of God this was; they did not seek, inquire for, and go after the Gospel, but it came to them; and so Christ was found of them by it, who sought him not, and made manifest in his person, grace, and righteousness to them that asked not after him." 
2. "The Gospel is always in one place or another, and will be to the end of the world; but it is not always in the same place; but as yet it was not removed from Colosse; it was still with them in the external ministry of it, and it remained in their hearts in the powerful and comfortable experience of it." 
3. "They hearkened to it externally, and a divine power going along with it, giving them hearing ears, and understanding hearts, they heard it, so as to know it, love it, and believe it; and from that time it brought forth fruit, and increased in them, and they continued in the faith and profession of it."

### John Wesley:
1. It bringeth forth fruit in all the world â€” That is, in every place where it is preached.
Ye knew the grace of God in truth â€” Truly experienced the gracious power of God.
