Pray to be filled with the knowledge of His will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. Understanding is in the intellect, while wisdom encompasses the faculties of the soul.

Seek a deeper understanding of God's will, for knowledge devoid of spiritual understanding serves little purpose. In the face of false teachings, an abundance of knowledge and discernment of God's will is the remedy.
