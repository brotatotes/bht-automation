# Colossians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through union with Christ, believers have already received in Him the spiritual substance, the circumcision made without hands, which surpasses the physical rite. This spiritual circumcision represents the putting off of the old sinful nature, like a garment that is taken off and laid aside. It is not achieved by human effort but is brought about by the union with Christ, whose circumcision is imputed to believers for justification and is the source of our sanctification. This inward, spiritual operation is accomplished by the Spirit of God, who works in the hearts of believers.

2. "This Christian transformation is set forth in its ideal conception, irrespective of its imperfect realization in our experience."

### John Gill:
1. "These believers were circumcised in Christ, or by him; not with external circumcision, which was peculiar to the Jews, the natural seed of Abraham, prefigured Christ, and had its accomplishment in him, the body and substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law."
2. "This is effected not 'by the hand of man', as the Ethiopic version reads it, as outward circumcision was; this is not done by any creature whatever; not by angels, who rejoice at the repentance of sinners, but cannot produce it; nor by ministers of the Gospel, who at most are but instruments of regeneration and conversion; nor by men themselves; this is not by might or power of man, by the strength of his free will, but by the Spirit of God."
3. "This is done several ways; partly by Christ's wrapping himself in the sins of his people, bearing them in his body, and becoming a sacrifice for them, whereby the old man was crucified, and the body of sin destroyed; and by an application of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, to the consciences of his people, whereby their iniquities are caused to pass from them, and they are clothed with change of raiment; and by the power of his Spirit, laying sin under the restraints of grace, not suffering it to have dominion, but causing grace to reign through righteousness; and by the saints themselves, under the influence of grace, who put off the old man with his deeds, according to the former conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye have received the spiritual blessings typified of old by circumcision."
2. "By an inward, spiritual operation."
3. "By that spiritual circumcision which Christ works in your heart."
