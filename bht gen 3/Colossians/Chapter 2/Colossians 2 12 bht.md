# Colossians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Baptism is portrayed as the burial of our old life and the initiation of a new one. The act of immersion symbolizes this burial, but the significance of baptism is upheld through other modes like affusion. By putting our faith in God's powerful working, displayed in Christ's resurrection, we are raised to a new moral life. Baptism is a visual representation of the change that has already taken place in our hearts through faith and signifies our fellowship with Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The new life being begun at baptism,â€”an image familiar alike to Jews and Christians,â€”the process itself of baptism is regarded as the burial of the former life."
2. "The minor details of the sacrament which corresponded to them, may in different ages or climates be varied; but the spiritual figures remain."
3. "The power of God in raising the dead to life is one and the same in our Lord and in usâ€”the physical power exerted in Him is not only a pledge of the same physical power to be exerted in us, but a condition and assurance of a spiritual power already exerted in us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Baptism is regarded as the burial of the old carnal life, to which the act of immersion symbolically corresponds; and in warm climates where immersion is safe, it is the mode most accordant with the significance of the ordinance; but the spirit of the ordinance is kept by affusion, where immersion would be inconvenient or dangerous; to insist on literal immersion in all cases would be mere legal ceremonialism."
2. "Faith in God's mighty operation in raising again Jesus is saving faith, and it is wrought in the soul by His same 'mighty working' whereby He 'raised Jesus from the dead.'"
3. "However, 'faith of' usually is 'faith in'; but there is no grammatical impropriety in understanding it as 'the faith which is the effect of the operation of God.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Buried with him in baptism."
2. "Ye are risen with him."
3. "Through the faith of the operation of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The burial and the raising are both typified in baptism."
2. "The raising is not the resurrection to eternal life at Christ's second coming, but the moral resurrection to a new life."
3. "Not the faith which God works, but your faith in God's working: faith in God's energy as displayed in Christ's resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "We obtain this by means of baptism, that it may be the more clearly apparent that there is no advantage from circumcision under the reign of Christ."
2. "By baptism, therefore, we are buried with Christ, because Christ does at the same time accomplish efficaciously that mortification, which he there represents, that the reality may be conjoined with the sign."
3. "He magnifies the grace which we obtain in Christ, as being greatly superior to circumcision. 'We are not only ingrafted into Christâ€™s death, but we also rise to newness of life:â€™ hence the more injury is done to Christ by those who endeavor to bring us back to circumcision."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fellowship with Christ finds its sign and seal in the rite of baptism, which, as then administered, had its external resemblance to the burial and resurrection of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For all who in the rite of baptism are plunged under the water, thereby declare that they put faith in the expiatory death of Christ for the pardon of their past sins." 
2. "In the symbol of baptism the resurrection to new life in Christ is pictured with an allusion to Christ's own resurrection and to our final resurrection."
3. "Baptism gives a picture of the change already wrought in the heart 'through faith.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle goes on to observe how complete and perfect the saints are in Christ... their baptism in water was a lively representation."
2. "Baptism being performed by immersion... is a very significant emblem of all this; it is a representation of the burial of Christ."
3. "In baptism saints are risen with Christ, as well as in it buried with him: and this through the faith of the operation of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The ancient manner of baptizing by immersion is as manifestly alluded to here, as the other manner of baptizing by sprinkling or pouring of water is." 
2. "No stress is laid on the age of the baptized, or the manner of performing it, but only on our being risen with Christ, through the powerful operation of God in the soul."
3. "It does not appear, that in all this St. Paul speaks of justification at all, but of sanctification altogether."
