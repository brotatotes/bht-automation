2. "Making you partakers of the power of his resurrection."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, Christ has not only forgiven all our transgressions, but He has also quickened us together with Him. This quickening is a spiritual resurrection, something beyond a mere removal of our old fleshly nature. We were once dead in our sins and alienated from God, as indicated by our uncircumcision. But through Christ's forgiveness and the power of His resurrection, we have been brought to new life. This forgiveness is not partial or temporary; it encompasses all sins, past, present, and future. It is a free gift of grace that unites us with Christ and delivers us from the bondage of legalism. So let us live in the reality of this new life, knowing that we have been made alive and forgiven by the merciful Savior.

- Attempt 5 BHT: In Colossians 2:13, Paul addresses the Colossian Gentiles and extends his message to all believers. He emphasizes that they were once dead in their sinful nature, separated from God. However, through Christ, they have been spiritually revived and forgiven of all their transgressions. The act of being forgiven is simultaneous with the process of being quickened, or made alive, spiritually. This forgiveness is not a piecemeal process, but a complete and universal act that covers all sins, past, present, and future. Their original sinful nature, represented by the uncircumcision of their flesh, has been transformed through Christ's work. The analogy of being dead and then quickened together with Christ symbolizes their participation in His resurrection power. This passage focuses on the spiritual application of the literal fact of resurrection, highlighting the believers' sanctification rather than justification.
