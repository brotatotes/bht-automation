# Colossians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through Christ's crucifixion, the bond representing the law was nailed to the cross and lost its obligatory power, no longer hindering us. The law, unable to produce inward obedience or inclination in our hearts, was against us with its accusations, threatenings, and reminders of unfulfilled duty. However, Christ blotted out and cancelled the bond, redeeming us from its curse. His death abolished the burdensome requirements of the Mosaic law and took away its condemnation, freeing us from guilt and pacifying our consciences before God.
