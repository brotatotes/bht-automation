## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The law was 'ministered by angels' (Gal. iii, 19: see Acts vii. 53), 'the word spoken by angels' (Heb. ii, 2:â€”they were the promulgators of the 'handwriting in ordinances.' In that promulgation of theirs, God was pleased to reveal Himself of old. That writing, that investiture, so to speak, of God, was first wiped out, soiled and rendered worthless, and then nailed to the Crossâ€”abrogated and suspended there."
2. "Thus God stripped off the principalities and the powersâ€”divested Himself of, put off from Himself, that ministration of angels, manifesting Himself henceforward without a veil in the exalted Person of Jesus."
3. "And the act of triumph, by which God has for ever subjected all principality and power to Christ, and made Him to be the only Head of His people, in whom they are complete, was that sacrifice, whereby all the law was accomplished."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "If our liberty is the spoil which Christ has rescued from the devil, what do others, who would bring us back into bondage, but restore to Satan the spoils of which he had been stript bare?"

2. "He has bruised the serpent's head, demolished his works, destroyed him himself, and all his powers, and defeated all their counsels and designs against his elect."
3. "He led Satan and his principalities and powers captive, who had led others, as he passed through the air, the territories of the devil, in the sight of God and the holy angels."
