# Colossians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not let anyone judge you in matters of eating, drinking, or observance of festivals, new moons, or sabbaths. These legal observances are secondary and have been dispensed with in Christ.

Do not allow yourselves to be fettered by the laws imposed by others, but focus instead on the righteousness, peace, and joy that come from living according to the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let no one therefore (because this is so‚Äîthat ye are complete in Christ, and that. God in Him hath put away and dispensed with all that is secondary and intermediate) judge you"
2. "in eating and in drinking"
3. "or in respect of feasts or new moon, or sabbaths"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Pay no regard to any one who sits in judgment on you as to legal observances in respect to foods." 
2. "The weekly sabbath rests on a more permanent foundation, having been instituted in Paradise to commemorate the completion of creation in six days." 
3. "The sabbath is still needed and is therefore still linked with the other nine commandments, as obligatory in the spirit, though the letter of the law has been superseded by that higher spirit of love which is the essence of law and Gospel alike."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let no man, therefore, judge you, or claim the right to decide for you in those matters. You are not responsible to man for your conduct, but to Christ." 
2. "No one had a right to impose their observance on Christians, or to condemn them if they did not keep [the festivals of the Jews]. They had been delivered from that obligation by the death of Christ." 
3. "No part of the moral law - no one of the ten commandments could be spoken of as 'a shadow of good things to come.' These commandments are, from the nature of moral law, of perpetual and universal obligation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Judge [Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒµœÑœâ] . Sit in judgment."
2. "The festival of the new moon is placed beside the Sabbath."
3. "The plural is only once used in the New Testament of more than a single day."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says, therefore, that it is not in the power of men to make us subject to the observance of rites which Christ has by his death abolished, and exempts us from their yoke, that we may not allow ourselves to be fettered by the laws which they have imposed."
2. "Consider whether it may not be taken to mean separation, for those that make a distinction of days, separate, as it were, one from another. Such a mode of partition was suitable for the Jews, that they might celebrate religiously the days that were appointed, by separating them from others. Among Christians, however, such a division has ceased."
3. "I answer, that we do not by any means observe days, as though there were any sacredness in holidays, or as though it were not lawful to labor upon them, but that respect is paid to government and order ‚Äî not to days."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let no man therefore judge you."
2. "The Mosaic law had prohibitions respecting food alone, forbidding wine to Nazarites and to priests in service; hence the Phrygian ascetics had probably gone beyond the law."
3. "The need of [the Lord's Day] is written in man's body, and experience proves that Christianity is the loser by the neglect of a religious observance of one day in seven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let no one judge you (ŒºŒ∑ œÑŒπœÇ œÖŒºŒ±œÇ Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒµœÑœâ)."
2. "For Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩœâ see on Matthew 7:1."
3. "He makes a plea for freedom in such matters on a par with that in Colossians 2:1; Colossians 2:14; Colossians 2:15."

### John Gill:
1. "They should not regard or submit to any man's judgment, as to the observance of the ceremonial law."
2. "Christ is the prophet who was to be raised up like unto Moses, and who only, and not Moses, is to be heard."
3. "The kingdom of God, or the Gospel dispensation, does not lie in the observance of such outward things, but in internal ones, in righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."

### John Wesley:
1. "Therefore ‚Äî Seeing these things are so."
2. "Let none judge you ‚Äî That is, regard none who judge you."
3. "In meat or drink ‚Äî For not observing the ceremonial law in these or any other particulars. Or in respect of a yearly feast, the new moon, or the weekly Jewish sabbaths."
