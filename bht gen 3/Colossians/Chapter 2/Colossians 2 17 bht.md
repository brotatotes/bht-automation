# Colossians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Mosaic laws and rituals were a type and resemblance of the blessings brought by Christ, while the body, the substance, belongs to Christ Himself. The Colossians are encouraged not to let themselves be judged by adhering to the shadowy rituals anymore since the substantial reality is found in union with Christ. The new dispensation in Christ supersedes the old system of shadows and holds a loftier joy, especially in the observance of the Lord's Day, which commemorates a more august event. By clinging to the shadows, one diminishes the manifestation and excellence of Christ Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "which is a shadow of things to come...but the body belongs to Christ."
2. "the substantial blessings, which those legal observances typified, are attached to, brought in by, found in union with, Christ."
3. "the fact of an obligatory rest of one day...would have been directly in the teeth of his assertion here: the holding of such would have been still to retain the shadow, while we possess the substance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The blessings of the Christian covenant, the substance of which Jewish ordinances were but the type."
2. "The real substance (of the blessings typified by the law) belongs to Christ."
3. "The world to come."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were only a dim outline of future things, not the reality."
2. "Between those things themselves which are in Christ, and those which only represented or prefigured them, there is as much difference as there is between a body and a shadow; a solid substance and a mere outline."
3. "Having now, therefore, the thing itself the shadow can be to us of no value; and that having come which was prefigured, that which was designed merely to represent it, is no longer binding."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Mosaic ritual system was to the great verities of the Gospel what the shadow is to the man, a mere general type or resemblance."
2. "The substance belongs to the Christian economy."
3. "It is derived from Christ, and can be realized only through union with Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those, therefore, who still adhere to those shadows, act like one who should judge of a man‚Äôs appearance from his shadow, while in the meantime he had himself personally before his eyes." 
2. "The man that calls back the ceremonies into use, either buries the manifestation of Christ, or robs Christ of his excellence, and makes him in a manner void."
3. "For when he says, Let no man judge you, he does not address the false apostles, but prohibits the Colossians from yielding their neck to unreasonable requirements."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All the matters spoken of in Colossians 2:16 are referred to; the whole system of prohibitions and festivals has a typical significance, pointing to ‚Äòthe things to come,‚Äô namely, the new dispensation."
2. "The body is Christ‚Äôs, belongs to Him; the reality of these observances is found in the new dispensation."
3. "In this substantial reality there is a place for the Lord‚Äôs Day, which is ‚Äònow to be a season of loftier joy, as it commemorates a more august event than either the creation of the universe, or the exodus from Egypt‚Äô (Eadie)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A shadow (œÉŒ∫ŒπŒ±). Old word, opposed to substance (œÉœâŒºŒ±, body)."
2. "The œÉœâŒºŒ± (body) casts the œÉŒ∫ŒπŒ± (shadow) and so belongs to Christ (ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ, genitive case)."
3. "In Hebrews 10:1 œÉŒ∫ŒπŒ± is distinguished from ŒµŒπŒ∫œâŒΩ (picture), but here from œÉœâŒºŒ± (body, substance)."

### John Gill:
1. "They were types, figures, and representations of spiritual and evangelical things."
2. "The body, or sum and substance of these shadows, is Christ; he gave rise unto them, he existed before them."
3. "Christ is the body and substance of all these shadows, in opposition to these sayings and notions of the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. Which are but a lifeless shadow; but the body, the substance, is of Christ.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse speaks of the temporary nature of the Mosaic laws and rituals, which served as a shadow or type of the blessings brought by Christ. These observances were a mere resemblance, while the substantial reality of these blessings can only be found in union with Christ. In contrast, the body or substance belongs to Christ, who is the one casting the shadow. Therefore, the Colossians are urged not to let anyone judge them or impose the burdensome requirements of the shadowy rituals on them anymore. The new dispensation in Christ supersedes the old system of shadows and holds a loftier joy, particularly in the observance of the Lord's Day, which commemorates a more august event. By clinging to the shadows, one diminishes the manifestation and excellence of Christ Himself.
