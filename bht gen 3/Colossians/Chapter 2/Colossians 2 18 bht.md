## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let no one of purpose defraud you of your prize in lowliness of mind and worship of the angels."
2. "This they willingly are ignorant of."
3. "Insisting on things which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his own flesh."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To be umpire in a contest to the detriment of one."
2. "His 'humility,' so called, is a pleasing of self."
3. "That the things seen may have been of demoniacal origination, appears from 1 Timothy 4:1, 'Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were desirous of appearing to do this with an humble spirit - even with the modesty of an angel - but still they had pleasure in that profound and dangerous kind of inquiry."
2. "The danger in the case arose from the fact that they assumed so much the aspect of modest piety; so much the appearance of the lowly devotion of angelic beings."
3. "The most meek and modest men in appearance are sometimes the most proud and reckless in their investigations of the doctrines of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Delighting in humility." 
2. "The worship of angels involved a show of humility, an affectation of superior reverence for God."
3. "The humility is thus characterized as affected, and the teachers as charlatans."

### John Calvin:
1. "He admonishes them, therefore, that the false apostles aimed at nothing else than to snatch away from them the palm, inasmuch as they draw them aside from the rectitude of their course."
2. "But, in my opinion, he rather condemns the contrivance as to the worshipping of angels. It is on this account that he has so carefully applied himself to this in the very commencement of the Epistle, to bring angels under subjection, lest they should obscure the splendor of Christ."
3. "For whoever depends upon his own reason, inasmuch as the acuteness of the flesh is wholly at work in him, Paul declares him to be puffed up in vain. And truly all the wisdom that men have from themselves is mere wind: hence there is nothing solid except in the word of God and the illumination of the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Rob you of the prize. The figure, borrowed from the games, suggests an unfair decision of the umpire in awarding the prize; but it need not be pressed further than to mean depriving the Christian of his ‚Äòprize,‚Äô which is future blessedness, eternal life."
2. "Willing,‚Äô or ‚Äòwillingly,‚Äô as we must express it, a qualification of the verb ‚Äòrob you of the prize,‚Äô but three senses have been given it. (1.) Willingly, of his own choice or impulse; this is almost equivalent to ‚Äòarbitrarily,‚Äô and agrees best with the exact sense of the Greek word."
3. "Vainly puffed up; puffed up with pride despite the show of humility, and that without ground."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rob you of your prize (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒµœÖŒµœÑœâ)... here only in the N.T. So here it means to decide or give judgment against."
2. "By a voluntary humility (Œ∏ŒµŒªœâŒΩ ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ±œÄŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÜœÅŒøœÉœÖŒΩŒ∑)... finding pleasure in humility."
3. "Vainly puffed up (ŒµŒπŒ∫Œ∑ œÜœÖœÉŒπŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ)... Powerful picture of the self-conceit of these bombastic Gnostics."

### John Gill:
1. "The Christian's reward, or prize he is running for, is the incorruptible and never fading crown of glory, life, and righteousness."
2. "True humility is an excellent grace; it is the clothing and ornament of a Christian; nor is there anything that makes a man more like Christ, than this grace."
3. "This shows that his humility was forced, and only in outward appearance, and was not true and genuine."

### John Wesley:
1. "Out of pretended humility, they worshipped angels, as not daring to apply immediately to God."
2. "Yet this really sprung from their being puffed up: (the constant forerunner of a fall, Proverbs 16:18)"
3. "So far was it from being an instance of true humility."
