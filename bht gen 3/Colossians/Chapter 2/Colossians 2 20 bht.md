# Colossians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why are you being prescribed to as though living in the world? Paul emphasizes that if you have died to the world through baptism, you should not continue to live according to its principles or be bound by its outward, worldly ordinances. The Colossians were acting as if they were seeking life and righteousness in the rudiments of the world, rather than recognizing their freedom in Christ.
