# Colossians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The instruction to handle not, neither taste, nor even touch refers to the prohibition of certain meats. The Greek words used have different nuances, conveying the idea of close contact and momentary contact. The Pharisees, Essenes, and Gnostics focused on external observances rather than inward conviction. Enlightened instruction is necessary to make laws effective, as mere outward rules may not suffice. These specific prohibitions do not support complete abstinence from intoxicating liquors. Human traditions can ensnare and suffocate consciences.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Handle not, neither taste, nor even touch" (it will be understood that these words follow immediately upon what went before, without a stop, as being the things prescribed.)
2. "I agree with Calvin, Bengel, and Meyer, in referring all the three to meats"
3. "but also of taste, coming as a defining term between the two less precise ones touch and handle"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Handle not, neither taste, nor even touch." 
2. "The three refer to meats."
3. "The first Greek word (hapse) is distinguished from the third (thiges), in that the former means close contact and retention: the latter, momentary contact."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why are ye subject to ordinances of various kinds, such as this - Touch not, taste not, handle not?" 
2. "The rapid succession of the words here, without any connecting particle, is supposed to denote the eagerness of the persons who imposed this injunction, and their earnestness in warning others from contaminating themselves with the prohibited things."
3. "Intoxicating drinks should be abstained from; but the obligation to do it should be made to rest on solid arguments, and not on passages of Scripture like this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Touch - taste - handle [Î±ÏˆÎ· - Î³ÎµÏ…ÏƒÎ· - Î¸Î¹Î³Î·Ï‚]. %Aptomai, A.V., touch, is properly to fasten one's self to or cling to."
2. "To get hands on so as to injure, 1 John 5:18. To have intercourse with, 1 Corinthians 7:1; 2 Corinthians 6:17."
3. "No single English word will express all these phases of meaning. Handle comes, perhaps, as near as any other, especially in its sense of treatment, as when we say that a speaker or writer handles a subject; or that a man is roughly handled by his enemies."

### John Calvin:
1. "When persons have once taken upon them to tyrannize over menâ€™s souls, there is no end of new laws being daily added to old ones, and new enactments starting up from time to time." 
2. "Human traditions are a labyrinth, in which consciences are more and more entangled; nay more, are snares, which from the beginning bind in such a way that in course of time they strangle in the end."
3. "How bright a mirror there is as to this in Popery!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The climax is reached in 'do not even touch.'" 
2. "The prohibitions are specific in form, and refer to certain kinds of food and drink." 
3. "This series of condemned prohibitions cannot be used in support of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Pharisees, Essenes, Gnostics made piety hinge on outward observances and rules instead of inward conviction and principle."
2. "Even today men are finding that the noble prohibition law needs enlightened instruction to make it effective. That is true of all law."
3. "These three verbs are all in the aorist subjunctive second person singular with Î¼Î·, a prohibition against handling or touching these forbidden things."

### John Gill:
1. "Touch not, taste not, handle not." 
2. "There is a treatise in their Misna, called Oholot, which gives many rules, and is full of decrees about things that defile by touching."
3. "Others think that touch not regards abstinence from women; see 1 Corinthians 7:1; and respects the prohibition of marriage by some in those times; and 'taste not', the forbearance of certain meats, at certain times, which God had not restrained any from; and 'handle not', that is, make no use of, or enjoy your own goods, and so designs that voluntary poverty which some entered into under the direction of false teachers."

### John Wesley:
1. Touch not â€” An unclean thing.
Taste not â€” Any forbidden meat.
Handle not â€” Any consecrated vessel.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Do not handle, neither taste, nor even touch refers to the prohibition of certain meats. The first Greek word, handle, denotes close contact and retention, while the third word, touch, means to fasten oneself to. These verbs convey the idea of close interaction with forbidden things. The Pharisees, Essenes, and Gnostics emphasized outward observances and rules over inner conviction and principle. Today, we can relate to the need for enlightened instruction to make laws effective. These prohibitions were specific to certain food and drink, and cannot be used to support total abstinence from intoxicating liquors. This verse highlights the danger of human traditions, which can entangle and strangle consciences.

The Greek words used distinguish between close contact, momentary contact, and fastening oneself to something. The Pharisees, Essenes, and Gnostics prioritized legalistic observances over inner conviction. Today, we still recognize the need for enlightened instruction to effectively enforce laws. However, these specific prohibitions should not be misapplied to advocate for total abstinence from alcoholic beverages. Beware of human traditions that entangle and bind consciences.
