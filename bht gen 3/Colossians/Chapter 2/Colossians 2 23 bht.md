# Colossians 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Colossians, there is a warning against following teachings that appear wise and humble but actually satisfy the flesh. Despite seeming to deny the body, these regulations ultimately indulge our human desires. True devotion and religion are absent from these practices. Mere rules are insufficient; they cannot fully guide us in our conduct. Thus, we must be cautious of false teachers and strive to grasp the mystery of God. By prioritizing genuine theology and caring for fellow believers, we can avoid the deception of these misleading teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such sort of commandments and teachings as... are possessed of a reputation indeed of wisdom in voluntary worship and humility, and not sparing of the body, not in any honour [of it], to the satiating of the flesh." 
2. "Why are ye suffering yourselves to be thus prescribed to [in the strain 'touch not, &c.' according to, &c., which are, &c.], and all for the satisfaction of the flesh?"
3. "They are not to seek the satisfying of the fleshâ€”not to mind earthly things, but 'make dead their members which were upon earth.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The former seeming in religion to do even more than God requires, but really setting aside God's will for man's own."
2. "Not paying any of that 'honor' which is due to the body as redeemed by such a price as the blood of Christ."
3. "While seeming to deny self and the body, they really are pampering the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We should feel a deep interest for the welfare of other Christians, even those whom we have never seen... By our prayers and sympathy, we may often do much good to those whom we shall never see until we meet them in heaven."
2. "We should be on our guard against the seductive arts of false teachers... They may have much more learning than we have; and they may put on the appearance of great humility and of real piety."
3. "Our views of the 'mystery of God' - of the divine nature, and especially of the rank and character of Christ, will determine all our views of theology."

### John Calvin:
1. "Show is placed in contrast with reality, for it is an appearance, as they commonly speak, which deceives by resemblance."
2. "Human traditions...are agreeable to us on this account, that they are in accordance with our understanding."
3. "The zeal of men, therefore, for superstition is surpassingly mad, which could not be restrained by so plain a declaration of God from breaking forth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Which things... have indeed a show of wisdom, have the reputation of wisdom, but lack the reality; this being obviously the meaning."
2. "Depravity, sensuous always, and so often sensual, in its manifestations, is not checked thus."
3. "The history of monasticism is a sufficient commentary. The connection between asceticism and the worship of angels seems a natural one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Which very things, these ascetic regulations, Have indeed a show of wisdom."
2. "Clearly here the bad sense, 'in mock humility.'"
3. "Mere rules do not carry us very far in human conduct as every father or mother knows, though we must have some regulations in family and state and church. But they are not enough of themselves."

### John Gill:
1. "Their pretensions to it lay in the following things, in will worship; being what was over and above that which was commanded by God, and so, like the freewill offerings under the law, must be acceptable to him; this was one of their colours, which had some show of wisdom, religion, and zeal."
2. "There was no true devotion nor religion in them."
3. "Though the body is not to be pampered, and the lusts of it indulged, or luxury and intemperance to be encouraged; yet since the body is the work of God's hands, is the habitation of the soul, and by which it performs its offices, and is the purchase of Christ, the temple of the Holy Spirit, and will be raised a glorious body at the last day, it ought not to be neglected and dishonoured; but should have a sufficiency of food and clothing, whereby it may be comfortably and honourably nourished and supported."

### John Wesley:
1. "Denying it many gratifications, and putting it to many inconveniences."
2. "Yet they are not of any real value before God, nor do they, upon the whole, mortify, but satisfy, the flesh."
3. "They indulge our corrupt nature, our self-will, pride, and desire of being distinguished from others."
