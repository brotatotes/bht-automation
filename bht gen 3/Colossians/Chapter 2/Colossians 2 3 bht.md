## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Like a mine of unknown and inexhaustible wealth, the treasures of wisdom are all in Him hidden, but not in order to remain so; they only need to be explored for you to attain 'unto the riches' in them."
2. "This sense suits the scope of the apostle, and sets aside ALFORD'S objection that 'the treasures are not hidden, but revealed.'"
3. "Still as the mine is unfathomable, there will, through eternity, be always fresh treasures in Him to be drawn forth from their hidden state."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reference is doubtless to Christ, as his name is the immediate antecedent, and as what is affirmed here properly appertains to him."
2. "Christ, as Mediator, was the great treasure-house where were to be found all the wisdom and knowledge needful for people."
3. "Christ is able to instruct us in all that it is desirable for us to know, so that it is not necessary for us to apply to philosophy, or to the teachings of human beings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In whom are all the treasures, etc., hidden." 
2. "The words which immediately follow in ver. 4, suggest the possibility that hidden may convey an allusion to the Apocrypha or secret writings of the Essenes, whose doctrines entered into the Colossian heresy."
3. "If such is Paul's allusion, the word suggests a contrast with the treasures of Christian wisdom which are accessible to all in Christ."

2. "Should any one choose to interpret it as referring to the mystery, the meaning will be, that all the wisdom of the pious is included in the gospel, by means of which God is revealed to us in his Son."
3. "For the preaching of the cross is always foolishness to the world...no knowledge, erudition, learning, wisdom, can be found elsewhere."
