## BHT:
In faith, we receive not only the doctrine of Christ but Himself into us. True faith is a spiritual communion where we receive Jesus the Christ, our Lord, as our Savior. We cannot separate Christ from His teachings; they are intrinsically linked. Just as we once received Christ as our Lord, so now let us continue to walk in Him, allowing His teachings and His presence to guide our lives. Let our walk in Him be characterized by faith, love, and holiness as we follow His direction.
