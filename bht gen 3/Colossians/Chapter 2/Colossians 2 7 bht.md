## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "rooted (see Eph. iii. 18) and being continually built up in Him"
2. "that the rooting, answering to the first elementary grounding in Him, is in the past: the being built up, answering to the continual increase in Him, is present"
3. "and confirmed in the (or, your) faith as ye were taught, abounding therein in (or, with) thanksgiving"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As in the Song of Solomon, when one image is not sufficient to express the varied aspects of divine truth, another is employed to supply the idea required." 
2. "Rooted" is in the past tense, implying their first conversion and vital grafting "in Him." "Built up" is present, implying their progressive increase in religion by union with Him.
3. "Advancing to fuller maturity in the faith, 'with thanksgiving' to God as the gracious Author of this whole blessing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Rooted ...in him - As a tree strikes its roots deep in the earth, so our faith should strike deep into the doctrine respecting the Saviour." 
2. "Abounding therein with thanksgiving - Expressing overflowing thanks to God that you have been made acquainted with truths so precious and glorious." 
3. "If there is anything for which we ought to be thankful, it is for the knowledge of the great truths respecting our Lord and Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The whole upbuilding of the Church proceeds within the compass of Christ's personality, life, and power." 
2. "For Paul's emphasis on thanksgiving, see Romans 1:21; Romans 14:6; 2 Corinthians 1:11; 2 Corinthians 4:15; 2 Corinthians 9:11, 2 Corinthians 9:12; Ephesians 5:20; 1 Timothy 2:1, etc."
3. "In this and in the Ephesian epistle, Christ is represented as the sphere within which the building goes on."

### John Calvin:
1. "the prosecution of the way, the support of the root, and of the foundation, is firmness and steadfastness of faith."
2. "He would not have them simply remain immovable, but would have them grow every day more and more."
3. "when he adds, with thanksgiving, he would have them always keep in mind from what source faith itself proceeds, that they may not be puffed up with presumption, but may rather with fear repose themselves in the gift of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first participle points to taking root once for all and continuing rooted; the second to the progressive building up."
2. "'Faith is, as it were, the cement of the building' (Lightfoot)."
3. "Here, as everywhere, the Apostle emphasizes the privilege of thanksgiving."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rooted (ŒµœÅœÅŒπŒ∂œâŒºŒµŒΩŒø). Perfect passive participle of old verb œÅŒπŒ∂Œøœâ from œÅŒπŒ∂Œ±, root. In N.T. only here and Ephesians 3:17. Paul changes the figure from walk to growing tree."
2. "Builded up in him (ŒµœÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøŒ¥ŒøŒºŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒø ŒµŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑœâ). Present passive participle (rooted to stay so) of ŒµœÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøŒ¥ŒøŒºŒµœâ, old verb, to build upon as in 1 Corinthians 3:10; 1 Corinthians 3:12. The metaphor is changed again to a building as continually going up (present tense)."
3. "Even as ye were taught (Œ∫Œ±Œ∏œâœÇ ŒµŒ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ±œáŒ∏Œ∑œÑŒµ). First aorist passive indicative of Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ±œÉŒ∫œâ, an allusion to œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµœÑŒµ in verse Colossians 2:6 and to ŒµŒºŒ±Œ∏ŒµœÑŒµ in Colossians 1:7."

### John Gill:
1. "Believers are sometimes compared to trees, and are trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord; and their root is Christ, from whence as such they spring, and by whom they are filled with the fruits of righteousness..." 
2. "Christ is the sure and only foundation on which they are laid, and where they are safe and secure..." 
3. "...they were well settled and grounded in their faith in Christ, and thoroughly instructed and established in the doctrines of the Gospel..."

### John Wesley:
1. Rooted in him ‚Äî As the vine.
Built ‚Äî On the sure foundation.
