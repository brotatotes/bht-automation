## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Take heed lest there shall be any one who leadeth you captive by means of his philosophy and empty deceit." 
2. "The character of the philosophy here meant [...] was that mixture of Jewish and Oriental, which afterwards expanded into gnosticism."
3. "Every true philosophy must therefore be according to Christ, must begin and end with Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beware lest there shall be any man leading you away as his spoil through his philosophy."
2. "You, who may have 'the riches of full assurance' and 'the treasures of wisdom,' should not suffer yourselves to be led away as a spoil by empty, deceitful philosophy."
3. "Their boasted higher 'philosophy' is but human tradition, and a cleaving to the carnal and worldly, and not to Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Take heed lest anyone plunder or rob you of your faith and hope by philosophy."
2. "The danger of the Colossians was, that they would rely rather on the deductions of that specious reasoning, than on what they had been taught by their Christian teachers."
3. "The doctrines which were advanced in those systems were maintained by plausible, not by solid arguments; by considerations not fitted to lead to the truth, but to lead astray."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil." 
2. "Hence the warning is not against all philosophy... but also their practical system, so that it covered their ascetic practices no less than their mysticism."
3. "Rudiments... applicable alike to Jewish and to Gentile teaching... Ceremonialism, meats, drinks, washings, Essenic asceticism, pagan symbolic mysteries and initiatory rites - all belonged to a rudimentary moral stage."

### John Calvin:
1. "Beware, says he, lest any one plunder you. He makes use of a very appropriate term, for he alludes to plunderers, who, when they cannot carry off the flock by violence, drive away some of the cattle fraudulently... we who are the sheep of Christ repose in safety when we hold the unity of the faith."
2. "Do not deviate a nailâ€™s breadth from purity of doctrine. For unquestionably Christ will act the part of the good Shepherd by protecting us if we but hear his voice, and reject those of strangers."
3. "Philosophy is nothing else than a corruption of spiritual doctrine if it is mixed up with Christ... all doctrines are foreign to Christ that make the worship of God, which we know to be spiritual, according to Christâ€™s rule, to consist in the elements of the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The false teachers sought to lead them away captive, body and mind; the former by ritualistic restrictions, the latter by heretical teaching."
2. "The teaching might be oral or written, but it was essentially esoteric, essentially traditional."
3. "What is â€˜not after Christâ€™ is rudimentary, not â€˜advanced;â€™ all teaching that does not make Him the centre only serves to lead men captive."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beware, see to it that there shall be no one who makes spoil of you, through his philosophy and vain deceit." 
2. "Christ is the yardstick by which to measure philosophy and all phases of human knowledge." 
3. "Christ is the measure for all human knowledge since he is the Creator and the Sustainer of the universe."

### John Gill:
1. "Rob you of the rich treasure of the Gospel, strip you of your spiritual armour, take away from you the truths and doctrines of Christ, and divest you of your spiritual privileges and blessings..."
2. "Not right philosophy, or true wisdom, the knowledge of God, of the things of nature, of things natural, moral, and civil..."
3. "Philosophy may be useful as an handmaid it is not to be a mistress in theological things; it may subserve, but not govern; it is not to be made use of as a judge, or rule in such matters."

### John Wesley:
1. "This the apostle condemns, 1. Because it was empty and deceitful, promising happiness, but giving none."
2. "Because it was grounded, not on solid reason, but the traditions of men."
3. "But in Christ dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead; the most full Godhead; not only divine powers, but divine nature."
