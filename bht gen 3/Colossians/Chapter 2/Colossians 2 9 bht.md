# Colossians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Christ, the fullness of the Godhead dwells, not just in certain aspects, but in its entirety. This dwells in Him personally and essentially, by the personal union of the divine nature in the Son of God with a human body. Through our union with Him, believers partake in His divine nature, sharing in His fullness. Contrasting with the false teachings and worldly philosophies, this truth reaffirms the deity and humanity of Jesus Christ in His bodily form.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Because in Him (emphatic: in Him alone) dwelleth (now, in His exaltation) all the fulness (compare on i. 19, and see below) of the Godhead..." 
2. "The fulness of the Godhead‚Äô here spoken of must be taken, as indeed the context shews, metaphysically, and not as ‚Äòall fulness‚Äô in ch. i. 19, where the historical Christ, as manifested in redemption, was in question."
3. "Before His incarnation, it dwelt in Him, as the word non-incarnate, but not bodily, as now that He is the Word Incarnate."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their 'philosophy' is not 'after Christ,' as all true philosophy is, everything which comes not from, and tends not to, Him, being a delusion."
2. "He, as man, was not merely God-like, but in the fullest sense, God."
3. "Believers, by union with Him, partake of His fulness of the divine nature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was the great and central doctrine that was to be maintained about Christ, that all the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him."
2. "The language is such as would be obviously employed on the supposition that God became incarnate, and appeared in human form."
3. "No language could, therefore, more clearly demonstrate the divinity of Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not the divine attributes, but the divine nature." 
2. "The fullness of the Godhead dwells in His person from His birth to His ascension."
3. "What a contrast to the human tradition and the rudiments of the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now in Christ there is a perfection, to which nothing can be added."
2. "For to what purpose do they tend, but to perfect what was commenced by Christ?"
3. "The sum is this, that God has manifested himself to us fully and perfectly in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because in him (in the Personal Christ, and in none other) dwelleth (now and permanently) all the fulness of the Godhead bodily."
2. "The fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the Eternal Word, and because of this when the Word became flesh the fulness dwelt in Him 'bodily.'"
3. "The reference is therefore to the now glorified Christ, but could have no validity were He not the Eternal Word, since 'all the fulness of the Godhead' means all the perfections of Deity; i.e., the Divine Essence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There dwells (at home) in Christ not one or more aspects of the Godhead... here only in N.T. as Œ∏ŒµŒπŒøœÑŒ∑œÇ only in Romans 1:20."
2. "Paul here asserts that 'all the œÄŒªŒ∑œÅœâŒºŒ± of the Godhead,' not just certain aspects, dwells in Christ and in bodily form."
3. "Paul here disposes of the Docetic theory that Jesus had no human body as well as the Cerinthian separation between the man Jesus and the aeon Christ. He asserts plainly the deity and the humanity of Jesus Christ in corporeal form."

### John Gill:
1. "The Godhead dwells in Christ as in a tabernacle, in allusion to the tabernacle of Moses, which looked mean without side, but glorious within; where God granted his presence, and accepted the sacrifices of his people."
2. "The act of inhabitation denotes the union of the two natures in Christ, and expresses the distinction of them; and is to be understood of the Godhead, as subsisting in the person of the Son of God, and not as subsisting in the person of the Father, or of the Spirit."
3. "The manner in which it dwells, is 'bodily'; not by power, as in the universe; nor by grace, as in the saints; nor by any glorious emanations of it, as in heaven; nor by gifts, as in the prophets and eminent men of God; nor by signs symbols, and shadows, as in the tabernacle and temple; but essentially and personally, or by personal union of the divine nature, as subsisting in the Son of God to an human body."
