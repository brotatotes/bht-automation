## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If then (as above asserted, ch. ii. 12, 20: the if implies no doubt of the fact, but lays it down as ground for an inference, see ch. ii. 20) ye were raised up together with Christ... seek the things above (heavenly, spiritual things)." 
2. "The participation is an objective one, brought about by that faith which was the condition of their baptismal admission into Him." 
3. "If you are united to Him, you will be tending to Him; and He is in heaven, sitting on the right hand of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If then ye have been once for all raised up (Greek, aorist tense) together with Christ" (namely, at your conversion and baptism, Romans 6:4)." 
2. "We are already seated there in Him as our Head; and hereafter shall be seated by Him, as the Bestower of our bliss." 
3. "The design of the Gospel is not merely to give rules, but mainly to supply motives to holiness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument is, that there was such an union between Christ and his people, that in virtue of his death they become dead to sin; that in virtue of his resurrection they rise to spiritual life."
2. "Seek those things which are above - That is, seek them as the objects of pursuit and affection; strive to secure them."
3. "The argument here is, that since Christ is there, and since he is the object of our supreme attachment, we should fix our affections on heavenly things, and seek to be prepared to dwell with him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be risen. In their baptism in which they died"
2. "Seated is a secondary predicate, as hidden in ch. 2 3."
3. "Where Christ is, seated."

### John Calvin:
1. "Ascension follows resurrection: hence, if we are the members of Christ we must ascend into heaven, because he, on being raised up from the dead, was received up into heaven, that he might draw us up with him."
2. "Now, we seek those things which are above, when in our minds we are truly sojourners in this world, and are not bound to it."
3. "Let us therefore bear in mind that that is a true and holy thinking as to Christ, which forthwith bears us up into heaven, that we may there adore him, and that our minds may dwell with him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Were raised together; the passive implies Godâ€™s agency, which is not suggested by the E. V. ('be risen'). The past tense points to the time of their baptism comp. chap. Colossians 2:12), which in the case of these adult Christians followed their faith in Christ."
2. "This being raised together with Christ implies ethical renewal of the believer, and hence it forms an appropriate motive to the exhortations which follow."
3. "The position of Christ, our personal Head and Lord, is the strongest motive to a life whose ends are heavenly."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The things that are above (Ï„Î± Î±Î½Ï‰). 'The upward things' (cf. Philippians 3:14), the treasure in heaven (Matthew 6:20). Paul gives this ideal and goal in place of merely ascetic rules."
2. "Seated on the right hand of God (ÎµÎ½ Î´ÎµÎ¾Î¹Î± Ï„Î¿Ï… Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï… ÎºÎ±Î¸Î·Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï‚). Not periphrastic verb, but additional statement. Christ is up there and at God's right hand."
3. "Paul gives this ideal and goal in place of merely ascetic rules."

### John Gill:
1. "For he does not here call in question their being risen with Christ, but takes it for granted that they were, and makes use of it as an argument for his present purpose."
2. "Where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God: which contains other reasons and arguments to engage believers to look upwards, and seek after heavenly things."
3. "He is 'on the right hand of God'; in human nature, an honour which none of the angels were ever admitted to."

### John Wesley:
1. If ye are risen, seek the things above â€” As Christ being risen, immediately went to heaven.
