## BHT:
In Christ, all distinctions among people, such as race and social status, cease to exist. Every category of humanity becomes inconsequential as all are absorbed into and centered in Christ.

In Christ, race and class distinctions vanish as He occupies all aspects of human life. In Him, believers find everything needed for justification, sanctification, and glorification.
