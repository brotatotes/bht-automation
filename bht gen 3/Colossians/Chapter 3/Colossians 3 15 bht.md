## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let Christ's peace rule in your hearts‚Äîto which you were also called in one body." 
2. "This peace...must not on account of the context be limited to that lower side. Its reference is evidently wider, as its office of ruling shows."
3. "Be ye thankful to God, who called you: so the context before and after certainly demands."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The peace of GOD. Therefore Christ is God. Peace was His legacy to His disciples before He left them (John 14:27), 'MY peace I give unto you.' Peace is peculiarly His to give." 
2. "Let the peace of Christ act as umpire when anger, envy, and such passions arise; and restrain them. Let not those passions give the award, so that you should be swayed by them, but let Christ's peace be the decider of everything." 
3. "Many wear a peaceful countenance and speak peace with the mouth, while war is in their hearts. To not have 'peace ruling in your hearts' would be inconsistent with the 'calling in one body,' and would be practical unthankfulness to God who called us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The peace which God gives to the soul is to be to us what the brabeutes, or governor at the games was to those who contended there."
2. "It [the peace of God] is to preside over and govern the mind; to preserve everything in its place; and to save it from tumult, disorder, and irregularity."
3. "The 'peace of God' will thus calm down every agitated element of the soul; subdue the tumult of passion, and preserve the mind in healthful action and order."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peace of Christ. Which comes from Christ."
2. "Christ is the one who adjusts all these, so that the metaphorical sense is appropriate."
3. "Called in one body. See Ephesians 4:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "He employs, however, a very appropriate metaphor; for as among wrestlers, he who has vanquished all the others carries off the palm, so he would have the peace of God be superior to all carnal affections..."
2. "...he points out also the remedy, that the peace of God may carry the victory, because it must be a bridle, by which carnal affections may be restrained."
3. "The clause, to which ye are called, intimates what manner of peace this is ‚Äî that unity which Christ has consecrated among us under his own direction."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts."
2. "The word 'rule' is more exactly: 'act as umpire,' a figure borrowed from the Grecian games."
3. "'Become' suggests increase, constant advance toward a gratitude not yet attained."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The peace of Christ (Œ∑ ŒµŒπœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ). The peace that Christ gives (John 14:27)."
2. "Rule (Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒµœÖŒµœÑœâ). Imperative active third singular of Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒµœÖœâ, to act as umpire (Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒµœÖœÇ), old verb, here alone in N.T. See 1 Corinthians 7:15 for called in peace."
3. "Be ye thankful (ŒµœÖœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑŒø Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒµœÉŒ∏Œµ). 'Keep on becoming thankful.' Continuous obligation."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the peace of God' is meant, either the peace believers have with God, which is his gift, and passes all understanding, and flows from a comfortable apprehension of interest in the blood, righteousness, and atonement of Christ." 
2. "This may be said to 'reign' in their hearts, when it is the governing principle there; when it restrains the turbulent passions of anger, wrath, and revenge, allays undue heats, moderates the spirits, and composes differences." 
3. "And be ye thankful; which intends either gratitude to men, to fellow creatures, for any service or kindness done by them, especially to the saints, the members of the same body, who are placed in a subservience, and in order to be useful to each other; or else to God, for all spiritual blessings in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "And then the peace of God shall rule in your hearts - Shall sway every temper, affection, thought..." 
2. "...as the reward (so the Greek word implies) of your preceding love and obedience."
