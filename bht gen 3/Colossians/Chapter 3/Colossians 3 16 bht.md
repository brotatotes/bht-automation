## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "Let Christ‚Äôs word dwell in you richly, i.e. in abundance and fulness, so as to lead to the following results."
3. "The singing to God is an analogous expression to that in 1 Cor. xiv. 28,‚Äî 'Let him speak... to God.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let the word of Christ‚Äîthe Gospel word by which ye have been called."
2. "At the love-feasts, and in their family circles, they were to be so full of the Word of Christ in the heart that the mouth should give it utterance in hymns of instruction, admonition, and praise."
3. "Singing (compare Ephesians 5:19) usually formed part of the entertainment at Greek banquets."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let the word of Christ - The doctrine of Christ. Dwell in you richly in all wisdom - Abundantly, producing the spirit of true wisdom."
2. "That doctrine is adapted to make you wise."
3. "It is true in a more important sense that he who is permitted to make the hymns of a church, need care little who preaches, or who makes the creed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word of Christ. The only occurrence of the phrase. The word spoken by Christ."
2. "The participles teaching and admonishing are used as imperatives."
3. "They are to be used in mutual Christian teaching and admonition."

### John Calvin:
1. "He on this account adds, in all wisdom ‚Äî that, being instructed by it, we may be wise as we ought to be."
2. "He requires mutual teaching and admonition."
3. "Let your communications, not merely those that are grave, but those also that are joyful and exhilarating, contain something profitable."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Richly;' 'not with a scanty foothold, but with a large and liberal occupancy'".
2. "In psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. See Ephesians 5:19. The words refer (though not exclusively) to the Old Testament psalms, to hymns of praise to Christ, and to other poetic productions, the result of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost."
3. "Singing with grace. Or, more literally, 'in grace,' Christ‚Äôs grace. It should not be weakened into 'gracefully' or 'thankfully.' The main question is, whether this explains 'teaching and admonishing,' or is another manifestation of the indwelling of the word of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Dwell (ŒµŒΩŒøŒπŒ∫ŒµŒπœÑœâ). Present active imperative of ŒµŒΩŒøŒπŒ∫Œµœâ, to make one's home, to be at home."
2. "In all wisdom (ŒµŒΩ œÄŒ±œÉŒ∑ œÉŒøœÜŒπŒ±). It is not clear whether this phrase goes with œÄŒªŒøœÖœÉŒπœâœÇ (richly) or with the participles following (Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ±œÉŒ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ Œ∫Œ± ŒΩŒøœÖŒ∏ŒµœÑŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒµœÇ, see Colossians 1:28). Either punctuation makes good sense."
3. "In your hearts (ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ±ŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ¥ŒπŒ±ŒπœÇ œÖŒºœâŒΩ). Without this there is no real worship 'to God' (œÑœâ Œ∏Œµœâ). How can a Jew or Unitarian in the choir lead in the worship of Christ as Saviour?"

### John Gill:
1. "The exhortation to let it dwell in them, supposes that it had entered into them, and had a place in them through the spirit and power of Christ; and that it should have a constant and fixed place there, and not be like a stranger or wayfaring man, that tarries but for a night..." 
2. "His meaning is, that not one part of the Scripture only should be regarded and attended to but the whole of it, every truth and doctrine in it, even the whole counsel of God..." 
3. "singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord; that is, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; and what is meant by singing of them... or in such a manner as will minister grace unto the hearers, be both amiable and edifying..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let the word of Christ ‚Äî So the apostle calls the whole scripture, and thereby asserts the divinity of his Master."
2. "Dwell ‚Äî Not make a short stay, or an occasional visit, but take up its stated residence."
3. "Richly ‚Äî In the largest measure, and with the greatest efficacy; so as to fill and govern the whole soul."
