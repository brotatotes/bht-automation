# Colossians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wives are instructed to submit to their husbands, because it is fitting and proper in the Lord. This submission is not about superiority or inferiority, but about recognizing the leadership role of the husband. It is a call for wives to respect and honor their husbands, while husbands are called to love their wives and not be harsh with them. This command for submission is not unique to the Colossian church, but is also found in other biblical passages and is a part of the Christian life. Therefore, wives are to submit to their own husbands, just as it is fitting and pleasing to the Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Seeing that such exhortations occur in Ephesians also in terms so very similar, we are not justified in assuming that there was any thing in the peculiar circumstances of the Colossian church, which required more than common exhortation of this kind."
2. "The words in the Lord belong to 'it is fit,' not to 'submit yourselves,' as is shewn by the parallel expression in ver. 20: was fitting, in that, element of life designated by 'in the Lord.'"
3. "The exhortations of the Epistle to Titus cannot be so completely severed from these as to be set down in another category."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Unto your own husbands‚ÄîThe oldest manuscripts omit 'own,' which crept in from :-." 
2. "As it is fit in the Lord‚ÄîGreek, 'was fit,' implying that there was at Colosse some degree of failure in fulfilling this duty, 'as it was your duty to have done as disciples of the Lord.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. Wives, submit yourselves ... - Notes on the parallel passage in Ephesians 5:21-24.


### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Not necessarily presupposing that the duty remained unperformed." 
3. "The past tense perhaps implies an essential a priori obligation."

### John Calvin:
1. "He commands wives to be subject. This is clear, but what follows is of doubtful signification ‚Äî as it is fit in the Lord."
2. "As it is fit in the Lord, that is, according to the appointment of the Lord, so that he confirms the subjection of wives by the authority of God."
3. "He requires love on the part of husbands, and that they be not bitter, because there is a danger lest they should abuse their authority in the way of tyranny."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Hence the submission is to be a loving one, with a Christian motive: As if fitting (as it should be) in the Lord."
3. "This means: as should be the case, in consequence of the fellowship with Jesus Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The verb œÖœÄŒøœÑŒ±œÉœÉŒøŒºŒ± has a military air, common in the Koine for such obedience." (Œ∫Œ± Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ∫ŒµœÇ)
2. "Obedience in government is essential as the same word shows in Romans 13:1; Romans 13:5." (œÖœÄŒøœÑŒ±œÉœÉŒµœÉŒ∏Œµ œÑŒøŒπœÇ Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ)

### John Gill:
1. "Subjection of wives to their own husbands is 'fit' and proper in its own nature, by reason of the original creation of man, and of the woman from him."
2. "Moreover, the woman was made for the man, and not the man for the woman; add to this, that the woman was in the transgression, and the means of the fall of man, which gave a fresh reason for, and made the obligation to subjection to him the stronger."
3. "It is what is fitting 'in the Lord': it is what he requires, not only what the law of God requires, but is what is commanded by Christ under the Gospel dispensation, and is to be observed by all those that are 'in' him."

### John Wesley:
1. Wives, submit ‚Äî Or be subject to. It is properly a military term, alluding to that entire submission that soldiers pay to their general. Ephesians 5:22, etc.
