- Attempt 1 BHT: Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is acceptable to God when done in the Lord. This obedience, however, is not occasional or sporadic, but rather a continual and ongoing submission. Christian parents have the responsibility of making reasonable and just demands of their children, as failing to do so can have serious consequences for both the child and society at large. The obligation of children to obey their parents is not limited to situations where they fully comprehend the rationale behind the commands; rather, it is a fundamental aspect of their upbringing and the development of their ethical and theological foundations. In this context, obedience is not just a mere social duty, but a Christian duty that is judged by the standards of Christ and His body. While the duty of obedience extends to all things, it is important to note that it does not require the violation of one's own conscience or submission to unlawful and unreasonable commands. Instead, obedience is to be rendered willingly and cheerfully in all things that are good, lawful, and indifferent. Ultimately, the motive for obedience should be the desire to please the Lord and bring glory to Him.
