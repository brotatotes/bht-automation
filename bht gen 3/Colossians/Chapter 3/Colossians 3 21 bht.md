## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A broken spirit is the pest of youth."
2. "It is assumed that the result of such irritation will be to cause repeated punishment, and so eventual desperation, on the part of the child."
3. "It would be well if all who have to educate children took to heart Bengel‚Äôs remark here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By perpetual fault-finding 'children' are 'discouraged' or 'disheartened.'"
2. "A broken-down spirit is fatal to youth."
3. "Translate here, 'irritate not.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Children should not be flattered, but they should be encouraged."
2. "They should not be so praised as to make them vain and proud, but they should be commended when they do well."
3. "He who always finds fault with a child; who is never satisfied with what he does; who scolds and frets and complains, let him do as he will, breaks his spirit, and soon destroys in the delicate texture of his soul all desire of doing well."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Provoke to anger is used of stirring up to good works."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Provoke not your children; or, ‚Äòdo not irritate your children.‚Äô ‚ÄòTo anger‚Äô is an unnecessary addition; the term used in Ephesians is different. Severe, unjust, capricious treatment is forbidden."
2. "That they be not disheartened; this is the certain result of such treatment. Bengel: ‚Äòa broken spirit, the bane of youth.‚Äô The child feels: I can never satisfy my father. Affection and confidence are destroyed, or at least cease to act as motives. Obedience becomes soulless, and the child loses its moral discrimination, and finally becomes reckless."
3. "Our heavenly Father, the Father of our spirits, Himself carefully guards against our becoming disheartened under His chastisement, and nothing rejoices Him more than that 'we cast not away our confidence;' and so also in the relations of parents and children, much depends upon our not being rendered morose by the faults, but taking courage as to final triumph."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Provoke not (ŒºŒ∑ ŒµœÅŒµŒ∏ŒπŒ∂ŒµœÑŒµ). Present imperative of old verb from ŒµœÅŒµŒ∏œâ, to excite. Only twice in N.T., here in bad sense, in good sense in 2 Corinthians 9:2 (to stimulate)." 
2. "Here it means to nag and as a habit (present tense)."
3. "One does not have to read Jane Eyre or Oliver Twist to know something of the sorrows of childhood as is witnessed by runaway children and even child suicides."

### John Gill:
1. "Fathers, provoke not your children to anger... lest they be discouraged."
2. "Their spirits be broke through grief and trouble, and they become indolent, sluggish, and unfit for business."
3. "Despairing of having any share in the affections of their parents, disregard their commands, instructions, and corrections, and grow obdurate, stubborn, and rebellious."

### John Wesley:
1. Lest they be discouraged ‚Äî Which may occasion their turning either desperate or stupid.
