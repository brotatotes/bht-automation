# Colossians 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fearing God is demonstrated when we abstain from evil in secret, free from the fear of men. Serving our masters sincerely, with a good heart and liberal mind, is the proper way to fear God. Singleness of heart and without duplicity, we are called to serve with integrity. Even as Christian slaves, we are to obey our earthly lords faithfully, not just when they are watching, but at all times. In doing so, we serve not just men, but also our Lord, Christ.

### John Calvin:
1. "By the former statement he means, that service is done to men in such a way that Christ at the same time holds supremacy of dominion, and is the supreme master. Here, truly, is choice consolation for all that are under subjection, inasmuch as they are informed that, while they willingly serve their masters, their services are acceptable to Christ, as though they had been rendered to him."
2. "From this, also, Paul gathers, that they will receive from him a reward, but it is the reward of inheritance, by which he means that the very thing that is bestowed in reward of works is freely given to us by God, for inheritance comes from adoption."
3. "In the second clause he again comforts servants, by saying that, if they are oppressed by the unjust cruelty of their masters, God himself will take vengeance, and will not, on the ground that they are servants, overlook the injuries inflicted upon them, inasmuch as there is no respect of persons with him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These Christian slaves (Œ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒø) had Christ as lord, but even so they were to obey their lords in the flesh."
2. "Not with eye-service (ŒºŒ∑ ŒµŒΩ ŒøœÜŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒºŒøŒ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒπŒ±ŒπœÇ). Another Pauline word... service while the master's eye was on the slave and no longer."
3. "In singleness of heart (ŒµŒΩ Œ±œÄŒªŒøœÑŒ∑œÑ Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ¥ŒπŒ±œÇ). So in Ephesians 6:5. Old and expressive word from Œ±œÄŒªŒøœÖœÇ (simple, without folds)."
