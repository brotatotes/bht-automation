## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "You must look to Him, not to men, as the source of all Christian reward."
2. "Here the word recompense would appear to be used with a marked reference to their present state of slavery, the compensation."
3. "The last clause, without the 'for,' is best. taken imperatively, as a general comprehension of the course of action prescribed in the former part of the verse: serve ye the Lord Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Knowing that it is from the Lord (the ultimate source of reward), ye shall receive the compensation (or recompense, which will make ample amends for your having no earthly possession as slaves now) consisting of the inheritance."
4. "Serve ye the Lord Christ."
6. "To the Lord and not unto men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of the inheritance. Which consists or is in the inheritance."
2. "For ye serve [γαρ δουλευετε]. Omit for. Some take the verb as imperative, serve ye; but the indicative is better as explaining from the Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye shall receive the recompense. Not pay or reward, but that which is a compensation for the present privations."
2. "Of the inheritance. This is the compensation, the heritage of heaven, full salvation."
3. "Ye serve. The word ‘for’ is to be omitted; and the original may mean either ‘ye serve,’ or ‘serve ye.’ The latter is preferable, summing up in one phrase the contents of all the previous precepts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye shall receive (απολημψεσθε). Future middle indicative of απολαμβανω, old verb, to get back (απο), to recover."
2. "The recompense (ανταποδοσιν). 'The full recompense,' old word, in LXX, but only here in N.T., but ανταποδομα twice (Luke 14:12; Romans 11:9). Given back (απο) in return (αντ)."
3. "Ye serve the Lord Christ (το Κυριω Χριστω δουλευετε). As his slaves and gladly so. Perhaps better as imperatives, keep on serving."

### John Gill:
1. "Though they may receive little or nothing from their earthly and carnal masters; yet they shall be used and treated as children by the Lord, and by whom they will be possessed of an eternal inheritance, after their work and labour is over."
2. "By 'the reward of the inheritance' is meant the heavenly glory, called a reward, because the apostle is speaking to servants and therefore uses language agreeable to them; and who, though they may have no reward in this world, yet as there is a God that judgeth in the earth, there is verily one for them in the world to come."
3. "It is in a way of receiving, and so by gift, as a man can receive nothing but what is given him; and as all grace is in a way of receiving, and therefore boasting in it is excluded, so glory is enjoyed in the same way, and from the same hands, even from Christ."
