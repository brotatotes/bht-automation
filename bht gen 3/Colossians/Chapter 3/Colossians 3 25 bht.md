## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "regard Christ as their Master, and serve Himâ€”seeing that all their wrongs in this world, if they leave them in His hands, will be in due time righted by Him, the just judge, with whom there is no respect of persons."
2. "For he that doeth wrong shall receive...that which he did wrongfully...and there is not respect of persons."
3. "So that in your Christian uprightness and conscientiousness you need not fear that you shall be in the end overborne by the superior power of your masters: there is a judge who will defend and right you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Serve ye the Lord Christ, and leave your wrongs in His hands to put to rights."
2. "For he that doeth wrong shall receive back the wrong which he hath done, and there is no respect of persons."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If the slave do wrong, he shall be punished; but the master who does wrong will not be excused, for there is no respect of persons."
2. "Shall receive."
3. "Respect of persons. In the Old Testament it has, more commonly, a good sense, of kindly reception, favorable regard. In the New Testament always a bad sense, which came to it through the meaning of mask which attached to proswpon face."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But it is disputed whether it is to be applied to the conduct of the masters, or to the servants also. In the former case, it encourages the servants by the fact that their wrongs will be righted; in the latter, it includes the wrong-doing of the servants, their unfaithfulness, as well as the harsh, injurious treatment they suffered."
2. "Men often talk and act as though God always took the part of the poor and of the laboring class. Yet this view makes Him a respecter of persons."

1. "Shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done... and it is fair and square." 
2. "There is no respect of persons... with men, but not with God."
3. "This is a general law of life and of God."

### John Gill:
1. "God will avenge all such injuries, sooner or later."
2. "He regards not the rich more than the poor; he makes no difference between bond and free, the servant and the master."
3. "He will do that which is just and right with regard to them both."
