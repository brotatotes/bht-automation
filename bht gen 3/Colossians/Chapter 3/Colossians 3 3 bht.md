# Colossians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Christian's real life is the outcome of being made partakers with Christ's death, freeing them from worldly attachments. It is only in the resurrection life with Christ that one truly lives. This life remains hidden, concealed together with Christ in God, secure against any intrusion. By dying to sin, the Christian's new spiritual life is no longer entangled with earthly desires but is joined with Christ's risen life. Such a life can never be lost since it is locked away with Christ, beyond reach.

2. "The saint's life is either spiritual, and is a life of grace from Christ, a life of faith on him, and a life of communion with him, and may be distinguished into a life of sanctification, both internal and external, and into a life of justification; or eternal, which is a life free from all the sorrows of this, both outward and inward; a life of perfection and pleasure, of vision and enjoyment of God and Christ, and of fellowship with Father, Son, and Spirit, angels and saints, and which will never end."
