## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Put to death...your members which are upon the earth...fornication, uncleanness, lustfulness, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, for it is idolatry." 
2. "Reduce these to a state of death as regards their actions and desires...they are members of Christ, partakers of his resurrection, renewed after His image."
3. "To serve self, whether by accumulation of goods or by satiety in pleasure, is his object in life. He is therefore an idolater, in the deepest and worst, namely, in the practical significance."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:

3. "Lust is not an unsuitable rendering of this passage."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Kill once for all, is the thought of the original."
