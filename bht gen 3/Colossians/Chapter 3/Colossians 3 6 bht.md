# Colossians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Covetousness, which amounts to idolatry, brings God's wrath. The all-encompassing sin negates God and arouses His especial anger. The present tense denotes the certainty of future events, such as the coming wrath of God. Witnessing His wrath upon the wicked is a deterrent to sinning and a reminder of God's displeasure and judgments already administered for sin. Therefore, it is crucial to mortify and abstain from covetousness and other sins, taking them seriously as they are not matters of indifference.
