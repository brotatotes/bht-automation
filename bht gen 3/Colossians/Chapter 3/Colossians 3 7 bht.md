# Colossians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Living and walking differ: living precedes walking. We once lived and walked in the sins and vices of the world, but now, having died to those sins through Christ, it is unseemly for us to continue indulging in them. Our conduct and condition agreed in our previous pagan state, but now we must mortify sin by denying it and living righteously. This contrast in living and walking signifies a withdrawal from those sinful practices and the progression towards a life that is sober, righteous, and godly.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When we were alive to the sins and vices of the world, we regulated our course and walked in them. However, it is important to note that living and walking are distinct from each other - living precedes walking. This is not a tautological claim, as seen in Galatians 5:25, where it is said, If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk. Our previous way of life, characterized by these sins, was the element in which we lived, and so it is no wonder that we also walked in them. The living comes first, and the walking follows. The living in the Spirit necessarily leads to walking in the Spirit. Our conduct and our condition aligned in our previous pagan state, but now that we have died to these sins through Christ, it is unseemly for us to continue in them. We are called to mortify sin, denying it and living a life that is sober, righteous, and godly. Living denotes the inward principle, while walking refers to the outward acts.
