# Colossians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Now that we are no longer living in them, as believers we should also put away the whole set of sinful behaviors, including abusive conversation and foul language. This means avoiding want of charity, kindness in thought and word, and sins of uncleanness. Our speech should be characterized by kindness and purity, and we should separate ourselves from all sins and vices. Let us lay them aside as dead weights, putting off anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, and filthy communication, so that they do not come out of our mouths.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But now (that ye are no longer living in them: opposed to 'once... when' above) do ye also (as well as other believers) put away the whole..." 
2. "foul language (the context makes it more probable here, than 'filthy conversation,' that this means 'abusive conversation,' for these four regard want of charity, of kindness in thought and word, rather than sins of uncleanness, which were before enumerated)"
3. "lay ye aside"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Do ye also put away all these."
2. "Reviling," "evil-speaking."
3. "Foul language" best retains the ambiguity of the original.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But now ye also put off all these - All these which follow, as being also inconsistent with the Christian calling."

2. "Not merely filthy talking, but foul-mouthed abuse."
3. "As ch. 2 20-22 suggests Christ's words in Matthew 14:1-20, this phrase suggests Matthew 14:11, Matthew 14:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the power and nature of mortification are such, that all corrupt affections are extinguished in us, lest sin should afterwards produce in us its wonted fruits."
2. "What I have rendered indignationem , (indignation,) is in the Greek Œ∏œÖŒº·ΩπœÇ ‚Äî a term, which denotes a more impetuous passionateness than ·ΩÄœÅŒ≥·Ω¥, (anger.)"

1. "But now, in contrast with ‚Äòonce‚Äô (Colossians 3:7), ye also, as well as other Christians, put off, as garments are put off, all these, ‚Äòthe whole of them,‚Äô including the sins named in Colossians 3:5, as well as those now mentioned." 
2. "Anger, wrath, malice (these three form a climax), evil speaking (lit., ‚Äòblasphemy‚Äô)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Put ye also away (Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒ∏Œµ Œ∫Œ± œÖŒºŒµŒπœÇ). Second aorist middle imperative of old verb Œ±œÄŒøœÑŒπŒ∏Œ∑Œº, to put away, lay aside like old clothes."

3. "Such language should never come out of the mouth of a Christian living the new life in Christ."

### John Gill:

2. "Filthy communication is the same with that which is said to be corrupt." 
3. "Obscene language, unchaste words, and filthy talking, which tend to encourage and cherish the sin of uncleanness in any of its branches."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wrath ‚Äî Is lasting anger."
2. "Filthy discourse ‚Äî And was there need to warn even these saints of God against so gross and palpable a sin as this?"
