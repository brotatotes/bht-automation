## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Fellow-prisoner" belongs to the same image of warfare, as "fellow-soldier."
2. Mark... accompanied Paul and Barnabas in part of their first missionary journey, and because he turned back from them at Perga, was the subject of dispute between them on their second journey.
3. It is very possible, that in consequence of the rejection of John Mark on that occasion by St. Paul, the Pauline portion of the churches may have looked upon him with suspicion.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Greek for 'fellow prisoner' is literally, fellow captive, an image from prisoners taken in warfare, Christians being 'fellow soldiers' whose warfare is 'the good fight of faith.'" 
2. "The family belonged to Cyprus; this accounts for Barnabas' choice of Cyprus as the first station on their journey, and for Mark's accompanying them readily so far, it being the country of his family."
3. "Hence, though Paul had not personally visited the Colossian Church, they knew of the past unfaithfulness of Mark; and needed this recommendation of him, after the temporary cloud on him, so as to receive him, now that he was about to visit them as an evangelist."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He, together with Gaius, had been seized in the tumult at Ephesus and treated with violence, but he adhered to the apostle in all his troubles, and attended him all his perils."
2. "They afterward became reconciled, and Paul mentions Mark here with affection. He sent for him when he sent Tychicus to Ephesus, and it seems that he had come to him in obedience to his request."
3. "Paul retained no malice, and now commended, in the warmest manner, one from whom he was formerly constrained to separate."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All the three terms fellow-prisoner, fellow-servant, fellow-worker - might be applied to both."
2. "Reasons unknown to us may easily have determined the use of one word or the other, independently of the question as to the particular time when they were in imprisonment."
3. "This incidental notice explains why Barnabas should have taken a more favorable view of Mark's defection than Paul."

### John Calvin:
1. "From this it appears that there were others that were associated with Paul, after he was brought to Rome."
2. "They were careful in furnishing attestations, that they might distinguish good men from false brethren â€” from pretenders, from impostors, and multitudes of vagrants."
3. "The same care is more than simply necessary at the present day, both because good teachers are coldly received, and because credulous and foolish men lay themselves too open to be deceived by impostors."

2. "He is also mentioned 2 Timothy 4:11."
3. "Barnabas being so great a man as he was, and so well known, it added some credit to Mark, that he was a relation of his."
