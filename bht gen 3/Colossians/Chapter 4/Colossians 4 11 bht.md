# Colossians 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These only, who are of the circumcision, proved a comfort to me, as the Judaistic teachers were generally opposed to me. Justus, a common name among the Jews, implies that Epaphras, Luke, and Demas were not of the circumcision, aligning with Luke's Gentile name and his Gospel's Gentile aspect. These Jewish Christians were my sole fellow workers towards the kingdom of God, offering solace and exhortation during my afflictions and sufferings.

2. "This implies that Epaphras, Luke, and Demas (Colossians 4:12; Colossians 4:14) were not of the circumcision. This agrees with Luke's Gentile name (the same as Lucanus), and the Gentile aspect of his Gospel." 
3. "These only, c.‚Äînamely, of the Jews. For the Jewish teachers were generally opposed to the apostle of the Gentiles (Philippians 1:15). Epaphras, &c., were also fellow laborers, but Gentiles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And Jesus, who is called Justus - The name Jesus was probably that which he bore among the Jews. Justus is a Roman name, and was probably that by which he was known among the Romans."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means, therefore, that there were few Jews at Rome who shewed themselves to be helpers to the gospel, nay more, that the whole nation was opposed to Christ."
2. "At the same time, by workers he means those only who were endowed with gifts that were necessary for promoting the gospel."
3. "He calls the gospel the kingdom of God, for it is the scepter by which God reigns over us, and by means of it we are singled out to life eternal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This indicates the general antagonism of the Jewish Christians."
2. "A touching allusion to the trials he encountered from the Judaizers."
3. "The use of the term 'fellow-worker' seems to oppose this view."
