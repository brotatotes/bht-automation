## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This Luke has ever been taken for the Evangelist."
2. "In the designation, the beloved physician, there may be a trace of what has been supposed, that it was in a professional capacity that he first became attached to St. Paul."
3. "The absence of any honourable or endearing mention here may be owing to the commencement of this apostasy, or some unfavourable indication in his character."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is conjectured that Luke 'the beloved physician' (the same as the Evangelist), may have first become connected with Paul in professionally attending on him in the sickness under which he labored in Phrygia and Galatia."
2. "Thus the allusion to his medical profession is appropriate in writing to men of Phrygia."
3. "Perhaps, already, his real character was betraying itself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The miraculous power of healing, possessed by the Saviour and his apostles, contributed much to the success of their preaching."
2. "For the power of alleviating pain of body - of restoring to health by miracles, would not only be an evidence of the divine origin of their mission - a credential that they were sent from God."
3. "One of the best qualifications in missionaries in modern times, in order to gain access to the pagan, is an acquaintance with the healing art."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Luke - Demas. See on Philippians 1:24. 
The beloved physician. See Introduction to Luke.


### John Calvin:
1. "I do not agree with those who understand this to be Luke the Evangelist; for I am of opinion that he was too well known to stand in need of such a designation."
2. "He would, undoubtedly, have called him his fellow-helper, or at least his companion and participant in his conflicts."
3. "I rather conjecture that he was absent at that time, and that it is another of the same name that is called a physician, to distinguish him from the other."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Luke, the beloved physician; undoubtedly the Evangelist, not to be confounded with Lucius...He may have been known at ColossÃ¦, but his gospel could scarcely have been known there, if indeed it was written so early." 
2. "The word 'beloved' is emphatic ('the physician, the beloved one'), giving prominence to his relation to Paul."
3. "The absence of any honorable or endearing mention here [referring to Demas] may be owing to the commencement of this apostasy, or some unfavorable indication in his character."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke, the beloved physician... The author of the Gospel and the Acts." 
2. "Both Mark and Luke are with Paul at this time, possibly also with copies of their Gospels with them." 
3. "It is beautiful to see preacher and physician warm friends in the community."

### John Gill:
1. "Luke the Evangelist, though some doubt it, is here intended, who was a constant companion of the apostle in his troubles, and went with him to Rome."
2. "Luke came to Christ, and being taught by him, became one of the seventy disciples."
3. "The apostle calls him 'beloved', not on account of his profession, in which he might be useful to many, but as he was a brother in Christ, a minister of the Gospel, and a fellow labourer of his."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke, the physician â€” Such he had been, at least, if he was not then.
