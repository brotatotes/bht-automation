# Colossians 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Colossians are instructed to read the epistle sent from Laodicea, which may refer to the Epistle to the Ephesians or an unidentified letter. The apostles desired their letters to be read not only by the original recipients but also by others, serving as a permanent source of instruction for all believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "an epistle which I have written to Laodicea, to be forwarded from thence to you."
2. "We may safely say that a letter not from, but to the Laodiceans is meant."
3. "Cause, before that, is of course to be supplied."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Epistles from the apostles were publicly read in the church assemblies."
2. "The Holy Spirit inspired Paul to write...Epistles which He saw necessary for that day, and for particular churches."
3. "It is possible that...the Epistle to the Ephesians was to be read in various churches besides Ephesus, and that Laodicea was the last of such churches before Colosse, whence he might designate the Epistle to the Ephesians here as 'the Epistle from Laodicea.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostles designed that the letters which they addressed to the churches should be read also by others, and should become the permanent source of instruction to the friends of Christ."
2. "Laodicea, here referred to, was the seat of one of the 'Seven churches' of Asia...It was situated on the river Lycus and stood at the southwestern angle of Phrygia."
3. "In the midst of one of the finest plains of Asia Minor, [Laodicea] is entirely without inhabitant...The ruins of Laodicea and Hierapolis are very extensive."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The epistle from Laodicaea. That is, the letter left at Laodicaea, and to be obtained by you from the church there." 
2. "This letter cannot be positively identified." 
3. "The composition known as the Epistle to the Laodicaeans is a late and clumsy forgery, existing only in Latin MSS., and made up chiefly of disconnected passages from Philippians, with a few from other epistles."

### John Calvin:
1. "The same view must also be taken of all the Epistles. They were indeed, in the first instance, addressed to particular Churches, but, as they contain doctrine that is always in force, and is common to all ages, it is of no importance what title they bear, for the subject matter belongs to us."
2. "I have no doubt that it was an Epistle that had been sent to Paul, the perusal of which might be profitable to the Colossians, as neighboring towns usually have many things in common."
3. "There was, however, an exceedingly gross imposture in the circumstance that some worthless person, I know not who, had the audacity to forge, under this pretext, an Epistle, that is so insipid, that nothing can be conceived to be more foreign to Paul's spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And when this (lit. â€˜theâ€™) epistle hath been read among you. The tense used must be thus rendered in English; there is no necessary reference to public reading."
2. "The only theories which are tenable are, (1) that the Epistle to the Ephesians is referred to; (2) that the letter to Laodicea has not been preserved. No other of the known Pauline Epistles can be referred to."
3. "The most probable view is therefore that which accepts the limited encyclical character of the Epistle to the Ephesians, and regards it as here referred to."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "When this epistle hath been read among you... The epistle was read in public to the church."
2. "Cause that... the Epistle."
3. "The most likely meaning is that the so-called Epistle to the Ephesians was a circular letter to various churches in the province of Asia, one copy going to Laodicea and to be passed on to Colossae as the Colossian letter was to be sent on to Laodicea."

### John Gill:
1. "And when this epistle is read amongst you...being sent not to any particular person, or persons, but to the whole body, and for their general good and instruction."
2. "his reason might be, not only because this church was near them, but because it was in much the same situation, being infested with the same sort of false teachers; and therefore what was said to the one, was pertinent to the other."
3. "from Colossians 2:1 it appears, that the apostle had not been at Laodices when he wrote this, and had not so much as seen any of the faces of the brethren there in the flesh; it therefore seems rather to be an epistle which was sent from Laodicea to him, or to the Colossians; which having something in it very instructive and useful, the apostle desires it might be publicly read."

### John Wesley:
1. The epistle from Laodicea â€” Not to Laodicea. Perhaps some letter had been written to St. Paul from thence.
