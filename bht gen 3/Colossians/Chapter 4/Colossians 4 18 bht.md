## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were ever to keep before them the fact that one who so deeply cared for them, and loved them, and to whom their perils of false doctrine occasioned such anxiety, was a prisoner in chains."
2. "When we read of 'his chains,' we should not forget that they moved over the paper as he wrote. His right hand was chained to the soldier that kept him."
3. "'The grace' in which we stand (Rom. v. 2): it seems to be a form of valediction belonging to the later period of the Epistles of St. Paul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul's autograph salutation, attesting that the preceding letter, though written by an amanuensis, is from himself."
2. "When we read of his chains, we should not forget that they moved over the paper as he wrote; his [right] hand was chained to the [left hand of the] soldier who kept him." 
3. "Grace be with you - Greek, 'THE grace' which every Christian enjoys in some degree, and which flows from God in Christ by the Holy Ghost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Remember my bonds - Also evidently written by his own hand, to make the injunction more impressive; compare the notes at Hebrews 13:3. The meaning is, that they should not forget him in his confinement. They should remember that he was suffering on their account (Notes, Colossians 1:24), and that he was entitled to every expression of sympathy and love."
2. "Grace be with you - Notes, Romans 16:20."
3. "The salutation by the hand of me Paul - Probably the rest of the Epistle was written by an amanuensis. As was his custom, Paul affixed his own hand to it in the form of a salutation; compare the 1 Corinthians 16:21 note; 2 Thessalonians 3:17 note."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The letter was written by an amanuensis, Paul adding his autograph."
2. "Grace be with you."
3. "This short form occurs only here, 1 Timothy 6:21; 2 Timothy 4:22."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These autograph salutations were to attest the genuineness of the document, as is shown in 2 Thessalonians 3:17; comp. the salutation of the amanuensis in Romans 16:22."
2. "A touching exhortation, speaking vividly to the hearts of his readers, and breathing patience, love, and encouragement."
3. "That the grace of God in Christ was all-sufficient need not be proved at the close of an Epistle whose theme is; Christ the Head of all things."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of me Paul with mine own hand (œÑŒ∑ ŒµŒºŒ∑ œáŒµŒπœÅ Œ†Œ±œÖŒªŒøœÖ). More precisely, 'with the hand of me Paul.'" (Commentary)
2. "The genitive Œ†Œ±œÖŒªŒøœÖ is in apposition with the idea in the possessive pronoun ŒµŒºŒ∑, which is itself in the instrumental case agreeing with œáŒµŒπœÅ." (Commentary)
3. "The chain (ŒµŒΩ Œ±ŒªœÖœÉŒµ Ephesians 6:20) clanked afresh as Paul took the pen to sign the salutation." (Commentary)

### John Gill:
1. "Remember my bonds; this he says, partly that they might be animated to abide by the Gospel, for which, as he had told them before, Colossians 4:3 that he was in bonds."
2. "Grace be with you, Amen; which is common to all his epistles, and well suits them; in which he so much displays the grace of God, as it is expressed in the Gospel."
3. "This epistle is said to be written from Rome to the Colossians, by Tychicus and Onesimus... that it was inscribed to the Colossians, there is no doubt; and that it was written from Rome is clear enough, since by several expressions it is plain that he was now a prisoner, and in bonds."
