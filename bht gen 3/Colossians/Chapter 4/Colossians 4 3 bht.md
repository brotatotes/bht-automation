# Colossians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pray for a door to open, an opportunity for the Gospel to be extended through the word. Like Paul, who sought liberation as a prisoner in order to proclaim the mystery of Christ, we should actively seek support from the prayers of others. This request not only highlights the importance of preaching the Gospel but also serves as an encouragement for other preachers who may be facing limitations. Let us pray for open doors, boldness to share the word, and receptive hearts ready to hear the message of Christ.

2. "Not only, therefore, ought each of us to pray for his brethren, but we ought also, on our part, diligently to seek help from the prayers of others, as often as occasion requires."
3. "He fearlessly makes his own life a secondary matter, as compared with the glory of Christ and the spread of the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That (indicating the purport and purpose of the petition) God would open onto us a door for the word." 
2. "To speak (to this end that I may speak) the mystery of Christ; belonging to Christ."

1. "The apostle desires they would pray for him, and his fellow ministers, and which he says not in dissimulation, under a guise of humility, but in true humility and lowliness of mind."
2. "God would open to us a door of utterance; or 'of the word'; so the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic; and Ethiopic versions; meaning, either the word of the Gospel, that the door of that might be opened, that it might have a free course, and be glorified."

2. "Give us utterance, that we may open our mouth boldly."
3. "Give us an opportunity of speaking, so that none may be able to hinder."
