# Ephesians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through our hope in the Messiah, we who have previously hoped in Christ are called to be to the praise of His glory. As Jewish Christians who had the promise before the coming of the Messiah, we not only praise God but become a praise, illustrating the glory of His goodness and grace. Our predestination aims for the praise of His glory to be made known, ascribing all to His grace. Having first trusted in Christ, we lean on Him, commit all to Him, and expect all good things from Him.
