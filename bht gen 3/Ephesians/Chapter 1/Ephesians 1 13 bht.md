# Ephesians 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word of truth, the Gospel of your salvation, is the instrument of the new birth, unmixed with human traditions or wisdom. The Spirit, like a seal, impresses the image of our Father on the soul at regeneration, guaranteeing the validity of our contract with Him. This seal is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of promise, who was announced as the Spirit by many prophets. It is through Him that we, both Jews and Gentiles, receive the full assurance of all the promises of God.
