## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To His God, Christ also in the days of His flesh prayed, 'Father, glorify thy Son:â€™ and even more markedly in that last cry, 'My God, my God.'"
2. "The eyes of the heart would be those pointed at in Matt. vi. 22, 23,â€”that inner eye of the heart, through which light is poured in on its own purposes and motives, and it looks out on, and perceives, and judges things spiritual: the eye, as in nature, being both receptive and contemplative of the light."
3. "That you may know what is the hope of His calling, what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the God of our Lord Jesusâ€”appropriate title here; as in :- he treats of God's raising Jesus to be Head over all things to the Church."
2. "the Father of gloryâ€”The Father of that infinite glory which shines in the face of Christ, who is 'the glory' (the true Shekinah); through whom also 'the glory of the inheritance' shall be ours."
3. "the spirit of wisdomâ€”whose attribute is infinite wisdom and who works wisdom in believers; and revelationâ€”whose function it is to reveal to believers spiritual mysteries."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The particular reason why Paul here speaks of him as 'the God of the Lord Jesus' is, that he prays that they might be further acquainted with the Redeemer, and be enlightened in regard to the great work which he came to do."
2. "May give unto you the Spirit of wisdom...revealing to you more and more of the character of the Redeemer, and of the nature and results of his work."
3. "However far Christians may have advanced in knowledge and in love, there is an unfathomed depth of knowledge which they may still explore, and which they should be exhorted still to attempt to fathom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Father to whom the glory belongs. Note the article, the glory, preeminently." 
2. "The Spirit of wisdom and revelation...He imparts general illumination (wisdom) and special revelations of divine mysteries."
3. "The condition is not merely acknowledgment, but knowledge. Epignwsiv knowledge is never ascribed to God in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "The knowledge of the godly is never so pure, but that some dimness or obscurity hangs over their spiritual vision."
2. "The gifts of the Spirit are not the gifts of nature. Till the Lord opens them, the eyes of our heart are blind. Till the Spirit has become our instructor, all that we know is folly and ignorance."
3. "In the knowledge of him. This might also be read, In the knowledge of himself. Both renderings agree well with the context, for he that knows the Son knows also the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This petition is a warrant for our expecting spiritual illumination in the study of Godâ€™s revelation; but it does not justify our looking for new revelations beyond or contrary to the simple teachings of Godâ€™s word, or confounding inspiration and illumination in the interest of mystical self-conceit."
2. "The absence of the article does not render the phrase indefinite, nor indicate a reference to the human spirit."
3. "The word used in the original suggests something hoped for, but dependent on the will of another."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "God the Father is the God of Christ."
2. "He is a glorious father to the saints, to whom he has shown inexpressible love."
3. "The Spirit is the gift of God; and all spiritual light and knowledge, and the increase of it, are owing to him."

### John Wesley:
