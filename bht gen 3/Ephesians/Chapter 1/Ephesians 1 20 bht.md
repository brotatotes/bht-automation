## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The raising of Christ is not only an earnest of our bodies being hereafter raised, but has a spiritual power in it involving (by virtue of our living union with Him, as members with the Head) the resurrection, spiritually of the believer's soul now, and, consequently, of his body hereafter."
2. "The Son, too, as God (though not as man), had a share in raising His own human body."
3. "Where He remains till all His enemies have been put under His feet... He shall resign His commission after their subjection."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'power' which was then exerted was as great as that of creation. It was imparting life to a cold and 'mangled' frame."
2. "It is impossible to conceive of a more direct exertion of 'power' than in raising up the dead; and there is no more striking illustration of the nature of conversion than in such a resurrection."
3. "The idea is, that great power was displayed by this, and that a similar exhibition is made when man is renewed and exalted to the high honor of being made an heir of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He wrought: The verb is kindred with working." 
2. "Christ's dead body was the point on which this working of divine power was exhibited."
3. "In the heavenly places: Local. Not merely of a spiritual state, which does not suit the local expressions made to sit and right hand."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ alone, therefore, is the mirror in which we can contemplate that which the weakness of the cross hinders from being clearly seen in ourselves."
2. "We shall find our advantage in directing our views to Christ, that in him, as in a mirror, we may see the glorious treasures of Divine grace, and the unmeasurable greatness of that power, which has not yet been manifested in ourselves."
3. "The expression does not refer to any bodily posture, but denotes the highest royal power with which Christ has been invested."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Which he wrought, or, ‚Äòhath wrought.‚Äô Good authorities support the latter reading, which presents the matter as an accomplished fact with permanent results." 
2. "It is a shallow exposition which regards ‚ÄòChrist‚Äôs resurrection as merely a pledge of our bodily resurrection, or as a mere figure representing our spiritual resurrection not as involving the resurrection of the church in both senses." 
3. "Christ‚Äôs present bodily existence is a reality; to explain this away is to adopt the most capricious method of interpretation. In some proper sense He is enthroned with the Father, and that throne is ‚Äòin the heavenly places.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "HŒ∑ŒΩ is cognate accusative of the relative referring to ŒµŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ (energy) with ŒµŒΩŒ∑œÅŒ≥Œ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ and note also Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒøœÖœÇ (strength) and ŒπœÉœáœÖŒøœÇ (might), three words trying to express what surpasses (œÖœÄŒµœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ) expression or comprehension."
2. "Made him to sit (Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒπœÉŒ±œÇ). First aorist active participle of Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒπŒ∂œâ in causative sense as in 1 Corinthians 6:4."
3. "Metaphorical local expression like Œ¥ŒµŒæŒπŒ± and ŒµŒΩ œÑŒøŒπœÇ ŒµœÄŒøœÖœÅ ŒµŒ±ŒΩŒπŒøŒπœÇ."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's resurrection from the dead was an instance of peculiar and special power."
2. "There is some proportion between the power put forth on Christ in raising him from the dead and that which is exerted in the work of conversion and faith."
3. "The work of faith, of grace and conversion, is the entire work of God, which is begun, carried on, and finished wholly by his power."

### John Wesley:
1. "He hath exalted him in his human nature, as a recompence for his sufferings..." 
2. "To a quiet, everlasting possession of all possible blessedness, majesty, and glory."
3. "Seated him at his own right hand."
