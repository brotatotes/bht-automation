# Ephesians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In adopting us, God is guided by His good pleasure as He predestines and chooses us to become reconciled children and partakers of His divine nature. Our adoption is not based on our personal worth, but on His grace and eternal plan. God's will and glory are foundational to our adoption, as He sovereignly determines the course of our salvation. Our freedom is a direct result of the freedom of God's will, and it is essential to recognize that our adoption rests solely on His benevolence and love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In God, indeed, all is one; but for our human way of speaking and treating, which is necessary to us, there follows on His first decree to adopt and to sanctify, the nearer decision, how and by what this shall be brought about, because it could only thus be brought about."
2. "so that we should become His sons, in the blessed sense of being reconciled to Him and having a place in His spiritual family"
3. "It seems evident that it must follow on the word 'adoption,' and its import must be ‚Äòto [into] Himself,‚Äô‚Äîi. e. so that we should be partakers of the divine nature"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We are 'chosen' out of the rest of the world; 'predestinated' to all things that secure the inheritance for us." 
2. "God has regard to Himself and the glory of His grace as His ultimate end." 
3. "We cannot go beyond 'the good pleasure of His will' in searching into the causes of our salvation, or of any of His works."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What is a nation but a collection of individuals? There is no such abstract being or thing as a nation; and if there was any purpose in regard to a nation, it must have had some reference to the individuals composing it."
2. "If there is 'any' well-founded objection to the doctrine of decrees or predestination, it is to the doctrine 'at all,' alike in regard to nations and individuals, and there are just the same difficulties in the one case as in the other."
3. "The purposes of God correspond exactly to facts as they actually occur, and much of the difficulty is taken away. If in the facts there is no just ground of complaint, there can be none, because it was the 'intention of God that the facts should be so.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Having predestinated [foreordained]. From pro before, oJrizw to define, the latter word being from opov a boundary. Hence to define or determine beforehand." 
2. "Adoption [œÖŒπŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπŒ±ŒΩ]. Never used of Christ." 
3. "Good pleasure [ŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒπŒ±ŒΩ]. Not strictly in the sense of kindly or friendly feeling, but because it pleased Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "In adopting us, therefore, God does not inquire what we are, and is not reconciled to us by any personal worth. His single motive is the eternal good pleasure, by which he predestinated us."
2. "The material cause both of eternal election, and of the love which is now revealed, is Christ, the Beloved. This name is given, to remind us that by him the love of God is communicated to us. Thus he is the well-beloved, in order that we may be reconciled by him."
3. "Every man, therefore, who hides this glory, is endeavoring to overturn the everlasting purpose of God. Such is the doctrine of the sophists, which entirely overturns the doctrine of Christ, lest the whole glory of our salvation should be ascribed undividedly to God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These things, at which men cavil, are prompted by love, and will be apprehended only when men respond in love."
2. "The end of the foreordaining is that we may be placed in the position of sons, enjoy the privileges of sons."
3. "The freedom of God‚Äôs will is here asserted, and for us this thought is an all-important one. If God is not free, then our freedom is impossible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having foreordained us (Œ†œÅŒøŒøœÅŒπœÉŒ±œÇ Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÇ). First aorist active participle of œÄœÅŒøŒøœÅŒπŒ∂œâ, late and rare compound to define or decide beforehand."
2. "Unto adoption as sons (ŒµŒπœÇ œÖŒπŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπŒ±ŒΩ). For this interesting word see Galatians 4:5; Romans 8:15; Romans 9:4."
3. "According to the good pleasure of his will (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒπŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ). Here ŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒπŒ±ŒΩ means purpose like Œ≤ŒøœÖŒªŒ∑ŒΩ in verse Ephesians 1:11 rather than benevolence (good pleasure)."

### John Gill:

Predestination, taken in a large sense, includes both election and reprobation, and even reaches to all affairs and occurrences in the world; to the persons, lives, and circumstances of men; to all mercies, temporal or spiritual; and to all afflictions, whether in love or in wrath." 
2. "by which is meant, either the grace of adoption, which is an act of the Father's love, a blessing provided and secured in the covenant of grace; and is of persons to an inheritance, to which they have no legal right; and is entirely free, there being no need on the adopter's part, and no worth on the part of the adopted."
3. "the will of God is the rule of all his actions, and of all his acts of grace and goodness; and the good pleasure of it appears in the predestination of men to grace and glory"

### John Wesley:
1. "Having predestinated us to the adoption of sons ‚Äî Having foreordained that all who afterwards believed should enjoy the dignity of being sons of God, and joint-heirs with Christ."
