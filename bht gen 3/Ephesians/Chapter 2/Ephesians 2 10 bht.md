# Ephesians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are God's work, created in Christ Jesus for good works that he has prearranged and assigned to each of us.

We are his making, formed by his hand to be good, and everything good in us is his creation. As God's workmanship, we are created unto good works, not to be justified by them, but to walk in them.

3. "The proper meaning of this passage is, 'to which ŒøŒπÃîÕÇœÇ hois good works God has predestinated us, or appointed us beforehand, that we should walk in them.'
