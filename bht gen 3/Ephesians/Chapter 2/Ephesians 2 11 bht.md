## BHT:
The Gentiles in Ephesus are urged to remember their previous state of uncircumcision and the contemptuous label the Uncircumcision. This remembrance serves to deepen their gratitude and faith. While the Jews prided themselves in their physical circumcision, the true circumcision is of the heart and is made by Christ. The contrast between the external symbol and the inward reality heightens the Gentiles' gratefulness for being elevated above the uncircumcised nations as Christians.
