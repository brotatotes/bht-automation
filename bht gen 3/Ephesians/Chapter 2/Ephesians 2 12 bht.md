# Ephesians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gentiles were once alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and the covenants of the promise, rendering them without hope and without God in the world. However, through Christ, they are no longer separated from this spiritual commonwealth, and are able to partake in the promise of salvation. Without Christ, they would remain without a church, without any promise of hope, godless, and without a spiritual home in the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The promise' is singular, to signify that the covenant, in reality, and substantially, is one and the same at all times, but only different in its accidents and external circumstances."
3. "Epicurus and Aristotle did not believe in it at all. The Platonists believed the soul passed through perpetual changes, now happy, and then again miserable; the Stoics, that it existed no longer than till the time of the general burning up of all things."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle is to remind them of the deplorable condition in which they were by nature; and nothing would better express it than to say they were 'without Christ,' or that they had no knowledge of a Saviour."
2. "Many were infidels. Many were scoffers. Many were profane, sensual, corrupt. Many rejected Christ with scorn; many, by simple neglect."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul speaks ideally of a spiritual commonwealth in which Jew and Gentile were together at peace with God."

### John Calvin:
1. "But for him that is without Christ, there remains nothing but destruction."
2. "Take away the covenant of salvation, and there remains no hope."
3. "Out of Christ there are none but idols."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This was the state of the Gentiles. What follows is an expansion of the meaning of this phrase, not something additional, or confirmatory."
2. "The reference is not to a civil constitution, or to citizenship, but rather to the theocratic spiritual privileges which the Jewish people possessed."
3. "The whole verse asserts that they were, as Gentiles, deprived of Christ, and this meant, without church, without promise, hopeless, godless, homeless."
