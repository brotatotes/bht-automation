# Ephesians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, He and none other, is our peace in the widest sense. He Himself reconciled and united us to God and one another, destroying the enmity through His flesh. In Him, both Jew and Gentile become one, as race and national distinctions vanish. The wall of separation, represented by the Sinaitic law, was broken down by Christ, who is not just our peacemaker but our very peace itself. This refers to the wall in the temple dividing the Gentiles from Israel and symbolizes the Mosaic economy that separated them.

"Christ is the author of peace between God and his people; there is naturally in man an enmity to God; sin has separated chief friends; nor can man make his peace with God; what he does, or can do, will not do it; and what will, he cannot do; Christ is the only fit and proper person for this work."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is our peace - Not only as he purchased it, but as he is the very bond and centre of union."
2. "He who hath made both - Jews and gentiles, one church."
