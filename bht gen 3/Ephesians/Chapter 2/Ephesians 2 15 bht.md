## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ has in, or by, His crucified flesh, abolished it, so far as its condemning and enmity-creating power is concerned, substituting for it the law of love, which is the everlasting spirit of the law, and which flows from the realization in the soul of His love in His death for us." 
2. "Not that He might merely reconcile the two to each other, but incorporate the two, reconciled in Him to God, into one new man; the old man to which both belonged, the enemy of God, having been slain in His flesh on the cross."
3. "We are all in God's sight but one in Christ, as we are but one in Adam."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not by instruction merely... but by his flesh - his human nature - and this can mean only that he did it by his sacrifice of himself."
2. "The Jews looked upon themselves as the favorites of heaven... the Gentiles regarded their laws with contempt... When Christ came and abolished by his death their special ceremonial laws, of course the cause of this alienation ceased."
3. "The idea is, that as two persons who had been at enmity, might become reconciled and be one in aim and pursuit, so it was in the effect of the work of Christ on the Jews and Gentiles."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Enmity is then an explanation of the previous figure, and must refer to the enmity between Jews and Gentiles. Yet not to this alone, 'but also, and as the widening context shows, more especially to the alienation of both Jew and Gentile from God.'"
2. "It was thus that the 'enmity' was broken down, namely, by the doing away of that 'law' which was the exponent of the enmity, not only as between Jew and Gentile, but as between man and God."
3. "'The ground of the existence and permanence is in Him; He is the author and foundation, and at the same time the life-sphere, creator, and second Adam, progenitor of the new race, which stands in the original peace with God.'"
