# Ephesians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By Christ's crucified flesh, He abolished the enmity and condemning power, making Jews and Gentiles one new man. The enmity was a result of the law, regarded as a separative system, but Christ dissolved the middle wall of partition through His sacrifice. This brought reconciliation, unity, and a new creation. Circumcision or uncircumcision no longer matters since the mark of difference has been taken away. Grace now admits both Jew and Gentile equally into fellowship, making them one new man in Christ.
