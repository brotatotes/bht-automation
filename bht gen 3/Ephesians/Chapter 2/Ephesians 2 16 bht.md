# Ephesians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through His cross, Christ accomplished an incredible act of reconciliation, not only restoring favor and laying aside enmity, but completely transforming hostility into complete reconciliation. His sacrificial death on the cross not only removed the enmity between man and God, but also eliminated the division between Jew and Gentile. Christ's death on the cross was the foundation for this profound reconciliation, as it brought peace and established a new unity among those who were far off (Gentiles) and those who were near (Jews) in the body of Christ, the Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Translate, 'might altogether reconcile them both in one body (the Church, :-) unto God through His cross.' The Greek for 'reconcile' (apocatalaxe), found only here and in Colossians 1:20, expresses not only a return to favor with one (catallage), but so to lay aside enmity that complete amity follows; to pass from enmity to complete reconciliation."
2. "Slain the enmityâ€”namely, that had been between man and God; and so that between Jew and Gentile which had resulted from it. By His being slain, He slew it."
3. "Therebyâ€”Greek, 'therein'; 'in' or 'by the cross,' that is, His crucifixion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not merely to make them harmonious, but it was that both, who had been alienated from God, should be reconciled to 'him.'"
2. "They who are reconciled to God will be at peace with each other. They will feel that they are of the same family, and are all brethren."
3. "He has by that death removed all the obstacles to reconciliation on the part of God and on the part of man. It is made efficacious in removing the enmity of the sinner against God, and producing peace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb contains a hint of restoration to a primal unity."
2. "You which were afar off. Gentiles."
3. "Peace upon peace to those who are far and to those who are near."

### John Calvin:
1. "Without this, neither the Law, nor ceremonies, nor their descent from Abraham, nor all their dazzling prerogatives, would be of any avail."
2. "Sin is the cause of enmity between God and us; and, until it is removed, we shall not be restored to the Divine favor."
3. "These words, which unquestionably relate to the cross, may admit of two senses, â€” either that Christ, by his death, has turned away from us the Fatherâ€™s anger, or that, having redeemed both Jews and Gentiles, he has brought them back into one flock."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reference is not to Christâ€™s human body, but to his mystical body (comp. chap. Ephesians 1:23), the church."
2. "Through the crossâ€™ points to the expiatory sacrifice of Christ as the ground of the reconciliation, in accordance with the teaching of the entire Bible."
3. "The enmity is â€˜that between man and God, which Christ did slay on the cross, and which being brought to an end, the separation between Jew and Gentile which was the result of it, was done awayâ€™(Alford)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Final clause with Î¹Î½Î± understood of first aorist active subjunctive of Î±Ï€Î¿ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î»Î»Î±ÏƒÏƒÏ‰ for which see Colossians 1:20; Colossians 1:22." 
2. "Paul piles up metaphors to express his idea of the Kingdom of God with Christ as King (the church, the body, the commonwealth of Israel, oneness, one new man in Christ, fellow-citizens, the family of God, the temple of God)."
3. "On the Cross where he slew the enmity (repeated here) between Jew and Gentile."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ by fulfilling it for them, and thereby abrogating it, reconciled them."
2. "reconciliation with others depends upon reconciliation with him."
3. "reconciliation being so effectually made by it that there is no need of a reiteration"

### John Wesley:
1. In one body â€” One church.
Having slain â€” By his own death on the cross.
The enmity â€” Which had been between sinners and God.
