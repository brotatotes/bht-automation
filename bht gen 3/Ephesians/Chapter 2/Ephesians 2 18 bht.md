# Ephesians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through Christ, both Jews and Gentiles have access to God and are united in one Spirit. This access is not limited to a select few, but is available to all believers. The oneness of the Spirit, through which we have our access, is followed by oneness in the body of Christ, the Church. It is only through the mediation of Jesus Christ that we are permitted to approach God and address Him as our Father. Thus, the three persons of the Godhead, Christ, the Spirit, and the Father, all share in the work of our redemption.
