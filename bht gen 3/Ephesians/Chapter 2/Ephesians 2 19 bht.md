# Ephesians 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God. Having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the Head cornerstone, the Lord Himself is built into this household. Formerly excluded, you now belong to the same community as the people of God, sharing their privileges and regarded as His children. This is a great honor, being admitted to the same community as Abraham, the patriarchs, prophets, kings, and even the angels themselves.
