# Ephesians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Christian temple's glory is eternal and real, unlike mere idolatrous gaud. Just as the temple in Jerusalem was the stronghold for Judaism and Diana's temple symbolized paganism, the image of a building is fitting for the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets in the Jew-Christian context. Christ Jesus is both the chief corner stone and the foundation stone, upon which the whole building rests. This spiritual building is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ as the primary foundation stone, holding together the entire edifice.
