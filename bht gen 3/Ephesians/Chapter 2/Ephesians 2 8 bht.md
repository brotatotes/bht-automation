# Ephesians 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is not attained through our own works or merit, but rather by the grace of God. Through faith, which is a gift from God, we are saved. It is important to recognize that this gift of salvation is not something we can achieve on our own; it is entirely bestowed upon us by God's grace. Our part is to have faith, which comes through hearing God's word and prayer. Salvation is not a reward, but a demonstration of God's abundant grace.
