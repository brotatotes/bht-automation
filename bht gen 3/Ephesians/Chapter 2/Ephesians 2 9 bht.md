# Ephesians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is not achieved through works, but solely through God's grace. The purpose of this grace is to eliminate any opportunity for boasting by humanity. The righteousness derived from works cannot procure salvation. Thus, all praise and credit should be directed towards God alone, as our best works are only possible through His grace and can never merit salvation. Consequently, salvation is not obtained by works but is the result of God's unfathomable mercy.
