# Ephesians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is not obtained through our own works, but solely by God's grace. This emphasizes that the righteousness of man, including all his works, is set aside and that salvation is a gift from God. The purpose of this is to ensure that no one can boast in their own works, but only in the Lord. Works do not play any role in earning salvation, as it is given freely by God. Hence, there is no room for boasting, but rather, all glory goes to God for His grace and salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

	stands in contrast to "by grace," as is confirmed by

lestâ€”rather, as Greek,
	"that no man should boast" (Romans 3:27;
	Romans 4:2).

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This resumes the negative side, asserting that salvation does not proceed from works, as a meritorious ground." 
2. "It is obvious that we cannot supply 'faith' here, and this is a strong argument for the view taken of the latter part of Ephesians 2:8."

### John Gill:
1. "Not of works,.... Of any kind, moral or ceremonial, before or after conversion, done without faith or in it, nor of these in any sense; works are neither the moving causes, nor the procuring causes, nor the helping causes, nor 'causa sine qua non', or conditions of salvation..."
2. "...therefore can never merit at his hand: and salvation is put upon such a foot, lest any man should boast; of his works before God, and unto men..."
3. "...whoever glories, may glory in the Lord."

1. Not by works â€” Neither this faith nor this salvation is owing to any works you ever did, will, or can do.
