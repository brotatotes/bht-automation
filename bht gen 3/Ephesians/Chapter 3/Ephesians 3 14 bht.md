# Ephesians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For this cause, because you are so built in and have such a standing in God's Church, I bow my knees towards the Father, not in a physical act but in earnest prayer. The posture affects the mind and is not unimportant, as seen in the practice of Paul and even the Lord Himself on earth. The foundation of sonship rests in Jesus Christ, the gateway to the Father. Thus, pastors, like Paul, should diligently entreat the Lord to bless their labors, looking up for Divine aid. Kneeling expresses reverence, humility, and submission in prayer, recognizing God as the Father of Christ, the only way to approach Him.
