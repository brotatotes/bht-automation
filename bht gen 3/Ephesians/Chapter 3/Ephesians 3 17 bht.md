## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not enough that He be on the tongue, or flit through the brain: the heart is His proper seat."

3. "Love, the first-fruit of the Spirit, flowing from Christ's love realized in the soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith - see the notes, Ephesians 2:22. Expressions like this often occur in the Scriptures, where God is said to dwell in us, and we are said to be the temples of the Holy Spirit."
2. "That ye being rooted - Firmly established - as a tree is whose roots strike deep, and extend afar."
3. "And grounded - Œ∏ŒµŒ∏ŒµŒºŒµŒªŒπœâŒºŒµÃÅŒΩŒøŒπ tethemelioÃÑmenoi - 'founded' - as a building is on a foundation. The word is taken from architecture, where a firm foundation is laid, and the meaning is, that he wished them to be as firm in the love of Christ, as a building is that rests on a solid basis."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "May dwell [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒøŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒ±Œπ]. Settle down and abide. Take up His permanent abode, so that ye may be a habitation [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒøŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ] of God." 
2. "The connection is with the preceding clause: 'to be strengthened, etc., so that Christ may dwell,' the latter words having at once a climactic and an explanatory force, and adding the idea of permanency to that of strengthening."
3. "By faith [Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ]. Through your (the article) faith, as the medium of appropriating Christ. Faith opens the door and receives Him who knocks."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a mistake to imagine that the Spirit can be obtained without obtaining Christ; and it is equally foolish and absurd to dream that we can receive Christ without the Spirit. Both doctrines must be believed." 
2. "By faith we not only acknowledge that Christ suffered and rose from the dead on our account, but, accepting the offers which he makes of himself, we possess and enjoy him as our Savior. This deserves our careful attention." 
3. "Among the fruits of Christ‚Äôs dwelling in us the apostle enumerates love and gratitude for the Divine grace and kindness exhibited to us in Christ. Hence it follows, that this is true and solid excellence."

2. "' Faith' opens the door to Him, appropriates Him, submits to Him so that we become His."
3. "Love is the fundamental grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ is asked to make his home in our hearts. This is the ideal, but a deal of fixing would have to be done in our hearts for Christ."
