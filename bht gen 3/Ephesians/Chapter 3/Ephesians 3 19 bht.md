## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The paradox 'to know... which passeth knowledge,' implies that when he says 'know,' he does not mean that we can adequately know; all we know is, that His love exceeds far our knowledge of it, and with even our fresh accessions of knowledge hereafter, will still exceed them."
2. "Filled, each according to your capacity, with the divine wisdom, knowledge, and love; 'even as God is full,' and as Christ who dwells in your hearts, hath 'all the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Him bodily' (Colossians 2:9)."
3. "The grand goal... filled even unto all the fulness of God."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "To know the love of Christ - The love of Christ toward us; the immensity of redeeming love."
2. "Nothing will so much excite gratitude in our hearts; nothing will prompt us so much to a life of self-denial; nothing will make us so benevolent and so dead to the world."
3. "Religion is not a name. It is not a matter of form. It is not a trifle. It is the richest, best gift of God to man. It ennobles our nature. It more clearly teaches us our true dignity than all the profound discoveries which people can make in science."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To know [Œ≥ŒΩœâŒΩŒ±Œπ]. Practically, through experience; while apprehend marks the knowledge as conception."
2. "Love of Christ. Christ's love to us. Human love to Christ could not be described in these terms. Which passeth knowledge."
3. "That ye might be filled with all the fullness of God [ŒπŒΩŒ± œÄŒªŒ∑œÅœâŒ∏Œ∑œÑŒµ ŒµŒπœÇ œÄŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒø œÄŒªŒ∑œÅœâŒºŒ± œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ]. Fullness of God is the fullness which God imparts through the dwelling of Christ in the heart; Christ, in whom the Father was pleased that all the fullness should dwell."

### John Calvin:
1. "The love of Christ contains within itself the whole of wisdom...that ye may be able to comprehend the love of Christ, which is the length and breadth, and depth, and height, that is, the complete perfection of all wisdom." 
2. "The love of Christ is held out to us as the subject which ought to occupy our daily and nightly meditations, and in which we ought to be wholly plunged. He who is in possession of this alone has enough."
3. "He who has Christ has everything necessary for being made perfect in God; for this is the meaning of the phrase, the fullness of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To have an adequate experimental knowledge of Christ's love which surpasses any abstract knowledge independent of religious experience and Christian gratitude."
2. "Love is the key to love; yet it must be remembered that Christ's love is in itself infinite, and that even when our love is warmest and purest we have not yet fully measured its extent."
3. "'The fulness of God' has been variously explained; comp. Ephesians 1:23. (1.) 'Fulness,' or, 'abundance,' which God imparts, either in gifts of grace, or more generally. (2.) The fulness with which God is filled, the fulness of His spiritual perfections."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All the same Paul dares to scale this peak." 
2. "This sublime climax in Paul's prayer, the ultimate goal for followers of Christ." 
3. "There is nothing that any one can add to these words."

### John Gill:
1. "The love of Christ to his own, to his church and people, is special and peculiar; free and sovereign; as early as his Father's love, and is durable and unchangeable; the greatest love that ever was heard of; it is matchless and unparalleled; it is exceeding strong and affectionate, and is wonderful and surprising." 
2. "The saints have some knowledge of this love, some tastes of it; their knowledge is a feeling and experimental one, fiducial and appropriating, and what influences their faith, and love, and cheerful obedience, but it is but imperfect."
3. "Now the apostle prays, that these saints might know more of this love; that their knowledge, which was imperfect, might be progressive."

### John Wesley:
1. "This only we know, that the love of Christ surpasses all knowledge."
2. "That ye may be filled - Which is the sum of all."
3. "With all the fulness of God ‚Äî With all his light, love, wisdom, holiness, power, and glory."
