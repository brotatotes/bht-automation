## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "to Him (solemn and emphatic repetition of the personal pronoun) be the glory (the whole glory accruing from all His dealings which have been spoken of: His own resulting glory) in the Church"
2. "in the Church (as its theatre before men, in which that glory must be recognized and rendered) and in Christ Jesus (as its inner verity, and essential element in which it abides, The two clauses are not altogether independent: it is ‚Äòin the Church, and [thus] in Christ Jesus‚Äô)"
3. "to all the generations of the age of the ages (so literally. Probably the account of the meaning is, that the age of ages [eternity] is conceived as containing ages, just as our ‚Äòage‚Äô contains years: and then those ages are thought of as made up, like ours, of generations. Like the similar expression, ages of ages, it is used, by a transfer of what we know in time, to express, imperfectly, and indeed improperly, the idea of Eternity)"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Unto Him be the glory... in the Church."

3. "Eternity is made up of ages, and ages of generations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'To Him' sums up emphatically all that has been said..." 
2. "The sphere 'in' which the glory is given is defined in a two-fold manner: 'in the Church,' since here the glory is ascribed; 'in Christ Jesus,' since only in fellowship with Him can it be offered."
3. "This is the literal rendering of an accumulation of terms, peculiar to this passage, but unmistakably pointing to eternity, though its unending duration is set forth in conceptions borrowed from the successive periods of time."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  In the church (ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ ŒµŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπŒ±). The general church, the body of Christ.

3. "For the church will abide forever, in which [glory] is to be given; the blessings of grace will be forever dispensing, for which it is to be given; and Jesus Christ, the Mediator, will continue forevermore, by whom it is given."

### John Wesley:
1. In the church ‚Äî On earth and in heaven.
