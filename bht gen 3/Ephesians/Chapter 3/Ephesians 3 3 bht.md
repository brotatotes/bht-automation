## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "even as I before wrote (not, ‘have before written.’ ‘Before wrote,’ viz. in ch. i. 9 ff.) briefly, whereby (viz. by that which I wrote: not the fact of my having written briefly; as some) ye can, while reading, perceive my un-derstanding in the mystery of Christ"
2. "which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men... it hath been now revealed unto His holy Apostles and Prophets in the Spirit"
3. "that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs and fellow-members and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the Gospel"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That by revelation was the mystery (namely, of the admission of the Gentiles, Ephesians 3:6; Ephesians 1:9) made known unto me (Galatians 1:12)."
2. "As I wrote afore—namely, in this Epistle (Ephesians 1:9; Ephesians 1:10), the words of which he partly repeats."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He refers to the revelation which was made to him when he was called to the apostolic office, that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles." 
2. "The hitherto concealed truth that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles." 
3. "The addition which he makes, 'whereby, when ye read,' etc., seems rather to imply that he refers to what he had just written."

### John Calvin:
1. "The present instance, on account of its novelty, had few supporters; and therefore he calls it a mystery. By this name he endeavors to remove the prejudice which the general displeasure at the event was fitted to excite."
2. "Paul draws the line of distinction between himself and those fanatics, who ascribe to God and to the Holy Spirit their own idle dreams. The false apostles boast of revelations, but it is a false boast."
3. "The phrase, (ἐν ὀλίγῳ,) which Erasmus has translated in a few words, appears rather to refer to time. On this supposition there would be an implied comparison between the present and the former writings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That evidently it was God who made known to him 'the mystery.'"
2. "The mystery of redemption, whose centre is the Person of Christ, whose object and purport is Christ, taking that term as including the Body of which He is the Head, which He has redeemed, and in which the Gentiles are 'fellow-members.'"
3. "In comparison with the wealth of the truth revealed, its fulness, its wide-reaching, deep-moving efficiency, what he writes is to him always little and brief."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By revelation (κατα αποκαλυψιν). Not essentially different from δι' αποκαλυψεως (Galatians 1:12). This was Paul's qualification for preaching 'the mystery' (το μυστηριον. See Ephesians 1:9)."
2. "As I wrote afore (καθως προεγραψα). First aorist active indicative of προγραφω as in Romans 15:4, not picture forth as Galatians 3:1. But when and where? Epistolary aorist for this Epistle? That is possible. A previous and lost Epistle as in 1 Corinthians 5:9? That also is abstractly possible. To the preceding discussion of the Gentiles? Possible and also probable."
3. "In few words (εν ολιγω). Not = προ ολιγου, shortly before, but as in Acts 26:28 'in brief space or time' = συντονως (Acts 24:4), 'briefly'."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel, which is sometimes called a mystery, the mystery of the Gospel, the mystery of godliness, and the mystery of faith."
2. "The several doctrines of the Gospel are the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven."
3. "This was made known to the apostle, not in a mere notional and speculative way, but in a spiritual and saving manner."

### John Wesley:
1. "The mystery — Of salvation by Christ alone, and that both to Jews and gentiles."
2. "As I wrote before — Namely, Ephesians 1:9,10; the very words of which passage he here repeats."
