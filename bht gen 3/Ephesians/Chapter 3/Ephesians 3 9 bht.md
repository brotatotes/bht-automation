### Albert Barnes:
1. "In those 'mysteries' there was a distinction between the initiated and uninitiated. There was a revelation to some of the worshippers, of certain holy secrets from which others were excluded. There were in some of the mysteries, as the Elensinian, 'great and lesser' doctrines in which different persons were initiated. In strong contrast with these, the 'great mystery' in Christianity was made known to all."
2. "It was concealed from none and there was no distinction made among those who were initiated. No truths which God had revealed were held back from any part, but there was a common participation by all."
3. "Christianity has no hidden truths for a part only of its friends; it has no 'reserved' doctrines; it has no truths to be entrusted only to a sacred priesthood. Its doctrines are to be published to the wide world, and every follower of Christ is to be a partaker of all the benefits of the truths which Christ has revealed."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The mystery. The admission of the Gentiles into covenant privileges."
3. "From the beginning of the world [Î±Ï€Î¿ Ï„Ï‰Î½ Î±Î¹Ï‰Î½Ï‰Î½] . Lit., from the ages."

### John Calvin:
1. "The publication of the gospel is called a fellowship, because it is the will of God that his purpose, which had formerly been hidden, shall now be shared by men."
2. "Who will question the right which God has to keep his own purposes concealed, until he shall be pleased to communicate them to men? What presumption, â€” yea, what madness is it, not to admit that God is wiser than we!"
3. "From the creation of the world he concludes, that it is the work of God to enlighten the darkness; but what was visible in the former case is ascribed to the Spirit, when he comes to speak of the kingdom of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not simply to teach all men, but to enlighten all, which is to be accomplished by means of the gospel."
2. "The mystery is the union of the Jews and Gentiles in Christ, not however independently of the wider reference."
3. "Such enlightenment was needed, for this mystery was one which from the beginning of the world had been hid."

3. "See Colossians 1:26."

2. "The ministry of the word is the means of enlightening [men], and is indeed the grand design of it; and the ministers of the Gospel do instrumentally enlighten persons, though it is God only that does it efficiently."
3. "The Gospel...was hid...in the heart of God, in his counsel and covenant...and this was kept so from ages past, from the beginning of time, till now, and was laid up in the breast of God from all eternity; for it was ordained before the world for the glory of his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "What those mysterious blessings are whereof all believers jointly partake."
2. "Which was, in a great measure, hidden from eternity by God."
3. "He, to make way for the free exercise of his love, created all things - This is the foundation of all his dispensations."
