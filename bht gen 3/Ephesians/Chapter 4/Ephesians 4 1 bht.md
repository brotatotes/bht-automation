### Albert Barnes:
1. "Such being your exalted privileges; since God has done so much for you; since he has revealed for you such a glorious system; since he has bestowed on you the honor of calling you into his kingdom, and making you partakers of his mercy, I entreat you to live in accordance with these elevated privileges, and to show your sense of his goodness by devoting your all to his service."
2. "It is to bear our religion with us to all places, companies, employments. Not merely to be a Christian on the Sabbath, and at the communion table, and in our own land, but every day, and everywhere, and in any land where we may be placed."
3. "To 'walk worthy of that calling,' is to live as becomes a Christian, an heir of glory; to live as Christ did. It is to do nothing inconsistent with the most elevated Christian character.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis in the original rests on 'exhort,' as indicated in the order given above. The word means first to call hither (corresponding with 'calling' and 'called'); then, to address, either for exhortation or comfort; it should not be rendered 'beseech.'"
2. "The phrase is apt in this connection: his joyous wearing of his bonds enforces his exhortation, giving it the tone of Christian experience more than of Apostolic dignity."
3. "For the true Christian walk is not obedience to rule, but the expression of loyal and loving allegiance to One, who has done for us what awakens our gratitude and exalts it into personal devotion to Him for what He is."

1. "For the list of virtues here see Colossians 3:12."

3. "Wherewith ye were called (Î·Ï‚ ÎµÎºÎ»Î·Î¸Î·Ï„Îµ). Attraction of the relative Î·Ï‚ to the genitive of the antecedent ÎºÎ»Î·ÏƒÎµÏ‰Ï‚ (calling) from the cognate accusative Î·Î½ with ÎµÎºÎ»Î·Î¸Î·Ï„Îµ (first aorist passive indicative of ÎºÎ±Î»ÎµÏ‰, to call)."

### John Gill:
1. "That ye walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye are called; by which is meant, not that private and peculiar state and condition of life, that the saints are called to, and in, but that calling, by the grace of God, which is common to them all." 
2. "To walk worthy of it, or suitable to it, is to walk as children of the light; to walk in the liberty wherewith Christ and his Spirit make them free; to walk by faith on Christ; and to walk in the ways of God, with Christ, the mark, in their view, and with the staff of promises in their hands."
3. "For this walking, though it refers to a holy life and conversation, a series of good works, yet it does not suppose that these merit calling; rather the contrary, since these follow upon it; and that is used as an argument to excite unto them: but the phrase is expressive of a fitness, suitableness, and agreeableness of a walk and conversation to such rich grace, and so high an honour conferred on saints."

### John Wesley:
1. "I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord" - Imprisoned for his sake and for your sakes. 
2. "For the sake of the gospel which he had preached amongst them." 
3. "This was therefore a powerful motive to them to comfort him under it by their obedience."
