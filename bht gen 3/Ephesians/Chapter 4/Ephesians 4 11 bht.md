# Ephesians 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The pastors mentioned in this verse were not simply individuals filling a role, but rather a divine gift to the Church. They were entrusted with the rule and guidance of the Church as bishops and had a special responsibility for a particular flock. The pastors were not just shepherds, but also had the ability to teach, drawing knowledge from their pastoral experiences. Christ, the Great Shepherd, is the ultimate model for these pastors. While these gifts of leadership and teaching can be found in one person, it is not always the case.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The men who filled the office, no less than the office itself, were a divine gift." 
2. "Not in the narrower sense of the word, writers of gospels, but in the wider sense, of itinerant preachers, usually sent on a special mission." 
3. "The figure in pastors, if to be pressed, would imply that they were entrusted with some special flock, which they tended, 'residing in and busied about some one spot,' as Chrysostom says."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The men who filled the office, no less than the office itself, were a divine gift."
2. "The 'pastor' had the outward rule and guidance of the Church: the bishop."
3. "That the 'pastors' here were the bishops and presbyters of the Church, is evident from Acts 20:28; 1 Peter 5:1; 1 Peter 5:2, where the bishops' and presbyters' office is said to be 'to feed' the flock."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The evangelist 'may' have been one whose main business was 'preaching,' and who was not particularly engaged in the 'government' of the church. The word properly means 'a messenger of good tidings;' and Robinson (Lexicon) supposes that it denotes a minister of the gospel who was not located in any place, but who traveled as a missionary to preach the gospel, and to found churches."
2. "The office was distinct from that of the 'pastor,' the teacher, and the 'prophet:' and was manifestly an office in which 'preaching' was the main thing."
3. "The word is given to ministers of the gospel with obvious propriety, and with great beauty. They are to exercise the same watchfulness and care over the people of their charge which a shepherd does over his flock."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The distinguishing features of an apostle were, a commission directly from Christ: being a witness of the resurrection: special inspiration: supreme authority: accrediting by miracles: unlimited commission to preach and to found churches."
2. "Prophets. Preachers and expounders under the immediate influence of the Spirit, and thus distinguished from teachers."
3. "No man is fit to be a pastor who cannot also teach, and the teacher needs the knowledge which pastoral experience gives."

### John Calvin:
1. "The external ministry of the word is also commended, on account of the advantages which it yields. Certain men appointed to that office, are employed in preaching the gospel... the divine command, and the ability to perform it, go together."
2. "The government of the church, by the preaching of the word, is first of all declared to be no human contrivance, but a most sacred ordinance of Christ."
3. "In truth, he plainly rejects it as without foundation, when he ascribes superiority to Christ alone, and represents the apostles, and all the pastors, as indeed inferior to Him, but associated on an equal level with each other."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ gives the Churchâ€™s ministers; the Church takes those given and sets them in the service of the Church."
2. "It would appear from this that they can have no successors in the distinctive features of their office."
3. "When Paul wrote the â€˜pastorsâ€™ were â€˜bishops,â€™ or â€˜elders,â€™ and probably were always â€˜teachersâ€™ also; it is not so clear that the â€˜teachersâ€™ were always â€˜pastors.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus said the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep and called himself the Good Shepherd." 
2. "Christ is the Great Shepherd." 
3. "These gifts can be found in one man, though not always."

### John Gill:
1. "These were not fixed and stated ministers in anyone place, as the following officers be, but were sent here and there as the apostles thought fit."
2. "The work of the ministry is not a human invention, but the appointment of Christ, for which he fits and qualifies, and therefore to be regarded."
3. "They only are the ministers of Christ, whom he makes ministers of the New Testament, and not whom men or themselves make and appoint."

### John Wesley:
1. "He gave some apostles - His chief ministers and special witnesses, as having seen him after his resurrection, and received their commission immediately from him."
2. "A prophet testifies of things to come; an evangelist of things past: and that chiefly by preaching the gospel before or after any of the apostles."
3. "Some pastors - Watching over their several flocks. And some teachers - Whether of the same or a lower order, to assist them, as occasion might require."
