### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "But as Paul intended to express here a just and orderly arrangement, I prefer the word (constitutio ) settlement or constitution, taking it in that sense in which a commonwealth, or kingdom, or province, is said to be settled, when confusion gives place to the regular administration of law."
2. "God might himself have performed this work, if he had chosen; but he has committed it to the ministry of men. This is intended to anticipate an objection. 'Cannot the church be constituted and properly arranged, without the instrumentality of men?' Paul asserts that a ministry is required, because such is the will of God."
3. "Our true completeness and perfection consist in our being united in the one body of Christ. No language more highly commendatory of the ministry of the word could have been employed, than to ascribe to it this effect. What is more excellent than to produce the true and complete perfection of the church?"
