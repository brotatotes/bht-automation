2. "The maturity of the full-grown man is contrasted with the infancy which follows."
3. "We cannot go forward from the finished growth of ver. 13, and say that its object is that we be no longer children, but must go back again to the growth itself and its purpose; that purpose being mainly the terminal one of ver. 13, and subordinately the intermediate one of our ver. 14."

3. "True faith confines its view so entirely to Christ, that it neither knows, nor desires to know, anything else."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The unity is rather that of the individual believers resulting from that perfect faith and that perfect knowledge which corresponds with the perfect object of both, namely, the Son of God. How far off is this goal! But the servant of Christ should never lose sight of it."
2. "The measure to be reached is 'the stature,' etc. The word means 'age,' and some contend for that meaning here, explaining, 'the measure characteristic of the age,' etc. But the idea of magnitude is prominent throughout the passage, and 'stature' seems more appropriate with 'measure.' Spiritual maturity is meant, and this maturity is conditioned by 'the fulness of Christ.'"
3. "No one helps the Church toward it who obscures 'the Son of God' as the object of 'faith' and 'knowledge,' or seeks perfection from other sources than 'the fulness of Christ.' 'Beyond Christ we cannot go, without Him or against Him there is no progress' (Braune)."

3. "When all the elect of God are gathered in and joined together, they will be as one man."

### John Wesley:
1. "Come to the unity of the faith, and knowledge of the Son of God â€” To both an exact agreement in the Christian doctrine, and an experimental knowledge of Christ as the Son of God."
2. "To a perfect man â€” To a state of spiritual manhood both in understanding and strength."
3. "To the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ â€” To that maturity of age and spiritual stature wherein we shall be filled with Christ, so that he will be all in all."
