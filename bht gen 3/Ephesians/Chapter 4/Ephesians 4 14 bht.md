# Ephesians 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers can be easily swayed by the various teachings and schemes of error, like billows of the sea tossed to and fro, even without wind. These teachings, represented as winds, blow the unstable soul in every direction, leaving them vulnerable to deception. Without a solid foundation in Christ, believers remain as babes, victims of every charlatan who comes along. To avoid being carried about by every wind, it is crucial to acquire settled views of truth and be firmly grounded in the doctrines of the gospel.
