## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "from whom all the body (which is) being closely framed together and compacted by means of every joint of the supplyâ€”according to the working in the measure of each individual partâ€”carries on the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."
2. "The joints are the points of union where the supply passes to the different members, and by means of which the body derives the supply by which it grows."
3. "Love is the element in which the edification, as well as that in which the growth, takes place."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Being fitly framed together, all the parts being in their proper position, and in mutual relation." 
2. "By means of every joint of the supply...furnishing the body with the materials of its growth." 
3. "According to the effectual working of grace in each member...proportioned to the measure of its need of supply."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No member of the church need be useless, anymore than a minute nerve or blood-vessel in the body need be useless. No matter how obscure the individual may be, he may contribute to the harmony and vigor of the whole."
2. "There should be union in the church. It is made up of materials which differ much from each other, as the body is made up of bones, and nerves, and muscles. Yet, in the body these are united; and so it should be in the church."
3. "Every member in the church should keep his place, just as every bone, and nerve, and muscle in the human frame should. Every member of the body should be in its right position; the heart, the lungs, the eye, the tongue, should occupy their right place; and every nerve in the system should be laid down just where it is designed to be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The present participles denote present, continuous progress. The two participles represent respectively the ideas of harmony or adaptation and compactness or solidity."
2. "The supply specifies it as peculiarly Christ's. The phrase joint of the supply signifies joint whose office or purpose it is to supply."
3. "It is a living organism, and its growth is produced by vital power within itself."

### John Calvin:
1. "All our increase should tend to exalt more highly the glory of Christ."
2. "Without mutual love, the health of the body cannot be maintained."
3. "If we wish to be considered members of Christ, let no man be anything for himself, but let us all be whatever we are for the benefit of each other."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The most difficult question is that of connection. The E. V. joins the phrase with the participles. In favor of this may be urged, the position of the phrase and the parallel passage in Colossians 2:19. But to join it with the verb â€˜maketh the growthâ€™ is equally allowable, and gives more perspicuity to the passage." 
2. "The repetition of â€˜bodyâ€™ gives distinctness to the involved statement, but may also indicate the body as a whole over against â€˜each several partâ€™ The verb â€˜makethâ€™ is intensive. All the body possesses, by means of the adaptation, compacting, supply, and energy of each part, contributes to this organic, symmetrical, growth."
3. "This is the aim of the growth: Self-edification, and that â€˜in love,â€™ as its element."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Out of which as the source of energy and direction."
2. "The assumption is that each part of the body functions properly in its own sphere."
3. "This is the way the body grows by cooperation under the control of the head and all 'in love'."

### John Gill:
1. "The author of the union of the members of Christ's body to one another is the Spirit of God, by him they are baptized into one body."
2. "The means [of the union] are the word and ordinances, and these convey a supply from Christ the head to every member, suitable to the part it bears in the body."
3. "Nothing is of a more edifying nature to the church than love, which bears the infirmities of the weak, and seeks for, and follows after those things which make for peace and godly edification."

### John Wesley:
1. "From whom the whole mystical body fitly joined together - All the parts being fitted for and adapted to each other, and most exactly harmonizing with the whole."
2. "And compacted â€” Knit and cemented together with the utmost firmness."
3. "Maketh increase by that which every joint supplieth â€” Or by the mutual help of every joint."
