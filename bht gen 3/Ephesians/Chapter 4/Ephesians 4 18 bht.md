# Ephesians 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gentiles are caught in the empty pursuit of their minds, as they are darkened in their understanding and alienated from the life of God. This spiritual life, kindled in believers from God's own life, is what they unknowingly miss out on. Before the fall, they partook in life and light, but now their understanding is morally darkened due to the hardening of their hearts. Their ignorance, stemming from sin, estranges them from God, leaving them void of His light and knowledge of His will.
