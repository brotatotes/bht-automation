# Ephesians 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who persistently give themselves up to the working of uncleanness are without excuse. Deliberately engaging in the pursuit of sinful desires, they are driven by greediness, always craving more sinful lusts and pleasures. Their consciences have been cauterized, losing all sense of sin. God allows them to be given up to the power of their own wicked desires. They commit every form of uncleanness, past feeling pain as they pursue unbridled lust without remorse. The connection between avarice and lust is evident, as their insatiable desires lead them deeper into sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "See how he shuts them out from excuse by using these words, the working of uncleanness: they sinned not, saith he, by chance fault, but they went and wrought the dread things themselves, and used that employ as their care in life."
2. "Greediness, the desire of having more, is obviously a wider vice than mere covetousness, though this latter is generally its prominent form. It is self-seeking, or greed: in whatever direction this central evil tendency finds its employment."
3. "So that it may include in itself as an element, as here, lustful sins, though it can never actually mean â€˜lasciviousnessâ€™."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "past feelingâ€”senseless, shameless, hopeless; the ultimate result of a long process of 'hardening,' or habit of sin."
2. "God gave them up to it, but not against their will; for they give themselves up to it."
3. "with a deliberate view to the working (as if it were their work or business, not a mere accidental fall into sin) of uncleanness of every kind."

2. "Lasciviousness...to work...with greediness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being past feeling...to cease to feel pain..."

3. "With greediness...one who always wants more..."

### John Gill:

2. "They do in order to work all uncleanness; to commit every unclean lust, to live in a continued commission of uncleanness of every sort."
