2. "Meekness is that spirit in which we accept God's dealings with us without disputing and resisting; and also the accepting patiently of the injuries done us by men, out of the thought that they are permitted by God for the chastening and purifying of His people."
3. "It is only the lowly, humble heart that is also meek."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Lowliness,' humble submission to God, and a consequent mildness toward men as His instruments, as if to say: 'Have I been helped, then I do not know who should not be helped'." 
2. "'Longsuffering' means, not taking swift vengeance, not inflicting speedy punishment, though it sometimes has the more general sense of 'forbearance.' It is meekness toward the sins of others, and the more difficult to exercise be-cause justice seems at times to be against it is promoted by recalling that we were called when sinners, that all our privileges are proofs of Godâ€™s longsuffering."
3. "'In love.' This is the element in which all true forbearance is manifested; without the Christian grace of love, it degenerates into indifference, but love 'is longsuffering'."

1. "In the exercise of humility...in not envying the gifts and graces of others, but rejoicing at them, and at every increase of them."
2. "With longsuffering; bearing much and long with the infirmities of each other; without being easily provoked to anger by any ill usage..."
3. "Forbearing one another in love; overlooking the infirmities of one another, forgiving injuries done, sympathizing with, and assisting each other in distressed circumstances..."
