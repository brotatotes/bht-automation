2. "Which is corrupt [œÑŒøŒΩ œÜŒ∏ŒµŒπœÅŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ] . The A. V. misses the force of the participle. The verb is passive, which is being corrupted, and marks the progressive condition of corruption which characterizes 'the old man.' Rev., correctly, waxeth corrupt." 
3. "According to the deceitful lusts [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÑŒ±œÇ ŒµœÄŒπŒ∏œÖŒºŒπŒ±œÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ±œÄŒ±œÑŒ∑œÇ] . Rev., correctly, lusts of deceit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis is on the verb, which is used of throwing off garments. The tense points to a single, sudden act."
2. "This putting off of the old man is indispensable, because in their former way of life this old man was, as it were, the garment in which they were clothed."
3. "Sin is characterized as deceitful because of its power of deceiving. These 'lusts' are the instruments which carry on the process of corruption, and their agency is so potent because the subjects are deceived as to the true character of the desires they cherish."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That ye put away (Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±). Second aorist middle infinitive of Œ±œÄŒøœÑŒπŒ∏Œ∑Œº with the metaphor of putting off clothing or habits." 
2. "As Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒ∏Œµ in Colossians 3:8 (which see) with the same addition of 'the old man' (œÑŒøŒΩ œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒΩ) as in Colossians 3:9."

3. "These make a man deserving of, and liable to the pit of corruption; and this is a good reason, why this corrupt old man, with respect to the life and conversation, should be put off."

### John Wesley:
1. The old man ‚Äî That is, the whole body of sin. All sinful desires are deceitful; promising the happiness which they cannot give.
