In this renewal, our noble and excellent part, the spirit, is brought back to life and made new again.

3. "just as the children of the world are walking in the vanity of their minds"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The renewal takes place, not in the mind, but in the spirit of it."
2. "The change is not in the mind psychologically, either in its essence or in its operation."
3. "It is in the spirit of the mind; in the power which, when changed itself, radically alters the entire sphere and business of the inner mechanism."

### John Calvin:
1. "Be renewed, not only with respect to the inferior appetites or desires, which are manifestly sinful, but with respect also to that part of the soul which is reckoned most noble and excellent." 
2. "There is an implied contrast between the spirit of our mind and the Divine and heavenly Spirit, who produces in us another and a new mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the spirit, or, 'by the Spirit,' of your mind. It is difficult to decide between the two views. The one refers 'spirit' to the human spirit, which belongs to the 'mind,' the whole phrase indicating that with reference to which the renewal takes place."
2. "The other refers 'Spirit' to the Holy Spirit indwelling in the human spirit" 
3. "The main difficulty is that the subject and the agency of the renewing are confused. But a process is referred to, in which this 'indwelling Spirit' of the mind is the continuous Agent."

1. "That ye be renewed [...] to make new (young) again." 
2. "It is an old verb, Î±Î½Î±Î½ÎµÎ¿Ï‰, to make new (young) again; though only here in N.T."
3. "The spirit (Ï„Ï‰ Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±Ï„). Not the Holy Spirit, but the human spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "And be renewed in the spirit of your mind."
2. "The more noble part of man stands in need of renovation, being corrupted by sin."
3. "It becomes saints to be concerned for such revivings and renewings, and to pray for them."

### John Wesley:
1. The spirit of your mind â€” The very ground of your heart.
