## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "nor again (there is a slight climax: see below) give scope (opportunity of action, which you would do by continuing in a state of irritation) to the devil"
2. "not, to the slanderer, as some attempt to make it mean: the word 'diabolos' as a substantive always has this personal meaning in the New Test."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 27. Neither give placeâ€”that
	is, occasion, or scope, to the devil, by continuing in

	night, is giving place to the devil, the prince of darkness ( :-).


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do not yield to the suggestions and temptations of Satan, who would take every opportunity to persuade you to cherish unkind and angry feelings, and to keep up a spirit of resentment among brethren."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Place. Room.


### John Calvin:

2. "We feel every day how impossible, or, at least, how difficult it is to cure long-continued hatred."
3. "Before the poison of hatred has found its way into the heart, anger must be thoroughly dislodged."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Give place, give free play, room in the heart, to the devil."
2. "The clause gives a reason why sinful anger should be avoided: it opens to Satan the heart which has been redeemed from his power by Christ."
3. "It is doubtful if the word diabolos ever means simply slanderer, or blasphemer, when used as a noun."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "See Romans 12:19 for this idiom."

3. "Do not give way to Satan, which is done, when men indulge any lust or corruption; and when they easily fall in with his suggestions and temptations; when they are off of their watch and guard; and when they do not resist, but quietly yield unto him."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither give place to the devil â€” By any delay.
