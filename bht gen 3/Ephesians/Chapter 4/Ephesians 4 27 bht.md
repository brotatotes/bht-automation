# Ephesians 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not let anger give the devil a foothold. When we continue in anger, we provide an opportunity for Satan to work in our lives. Instead, we should restrain our anger, not yielding to the temptations of the enemy. By giving in to anger, we open ourselves to the influence of the devil and hinder the work of Christ in us. Let us resist the devil and hold onto the peace and love that Christ has given us.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Do not give the devil an opportunity to take hold of your anger and resentment. When we hold onto anger, we give the devil room to work in our hearts and lead us into sin. Instead, we should curb our temper and restrain our anger, not yielding to the temptations and suggestions of Satan. This is important because by giving in to sinful anger, we open our hearts to the enemy who seeks to undermine the work of Christ in us. So, let us be mindful not to allow the devil to gain a foothold in our lives, but rather resist him and hold onto the peace and love that Christ has given us.
