# Ephesians 4:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone repents from their sin, it's not enough to just stop. They must pursue the opposite virtue. For instance, if they used to steal, they should now work diligently, using their hands for good, and have something to give to those in need. Christians should prioritize using honest industry for the greater good, rather than selfish gain. Even unemployment is not an excuse for theft. Instead, Christians should engage in honorable labor and generously give to others.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When someone decides to turn away from their sinful ways, it is not enough for them to simply stop engaging in that sin. They must actively pursue a life that is completely opposite to it. For instance, if someone was known for stealing, they should not only refrain from stealing, but they should strive to become hardworking individuals and contribute to society in a positive way. Christians, in particular, should use their honest labor to not only provide for themselves but to also help those in need. This verse teaches us that stealing is never acceptable, even if someone is facing unemployment. Instead, individuals should focus on honest industry and acquiring the means to be of greater usefulness to others. Laziness is considered a form of dishonesty, and manual labor is honorable and dignified. By diligently working and generating income, individuals can support their own lives and, at the same time, be able to give generously to those who are in need.
