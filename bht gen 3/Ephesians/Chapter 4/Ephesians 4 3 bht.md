# Ephesians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Unity among believers is crucial, and the Spirit is the one who brings about this unity. We are urged to diligently strive to maintain this unity, which is not just external or based on creed, but a unity of temper and affection. It is the bond of peace that holds the Church together, as a symbol of the inner unity that the Spirit creates. Without love, there can be no true peace. Therefore, let us make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through love.

### Albert Barnes:

3. "It is not mere 'external' unity; it is not a mere unity of creed; it is not a mere unity in the forms of public worship; it is such as the Holy Spirit produces in the hearts of Christians, when it fills them all with the same love, and joy, and peace in believing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Endeavoring [œÉœÄŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±Œ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ] . Not strong enough. Originally the verb means to make haste. So the kindred noun spoudh haste, Mark 6:25; Luke 1:39. Hence diligence. Rev., here, giving diligence."
2. "Unity of the Spirit. Wrought by the Holy Spirit."
3. "Bond of peace. The bond which is peace. Compare ch. 2 14, our peace - made both one. Christ, our peace, is thus a bond of peace."

3. "Only unity of Christians, wrought by the Holy Spirit, maintained by loving personal endeavor, can result in the manifested unity of the Body of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The unity (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµŒΩŒøœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±)."

### John Gill:
1. "The saints are united under one head, and are members of one and the same body, and should be of the same mind and judgment, and of one accord, heart, and affection: and this may be called 'the unity of the Spirit'; because it is an union of spirits, of the spirits or souls of men; and that in spiritual affairs, in the spiritual exercises of religion; and it is effected by the Spirit of God, by whom they are baptized into one body."
2. "though it is difficult, and may sometimes seem to be impossible, yet it becomes the saints to be diligent in the use of means to keep it up, and continue it; and which they may be said to endeavour after, when they abide with one another, and do not forsake each other upon every occasion; when they perform all offices of love to one another, and stir up each other to the like"
3. "by maintaining peace among themselves, and seeking those things which tend to, and make for peace, and spiritual edification; and which is called a bond, in allusion to the Greek word used, which comes from one that signifies to knit, join, and bind together, and because it is of a knitting and uniting nature."

### John Wesley:
1. Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit ‚Äî That mutual union and harmony, which is a fruit of the Spirit. The bond of peace is love.
