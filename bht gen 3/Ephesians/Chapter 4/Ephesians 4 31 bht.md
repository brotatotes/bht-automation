# Ephesians 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let go of all bitterness, wrath, and anger, for these emotions are born out of a bitter disposition and can lead to malice, hidden fires that can be the most formidable. Such enmities are most savage when they are cherished within and make no show to those who are outside. Bitterness begets wrath; wrath begets anger; anger begets clamor, evil-speaking, slander, and surmises of evil. Malice is the secret root of all. Therefore, we must put away bitterness, anger, and clamor, making a clean sweep of them.

2. "wrath: heat of spirit, which follows upon bitterness, or upon the spirit being embittered and offended."
3. "And clamour and evil speaking; such as brawlings, contentions, contumelies, reproaches, slanders, c. arising from an embittered, wrathful, and angry disposition: these should all be put away from you, with all malice being the deeds of the old man, unbecoming such as are born again, and grieving to the Spirit of God."

1. "Let all bitterness ‚Äî The height of settled anger, opposite to kindness."
