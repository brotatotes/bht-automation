# Ephesians 4:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be not faithless, but believing. Kind, tenderhearted, forgiving, are opposed to bitterness, wrath, and anger. It is just that you in turn shall be so to your fellow men, who have not erred against you in the degree that you have erred against God. It is in Christ that God vouchsafes forgiveness to us. Let a man recollect his own sins and follies; let him see how often he has offended God; and then, fresh with this feeling, let him go and say, 'My brother, I forgive you.'
