# Ephesians 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The faithful all over the world, past, present, and to come, are called in one hope of their calling, belonging to the one body of Christ. The one Spirit provides the Church with true unity. We are called to unity, for we stand related to the Church, and our calling inspires the one hope that unites us. Our unity is not just potential, but actual and worldwide. It is the same hope we have as fellow heirs of heaven, looking forward to the same joy and happiness beyond the grave.
