# Ephesians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Church is united in its faith, sacraments, hope, love, discipline, and government, as believers find oneness through their shared Savior. The act of believing, represented by the one faith, allows individuals to grasp and appropriate the Lord. Through baptism, believers are outwardly marked with Christ's name, symbolizing their incorporation into the body of Christ. Baptism, distinguished from other sacraments, emphasizes unity and the importance of each member being in vital union with the whole body, fostering a sense of shared identity and commitment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "one Lord (as the Head of the Church: in this verse he grounds the co-existence of the 'one body and one Spirit' in the three great facts on which it rests‚Äîthe first objective,‚Äîone Lord‚Äîthe second subjective,‚Äîone faith‚Äîthe third compounded of the two,‚Äîone baptism)"
2. "one faith (in that one Lord: the subjective medium by which that one Lord is apprehended and appropriated: not faith which we believed, but, faith by which we believe: but it is necessarily understood, that this subjective faith has for its object the One Lord just mentioned)"
3. "one baptism (the objective seal of the subjective faith, by which, as a badge, the members of Christ are outwardly and visibly stamped with His name. The other sacrament, being a matured act of subsequent participation, a function of the incorporate, not a seal of incorporation [a symbol of union, not of unity: so Ellicott], is not here adduced."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith" is not here that which we believe, but the act of believing, the mean by which we apprehend the "one Lord." (Ephesians 4:5)
2. "Baptism" is specified, being the sacrament whereby we are incorporated into the "one body." (Ephesians 4:5)
3. The Church is one in unity of faith, unity of origination, unity of sacraments, unity of hope, unity of charity, and unity (not uniformity) of discipline and government. (Ephesians 4:5)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no better way of promoting unity among Christians than by reminding them that they have the same Saviour."
2. "Let two men who have never seen each other before, meet in a distant land, and feel that they have the same Redeemer, and their hearts will mingle into one."
3. "Whether by immersion, or by pouring, or by sprinkling, they have all been baptized with water; whether it is done in adult years, or in infancy, the same solemn act has been performed on all - the act of consecration to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith. The principle of faith; not that which is believed - the body of Christian doctrine, which does not promote unity." 
2. "Baptism. The external sign of faith, but of no significance without the Lord and the faith."  
3. "Baptism, moreover, is not administered to the Church as a body, but to individuals, and therefore emphasizes the exhortation to each member to be in vital union with the whole body."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ cannot be divided. Faith cannot be rent. There are not various baptisms, but one which is common to all."
2. "Faith, and baptism, and God the Father, and Christ, ought to unite us, so as almost to become one man."
3. "Baptism possesses such force as to make us one; and in baptism, the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit, is invoked."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One Lord' is the Personal Christ. The whole Epistle shows that out of Him there is no unity of the Spirit."
2. "For 'faith' here does not mean what is believed, but the act of believing."
3. "Baptism is named, rather than the Lord‚Äôs Supper, since the latter is a manifestation of union preserved, while the former, 'from its single celebration and marked individual reference, presents more clearly the idea of unity.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One Lord (ŒµŒπœÇ ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒøœÇ). The Lord Jesus Christ and he alone (no series of aeons)."
2. "One faith (ŒºŒπŒ± œÄŒπœÉœÑŒπœÇ). One act of trust in Christ, the same for all (Jew or Gentile), one way of being saved."
3. "One baptism (ŒµŒΩ Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒπœÉŒºŒ±). The result of baptizing (Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒπœÉŒºŒ±), while Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒπœÉŒºŒøœÇ is the act."

### John Gill:
1. "He has betrothed them to himself, and is their husband, and so their Lord, whom they are to worship and obey."
2. "There is but one true grace of faith; and which, though it is in different subjects, and its degrees and acts are various, yet as to its nature, it is like precious faith in all."
3. "There is but one baptism under the Gospel; for John's and Christ's are the same: there are, besides, figurative or metaphorical ones, which are so in an improper sense, as the baptism of the Spirit, and the baptism of blood, or of sufferings; but there is but one baptism, literally and properly so called."

### John Wesley:
1. One outward baptism.
