# Ephesians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The grand source of unity among believers lies in the fundamental truth of having one God and Father who holds ultimate sovereignty over all. This universal Fathership, which even the Church inherits in its fullness, is the chief aspect from which all other aspects flow. Through the work of the Father, the Son filling all things, and the witness of the indwelling Spirit, God's power is evident and extends to all lives. This unity goes beyond shared opinions or feelings, as it arises supernaturally from a common principle of life in God.
