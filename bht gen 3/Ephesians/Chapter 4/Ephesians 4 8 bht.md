## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every part of that ark, every stone of that hill, was full of spiritual meaning. Every note struck on the lyres of the sweet singers of Israel, is but part of a chord, deep and world-wide, sounding from the golden harps of redemption."
2. "The partial triumphs of David and Solomon only prefigured as in a prophetic mirror the universal and eternal triumph of the Incarnate Son of God."
3. "Thou hast taken gifts among men,' hast, as a victor, surrounded by thy victorious host, brought gifts home, spoils ofâ€”and the result of such reception would be naturally stated as the distribution of them among such hosts, and the people."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ, the Head of the Church, is the author of all these different gifts, and that giving of them is an act of His 'grace'."
2. "In the antitypical meaning, the foes of Christ the Son of David, the devil, death, the curse, and sin, led as it were in triumphal procession as a sign of the destruction of the foe."
3. "The impartation of the gifts and graces of the Spirit depended on Christ's ascension."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'ascending on high,' therefore, in the Psalm, refers, as it seems to me, to the ascent of the symbol of the Divine Presence accompanying the ark on Mount Zion, or to the placing it 'on high' above all its foes."
2. "He also ascended on high. His ascent was the proof of victory over his foes. He went there for a permanent abode."
3. "When Christ ascended to heaven, he triumphed over all his foes. It was a complete victory over the malice of the great enemy of God, and over those who had sought his life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The captives are not the redeemed, but the enemies of Christ's kingdom, Satan, Sin, and Death."
2. "His [Paul's] point is the distribution of grace by Christ in varied measure to individuals."
3. "He [Paul] confirms this by Scripture, seeing in the Jehovah of this Old - Testament passage the Christ of the New Testament - one Redeemer under both covenants."

### John Calvin:
1. "The noblest triumph which God ever gained was when Christ, after subduing sin, conquering death, and putting Satan to flight, rose majestically to heaven."
2. "Captivity is a collective noun for captive enemies; and the plain meaning is, that God reduced his enemies to subjection, which was more fully accomplished in Christ than in any other way."
3. "Paul intends to shew, that this ascension of God in the person of Christ was far more illustrious than the ancient triumphs of the Church; because it is a more honorable distinction for a conqueror to dispense his bounty largely to all classes, than to gather spoils from the vanquished."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The application here undoubtedly is to the enemies of Christ who have been overcome, either (1) men who have become His servants (comp. the correct sense of 2 Corinthians 2:14), previously prisoners of Satan; or (2) Satan, sin, and death, whom He had conquered through His death and resurrection."
2. "The former lessens the difficulty in the last clause, making these captives the gifts, who are both received and given. But this lays it open to suspicion."
3. "The ideas of the original and Paulâ€™s application are thus to be regarded, not as identical, but as correlative."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The quotation is from Psalms 68:18, a Messianic Psalm of victory which Paul adapts and interprets for Christ's triumph over death."
2. "He led captivity captive."
3. "The verb also (Î±Î¹Ï‡Î¼Î±Î»Ï‰Ï„ÎµÏ…Ï‰) is from the old word Î±Î¹Ï‡Î¼Î±Î»Ï‰Ï„Î¿Ï‚, captive in war."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's ascension to heaven was...real, local, and visible."
2. "Christ's conquests and triumph over sin, Satan, the world, death, and the grave."
3. "The gifts of the Holy Ghost...qualify men for the work of the ministry."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having ascended on high, he led captivity captive - He triumphed over all his enemies, Satan, sin, and death, which had before enslaved all the world."
2. "Alluding to the custom of ancient conquerors, who led those they had conquered in chains after them."
3. "And, as they also used to give donatives to the people, at their return from victory, so he gave gifts to men - Both the ordinary and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit."
