## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ascent implied a previous descent, This is the leading thought."
2. "The fact of descent being the primary thought, we have only to ask as above, how far that descent is carried in the Apostleâ€™s mind."
3. "And this meaning seems to be upheld by the words, 'that he might fill all things,' which follow, as well as by the contrast furnished by up above all the heavens."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul reasons that (assuming Him to be God) His ascent implies a previous descent; and that the language of the Psalm can only refer to Christ, who first descended, then ascended." 
2. "Others, though they did not previously descend, have ascended; but none save Christ can be referred to in the Psalm as having done so; for it is of God it speaks." 
3. "Christ, as Lord of all, took possession first of the earth the unseen world beneath it (some conjecture that the region of the lost is in the central parts of our globe), then of heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is by no means certain that Paul meant to say that the 'word' 'ascended' demonstrated that there must have been a previous descent; but he probably means that in the case of Christ there was, 'in fact,' a descent into the lower parts of the earth first."
2. "From the one Christ descended to the other; and he came not only to the earth, but he stooped to the most humble condition of humanity here."
3. "The idea is, that the Redeemer descended from his lofty eminence in heaven, and became a man of humble rank and condition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By descending into the depths and ascending above all, He entered upon His function of filling the whole universe, in virtue of which function He distributes gifts to men." 
2. "His ascent implies a previous descent."
3. "The reference is to Christ's descent into Hades."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is this humiliation which Paul justly infers from the declaration that God had ascended."
2. "If ever there was a time when, after appearing to lay aside the brightness of his power, God ascended gloriously, it was when Christ was raised from our lowest condition on earth, and received into heavenly glory."
3. "These words mean nothing more than the condition of the present life. To torture them so as to make them mean purgatory or hell, is exceedingly foolish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now introduces an explanatory statement, not a proof, of the correctness of the application of Ephesians 4:8."
2. "What is it, what does it imply, but that he also descended. It is assumed, since the reference in the Old Testament is to God, and here to the Messiah, that heaven is the point of departure and place of return for Him who is spoken of."
3. "But whither? Paul says, into the lower parts of the earth. It is quite grammatical to explain this as, â€˜the lower parts, namely, the earth,â€™ and this is all that is necessarily involved in what precedes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul picks out the verb Î±Î½Î±Î²Î±Ï‚ (second aorist active participle of Î±Î½Î±Î²Î±Î¹Î½Ï‰, to go up), changes its form to Î±Î½ÎµÎ²Î· (second aorist indicative), and points the article (Ï„Î¿) at it."
2. "Then he concludes that it implied a previous ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î²Î±Ï‚ (coming down)."
3. "If the Î±Î½Î±Î²Î±Ï‚ is the Ascension of Christ, then the ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î²Î±Ï‚ would be the Descent (Incarnation) to earth and Ï„Î·Ï‚ Î³Î·Ï‚ would be the genitive of apposition."

### John Gill:
1. "For certain it is, that the place where Abraham was with Lazarus in his bosom was not near to hell, but afar off, and that there was a great gulf between them..."
2. "...it may rather design the whole of his humiliation, as his descent from heaven and incarnation in the virgin's womb, where his human nature was curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth..."
3. "...his humbling himself and becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, when he was made sin and a curse for his people, and bore all the punishment due to their transgressions..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now this expression, He ascended, what is it, but that he descended... does it not imply, that he descended first?" 
2. "Certainly it does, on the supposition of his being God... since all the saints will ascend to heaven, though none of them descended thence."
3. "Into the lower parts of the earth â€” So the womb is called, Psalm 139:15; the grave, Psalm 63:9."
