# Ephesians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Therefore, as beloved children of God, we are called to imitate Him in our walk of love. Just as children imitate their fathers, we are to imitate the Father who loves us dearly. This means that when we do well, we are truly reflecting our identity as sons and daughters of God. It is not enough to claim the title of a child of God without demonstrating the resemblance and likeness of our heavenly Father through acts of love and kindness. As we imitate God, we become followers or imitators in His image.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The walk in love as resuming ch. iv. 1, and indicating a beginning, rather than a close, of a paragraph."
2. "Be ye (or, 'become ye,' see on last verse) therefore (seeing that God forgave you in Christ, see next verse) imitators of God (viz. in walking in love, see below), as children beloved (see next verse)."
3. "Imitators of God in walking in love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We are sons of men, when we do ill; sons of God, when we do well."
2. "Sonship infers an absolute necessity of imitation, it being vain to assume the title of son without any similitude of the Father."
3. "Sons of God, when we do well."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be ye therefore followers of God - Greek, 'Be imitators - Î¼Î¹Î¼Î·Ï„Î±Î¹Ì€ mimeÌ„tai - of God.' The idea is not that they were to be the friends of God, or numbered among his followers, but that they were to imitate him..."
2. "As dear children - The meaning is, 'as those children which are beloved follow the example of a father, so we, who are beloved of God, should follow his example.'"
3. "What a simple rule this is! And how much contention and strife would be avoided if it were followed! If every Christian who is angry, unforgiving, and unkind, would just ask himself the question, 'How does God treat me?' it would save all the trouble and heart-burning which ever exists in the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Be ye [Î³Î¹Î½ÎµÏƒÎ¸Îµ] . Become, as ch. 4 32. 
Followers [Î¼Î¹Î¼Î·Ï„Î±Î¹] . Rev, correctly, imitators. 
Dear [Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î·Ï„Î±] Rev., beloved. As those to whom Christ has shown love


### John Calvin:
1. "If, then, we are the children of God, we ought to be followers of God."
2. "Christ also declares, that, unless we shew kindness to the unworthy, we cannot be the children of our heavenly Father."
3. "To compensate him with benefits is divine, and makes men of earth followers of the Father who is in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜Thereforeâ€™ connects the exhortation with chap. Ephesians 4:31-32, but there is an advance in thought, so that a new section begins here."
2. "Followers. Lit, 'imitators,' which perhaps suggests too much. In any case God is the model, especially in the crowning act of His love (chap. Ephesians 4:32); hence â€˜become,â€™ not â€˜be.â€™"
3. "As beloved children; children through Christ, and beloved of God, hence to imitate Christ (Ephesians 5:2); each word contains a motive."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Imitators of God (Î¼Î¹Î¼Î·Ï„Î± Ï„Î¿Ï… Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï…). This old word from Î¼Î¹Î¼ÎµÎ¿Î¼Î± Paul boldly uses. If we are to be like God, we must imitate him. 


### John Gill:
1. "Not in his works of infinite wisdom and almighty power, which is impossible; but in acts of righteousness and holiness, and particularly in acts of mercy, goodness, and beneficence..." 
2. "and this should be done by the saints, as dear children..." 
3. "and therefore it becomes them to imitate him; for who should they imitate and follow after, but their Father, and especially when they are so dear unto him?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Be ye therefore followers â€” Imitators."
2. "O how much more honourable and more happy, to be an imitator of God, than of Homer, Virgil, or Alexander the Great!"
