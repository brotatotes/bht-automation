# Ephesians 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Vices perish and bear no fruit, while virtues abound in the light. Therefore, we must not only refrain from fellowship but also confront and shame the works of darkness. Sin, being darkness, should be reproved and exposed. Our lives should serve as a rebuke to the sinful world, expressing disapproval of wickedness. We must avoid involvement or support of evil, even passive consent is fellowship. Instead, we must reprove works of darkness both through our words and actions, shining the light of righteousness on the darkness.
