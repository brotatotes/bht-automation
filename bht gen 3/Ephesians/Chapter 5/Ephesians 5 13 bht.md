# Ephesians 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your consistent lives and faithful reproofs will be your 'armor of light' in making an inroad on the kingdom of darkness. The light of your Christian life, shed upon the deeds of darkness, will bring them out of the category of darkness into light. When you reprove, manifesting the hidden sins and evil works, everything that is made manifest becomes light. It is only through the light that the true moral quality of these things is revealed. So, turn on the light and let your reproofs be a means of bringing to light what is involved in darkness.
