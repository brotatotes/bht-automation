# Ephesians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Redeeming the time means rescuing and improving our time for important purposes. We should employ our time in gaining knowledge, doing good, seeking salvation, and doing the will of God. The days are evil, filled with vices that waste our time. Therefore, we should be diligent in redeeming every opportunity and availing ourselves of the chance to act righteously, like a merchant carefully looking out for vantages. Let us be eager to recover time in every possible way, especially in these days of ignorance and immorality.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Redeeming the time - The word rendered here as 'redeeming,' means 'to purchase; to buy up' from the possession or power of anyone; and then to redeem, to set free - as from service or bondage; notes, Galatians 3:13. Here it means, to rescue or recover our time from waste; to improve it for great and important purposes."
2. "They redeem their time who employ it: (1) In gaining useful knowledge; (2) In doing good to others; (3) In employing it for the purpose of an honest livelihood for themselves and families; (4) In prayer and self-examination to make the heart better; (5) In seeking salvation, and in endeavoring to do the will of God."
3. "We should still endeavor to redeem our time for the same reasons which are suggested by the apostle - because the days are evil. There are evil influences abroad; allurements and vices that would waste time, and from which we should endeavor to rescue it."
