# Ephesians 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit. The abuse of wine is the real crime, not God's gift itself. Christians should be full in Spirit, expressing their joy not in drunken or worldly songs, but in Christian hymns of thankfulness. Being filled with the Spirit brings an ecstatic exhilaration, similar to that caused by wine, but distinct from it, leading to abiding exaltation in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.

1. "The sin of drunkenness here dehorted from, is a custom, or habit, of voluntary excessive drinking of any strong liquor, whereby the mind is disturbed, and deprived of the use of reason."
2. "Excessive drinking deprives persons of the use of reason, though not always; and such are criminal, who are mighty to drink wine, and strong to mingle strong drink; as are also such, who though not guilty of this sin themselves, are the means of it in others."
3. "It hurts the mind, memory, and judgment; deprives of reason, and sets a man below a beast; it brings diseases on the body, and wastes the estate; it unfits for business and duty; it opens a door for every sin, and exposes to shame and danger; and therefore should be carefully avoided, and especially by professors of religion."

### John Wesley:
1. "Which leads to debauchery of every kind."
2. "Be ye filled with the Spirit ‚Äî In all his graces."
3. "Who gives a more noble pleasure than wine can do."
