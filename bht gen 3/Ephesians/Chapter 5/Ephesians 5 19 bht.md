## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The custom of antiphonal chanting the church has received from as far back as the Apostles." 
2. "The Christian‚Äôs ode is to be spiritual, inspired by that fulness of the Spirit which is in him."
3. "Singing and playing corresponding to hymns and psalms above."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Spirit gives true eloquence; wine, a spurious eloquence."
2. "Let your songs be not the drinking songs of heathen feasts, but psalms and hymns; and their accompaniment, not the music of the lyre, but the melody of the heart."
3. "To Christ as God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Speaking among yourselves, that is, endeavoring to edify one another, and to promote purity of heart, by songs of praise."
2. "Nothing is more clear than that it was practiced by the Saviour himself and the apostles, and by the primitive church, as well as by the great body of Christians in all ages."
3. "A choir of sweet singers in a church - united in the same praises here - 'ought' to be prepared to join in the same praises around the throne of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Speaking to yourselves [ŒªŒ±ŒªŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒµœÇ ŒµŒ±œÖœÑŒøŒπœÇ] . Rev., one to another. The A. V. is literally correct, but is open to the misinterpretation each one communing with himself." 
2. "The meaning is as in Colossians 3:13, and Rev. is better."
3. "Hymns - spiritual songs."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Spirit means 'joy in the Holy Ghost,' and the exhortation, be ye filled, alludes to deep drinking, with which it is indirectly contrasted." 
2. "Speaking to themselves, is speaking among themselves. Nor does he enjoin them to sing inwardly or alone; for he immediately adds, singing in your hearts; as if he had said, 'Let your praises be not merely on the tongue, as hypocrites do, but from the heart.'" 
3. "The appellation spiritual, given to these songs, is strikingly appropriate; for the songs most frequently used are almost always on trifling subjects, and very far from being chaste."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reciprocal influence on their hearts is meant; and that in social intercourse as well as in their public assemblies."
2. "There is no warrant for confining public praise to the use of the Old Testament psalms, or of paraphrases of other Scripture passages."
3. "The view which takes this clause as subordinate to the preceding part of the verse is open to objection. It usually explains 'in your heart' as = heartily, which is incorrect."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To the Lord (œÑœâ ŒöœÖœÅŒπœâ). The Lord Jesus."
2. "In Colossians 3:16 we have œÑœâ Œ∏Œµœâ (to God) with all these varieties of praise, another proof of the deity of Christ."
3. "See Colossians 3:16 for discussion."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'spiritual songs' are meant the same Psalms of David...which are called 'spiritual,' because they are indited by the Spirit of God, consist of spiritual matter, and are designed for spiritual edification."
2. "Singing, as it is a distinct thing from prayer, so from giving of thanks, which is mentioned in Ephesians 5:20 as another duty; it is not a mental praising of God, for it is called speaking, and teaching, and admonishing, but it is a praising of God with the modulation of the voice."
3. "Singing and making melody in the heart is singing with, or from the heart, or heartily; of as elsewhere, 'with grace,' and which the Alexandrian copy reads here; that is, either with gratitude and thankfulness, or with grace in exercise; and the end in view should be the glory of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "By there being no inspired songs, peculiarly adapted to the Christian dispensation, as there were to the Jewish, it is evident that the promise of the Holy Ghost to believers, in the last days, was by his larger effusion to supply the lack of it."
2. "Singing with your hearts ‚Äî As well as your voice."
3. "To the Lord ‚Äî Jesus, who searcheth the heart."
