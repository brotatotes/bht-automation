# Ephesians 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wives are called to submit to their husbands, recognizing the unique personal relationship that mirrors Christ's headship over the Church. This submission is not meant to demean the wife, but to establish a hierarchy of authority within the family, where the husband serves as the head. It is through this submission that wives express their obedience to Christ Himself. The duty of submission should be approached with a Christian spirit, with mutual love and confidence, as it is a reflection of the husband's representation of Christ in the family.
