# Ephesians 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's unique Headship is distinct from a husband's role. While a husband is the head of his wife, Christ's Headship is gained through His redemptive act, making Him the Savior of the body, the church. The husband's love and protection cannot be equated with salvation, which is peculiar to Christ's headship alone. Just as Christ is the head of the church, a husband's role as head is significant, pointing to the importance of submission for the benefit and comfort of the wife.

- Attempt 1 BHT: In this verse, the comparison lies in the fact of headship alone. Christ's headship is unique and cannot be entirely identical to that of a husband. He is the Savior of the body, the church, having gained Headship through His redemptive act. A husband's love and protection cannot be called salvation, in which respect Christ's headship is peculiar to Himself. Just as Christ is the head of the church, a husband is the head of his wife. The husband is not the savior of the wife, but rather, just as Christ rules over the church for her salvation, nothing yields more advantage or comfort to the wife than to be subject to her husband.
