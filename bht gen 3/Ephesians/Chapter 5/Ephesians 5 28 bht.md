# Ephesians 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Husbands are commanded to love their wives as they love their own bodies, for in doing so, they are also loving themselves. Just as Christ loves the Church and shares the same love and union of body with it, so should husbands love their wives as themselves. This love should manifest itself in caring for the comfort and well-being of their wives, just as they care for their own bodies. By loving their wives, husbands honor the close relationship between them, as they are not only united by nature but also by the sacred bond of marriage.
