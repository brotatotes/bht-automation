- Attempt 4 BHT: The verse emphasizes the need for purity and righteousness among believers. Fornication, impurity, and covetousness are mentioned as sins that should not even be named or talked about within the community of saints. The commentators explain that covetousness is closely linked to impurity, as both involve a desire for sensual pleasures and an attachment to material possessions. They emphasize that these sins are debasing and unbecoming of those who are set apart for God. The severity of these sins is highlighted by the comparison of the covetous man to idolaters and the warning that the public estimation of covetousness may come to match that of other gross vices. Overall, the verse calls believers to distance themselves from any hint of immorality and to uphold a standard of holiness that reflects their identity as saints.

- Attempt 5 BHT: Believers are urged to reject immorality and greed, distancing themselves from discussions and even mentions of such sins. The sins of fornication, impurity, and covetousness are closely linked, characterized by a longing for sensual pleasure and a love for material possessions. These vices are seen as debasing and unfitting for those who belong to God. The severity of covetousness is underscored by its comparison to idolatry, and it is suggested that society may one day regard covetousness with the same repugnance as other gross sins. As saints, believers are called to uphold a standard of purity and righteousness that reflects their holiness.
