# Ephesians 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As members of Christ's Body, we can understand our intimate spiritual union with Him by comparing it to the relationship between man and woman. Just as a woman owes her natural being to the man, so do we owe our entire spiritual being to Christ, our source and head. We are as intimately united to Christ, in a spiritual sense, as if we were literally 'flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone.' It is through this union that Christ nourishes and cherishes the Church, His mystical body.
