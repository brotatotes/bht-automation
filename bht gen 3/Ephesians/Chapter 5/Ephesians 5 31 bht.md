## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This whole verse is said not of human marriages, but of Christ and the church. HE is the man in the Apostle‚Äôs view here, the Church is the woman."
2. "His leaving the Father‚Äôs bosom, which is past‚ÄîHis gradual preparation of the union, which is present: His full consummation of it, which is future."
3. "I would regard the saying as applied to that, past, present, and future, which constitutes Christ‚Äôs Union to His Bride the Church: His leaving the Father‚Äôs bosom, which is past‚ÄîHis gradual preparation of the union, which is present: His full consummation of it, which is future."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The natural marriage, wherein 'a man leaves father and mother and is joined unto his wife,' is not the principal thing meant here, but the spiritual marriage represented by it, and on which it rests, whereby Christ left the Father's bosom to woo to Himself the Church out of a lost world..."
2. "In natural marriage, husband and wife combine the elements of one perfect human being: the one being incomplete without the other. So Christ, as God-man, is pleased to make the Church, the body, a necessary adjunct to Himself, the Head."
3. "Christ will never allow any power to sever Himself and His bride, indissolubly joined."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning of the phrase rendered 'for this cause' is, 'answerably to this;' or corresponding to this." 
2. "There is no evidence that the marriage connection was originally designed to symbolize or typify this union, but it may be used to illustrate that connection."
3. "The comparison should be confined, however, strictly to the use made of it in the New Testament."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The compound verb denotes most intimate union."
2. "Shall be unto one flesh."
3. "Shall become."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul says that we are members of his flesh and of his bones. Do we wonder then, that in the Lord‚Äôs supper he holds out his body to be enjoyed by us, and to nourish us unto eternal life?"
2. "Thus we prove that the only union which we maintain to be represented by the Lord‚Äôs supper is here declared in its truth and consequences by the apostle."
3. "Such is the union between us and Christ, who in some sort makes us partakers of his substance. 'We are bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh,' not because, like ourselves, he has a human nature, but because, by the power of his Spirit, he makes us a part of his body, so that from him we derive our life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase in Genesis equivalent to ‚Äòfor this cause‚Äô points directly to the creation of Eve, and the variation here does not of itself indicate a different reference."
2. "In the Apostle‚Äôs use of the Old Testament language a secondary application to Christ and His Church may well be admitted, since the Apostle throughout has both in mind."
3. "The saying is applied to that, past, present, and future, which constitutes Christ‚Äôs union to His Bride the Church: His leaving the Father‚Äôs bosom, which is past. His gradual preparation of the union which is present; His full consummation of it, which is future.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This whole verse is a practical quotation and application of the language to Paul's argument here."
2. "It seems absurd to make Paul mean Christ here by Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ (man) as some commentators do."

### John Gill:
1. "These words contain the law of marriage, and are cited from Genesis 2:24."
2. "Are observed against polygamy, and to stir up mutual affection."
3. "Declare what ought to be, and are a prophecy of what should be."

### John Wesley:
1. For this cause ‚Äî Because of this intimate union. Genesis 2:24.
