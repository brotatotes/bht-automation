# Ephesians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who engage in fornication, uncleanness, or covetousness, which is essentially idolatry, are aware that they have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. The sin of covetousness, seen as worship of the created rather than the Creator, is severely rebuked by St. Paul due to his own abandonment of selfish greed. This firm exclusion from the eternal verities of the Kingdom emphasizes the need for riches to be used for the good of others and the glory of God in order to avoid their own destruction.
