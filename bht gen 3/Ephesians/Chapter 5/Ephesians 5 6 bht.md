## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let no one deceive you with empty sayings... words with no underlying facts." 
2. "The caution was especially needed, at a time when moral purity was so generally regarded as a thing indifferent."
3. "His special wrath, His vengeance for these sins, over and above their state of disobedience, on the sons of disobedience."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "vainâ€”empty, unreal words, namely, palliations of 'uncleanness,' 'covetousness,' and 'jesting.'"
2. "comethâ€”present, not merely 'shall come.' Is as sure as if already come."
3. "The children of unbelief in doctrine are 'children of disobedience' in practice, and these again are 'children of wrath.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let no one by artful pleas persuade you that there will be no danger from practicing these vices."
2. "It required, therefore, all the authority of an apostle to convince them, that however plausible were the arguments in defense of them, they certainly exposed those who practiced them to the wrath of God."
3. "For because of these things cometh the wrath of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Vain. Plausible, but devoid of truth, and employed to palliate heathen vices.


### John Calvin:
1. "Let no man deceive you...In all ages, indeed, Satan raises up sorcerers of this description, who endeavor by unholy scoffs to escape the Divine judgment." 
2. "Paul...exclaims that we must guard against that sophistry by which consciences are ensnared to their ruin."
3. "God does not make himself an object of terror to his children, that they may avoid him, but does all that can be done in a fatherly manner, to draw them to himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let no man deceive you with empty words; words that do not contain truth." 
2. "Covetousness especially is scarcely accounted a sin, even among Christians; yet the Apostle condemns it more strongly than the other vice which the heathen then tolerated."
3. "To be deceived by empty words about these sins leads to this visitation of Godâ€™s wrath."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  With empty words (ÎºÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹Ï‚ Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Î¹Ï‚). Instrumental case. Probably Paul has in mind the same Gnostic praters as in Colossians 2:4. See Ephesians 2:2. 


### John Gill:
1. "Let no man deceive you with vain words,.... With vain philosophy, vain babblings, with foolish and filthy talking; suggesting that these were not sinful the apostle had condemned; or that they were small sins, the frailties of human life; and that God would take no notice of them, and they might continue in them with impunity." 
2. "The wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience; in temporal judgments, and in eternal ruin; there have been instances of it; it is usually the case, and always if grace prevents not; this wrath comes down from above, and sometimes suddenly, with great force and power, like a mighty flood; and there is no standing up under it, and against it."
3. "The consideration of their not being appointed to this wrath, though deserving of it as others, and of their deliverance from it by Christ, should engage them the more to abstain from these sins."

### John Wesley:
1. Because of these things â€” As innocent as the heathens esteem them, and as those dealers in vain words would persuade you to think them.
