# Ephesians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our wrestling as believers is not against flesh and blood, but against the governments and powers of this present state of darkness. This fight takes place in the heavenly places, where the evil spirits dwell, and we need the panoply of God to overcome them. Our real struggle is not with human beings, but with the supernatural foes of evil. It is important for us to recognize our own weakness, the strength of our spiritual enemies, and God's provision for our defense.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the governments, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this present state of darkness."
2. "It is in heavenly matters that our fight takes place."
3. "That habitation of the evil spirits, which in ch. ii. 2 was said, when speaking of mere matters of fact, to be in the air, is, now that the difficulty and importance of the Christian conflict is being forcibly set forth, represented as 'in the heavenly places'â€”over us, and too strong for us without the panoply of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For our wrestling ('the wrestling' in which we are engaged) is not against flesh, c. Flesh and blood foes are Satan's mere tools, the real foe lurking behind them is Satan himself, with whom our conflict is."
2. "The more clearly any book of Scripture, as this, treats of the economy of the kingdom of light, the more clearly does it set forth the kingdom of darkness. Hence, nowhere does the satanic kingdom come more clearly into view than in the Gospels which treat of Christ, the true Light."
3. "But believers have naught to fear, being 'blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were the source and origin of all their spiritual conflicts, and with them the warfare was to be maintained."
2. "The earth - dark, and wretched and ignorant, and sinful - is just such a dominion as they would choose, or as they would cause; and the degradation and woe of the pagan world are just such as foul and malignant spirits would delight in."
3. "No empire has been so extended, or has continued so long, as that empire of darkness; and nothing on earth is so difficult to destroy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our wrestling is."
2. "World - Rulers of this darkness."
3. "The spiritual hosts of wickedness."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our difficulties are far greater than if we had to fight with men. There we resist human strength, sword is opposed to sword, man contends with man, force is met by force, and skill by skill; but here the case is widely different."
2. "Let us remember this when the injurious treatment of others provokes us to revenge. Our natural disposition would lead us to direct all our exertions against the men themselves; but this foolish desire will be restrained by the consideration that the men who annoy us are nothing more than darts thrown by the hand of Satan."
3. "By speaking of the power of the enemy, Paul labors to keep us more on the alert. He had already called him the devil, but now employs a variety of epithets, to make the reader understand that this is not an enemy who may be safely despised."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our real conflict as Christians is not with men, nor even with our own human nature."
2. "The one great practical purpose is to warn us against misapprehending the nature of the spiritual conflict."
3. "The three great mistakes are: not knowing our own weakness; not knowing the strength of our spiritual foes; not knowing Godâ€™s provision for our defense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To us the wrestling is not."
2. "These 'world-rulers' are limited to 'this darkness' here on earth."
3. "Our 'wrestling' is with foes of evil natural and supernatural. We sorely need 'the panoply of God' (furnished by God)."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a reason why saints should be strong in the Lord, and why they should put on the whole armour of God, and prepare for battle, since their enemies are such as here described."
2. "The devil is called by them, 'the prince of darkness', and mention is made by them of 'the darkness of the world'; from whom the apostle seems to have taken these phrases, as being in common use among the Jews."
3. "We should have on our armour, and be in a readiness to engage them [the wicked spirits]; and so the Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it, 'under', or 'beneath heaven'; and the Arabic version, 'in the air'."

### John Wesley:
1. "For our wrestling is not only, not chiefly, against flesh and blood - Weak men, or fleshly appetites."
2. "But against principalities, against powers â€” The mighty princes of all the infernal legions."
3. "Against wicked spirits â€” Who continually oppose faith, love, holiness, either by force or fraud; and labour to infuse unbelief, pride, idolatry malice, envy, anger, hatred."
