# Ephesians 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take up the entire armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, to stand firm at your post. We must have our armor always on, ready against the evil day, for the fight that demands everything. With Divine strength and equipment, we can overcome and stand victorious against our foes, the wiles and stratagems of Satan. Having done all, we must still keep on our armor, watching and praying to endure to the end and stand before the Son of Man.
