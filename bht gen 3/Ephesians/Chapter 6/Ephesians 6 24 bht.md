## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "He who is good enough for Christ, is good enough for me."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There could not be a more appropriate close of the Epistle than such a wish; there will be nothing more needful for us when we come to the close of life than the consciousness that we love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity."
2. "To writer and reader may this be equally the inestimable consolation then!"
3. "Better, far better then will be the evidence of such sincere love, than all the wealth which toil can gain, all the honors which the world can bestow - than the most splendid mansion, or the widest fame."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

2. "When the heart of man is free from all hypocrisy, it will be free from all corruption."
3. "The only way of enjoying the light of the Divine countenance is to love sincerely God‚Äôs own Son, in whom his love toward us has been declared and confirmed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Extensively, the Church is not bounded by those external limits necessarily established by ecclesiastical organizations, nor by those logical ones as necessarily defined by detailed dogmatic statement."
2. "Intensively, however, this definition opposes the view that the Church can dwell in the region of indifferentism, ignorance, doubt, or unbelief."
3. "Mere ‚Äòsincerity‚Äô is not sufficient; the love must move in a sphere, partake of a character, which is ‚Äòperennial, immutable, incorruptible,‚Äô and Christ‚Äôs grace alone can produce such a love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  In uncorruptness (ŒµŒΩ Œ±œÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉŒπŒ±). A never diminishing love. See 1 Corinthians 15:42 for Œ±œÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉŒπŒ±. 


### John Gill:
1. "Love to Christ is a grace of the Spirit, and is in all believers; and though it is imperfect, and sometimes cold, it will abide for ever." 
2. "It ought to be universal and superlative; all of Christ is to be loved, and he is to be loved above all." 
3. "Grace may be connected with the word translated 'sincerity', and be rendered 'grace with incorruption': or incorruptible grace, as true grace is an incorruptible seed; or 'grace with immortality'."

### John Wesley:
1. In sincerity ‚Äî Or in incorruption; without corrupting his genuine gospel, without any mixture of corrupt affections. And that with continuance, till grace issue in glory.
