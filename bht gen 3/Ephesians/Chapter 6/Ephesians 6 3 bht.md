## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The godly are equally blessed in every land, as the Jews were in the land which God gave them."
2. "This promise is always fulfilled, either literally, or by the substitution of a higher blessing, namely, one spiritual and eternal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That it may be well with thee - ... they would be more happy, useful, and virtuous if they obeyed their parents than if they disobeyed them."
2. "Long life was regarded as a great blessing; and this blessing was promised. The apostle here gives to the promise a more general form, and says that obedience to parents was connected at all times with long life."
3. "obedient children are saved from the vices and crimes which shorten life... Obedience to parents is connected with virtuous habits that are conducive to long life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Thou mayest live long [ŒµœÉŒ∑ ŒºŒ±Œ∫œÅŒøœáœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒøœÇ] . Lit., mayest be long - lived. The adjective occurs only here.


### John Calvin:
1. "The promise is ‚Äî a long life; from which we are led to understand that the present life is not to be overlooked among the gifts of God."
2. "Those who show kindness to their parents from whom they derived life, are assured by God, that in this life it will be well with them."
3. "But as the same divine blessing is extended to the whole world, Paul has properly left out the mention of a place, the peculiar distinction of which lasted only till the coming of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is hardly safe to affirm that the original commandment necessarily implied the wider reference; and that Paul omitted the last clause because his readers were not only familiar with the passage but understood it in this wider sense."
2. "To give the promise an exclusively spiritual meaning is altogether unwarranted."
3. "It is to be applied ‚Äòsimply and plainly to individuals, subject of course to the conditions which always belong to such temporal promises‚Äô (Ellicott)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That it may be well with thee (ŒπŒΩŒ± ŒµœÖ œÉŒø Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ∑œÑŒ±). From Exodus 20:12, 'that it may happen to thee well.'"

3. "ŒúŒ±Œ∫œÅŒøœáœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒøœÇ is a late and rare compound adjective, here only in N.T. (from LXX, Exodus 20:12)."
