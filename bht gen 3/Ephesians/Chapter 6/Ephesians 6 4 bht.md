# Ephesians 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Parents, whether fathers or mothers, should avoid provoking or irritating their children through vexatious commands, unreasonable blame, or uncertain temper. Instead, they are called to raise their children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord, using discipline by means of punishment and training through words of encouragement, remonstrance, or reproof. Fathers, who are more prone to passion, should be extra cautious in their interactions with their children. It is the parents' responsibility to guide their children in the fear of the Lord and correct them when needed, fostering a respectful and obedient relationship.
