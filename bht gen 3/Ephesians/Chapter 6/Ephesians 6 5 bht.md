## BHT:
Servants, as slaves, it is your duty to obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, in simplicity of heart, as if you were serving Christ Himself. Let your motivation come from Him, as He is the source of all Christian motives and duties.

Remember, your service should be characterized by singleness of heart, without double-mindedness or eye-service, and always putting your master's interests first.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Slaves, obey your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of your heart, as to Christ." 
2. "Anxious reverence, which will be the fruit of simplicity of heart." 
3. "He being the source and ground of all Christian motives and duties."

3. "Singleness - without double-mindedness, or 'eye service,' which seeks to please outwardly, without the sincere desire to make the master's interest at all times the first consideration."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not the design of the Christian religion to produce a rude sundering of the ties which bind man to man, but to teach all to perform their duties aright in the relations in which Christianity found them, and gradually to modify the customs of society, and to produce ultimately the universal prevalence of that which is right."
2. "Whatever might be true about the propriety of slavery, and whatever might be the duty of the master about setting the slave free, it would be more to the honor of religion for the servant to perform his task with a willing mind than to be contumacious and rebellious."
3. "Fidelity, in whatever situation we may be in life, is acceptable service to the Lord. A Christian may as acceptably serve the Lord Jesus in the condition of a servant, as if he were a minister of the gospel, or a king on a throne."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "According to the flesh. Regarded in their merely human relation."

2. "As if he had said, 'Do not suppose that by the judgment of men you were thrown into slavery. It is God who has laid upon you this burden, who has placed you in the power of your masters.'"
3. "He who conscientiously endeavors to render what he owes to his master, performs his duty not to man only, but to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The application of the principles here involved must legitimately result in the abolition of slavery; but the Apostle rightly deemed it of more importance to secure Christian ethics in the already existing relation than to violently overthrow it."
2. "With fear and trembling; with anxious, conscientious solicitude, in singleness of heart, as the element of their anxious service; opposed to duplicity, in which the inner disposition and outward appearance do not correspond."
3. "The distinctly Christian motive is especially important here... The same motive ought to have validity in connection with the duties of any Christian employ√©, from a cabinet minister to a day laborer. Fidelity is a rare virtue when this basis does not exist."
