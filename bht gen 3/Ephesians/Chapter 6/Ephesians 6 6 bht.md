# Ephesians 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Serving as bondmen of Christ, our aim should not be to please men through eyeservice alone. Instead, our service should be rooted in doing the will of God, even while serving our earthly masters. We must not be men-pleasers, but rather Christ-pleasers, faithfully carrying out the unseen Master's will. By serving with sincerity and devotion, both when our masters are present and when they are absent, we demonstrate our commitment to honoring and pleasing God above all.
