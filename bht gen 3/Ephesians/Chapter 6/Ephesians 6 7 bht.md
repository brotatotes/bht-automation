# Ephesians 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are encouraged to serve not with eye-service, but from the heart with good will. By doing service as to the Lord and not solely for men, believers demonstrate their devotion to God and make every action a sacrifice in his sight. This includes having a real regard for others, just as Xenophon highlighted that a slave should have good will towards their master's interests as if it were their own. Obedience to God's will should be the true motivation for service, showing genuine care and a desire to please the Lord.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words need here no such qualification as 'from the heart': if the will of God be the real object of the man's obedience, that it is not an eye-service will be sufficiently ensured." 
2. "The double qualification, 'from the heart with good will,' attached to doing service, describes beautifully the source in himself [from the heart] and the accompanying feeling towards another [with good will] of Christian service."
3. "Doing service as to the Lord, and not to men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Good will" is stated by XENOPHON
[Economics] to be the principal virtue of a slave towards his
master: a real regard to his master's interest as if his own, a good
will which not even a master's severity can extinguish.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He should regard his lot in life as having been ordered by Divine Providence for some wise and good purpose."
2. "The feeling that 'God' has ordered the circumstances of our lives, and that he has some wise and good ends to answer by it, makes us contented there."
3. "A conscientious slave may find happiness in submitting to God, and doing his will, just as a conscientious martyr may. But this does not sanction the wrong, either of the slave-owner or of the persecutor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. With good - will. Bengel quotes Xenophon : "The slave that is a steward must have good - will if he is to on thy place adequately." Compare Colossians 3:23.


### John Calvin:
1. "Though they dare not openly break out or give signs of obstinacy, their dislike of the authority exercised over them is so strong, that it is with the greatest unwillingness and reluctance that they obey their masters."
2. "It is God who appoints and regulates all the arrangements of society."
3. "He reminds them that their spiritual freedom, which was by far the most desirable, remained untouched."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The work is to be done 'from the soul,' heartily..."
2. "Doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men."
3. "This virtually sums up Ephesians 6:6, and returns to the motive to Ephesians 6:5: 'as to Christ.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  With good will (Î¼ÎµÏ„' ÎµÏ…Î½Î¿Î¹Î±Ï‚). Not in Col. Old word from ÎµÏ…Î½Î¿Î¿Ï‚, only here in N.T. as ÎµÏ…Î½Î¿ÎµÏ‰ is in N.T. only in Matthew 5:25. 


### John Gill:
1. "With good will doing service,.... To their masters; not grudgingly, with an ill will; no otherwise, nor longer than when they are forced to it; but of a ready mind, and with a cheerful spirit, taking delight in their work, and reckoning it a pleasure to serve their masters."
2. "Doing what they do as to the Lord, and not to men; not merely because it is the will of men, and they are commanded by them, and in order to please them, but because it is the will of the Lord, and is wellpleasing in his sight."

### John Wesley:
1. "Unto the Lord, and not to men â€” That is, rather than to men."
2. "Making every action of common life a sacrifice to God."
3. "Having an eye to him in all things, even as if there were no other master."
