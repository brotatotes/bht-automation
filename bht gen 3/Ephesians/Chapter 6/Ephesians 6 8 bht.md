# Ephesians 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this section, we are reminded that all individuals, regardless of their position in society, will be rewarded by God for the good they have done. This promise should not be interpreted metaphorically or restricted to heavenly rewards, as it involves a genuine recompense from the Lord. Even if masters or authorities fail to appreciate or reciprocate their servants' kindness, God recognizes their acts and considers Himself indebted to them. This assurance reminds us that God values every act of goodness, irrespective of how society perceives it.

2. "Knowing that each man, if he shall have done any good thing, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether he be slave or free."
3. "For just as those who receive a benefit, if they be not grateful to their benefactors, make God a debtor to them: so in this case the masters, if you treat them well and they make you no return, have in fact made a greater return, by making God your debtor."
