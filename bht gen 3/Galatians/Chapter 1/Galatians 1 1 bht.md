In Galatians 1:1, there is a clear contrast between ordinary man and Jesus Christ and God the Father. The Apostle Paul emphasizes that his call to apostleship came directly from God, through the immediate agent of Jesus Christ, rather than through human authority.

This sets Paul apart from false apostles, while also highlighting the divine authority and power of Jesus Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The strongest possible contrast is here drawn between man, in the ordinary sense, on the one side, and Jesus Christ, and God the Father, on the other."
2. "Had not the Apostle regarded Jesus Christ as one with the Father in the Godhead, he never could have written thus."
3. "Because the Resurrection, including and implying the Ascension, was the Fatherâ€™s bestowal on Christ of gifts for men, by virtue of which St. Paulâ€™s Apostleship had been received."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not only was the call from God as its ultimate source, but by Christ and the Father as the immediate agent in calling him."
2. "The opposition between 'Christ' and 'man,' and His name being put in closest connection with God the Father, imply His Godhead."
3. "He had seen and been constituted an apostle by Him in His resurrection power."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He [Paul] means to affirm, that he had not been sent out by the body of apostles at Jerusalem."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From men - through man or a man. In contradiction of the assertion that he was not directly commissioned by Jesus Christ, like the twelve, but only by human authority."
2. "He thus distinguishes himself from false apostles who did not derive their commissions from God, and ranks himself with the twelve."
3. "It was the risen Christ who made Paul an apostle."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us always bear this in mind, that in the church we ought to listen to God alone, and to Jesus Christ, whom he has appointed to be our teacher."
2. "Whoever assumes a right to instruct us, must speak in the name of God or of Christ."
3. "The calling of Paul is therefore more illustrious than it would have been, if Christ, while still a mortal, had ordained him to the office."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An Apostle, lit., messenger; here in the highest sense: one of the special messengers of Christ and witnesses of his resurrection who were (1) directly called by him, (2) inspired by the Holy Spirit, and hence infallible in their religious teaching, and (3) commissioned to all nations; hence the founders and authoritative teachers of the whole church in all ages."
2. "Not from men, nor through man. Paulâ€™s apostleship is entirely independent of human agency, direct or indirect. The preposition â€˜fromâ€™ denotes the origin or fountain, the preposition â€˜throughâ€™ the instrumentality or channel."
3. "And God the Father. The immediate and frequent coordination of Christ with God the Father, especially here in contrast with the preceding men and man, proves that the Apostle regarded the Saviour as a Divine being."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul denies that his apostleship had a human source and that it had come to him through a human channel."
2. "The call to be an apostle came to Paul through Jesus Christ."
3. "And therefore Paul was qualified to be an apostle since he had seen the Risen Christ."

1. "He asserts himself to be 'an apostle', which was the highest office in the church, to which he was immediately called by Christ, and confirmed in it by signs and wonders."
2. "He did not act upon human authority, or by an human commission: this is said in opposition to the false apostles, and to an unlawful investiture with the office of apostleship."
3. "Jesus Christ being here opposed to man, does not suggest that he was not a man, really and truly, for he certainly was; he partook of the same flesh and blood with us, and was in all things made like unto us, sin excepted; but that he was not a mere man, he was truly God as well as man."

### John Wesley:
1. "Here it was necessary for St. Paul to assert his authority; otherwise he is very modest in the use of this title." 
2. "Not commissioned from them, but from God the Father."
3. "Neither by any man as an instrument, but by Jesus Christ."
