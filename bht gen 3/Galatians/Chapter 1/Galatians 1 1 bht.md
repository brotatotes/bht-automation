## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The strongest possible contrast is here drawn between man, in the ordinary sense, on the one side, and Jesus Christ, and God the Father, on the other."
2. "It is important to remember that the mission of Paul to the actual work of the ministry was by the command of the Holy Spirit, proceeding from, and expressing the will of, the Father and the Son."
3. "The Resurrection, including and implying the Ascension, was the Fatherâ€™s bestowal on Christ of gifts for men, by virtue of which Paulâ€™s Apostleship had been received."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "evidently because his apostolic commission needs now to be vindicated against deniers of it."
2. "Not only was the call from God as its ultimate source, but by Christ and the Father as the immediate agent in calling him."
3. "implying that, though he had not seen Him in His humiliation as the other apostles (which was made an objection against him), he had seen and been constituted an apostle by Him in His resurrection power."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His was a higher calling; a calling of God, and he had been sent directly by him." 
2. "He was neither sent out from any body of people to execute their purposes; nor did he receive his commission, authority, or ordination through the medium of any man." 
3. "He had the highest possible authority for the office of an apostle; he had been called to it by God himself, who had raised up the Redeemer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From men - through man or a man. In contradiction of the assertion that he was not directly commissioned by Jesus Christ, like the twelve, but only by human authority." 
2. "He thus distinguishes himself from false apostles who did not derive their commissions from God, and ranks himself with the twelve." 
3. "It was the risen Christ who made Paul an apostle."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever assumes a right to instruct us, must speak in the name of God or of Christ. Let us always bear this in mind, that in the church we ought to listen to God alone, and to Jesus Christ, whom he has appointed to be our teacher." 
2. "His meaning will therefore stand thus: 'Whoever may be the persons by whom others boast that they have been sent, I shall be superior to them; for I hold my commission from God and Christ.'"
3. "The calling of Paul is therefore more illustrious than it would have been, if Christ, while still a mortal, had ordained him to the office. And this circumstance deserves attention; for Paul intimates that the attempt to set aside his authority, involved a malignant opposition to the astonishing power of God, which was displayed in the resurrection of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paulâ€™s apostleship is entirely independent of human agency, direct or indirect."
2. "The Apostles are both â€˜from Christâ€™ and â€˜through Christ;â€™ their disciples (and all regular teachers of the church) are â€˜fromâ€™ Christ, but â€˜through man;â€™ the false teachers are â€˜from menâ€™ and â€˜through man,â€™ or self-constituted intruders without any authority from Christ."
3. "The immediate and frequent coordination of Christ with God the Father, especially here in contrast with the preceding men and man, proves that the Apostle regarded the Saviour as a Divine being."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The bluntness of Paul's denial is due to the charge made by the Judaizers that Paul was not a genuine apostle because not one of the twelve."
2. "Paul denies that his apostleship had a human source and that it had come to him through a human channel."
3. "And therefore Paul was qualified to be an apostle since he had seen the Risen Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "He asserts himself to be 'an apostle', which was the highest office in the church, to which he was immediately called by Christ, and confirmed in it by signs and wonders."
2. "This serves the more to confirm the divine authority under which Paul acted as an apostle, being not only made so by Christ, but also by God the Father."
3. "His call to apostleship was rather more grand and illustrious than that of any of the other apostles."

### John Wesley:
1. "Here it was necessary for St. Paul to assert his authority; otherwise he is very modest in the use of this title."
2. "Not commissioned from them, but from God the Father."
3. "Neither by any man as an instrument, but by Jesus Christ."
