# Galatians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, a zealous assertor of his ancestral traditions, became a proficient and excelled in distinctively Jewish culture. He outstripped his Jewish contemporaries in his progress in Judaism, particularly in the Pharisaic traditions engrafted on the law. However, his encounter with the Christian tradition transformed him, leading him to go beyond the Jewish traditions and teach the Gospel. It is worth noting that his zealous pursuit of the Jewish religion was not founded on true knowledge, as Jesus himself opposed such traditions and emphasized the importance of relying on the Bible rather than ecclesiastical traditions.
