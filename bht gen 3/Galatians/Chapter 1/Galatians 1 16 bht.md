2. "Christ was the subject of his ministry; the things respecting his person, as that he was very God, the Son of God, God and man in one person the things respecting his office, as that he is the only Mediator between God and man, the prophet of the church, the high priest over the house of God, and King of saints."
3. "Immediately, as soon as he was called by grace, and Christ was revealed in him, he set about it."

### John Wesley:
1. "To reveal his Son in me ‚Äî By the powerful operation of his Spirit."
