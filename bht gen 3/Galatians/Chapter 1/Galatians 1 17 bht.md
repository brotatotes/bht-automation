### Henry Alford:

2. "Its object does not seem to have been the preaching of the Gospel,â€”but preparation for the apostolic work."
3. "Here we must apparently take it in the wider sense, and understand that part of the Arabian desert which nearly bordered on Damascus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This was a country of the Gentiles; here doubtless he preached as he did before and after (Acts 9:20; Acts 9:22) at Damascus: thus he shows the independence of his apostolic commission."
2. "He also here had that comparative retirement needed, after the first fervor of his conversion, to prepare him for the great work before him."
3. "The Lord from heaven communed with him, as He on earth in the days of His flesh communed with the other apostles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of this statement is to show that, in no sense, did he derive his commission from man."
2. "Several of the apostles remained in Jerusalem for a considerable time after the ascension of the Lord Jesus, and it was regarded as the principal place of authority."
3. "He has given the leading events in the public labors of Paul; and it is not at all improbable that he has omitted not a few short excursions made by him for the purpose of preaching the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Went I up...In that case the meaning would be went away to Jerusalem from where I then was."
2. "Apostles before me. In point of seniority."
3. "It is entirely impossible to decide what Paul means by this term."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a mistake to suppose, that, because the apostles are now separately mentioned, they are not included in the words, flesh and blood."
2. "For the purpose of shewing that he did not owe his commission to man, the false boasting of unprincipled men laid him under the necessity of contrasting the authority of the apostles themselves with the authority of God."
3. "Let godly readers consider the severe temptation with which Paul was called to struggle at the very commencement of his course. He who but yesterday, for the sake of doing him honor, had been sent to Damascus with a magnificent retinue, is now compelled to wander as an exile in a foreign land: but he does not lose his courage."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul concedes to the other Apostles no other preference but the priority of call. He knew and declared in all humility that by the grace of God he labored more in word and deed than they all."
2. "After the great moral revolution which shook his body and soul, he needed repose and time of preparation for his apostleship by prayer, meditation, and the renewed study of the Old Testament, in the light of its fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus of Nazareth."
3. "There is no spot on earth where one may receive a stronger and deeper impression of the terrible majesty of Godâ€™s law, which threatens death to the transgressor, than on Mount Sinai and the awful panorama of desolation and death which surrounds it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His call did not come from them nor did he receive confirmation by them."
2. "This visit to Arabia has to come between the two visits to Damascus which are not distinguished in Acts 9:22."
3. "We must place the visit to Arabia between verses Galatians 1:22; Galatians 1:23."

### John Gill:
1. "he did not receive the Gospel from men, no not from the apostles themselves; since, upon his conversion, he did not go up to Jerusalem to see any of them, and talk with them"
2. "nor did he stand in need of any instructions from them, being immediately furnished sufficiently by Christ himself"
3. "he proved that Jesus of Nazareth was the true Messiah, to the confusion of the Jews there; which drew upon him their resentment and indignation"

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither did I go up to Jerusalem... But I immediately went again into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus." 
2. "He presupposes the journey to Damascus, in which he was converted, as being known to them all."
