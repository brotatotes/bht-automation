# Galatians 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
James, the Lord's brother, was one of the Twelve apostles and the only one Paul saw during his visit. It is likely that James was a son of Joseph and Mary, as his brothers are never called sons of Joseph. He should not be confused with James, the son of Zebedee. James and Jude, both apostles, are probably the authors of the Epistles attributed to them. Paul mentioning James as an apostle highlights his equality with the Twelve against the Judaizers' attacks.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That James, the Lordâ€™s brother, was one of the Twelve, and the only one besides Peter whom Paul saw at this visit."
2. "We must then adopt (2): which is besides in consonance with other notices respecting the term Apostle, and the person here mentioned."
3. "I reserve the subject for full discussion in the Introduction to the Epistle of James."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James, the Lord's brotherâ€”This designation, to distinguish him from James the son of Zebedee, was appropriate while that apostle was alive. But before Paul's second visit to Jerusalem (Galatians 2:1; Acts 15:1-4), he had been beheaded by Herod (Acts 12:2)."
2. "His brethren are never called 'sons of Joseph,' which they would have been had they been the Lord's brothers strictly."
3. "It is not likely there would be two pairs of brothers named alike, of such eminence as James and Jude; the likelihood is that the apostles James and Jude are also the writers of the Epistles, and the brethren of Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the list of the apostles in Matthew 10:2-3, two of this name are mentioned, James the son of Zebedee and brother of John, and James the son of Alpheus."
2. "This latter James was called James the Less Mark 15:40, to distinguish him from the other James, probably because he was the younger."
3. "It is probable that this was the James referred to here, as it is evident from the Acts of the Apostles that he was a prominent man among the apostles in Jerusalem."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I saw none save James. Not, I saw none other of the apostles, but I saw James." 
2. "The Lord's brother means that James was a son of Joseph and Mary." 
3. "The explanations which differ from that of Helvidius have grown, largely, out of the desire to maintain the perpetual virginity of Mary."

### John Calvin:
1. "Almost all the ancients are agreed that he was one of the disciples, whose surname was 'Oblias' and 'The Just,' and that he presided over the church at Jerusalem."
2. "It appears to me, therefore, far more probable, that the person of whom he is speaking is the son of Alpheus."
3. "This must be understood to relate, not to the twelve, but to these two apostles, who alone were at that time residing in Jerusalem."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exceptive words 'but only...intimates...that he was...an Apostle only in the wider sense, who, owing to his character, position, and relationship to the Lord, enjoyed apostolical authority. The sense then is: 'the only other man of prominence and authority I saw was James.'" (Galatians 1:19)
2. "'Brother' is...a uterine brother, i.e., a younger son of Joseph and Mary (which is the most natural view; comp. the words â€˜tillâ€™ and â€˜first bornâ€™ in Matthew 1:25, and Luke 2:7); or a son of Joseph from a previous marriage, and hence a step-son of Mary and a step-brother of Jesus." (Galatians 1:19)
3. "The cousin-theory...is exegetically untenable...The following reasons are conclusive against it and in favor of a closer relationship: (1.) the natural meaning of the term â€˜brother,â€™...; (2.) the fact that these brothers and sisters appear in the Gospels constantly in close connection with the holy family; (3.) they are represented as unbelieving before the resurrection...which excludes them from the Twelve; (4.) they are always distinguished from the Twelve." (Galatians 1:19)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "James the brother of the Lord... is here termed an apostle, though not one of the twelve." 
2. "Paul is showing his independence of and equality with the twelve in answer to the attacks of the Judaizers." 
3. "The rest of the twelve were probably away preaching."

### John Gill:
1. "This James was James the less, the son of Mary the wife of Cleophas, which Cleophas was the brother of Joseph, the husband of Mary the mother of our Lord."
2. "And so our Lord and this James were brothers' children, as was supposed: or else the wife of Cleophas the mother of James, was sister to Mary the mother of Christ."
3. "Christ had brethren or relations according to the flesh, distinct from his disciples and apostles, and his brethren among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "But other of the apostles I saw none, save James the brother (that is, the kinsman) of the Lord."
2. "Therefore when Barnabas is said to have 'brought him into the apostles,' Acts 9:27, only St. Peter and St James are meant."
