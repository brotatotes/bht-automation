### Philip Schaff:
1. "The James here spoken of is not James the elder, the son of Zebedee and Salome... but the same who... presided over the congregation of Jerusalem... and is frequently called â€˜brother of the Lord,â€™ as here, or simply James."
2. "The exceptive words â€˜but only,â€™... do not necessarily imply that this James was one of the twelve Apostles... but it intimates rather... that he was, like Barnabas, an Apostle only in the wider sense, who, owing to his character, position, and relationship to the Lord, enjoyed apostolical authority."
3. "To distinguish him from the two Apostles of that name. â€˜Brotherâ€™ is not cousin... but either a uterine brother, i.e., a younger son of Joseph and Mary... or a son of Joseph from a previous marriage, and hence a step-son of Mary and a step-brother of Jesus."

2. "Christ had brethren or relations according to the flesh, distinct from his disciples and apostles, and his brethren among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "But other of the apostles I saw none, save James the brother (that is, the kinsman) of the Lord."
2. "Therefore when Barnabas is said to have 'brought him into the apostles,' Acts 9:27, only St. Peter and St James are meant."
