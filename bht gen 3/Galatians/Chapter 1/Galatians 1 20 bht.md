## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This asseveration applies most naturally to the important fact just assertedâ€”his short visit to Jerusalem, and his having seen only Peter and James." 
2. "If a report had been spread in Galatia that after his conversion he spent years at Jerusalem and received regular institution in Christianity at the hands of the Apostles, this last fact would naturally cause amazement, and need a strong confirmatory asseveration."
3. "This last fact would naturally cause amazement, and need a strong confirmatory asseveration."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "...his visit was but for fifteen days and that he saw no apostle save Peter and James." 
3. "...his earnestness in asserting the contrary facts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of this oath here is to prevent all suspicion of falsehood."
2. "It was an extraordinary and miraculous revelation of the truth by Jesus Christ himself."
3. "That fact was so extraordinary, and it was so remarkable that the system thus communicated to him should harmonize so entirely with that taught by the other apostles with whom he had had no contact."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I lie not. Comp. Romans 9:1; 2 Corinthians 11:31; 1 Timothy 2:7.


### John Calvin:
1. "The vast earnestness of Paul on this subject is evinced by his resorting to an oath, which cannot lawfully be employed but on great and weighty occasions."

1. "Now the things which I write unto you... he therefore not only wrote these things, but for the confirmation of them solemnly appeals to God the searcher of hearts for the truth of them."
2. "behold, before God I lie not; which is not only a strong asseveration, but a formal oath."
3. "whence it is manifest that an oath upon proper occasions, where there is a necessity for it, and a good end to be answered by it, may be lawfully made."
