After fourteen years, Paul embarked on a significant journey to Jerusalem.

Furthermore, the presence of Titus, a Greek Christian, posed a challenge to those advocating for adherence to Jewish customs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "After fourteen years"; namely, from Paul's conversion inclusive. In the fourteenth year from his conversion.
2. His omitting allusion to that decree is; (1) Because his design here is to show the Galatians his own independent apostolic authority, whence he was not likely to support himself by their decision. Thus we see that general councils are not above apostles. (2) Because he argues the point upon principle, not authoritative decisions. (3) The decree did not go the length of the position maintained here: the council did not impose Mosaic ordinances; the apostle maintains that the Mosaic institution itself is at an end.
3. Paul meets them by a far more direct confutation, "Christ is of no effect unto you whosoever are justified by the law".

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is commonly supposed that Paul here refers to the visit which he made as recorded in Acts 15:0." 
2. "Paul seems to have taken him with him as a private affair; but the reason is not mentioned. It may have been to show his Christian liberty, and his sense of what he had a right to do; or it may have been to furnish a case on the subject of inquiry." 
3. "He attended Paul frequently in his travels; was employed by him in important services."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fourteen years after" Rev. after the space of fourteen years. Comp. dij ejtwn pleionwn after several years, Acts 24:17; dij hJmerwn after (some) days, Mark 2:1. (26 words)
2. "Dia means after, that is, a given number of years being interposed between two points of time." (19 words)
3. "Not, in the course of (Rev. marg.)." (5 words)

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not reasonable to suppose that Peter would have used such dissimulation, if that controversy had been settled and the decree of the Apostles published."
2. "While his opponents were falsely pleading the name of the apostles, and earnestly striving to ruin the reputation of Paul, what carelessness would it have angered in him to pass by the decree universally circulated among them?"
3. "In their name, you oblige the Gentiles to keep the law, but I appeal to their own writing, which sets the consciences of men at liberty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fourteen years of independent apostolic labor are to be reckoned not from the journey last mentioned (Galatians 1:18), but from Paulâ€™s conversion, this being the great turning point in his life." 
2. "But in neither case was I instructed or commissioned by them; on the contrary, they recognized me as an independent, divinely appointed Apostle of the Gentiles." 
3. "Being an uncircumcised convert and a living testimony of the efficient labors of Paul among the Gentiles, Titus was peculiarly suited for the object of this journey."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul is not giving a recital of his visits to Jerusalem, but of his points of contact with the apostles in Jerusalem."
2. "Paul here gives the inside view of this private conference in Jerusalem that came in between the two public meetings."
3. "But his very presence was a challenge to the Judaizers, since he was a Greek Christian."
