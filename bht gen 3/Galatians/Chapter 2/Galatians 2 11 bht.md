## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "One of the most curious instances of ecclesiastical ingenuity on record has been afforded in the interpretation of this passage by the Fathers."
2. "They try to make it appear that the reproof was only an apparent oneâ€”that St. Peter was entirely in the right, and St. Paul withstood him to the face, i.e. as they explain it, â€˜in appearance merely,â€™ because he had been blamed by others."
3. "Afterwards, Jerome abandoned his view for the right one. because he was condemned] not, â€˜because he was to be blamed,â€™ A.V.: no such meaning can be extracted from the original word. He was â€˜a condemned man,â€™ as we say: by whom, does not appear: possibly, by his own act: or, by the Christians in Antioch: but St. Paul would hardly have waited for the prompting of others to pronounce his condemnation of him. I therefore prefer the former: he was [self] convicted: convicted of inconsistency by his conduct."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostles were not always inspired; but were so always in writing the Scriptures."
2. "The Christian fathers may be trusted generally as witnesses to facts, but not implicitly followed in matters of opinion."
3. "Regarding the proceeding with prejudice, they explained away the force of the Jerusalem decision."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul says that he did not hesitate to resist [Peter] in a case where Peter was manifestly wrong, and thus showed that he was an apostle of the same standing as the others." 
2. "Paul openly opposed him, and reproved him. Paul thus showed that he was equal with Peter in his apostolical authority and dignity." 
3. "The first thing to be noted is, that it was done openly, and with candor. It was reproof addressed to the offender himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The explanation that Paul withstood Peter only in appearance or semblance... is one of the curiosities of exegesis, and was probably adopted out of misplaced consideration for the prestige of Peter."
2. "He was to be blamed... correctly, he stood condemned."
3. "Not by the body of Christians at Antioch; rather his act was its own condemnation."

### John Calvin:
1. "What reason could there now be for hesitating to receive it as certain and undoubted truth?"
2. "This is another thunderbolt which strikes the Papacy of Rome."
3. "The observation of Chrysostom, that, for the sake of avoiding scandal, they would have talked in private if they had any difference, is frivolous."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The logic of the decree pointed to a full communion with the Gentile brethren, but the letter did not. It was a compromise, a step in the right direction, but it stopped half way."
2. "Paul considered this as a matter in itself indifferent and harmless, considering the vanity of idols, provided that no offense be given to weak brethren, in which case he himself would â€˜eat no flesh for evermore,â€™ lest he make his â€˜brother to stumble.â€™"
3. "He was condemned, self-condemned, self-convicted by his own conduct, not by the Gentile Christians of Antioch, for Paul would hardly have waited for the judgment of others in a matter of such importance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I stood against him face to face."
2. "In Antioch he looked him in the eye as his superior in character and courage."
3. "Because he stood condemned."

### John Gill:
1. "he did not go about as a tale bearer, whisperer, and backbiter, but reproved him to his face, freely spoke his mind to him, boldly resisted him, honestly endeavoured to convince him of his mistake, and to put a stop to his conduct; though he did not withstand him as an enemy, or use him with rudeness and ill manners; or as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, and false teachers resist the truth; but as a friend and an apostle, and in an amicable manner, and yet with all uprightness:"
2. "his reason for it was,
because he was to be blamed; some read it, 'was blamed', or 'condemned', either by others, by the Jews, for his going into Cornelius's house formerly; but what has this to do with the present case? or by those who lately came from James to Antioch, for his eating with the Gentiles there; yet this could be no reason for the apostle's withstanding him, but rather a reason why he should stand by him; or he was condemned by himself, self-condemned, acting contrary to the sentiments of his mind, and what he had declared in the council at Jerusalem; though it is best to render the word, to be blamed, which shows that the apostle did not oppose him for opposition sake, rashly, and without any foundation; there was a just reason for it, he had done that which was culpable, and for which he was blameworthy;"
3. "this is to make the apostle guilty of the evil he charges Peter with, namely, dissimulation; no, the opposition was real, and in all faithfulness and integrity;"

### John Wesley:
1. "So far was he from receiving his doctrine from man, or from being inferior to the chief of the apostles."
2. "I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
3. "For fear of man, for dissimulation, and for not walking uprightly."
