## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But the candid reader will I think at once recognize in the words a mission from James: and will find no difficulty in believing that that Apostle, even after the decision of the council regarding the Gentile converts, may have retained his strict view of the duties of Jewish converts."
2. "Thus we have no occasion to assume that James had in the council been over-persuaded by the earnestness and eloquence of Paul, and had afterwards undergone a reaction: for his course will be consistent throughout."
3. "The whole incident is remarkably characteristic of Peterâ€”ever the first to recognize, and the first to draw back from, great principles and truths."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Certain from James... Still James' leanings were to legalism, and this gave him his influence with the Jewish party." 
2. "Yet after all, this same Peter, through fear of man, was faithless to his own so distinctly avowed principles."
3. "We recognize the same old nature in him as led him, after faithfully witnessing for Christ, yet for a brief space, to deny Him."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is very evident that at Jerusalem the special rites of the Jews were observed for a long time by those who became Christian converts."
2. "He had learned that God designed to break down the wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles, and he familiarly associated with them, and partook with them of their food."
3. "No one can read his history without loving his ardent and sincere attachment to his Master; and yet no one can read it without a tear of regret that he was left thus to do injury to his cause."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Did eat with [ÏƒÏ…Î½Î·ÏƒÎ¸Î¹ÎµÎ½] . A. V. misses the force of the imperfect, marking Peter's custom."
2. "Not only at church feasts, but at ordinary meals, in defiance of the Pharisaic that this prohibition was not binding."
3. "He had defended that position in the apostolic conference."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the sake of the Jews, Peter had withdrawn himself from the Gentiles, in order to drive them from the communion of the Church, unless they would relinquish the liberty of the Gospel, and submit to the yoke of the Law." 
2. "If Paul had been silent here, his whole doctrine fell; all the edification obtained by his ministry was ruined."
3. "This shows us how cautiously we ought to guard against giving way to the opinions of men, lest an immoderate desire to please, or an undue dread of giving offense, should turn us aside from the right path."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is unnecessary therefore to charge him with inconsistency. All we can say is that he stopped halfway and never ventured so far as Paul, or even as Peter, who broke through the ceremonial restrictions of their native religion."
2. "With his accustomed ardor Peter carried out his conviction which he had boldly professed in Jerusalem, and made common cause with the Gentile converts."
3. "His strength and weakness, his boldness and timidity are the two opposite manifestations of the same warm, impulsive and impressible temper."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For before that certain came from James... 'for before the coming as to some from James.'" (100 words)
2. "He did eat with the Gentiles... 'he began to draw himself (ÎµÎ±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½) back.'" (20 words)
3. "Separated himself... 'began to separate himself' just like a Pharisee." (15 words)

### John Gill:
1. "He knew that the distinction of meats was now laid aside, and that nothing was common and unclean of itself, and that every creature of God was good, and not to be refused if received with thankfulness; wherefore he made use of his Christian liberty." 
2. "His conduct did not agree with the true sentiments of his mind, which he covered and dissembled."
3. "This led him into such a conduct; so true is that of the wise man, that 'the fear of man bringeth a snare'".
