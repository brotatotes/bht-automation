# Galatians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, as Jews by nature, know that no one is justified by the works of the law, but only through faith in Jesus Christ. Even though we may be Jews and not sinners like the Gentiles, we have found that relying on the law does not bring justification. It is therefore unreasonable to impose the law on the Gentiles, especially when we ourselves have found salvation through faith in Christ.

- Attempt 1 BHT: We (I and thou, Peter), by nature Jews, and not sinners as the Gentiles (according to Jewish language), are not justified by the works of the law, but through the faith of Jesus Christ. By the works of the law, no one can find justification. We, as Jews, recognized the futility of relying on the law for salvation and turned to faith in Christ for justification. Therefore, it is illogical to impose the law on the Gentiles when even the Jews themselves found salvation through faith.
