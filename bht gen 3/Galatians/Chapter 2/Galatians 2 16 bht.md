3. "By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. This is the foundation of a freely bestowed righteousness, when we are stripped of a righteousness of our own."

3. "Paul uses Î´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Î¿ÏƒÏ…Î½Î· in two senses: justification, on the basis of what Christ has done and obtained by faith, and sanctification, actual goodness as the result of living with and for Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Men are not justified by faith, either as an habit, or an act; not by it as an habit or principle, this would be to confound justification and sanctification; nor as an act, for as such it is a man's own, and then justification would be by a man's works, contrary to the Scripture."
2. "These Jews did not believe in Christ, in order by their believing to procure their justification before God, and acceptance with him, but that they might receive, by faith, this blessing from the Lord in their own conscience, and enjoy the comfort of it, and all that spiritual peace which results from it, and which they could not find in the works of the law."
3. "By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
