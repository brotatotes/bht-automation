# Galatians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By rebuilding what was torn down, one proves themselves a transgressor of the law. Peter contradicted himself by asserting the obligation of the law after setting it aside and living like the Gentiles. In doing so, he became an architect of ruin, going against the gospel of freedom. If anyone professes the gospel but doesn't live according to it, they are sinners but not justified, and the blame lies on them, not the gospel.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: By rebuilding the very things that were torn down, one proves themselves to be a transgressor of the law. This is what Peter did by asserting the obligation of the law after previously setting it aside and living like the Gentiles. In doing so, he contradicted himself and became an architect of ruin. By establishing once again the law of bondage, he went against the gospel of freedom. In preaching the gospel, Paul restored true righteousness and the destruction of sin. Therefore, if anyone professes the gospel but does not live according to it, they are sinners but not justified, and the blame lies on them, not the gospel.

- Attempt 4 BHT: In Galatians 2:18, Paul confronts Peter for his inconsistency in upholding the law. Paul emphasizes that by now reasserting the obligation of the law, Peter is proving himself a transgressor and undermining the gospel of grace. Peter's fluctuating behavior of living like a Gentile and then like a Jew tears down both the ceremonial law and salvation by grace. By rebuilding that which had been destroyed, Peter deviates from the true righteousness that comes through faith in Christ and establishes sin instead. As Paul points out, this proves that Peter is not a faithful minister of Christ, but rather a transgressor of the very law he seeks to uphold.

- Attempt 5 BHT: In this passage, Paul confronts Peter's contradictory behavior, accusing him of proving himself a transgressor by rebuilding the very things he had torn down. By asserting the obligation of the law once again, Peter undermines the gospel of grace and debar himself from both justification by the law and justification by Christ. This inconsistency in upholding the law demonstrates Peter's failure to be a faithful minister of Christ, establishing sin instead of true righteousness through faith.
