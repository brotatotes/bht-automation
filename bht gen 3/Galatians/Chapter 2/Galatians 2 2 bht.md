- Attempt 1 BHT: In Galatians 2:2, the anxiety felt by Paul in preventing his work from being disowned by the Judaizers is completely understandable. Unlike Peter and the Judaizers, Paul does not nullify the grace of God; he affirms that Christ gratuitously died, without cause. Paul's purpose in consulting James, Peter, and John is to ensure that the Gospel he preaches to the Gentiles aligns with theirs, and that the results it produces on the Gentile converts are divinely confirmed. By doing so, he avoids the possibility of his running being in vain, had circumcision been deemed necessary. Ultimately, the decision reached by this group would influence the outcome of the public conference.
