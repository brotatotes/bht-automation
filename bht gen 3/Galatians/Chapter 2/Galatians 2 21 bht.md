# Galatians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If righteousness comes through the law, then Christ would have died in vain. By trying to establish our own righteousness through the works of the law, we would frustrate the grace of God and invalidate the death of Christ. However, we cannot be justified by our own efforts, for Christ's death showed that the law has no power to make us righteous. We are saved solely by the grace of God, revealed in the love and atoning death of Christ. Seeking righteousness through the law would reject God's grace and make Christ's death meaningless.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I do not frustrate the grace of Godâ€”I do not make it void, as thou, Peter, art doing by Judaizing."
2. "â€¦Christ died needlessly," or "without just cause."
3. "Christ's having died, shows that the law has no power to justify us; for if the law can justify or make us righteous, the death of Christ is superfluous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul would not take any measures or pursue any course that would render [the grace of God] vain or inefficacious."
2. "A conformity to the rites of Moses as a ground of justification would tend to frustrate the grace of God, or to render the method of salvation solely by the Redeemer nugatory."
3. "To feel the need of a Saviour it is necessary to feel that we are lost and ruined sinners; that we have no merit upon which we can rely; and that we are entirely dependent on the mercy of God for salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I do not invalidate the grace of God in the offering of Christ, as one does who seeks to reestablish the law as a means of justification; for if righteousness comes through the law, there was no occasion for Christ to die."
2. "The law crucified Christ and thereby declared him accursed. In virtue of my moral fellowship with Christ, I was (ethically) crucified with him. The act of the law forced me to break with the law. Through the law I died to the law. Thus I came under a new principle of life."
3. "If I should declare that righteousness is through the law, by reasserting the obligation of the law, I should annul the grace of God as exhibited in the death of Christ: for in that case, Christ's death would be superfluous and useless. But I do not annul the grace of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "For, if we do not renounce all other hopes, and embrace Christ alone, we reject the grace of God."
2. "If we could produce a righteousness of our own, then Christ has suffered in vain; for the intention of his sufferings was to procure it for us."
3. "He who ascribes to works his sanctification, pardon, atonement, righteousness, or deliverance, makes void the death of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The grace of God, which revealed itself in the infinite love and atoning death of Christ."
2. "Christ died for nought, or 'uselessly,' i.e., without good cause; not 'in vain' (i.e., without fruit or effect)."
3. "Christianity has survived all these attacks, and gains new strength from every conflict."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I do not make void the grace of God."
2. "Then Christ died for nought."
3. "To be saved by law, one has to keep all the law that he knows."

### John Gill:
1. "meaning either the grace of the Son of God in giving himself for him, just mentioned by him; or the particular doctrine of grace, justification, he is speaking of, as proceeding from the grace of God, upon the foot of the righteousness of Christ; or the whole Gospel, all and each of which would be denied, despised, rejected, made null and void, be in vain, fallen and departed from, should justification be sought for by the works of the law." 
2. "For if righteousness come by the law; if a justifying righteousness is to be attained unto by the works of the law, or men can be justified by their obedience to it, then Christ is dead in vain."
3. "Wherefore it may be strongly concluded, that there is no righteousness by the law of works, nor to be attained that way, otherwise Christ had never died; and that justification is solely and alone by his righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "Meantime I do not make void - In seeking to be justified by my own works."
