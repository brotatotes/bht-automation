# Galatians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not even Titus, who was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. The fact that the demand was not complied with, but resisted by Paul and Barnabas, shows that the apostles virtually sanctioned Paul's course among the Gentiles and admitted his independence as an apostle. This confirmed that Christianity did not interfere with Jewish usages as social ordinances, though they no longer had their religious significance. The refusal to impose circumcision on Titus and other Gentile converts proved that it was not necessary for salvation.
