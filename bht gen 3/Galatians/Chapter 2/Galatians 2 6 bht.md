# Galatians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's authority as an apostle and the truth of his message were unaffected by the standing or reputation of the early apostles. God's impartiality means He does not show favoritism based on external factors. The other apostles did not make any new demands on Paul or add to his knowledge of the Gospel. Paul did not seek approval from recognized church leaders for his commission because his message was complete. The endorsement of the pillars of the church came when they embraced Paul's gospel without presenting their own.

### Marvin Vincent:

1. "But any one who will consider how necessary that boasting was, will acknowledge that it was holy boasting, and worthy of the highest praise; for, if he had yielded this point to his opponents, that he had profited under the apostles, he would have furnished them with two charges against him."
2. "He admits that they were first in the order of time, but contends that this did not prevent him from being their equal in rank."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: God is impartial and does not show favoritism towards anyone based on their status or external conditions. The early apostles, who were esteemed in the church, did not impose any new requirements on Paul or add anything to his knowledge of the Gospel. Paul was indifferent about receiving his commission from recognized church leaders because his authority as an apostle and the truth of his message were not dependent on their approval. The pillars of the church, James, Peter, and John, eventually embraced Paul's gospel without offering a different one. Their standing and reputation mattered little to Paul because he knew that God does not show partiality. He was confident in the completeness and perfection of the truths he shared, and the fact that the other apostles did not bring forth their own gospel validated the validity of his message.
