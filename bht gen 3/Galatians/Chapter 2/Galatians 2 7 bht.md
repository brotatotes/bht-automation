# Galatians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Instead of supporting Paul, the other apostles left him to fight his own battle, essentially saying, You do your thing and we'll do ours. However, they saw that Paul had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as Peter had been entrusted with preaching to the Jews. This distinction was not a difference in the message itself, but rather a division of labor. Rather than disagreeing with Paul's approach, the other apostles gave their approval and recognized that he had been chosen for this specific task.
