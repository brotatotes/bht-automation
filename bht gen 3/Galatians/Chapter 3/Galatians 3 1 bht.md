# Galatians 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Galatians, who had been taught about the crucifixion of Christ in such a vivid and powerful manner, were foolish to be led astray by false teachers. The sight of Christ crucified should have been enough to counteract any fascination or bewitchment, but they regrettably turned away from the freedom of the gospel and embraced the bondage of the law. The relapse into legalism was absurd and inexplicable, suggesting the influence of some form of dark magic.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

1.

2. "so these deceitful workers, who had transformed themselves into the apostles of Christ, as Satan sometimes transforms himself into an angel of light, had set this doctrine in a false light before them, thereby to corrupt their minds from the simplicity that is in Christ."
3. "the clear Gospel revelation of a crucified Christ, in the preaching of him by the apostle, which was such that no picture, no image, no crucifix would come up to, and which, where such preaching is, are altogether vain and needless; and the clear view these saints had, by faith, in the glass of the Gospel of Christ, and him crucified, which so realized the object, as if it was present and before the natural eye."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Galatians, although not foolish by nature, were foolish in the way they allowed themselves to be deceived and led astray. They should have been reminded of the crucifixion, which represents the entire mystery of redemption and freedom from the law. It was through faith in this crucifixion that all Christians, not just the Jews, received the promise of the Spirit. The sight of Christ crucified should have been enough to counteract the fascination and false teaching of the Judaizers. How could anyone have bewitched them when they had witnessed the graphic portrayal of Christ crucified before their own eyes? It was absurd for them to fall back into the slavery of the law after experiencing the freedom of the gospel. The Galatians were without excuse for succumbing to the deceitful tactics of those who sought to corrupt their minds and divert their focus from the simplicity found in Christ. Indeed, the preaching of the crucified Christ and the clear view of him by faith should have been enough to dispel any notion of relying on the law for righteousness.
