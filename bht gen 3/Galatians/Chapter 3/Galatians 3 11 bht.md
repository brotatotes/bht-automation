# Galatians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one can be justified by the law, as even if someone could keep it, justification is by faith alone. The just shall live by faith, contrasting it with living by works. Justification by faith is God's chosen way, as no one except Jesus has fully kept the law. Therefore, we are not justified by the law but by faith, relying on Christ alone. This promise of life through faith is a continuous state of acceptance, life, and salvation.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: No one can be justified by the law, as even if someone were able to keep it perfectly, justification is by faith alone. The Scripture emphasizes that the just shall live by faith, contrasting it with living by one's own works. Justification by faith is the chosen way of God, because no one except Jesus has ever fully kept the law. Therefore, it is not by the law but by faith that we are justified in the sight of God, relying on Christ alone. This promise of life through faith is not temporary, but a continuous state of acceptance, life, and salvation.
