# Galatians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the discussion of the law and faith, it is evident that they are fundamentally different. The law, characterized by its demand for obedience, does not require faith, grace, or mercy. Paul emphasizes that the law is useless without actually being followed, regardless of one's reliance on it. The law disregards a person's faith and centers solely on their actions. Consequently, it becomes clear that justification cannot be achieved through the law, as it is not founded on faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 12. doethâ€”Many depended on the
	law although they did not keep it; but without doing, saith Paul, it
	is of no use to them (Romans 2:13;
	Romans 2:17; Romans 2:23;
	Romans 10:5).


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Law is not a matter of faith; it does not relate to faith; it does not require faith; it deals in other matters, and it pertains to another system than to faith."
2. "This is the language of the Law, and this is what the Law teaches. It does not make provision for faith, but it requires unwavering and perpetual obedience if man would obtain life by it."
3. "The Law requires unwavering and perpetual obedience, if man would obtain life by it."

### John Calvin:
1. "The contradiction between the law and faith lies in the matter of justification."
2. "The difference lies in this, that man, when he fulfils the law, is reckoned righteous by a legal righteousness."
3. "But since God promises life to the doers of the law, why does Paul affirm that they are not righteous? The reply to this objection is easy. There are none righteous by the works of the law, because there are none who do those works."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  The law is not of faith (Î¿ Î½Î¿Î¼Î¿Ï‚ Î¿Ï…Îº ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½ ÎµÎº Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„ÎµÏ‰Ï‚). Law demands complete obedience and rests not on mercy, faith, grace. 


### John Gill:
1. "The law does not consist of faith in Christ, nor does it require it, and that a man should live by it upon his righteousness; it is the Gospel that reveals the righteousness of Christ, and directs and encourages men to believe in him and be saved."
2. "The law does not take any notice of a man's faith; nor has it anything to do with a man as a believer, but as a doer, in the point of justification."
3. "Since eternal life is a promise made before the world began, is provided for in an everlasting covenant, is revealed in the Gospel, and is the pure gift of God's grace through Christ, it seems that it never was the will of God that it should be obtained by the works of the law."

### John Wesley:
1. And the law is not of faith â€” But quite opposite to it: it does not say, Believe; but, Do. Leviticus 18:5
