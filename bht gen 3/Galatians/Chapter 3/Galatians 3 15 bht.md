# Galatians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Galatians 3:15, Paul uses the analogy of human covenants to stress the immutability of God's promises. He reasons that if even a human covenant, once ratified, cannot be set aside or altered by anyone other than the parties involved, the same principle holds true for God's covenant with Abraham. Legal Judaism has no power to modify the fundamental relationship established by the original promises. God's covenant remains inviolable, a testament to His righteous nature and everlasting faithfulness.
