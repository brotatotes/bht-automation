# Galatians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise of the covenant was made to Christ, the Seed to whom the promises were given, encompassing both Jew and Gentile who are identified with and represented by Him. This covenant is not temporary, but remains valid, as God's covenant with Abraham and his seed remains uncancelled. The promises still await fulfillment, and they apply to all believers, both Jews and Gentiles. In Christ, believers become Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise, as the covenant gathers up the promise in its special application to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The central point of the Apostle‚Äôs argument is this: The seed to whom the promises were made, was Christ."
2. "The fact is, that we must place ourselves in St. Paul‚Äôs position with regard to the idea of Christ, before we can appreciate all he meant by this word here."
3. "This seed is, CHRIST: not merely in the narrower sense, the man Christ Jesus, but Christ the Seed, Christ the Second Adam, Christ the Head of the Body."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The covenant of promise was not 'spoken' (so Greek for 'made') to Abraham alone, but 'to Abraham and his seed'; to the latter especially; and this means Christ."
2. "The promises still in part remain to be fulfilled... The covenant was not made with 'many' seeds... but with the one seed; therefore, the promise that in Him 'all the families of the earth shall be blessed' joins in this one Seed, Christ, Jew and Gentile, as fellow heirs on the same terms of acceptability, namely, by grace through faith."
3. "God makes His covenant of promise with the one seed, Christ, and embraces others only as they are identified with, and represented by, Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The promise here referred to was that which is recorded in Genesis 22:17-18."
2. "He designs evidently to be understood as affirming that in the use of the singular number œÉœÄŒµÃÅœÅŒºŒ± sperma (seed), instead of the plural œÉœÄŒµÃÅœÅŒºŒ±œÑŒ± spermata (seeds), there is a fair ground of argument to demonstrate that the promise related to Christ or the Messiah, and to him primarily if not exclusively."
3. "The promise was indeed at first general, and the term used was of the most general nature; but it was shown from time to time that God intended that it should be applied only to one branch or portion of the family of Abraham; and that limitation was finally so made as to terminate in the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The promises were given, not to Abraham only, but to his descendants. Hence it follows that the covenant was not a mere temporary contract, made to last only up to the time of the law."
2. "Even a man's covenant remains uncancelled and without additions. Similarly, God's covenant - promises to Abraham remain valid."
3. "The original promise referred to the posterity of Abraham generally, and therefore applies to Christ individually only as representing these: as gathering up into one all who should be incorporated with him."

### John Calvin:
1. "He saith not, And to seeds."
2. "But if Christ be the foundation of the bargain, it follows that it is of free grace."
3. "We have ascertained, then, that we are all cursed by nature, and that the blessing of Abraham has been promised to all nations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis lies on the words: 'and to his seed,' which look beyond the law of Moses and to Christ‚Äôs coming."
2. "The seed of Abraham comprehends, therefore, not only the Israelites under Moses and Joshua, but above all Christ and his people as the true spiritual Israel who enter into that heavenly rest."
3. "The key to the passage is in Galatians 3:28-29: 'Ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ‚Äôs, then are ye Abraham‚Äôs seed, heirs according to the promise.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But the promise to Abraham... applies to all believers (both Jews and Gentiles) as Paul has shown in verses Galatians 3:7-14." 
2. "Here Paul uses a rabbinical refinement which is yet intelligible." 
3. "The people of Israel were a type of the Messiah and he gathers up the promise in its special application to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The promises design the promises of the covenant of grace...which are exceeding great and precious, better than those of any other covenant..."
2. "...the promises here intended principally are such as these, that God will be their God, and they shall be his people, the promise of Christ as a Saviour and Redeemer of them; of the Spirit as their sanctifier, and the applier of all grace unto them; of justification by Christ's righteousness, and pardon by his blood; of adoption through free rich grace; of perseverance in grace, and of the eternal inheritance..."
3. "...the declaration and manifestation of the covenant, and its promises to Abraham; which was frequently done, as upon the call of him out of the land of Chaldea, upon his parting with Lot, when he was grown old, and when Eliezer his servant was like to be his heir, and just before the giving of him the covenant of circumcision, and again upon the offering up of his son Isaac..."

### John Wesley:
1. "The chief of all, and which was several times repeated, was that of the blessing through Christ."
2. "But as of one ‚Äî That is, one kind of seed, one posterity, one kind of sons. And to all these the blessing belonged by promise."
3. "Which is Christ ‚Äî including all that believe in him. Genesis 22:18."
