# Galatians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise of blessing made to Abraham extends to Christ, the one seed who represents both Jews and Gentiles as fellow heirs through faith and grace. The covenant of promise, different from the covenant of works, is fulfilled in Christ. The law, given before Christ's coming, cannot disannul the promise made to Abraham and his seed. Christ gathers up and incorporates those who believe in him. Thus, the promises find their fulfillment in Christ as he embraces his people and becomes the foundation of the covenant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The central point of the Apostle‚Äôs argument is this: The seed to whom the promises were made, was Christ." 
2. "The fact is, that we must place ourselves in St. Paul‚Äôs position with regard to the idea of Christ, before we can appreciate all he meant by this word here."
3. "Christ contains His people, and the mention even of the personal Christ would bring with it, in the Apostle‚Äôs mind, the inclusion of his believing people."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ not having come when the law was given, the covenant could not have been then fulfilled, but awaited the coming of Him, the Seed, to whom it was spoken."
2. "The promise that in Him 'all the families of the earth shall be blessed' joins in this one Seed, Christ, Jew and Gentile, as fellow heirs on the same terms of acceptability, namely, by grace through faith."
3. "God makes a covenant, but it is one of promise; whereas the law is a covenant of works. Whereas the law brings in a mediator, a third party, God makes His covenant of promise with the one seed, Christ, and embraces others only as they are identified with, and represented by, Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It might be said, then, that the promise 'to thy seed' did not refer to the two races, as if he had said œÉœÄŒµÃÅœÅŒºŒ±œÑŒ± (seeds), but to one œÉœÄŒµÃÅœÅŒºŒ± (the seed) of Abraham, by way of eminence."
2. "The promise was indeed at first general, and the term used was of the most general nature; but it was shown from time to time that God intended that it should be applied only to one branch or portion of the family of Abraham; and that limitation was finally so made as to terminate in the Messiah."
3. "The apostle, arguing with Jews, employs an argument to which they were accustomed to attach importance; for they laid great stress on the respective use of the singular and plural number; which argument...was certainly both lawful and wise to reason with them after their own fashion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Even a man's covenant remains uncancelled and without additions. Similarly, God's covenant - promises to Abraham remain valid; and this is made certain by the fact that the promises were given not only to Abraham but to his seed; and since the singular, seed, is used, and not seeds, it is evident that Christ is meant."
2. "There can be no disannulling by the law of a promise made not only to Abraham, but to his seed."
3. "The original promise referred to the posterity of Abraham generally, and therefore applies to Christ individually only as representing these: as gathering up into one all who should be incorporated with him."

### John Calvin:
1. "But if Christ be the foundation of the bargain, it follows that it is of free grace; and this too is the meaning of the word promise."
2. "I am the more surprised that our own writers should have been silent on this head, as we have abundant means of repelling their slander."
3. "We have ascertained, then, that we are all cursed by nature, and that the blessing of Abraham has been promised to all nations. Do all indiscriminately reach it? Certainly not, but those only who are 'gathered' to the Messiah."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The seed of Abraham comprehends, therefore, not only the Israelites under Moses and Joshua, but above all Christ and his people as the true spiritual Israel who enter into that heavenly rest, of which the rest of the earthly Canaan was only an imperfect type."
2. "The main point is that the collective word seed is used instead of children or descendants, and that this word seed denotes an organic unity of true spiritual Abrahamites, and not all the carnal descendants of Abraham, as the Jews imagined."
3. "The seed includes, therefore, all true believers who are vitally united to Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But as of one (Œ±ŒªŒª' œâœÇ ŒµœÜ' ŒµŒΩŒøœÇ). But as in the case of one."
2. "The people of Israel were a type of the Messiah and he gathers up the promise in its special application to Christ."
3. "He does not say that Christ is specifically referred to in Genesis 13:15 or Galatians 17:7."

### John Gill:
1. "The promises design the promises of the covenant of grace mentioned in the next verse, which are exceeding great and precious, better than those of any other covenant..."
2. "The promises here intended principally are such as these, that God will be their God, and they shall be his people, the promise of Christ as a Saviour and Redeemer of them; of the Spirit as their sanctifier, and the applier of all grace unto them; of justification by Christ's righteousness, and pardon by his blood; of adoption through free rich grace; of perseverance in grace, and of the eternal inheritance..."
3. "...the covenant and the promises were not now made with, and to Christ, as personally considered, this was done in eternity; but Christ mystical, the church, which is the body of Christ, of which he is the head, and is called by his name..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now the promises were made to Abraham and his seed... the chief of all, and which was several times repeated, was that of the blessing through Christ."
2. "But as of one - That is, one kind of seed, one posterity, one kind of sons... And to all these the blessing belonged by promise."
3. "Which is Christ - including all that believe in him."
