3. "Thus it will appear that the Septuagint, Samaritan Pentateuch, and St. Paul, have the right chronology."

The former, being founded on Christ, was free; and therefore the law, which came after, could not enable men to obtain salvation otherwise than by grace, for then, 'it would make the promise of none effect.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law is only an intervening link between the promise and its fulfilment."
2. "The older an agreement the stronger is its authority."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The covenant of the Law, which came after the promise given to Abraham, does not nullify or eliminate that promise. The confirmation of this can be found in the Septuagint version, which aligns with Paul's references to the four hundred and thirty years. The duration of time between the promise to Abraham and the giving of the Law only serves to emphasize the authority and stability of the promise. The Law, while serving as an intervening link, does not have the power to alter or annul the covenant made with Abraham. This distinction is crucial because the promise is based on grace and faith, whereas the Law operates on the merit of works. In Christ, the fulfillment of the promise is secured, and the Law does not render it ineffective. The covenant made with Abraham encompasses the blessing for all nations, and the Law cannot supersede or replace it, nor can it limit it solely to the Jewish people.
