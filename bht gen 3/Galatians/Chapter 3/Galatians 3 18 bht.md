# Galatians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inheritance, encompassing all the blessings promised to Abraham and his spiritual and literal children, is not obtained through the law. It is given freely, as a gracious gift, through the promise of God. The giving of the law did not change the fact that the inheritance came to Israel by the promise to Abraham, not through the Mosaic law. Salvation rests either on the promise or on the law, but it cannot be obtained through both. Therefore, the inheritance is not of, or from, the law.

If the inheritance was through the law, it would no longer be based on the promise. The giving of the law did not change the fact that the inheritance came to Israel through the promise to Abraham. It is important to understand that salvation cannot be obtained both through the law and through the promise, as they are completely inconsistent with each other.

Therefore, the inheritance is not obtained through the law, but through the promise.
