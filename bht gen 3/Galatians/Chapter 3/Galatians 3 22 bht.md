# Galatians 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scripture, personified as a jailer, locks everyone up in sin like prisoners in a dungeon, for it clearly states that the law cannot grant life or righteousness. Its purpose is to guide us to the promise of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, which is not the result of our works but simply believing. By recognizing our guilt, as pronounced by the Scripture, we are driven to seek help from Christ for redemption. Through the Scripture, we not only realize our condemnation but also find support in Christ.
