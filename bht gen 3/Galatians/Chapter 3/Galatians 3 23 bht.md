# Galatians 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We were kept in ward, shut up under the law, in order to the faith about to be revealed. The faith of Jesus Christ, which did not exist until Christ came, was as yet an element of life hidden in the counsel of God. The law served as the warder, the Lord or despot, keeping us under moral captivity until the time when faith should come. The office of the law as a jailer was designed to be only temporary, until the faith was first revealed at the coming of Christ and the gospel.
