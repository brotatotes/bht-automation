# Galatians 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law acted as our tutor, guiding us to Christ and justifying us by faith. It showed us what we ought to do, yet exposed our inability to fulfill it. The law was neither identical nor opposed to the promise, but rather a necessary but subordinate element in human development. Christ is the fulfillment of the law, our ultimate Schoolmaster who dismisses the pedagogue. The law condemned us, preparing us to welcome the offer of pardon through a Redeemer. Through the law, we came to Christ.
