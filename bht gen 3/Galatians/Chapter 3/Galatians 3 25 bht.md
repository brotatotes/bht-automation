# Galatians 3:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law, represented by Moses, can only bring us to the border of the heavenly Canaan, but it is through Joshua, a type of Jesus, that we are led into our true inheritance. The law's purpose is to guide us to Christ, and once we have faith, we are no longer bound by the burdensome ceremonies and rites of the Jewish law. We are now directly under the instruction of Jesus Himself, experiencing a newfound freedom as we no longer need the guidance of a schoolmaster.
