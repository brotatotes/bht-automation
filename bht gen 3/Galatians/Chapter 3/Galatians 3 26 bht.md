# Galatians 3:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By faith in Christ Jesus, both Jews and Gentiles are no longer children requiring a tutor, but rather liberated and walking at liberty as sons of God. This is not about physical lineage, but about becoming spiritual sons of Abraham by faith. While God is the Father of all through creation, only those who receive adoption through faith in Christ Jesus become His spiritual children. It is the Spirit of God who leads and teaches these sons, confirming their status as children of God.

2. "The language here is derived from the fact, that until the son arrived at age, he was in many respects not different from a servant."
3. "When of age, he entered on the privileges of heirship, and was free to act for himself. Thus, under the Law, people were under restraints, and subject to heavy exactions. Under the gospel, they are free, and admitted to the privileges of the sons of God."

2. "Not that faith makes any the children of God, or puts them into such a relation; no, that is God's own act and deed; of his free rich grace and goodness..."
3. "They are sons grown up into the faith of Christ, and are led and taught by the Spirit of God, as they are that are the children of God by faith; and as is promised to the saints under the Gospel, that they shall be 'all taught of God'."
