# Galatians 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In baptism, believers are not merely receiving a ticket of admission into the Christian community. Rather, they are boldly and broadly experiencing the effect of baptism, putting on Christ Himself. Baptism becomes a means of spiritual transference from legal condemnation to a living union with Christ and sonship through Him. It is through Christ alone, by baptizing with His Spirit, that the inward grace corresponds to the outward sign. This act of putting on Christ signifies a profound change and a declaration of faith in Him as Lord and Savior.
