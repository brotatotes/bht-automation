## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The absolute equality of all in this sonship, to the obliteration of all differences of earthly extraction or position."
2. "Observe, 'neither Jew nor Greek,'â€” 'neither bond nor free,' but 'male and female': the two former being accidental distinctions which may be entirely put off in falling back on our humanity,â€”but the latter a necessary distinction, absorbed however in the higher category: 'there is no distinction into male and female.'"
3. "The unavoidable inference from an assertion like this is, that Christianity did alter the condition of women and slaves."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is in this sonship by faith in Christ, no class privileged above another."
2. "Difference of sex makes no difference in Christian privileges."
3. "All of either sex are now 'kings and priests unto God'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All confess that they are sinners; all are saved by the merits of the same Saviour; all are admitted to the same privileges as children of God."
2. "Christianity regards all people as made of one blood to dwell on all the face of the earth and esteems them all to be equal in the matter of salvation."
3. "Christianity thus elevates the female sex to an equality with the male, on the most important of all interests; and it has in this way made most important changes in the world wherever it has prevailed."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is neither Jew nor Greek...nor is circumcision any more regarded than sex or civil rank." 
2. "Because Christ makes them all one...Ye are one: the distinction is now removed." 
3. "The apostleâ€™s object is to shew that the grace of adoption, and the hope of salvation, do not depend on the law, but are contained in Christ alone, who therefore is all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The great idea of freedom, fraternity, and equality, then, is to be traced to Christianity, although it is often carnally misunderstood and caricatured by men."
2. "The gospel makes all men equal before God, both as sinners, and as subjects of redeeming grace; it has broken down the national, social, and sexual partition walls of the ancient world, and raised women and slaves to the true dignity and the enjoyment of the rights of man."
3. "For ye all are one (man) in Christ Jesus, one moral person in Jesus Christ the head."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "This radical statement marks out the path along which Christianity was to come in the sphere (ÎµÎ½) and spirit and power of Christ."
3. "We are on the road and there is no hope on any way than on 'the Jesus Road.'"

### John Gill:
1. "There is no difference between them, the middle wall of partition being broken down, and that, in the business of justification and salvation, it signified nothing whether a man was a Jew or a Greek."
2. "God, in calling, justifying, and saving men, is no respecter of persons, as being high and low, rich and poor, bond or free."
3. "Under the Gospel dispensation there is no distinction made between male and female as to divine things; as they are alike called by the grace of God, they have the same right to Gospel ordinances, baptism and the Lord's supper, and to every spiritual privilege."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is neither Jew nor Greek â€” That is, there is no difference between them; they are equally accepted through faith."
2. "There is neither male nor female â€” Circumcision being laid aside, which was peculiar to males, and was designed to put a difference, during that dispensation, between Jews and gentiles."
