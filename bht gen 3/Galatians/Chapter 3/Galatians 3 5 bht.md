# Galatians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wonders wrought by divine power in you, at your conversion and since, are not the result of the works of the law, but rather they come from the hearing and message of faith. These miracles are a purely divine operation, not merited by legal works, but received and experienced only through the message of faith. God is the one who supplies the Spirit and works miraculously among you. These miracles do not prove grace to be in the heart, and cannot be attributed to the preaching of the law or the false doctrine of justification by works.

3. "Miracles [Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒºŒµŒπœÇ] . See on Matthew 11:20. Either miracles, as Mark 6:2; 1 Corinthians 12:10, or miraculous powers, as 1 Corinthians 12:6; Philippians 2:13; Ephesians 2:2. The analogy of these latter passages favors the second meaning."
