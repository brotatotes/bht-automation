# Galatians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are of faith, as the origin and starting point of their spiritual life, are the true children of Abraham. They are the ones who have relinquished confidence in works and rely on the promise of God alone. It is evident that only those who believe and are justified in this manner can truly claim to be the descendants of Abraham. Therefore, it is through faith in God and His promises that we can become partakers of Abraham's faith and heirs to the promises made to him.
