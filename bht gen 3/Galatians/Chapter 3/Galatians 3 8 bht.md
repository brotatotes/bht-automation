# Galatians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scripture wisely foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, not works, and thus announced in advance to Abraham the good news that all nations would be blessed through him. This shows that the Gospel, with its promise of justification by faith, is not a new doctrine but was taught early on. Abraham's faith serves as a model for all who seek the same blessings of redemption, reconciliation, and eternal life through faith in Christ.
