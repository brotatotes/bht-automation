# Galatians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who share in Abraham's blessing are not those who rely on their own works, but those who have faith. Their community with faithful Abraham is based on the shared characteristic of faith. Just as Abraham's faith resulted in justification, so too does faith bring about the same result for believers. They are regarded as part of the same blessing that began with Abraham. Therefore, those who truly believe are blessed with the same justifying righteousness and the promise of eternal life.
