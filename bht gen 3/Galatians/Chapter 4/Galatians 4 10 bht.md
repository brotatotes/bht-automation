# Galatians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul admonishes against the obligatory observance of days, as it contradicts the perfection of the Christian dispensation and Christ's finished work. He grieves to see Gentile believers entangled in the Judaizing Christians' insistence on meticulous adherence to Jewish Sabbaths, new moons, and festivals. While the civil observance of days is necessary, the true rest and freedom for believers is found in Christ, not in the observance of these specific dates.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice how utterly such a verse is at variance with any and every theory of a Christian sabbath, cutting at the root, as it does, of ALL obligatory observance of times as such." 
2. "To observe periods then, now in the fulness of time, is to deny the perfection of the Christian dispensation, the complete and finished nature of Christâ€™s work."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not a fair interpretation of this to suppose that the apostle refers to the Sabbath, properly so called, for this was a part of the Decalogue; and was observed by the Saviour himself, and by the apostles also."
2. "There is as real servitude in the observance of the numerous festivals, and fasts in the papal communion and in some Protestant churches, as there was in the observance of the days in the Jewish ecclesiastical calendar."

3. "The holy, festal seasons, as Passover Pentecost, Feast of Tabernacles."

3. "The observance of days among us is a free service, and void of all superstition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Is it possible that you should observe!"
2. "Paul denounces the Pharisaic Sabbatarianism... It was a pedantic, mechanical, slavish observance which worshipped the letter and killed the spirit."
3. "The law of the Sabbath... is as old as the creation, it is founded in the moral and physical constitution of man... and is an absolute necessity for public worship and the welfare of man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The meticulous observance of the Pharisees Paul knew to a nicety."
2. "It hurt him to the quick after his own merciful deliverance to see these Gentile Christians drawn into this spider-web of Judaizing Christians, once set free, now enslaved again."
3. "Paul does not object to these observances for he kept them himself as a Jew. He objected to Gentiles taking to them as a means of salvation."

2. "By 'months' are designed their new moons...and were typical of that light, knowledge, and grace, the church receives from Christ, the sun of righteousness; and he, the substance, being come, these shadows disappeared."
3. "And by 'years' are to be understood their sabbatical years...which having their accomplishment in him, were no longer to be observed; wherefore these Galatians are blamed for so doing."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye observe days â€” Jewish sabbaths."
2. "And months â€” New moons."
3. "And times â€” As that of the passover, pentecost, and the feast of tabernacles."

The apostle Paul, having experienced deliverance from the bondage of the law, was pained to see the Gentile Christians being ensnared by the Judaizing Christians who advocated for the observance of specific dates.

The true rest of believers is found in Christ, not in the observance of these days.
