## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression, which has been altered into 'my temptation,' is one of those exquisite and delicate touches, which belong so peculiarly to St. Paulâ€™s mind."
2. "Besides the freedom of angels from fleshly weakness, there is doubtless an allusion to their office as messengersâ€”and to His saying, who is above the angels, Luke x. 16."
3. "No inference can be drawn from these expressions being used of the Galatiansâ€™ reception of him, that they were already Christians when he first visited them: the words are evidently not to be pressed as intended to be accurate in point of chronology; they mean, not, â€˜as you would have received,â€™&c., but, â€˜as you would (now) receive.â€™"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "My infirmity, which was, or might have been, a 'temptation,' or trial, to you, ye despised not, that is, ye were not tempted by it to despise me and my message." 
2. "Temptation does not mean here, as we now use the word, tendency to an evil habit, but BODILY TRIAL."
3. "An angel is free from the flesh, infirmity, and temptation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I was afflicted with various calamities and infirmities, but that this did not hinder their receiving me as an angel from heaven."
2. "The highest proof of attachment to a minister, is to receive him as the Saviour would be received."
3. "It showed their attachment to the Lord Jesus, that they received his apostle as they would have received the Saviour himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye did not despise nor reject me, but received me."
2. "Ye did not set at nought, from nothing."
3. "To receive as an angel is to receive with great veneration."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls it a temptation or trial, because it was a thing not unknown or hidden, and he did not himself attempt to conceal it."
2. "In this light every true minister of Christ ought to be regarded... they too are the messengers of God, by whose mouth God speaks to us."
3. "If they wish to obtain the honors of angels, let them perform the duty of angels: if they wish that we should listen to them as to Christ, let them convey to us faithfully his pure word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Your trialâ€™ is better supported than â€˜my trial.â€™ The infirmity of Paul tried the patience and love of the Galatians and tempted them to scorn and reject both him and the gospel which he preached."
2. "For the natural man is always disposed to judge from outward appearance."
3. "But ye received me as an angel of God, (even) as Christ Jesus, who is much superior to any angel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Your temptation (or trial) in my flesh."
2. "Nor rejected... to spurn, to loathe."
3. "Not a mere 'messenger' of God, but a very angel, even as Christ Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "nor the apostle on the account of it, nor his ministry; they thought never the worse of him, nor of the Gospel he preached, because of this"
2. "with all that reverence and respect, that high esteem, veneration, and affection, as if one of the celestial inhabitants had been sent down from heaven"
3. "they looked upon him under that character, and regarded him as such, even as Christ Jesus"

### John Wesley:
1. And ye did not slight my temptation â€” That is, ye did not slight or disdain me for my temptation, my "thorn in the flesh."
