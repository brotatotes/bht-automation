# Galatians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What has happened to the joy and felicitation that you once had when I was among you, proclaiming the Gospel? You were so devoted to me that you would have given up your own eyes for my sake. But now, in your turning away from the freedom of the Gospel to the burdens of the law, where is that blessedness? Your boastful happiness has vanished as you embrace the weak and impoverished elements of the ceremonial law, entering into a state of bondage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Where then (i. e. where in estimation, holding what place) (is) your congratulation of yourselves (so literally: the blessedness ye boasted of, in having me among you as your Apostle? This is perhaps as good a rendering as the words will bear)?"
2. "In seeking for a reference for this expression, y e would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me, the right course will be, not at once to adopt the conclusion, that they point to ocular weakness on the part of the Apostle,‚Äînor, because they form a trite proverb (signifying any great extent of self-sacrifice for another) in many languages, therefore to set down at once that no such allusion to a personal infirmity can have been intended, but to judge from the words themselves, and our information from other sources, whether such an allusion is likely."
3. "The inference then of any ocular disease from these words themselves seems to me precarious. Certainly Acts xxiii. 1 ff. receives light from such a supposition: but with our very small knowledge on the subject, many conjectures may be hazarded with some show of support from Scripture, while none of them has enough foundation to mike it probable on the whole."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Where, c.‚ÄîOf what value was your congratulation (so the Greek for 'blessedness' expresses) of yourselves, on account of your having among you me, the messenger of the Gospel, considering how entirely you have veered about since?" 
2. "Once you counted yourselves blessed in being favored with my ministry." 
3. "You would have torn out your own eyes to supply the lack of mine."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What blessedness you had then! How happy was that moment! What tenderness of affection! What overflowing joy!"
2. "No higher proof of attachment could have been given."
3. "They loved him so much, that they would have given to him anything, however dear; they would have done anything to contribute to his welfare."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Where is then that gratulation of yours?"
2. "Your eyes, as most treasured possessions."
3. "All attempts to connect the passage with Paul's 'thorn in the flesh' are to be dismissed as fanciful."

### John Calvin:
1. "Shall your falling away now destroy the glory of your obedience in the presence of God?"
2. "By despising the pure doctrine which they had embraced, they throw away, of their own accord, the blessedness which they had obtained, and draw down upon themselves the destruction in which their unhappy career must terminate."
3. "To be willing to pluck out their own eyes, if it had been necessary, was an evidence of very extraordinary love, stronger than the willingness to part with life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What has become of the boasting of your blessedness, of your rejoicing in my teaching, since you turned away from the freedom of the gospel to the slavery of the law?" 
2. "How hollow and unmeaning was your boast of happiness in view of your speedy apostasy!"
3. "You would have plucked out your eyes and given (them) to me... You were ready to make the greatest sacrifice to relieve my sufferings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That gratulation of yourselves (Œø ŒºŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÅŒπœÉŒºŒøœÇ œÖŒºœâŒΩ). 'Your felicitation.'"
2. "You no longer felicitate yourselves on my presence with you."
3. "Ye would have plucked out your eves and given them to me (œÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒøœÜŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒºŒøœÖœÇ œÖŒºœâŒΩ ŒµŒæŒøœÅœÖŒæŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ ŒµŒ¥œâŒ∫Œ±œÑŒµ ŒºŒø)."

### John Gill:
1. "where was this blessedness now, since they were turning to the weak and beggarly elements of the ceremonial law, and were inclined to observe its ordinances, and bring themselves hereby into a state of bondage?"
2. "They were happy persons while under the ministry of the apostle; as a Gospel ministry is a great happiness to any that enjoy it."
3. "so fully persuaded was the apostle of their strong and sincere affection for him at that time, that he was ready to attest the truth of this in any form to any persons."

### John Wesley:
1. What was then the blessedness ye spake of ‚Äî On which ye so congratulated one another.
