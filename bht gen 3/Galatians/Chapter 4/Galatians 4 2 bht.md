2. "A bishop or overseer is also called 'a steward of God' (Titus 1:7)."
3. "Whether Paul's figure assumes that the father is dead or living is a point which does not affect his argument. It is not easy to decide. As Alford justly remarks: 'the antitype breaks through the type and disturbs it, as is the case wherever the idea of inheritance is spiritualized.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Until the day pre-appointed, or day fixed beforehand. A legal term (one word in Greek, prothesmia) signifying the time allowed to elapse before bringing an action, the time fixed by the statute of limitations...then any pre-appointed time or day; here the time when the office of the guardian terminates."
2. "By the father. Among the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans, the period of pupilage or nonage was fixed by law, and not dependent upon the arbitrary will of the parent."

1. "Under guardians (υπο επιτροπους)... an overseer or one in charge of children... guardian of an orphan minor." 
2. "Stewards (οικονομους)... manager of a household... manager of an estate and also as treasurer." 
3. "Until the time appointed of the father (αχρ της προθεσμιας του πατρος)... appointed beforehand... the tutor had charge of the child till he was fourteen when the curator took charge of him till he was twenty-five."

### John Gill:
1. "we do not appoint a tutor or guardian for a bearded person"
2. "we appoint a guardian for an infant"
3. "the time of minority, and so the duration of tutors and guardians, were according to the laws of the nation"
