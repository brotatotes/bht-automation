### John Gill:
1. "His meaning is, either that be wished he was personally present among them; that he had but an opportunity of seeing them face to face, and telling them all his mind, and in such a manner as he could not in a single epistle."
2. "that whereas before he preached the Gospel of the grace of God unto them, and his voice was charming to them like that of an angel, and even of Jesus Christ himself; but they having turned their backs upon it, and slighted it, he would now thunder out the law to them they seemed to be so fond of; even that voice of words, which when, the Israelites on Mount Sinai heard, entreated they might hear no more."
3. "He was ashamed of them for their apostasy and degeneracy; he was amazed and astonished at their conduct; or, as the word may be rendered, be was 'perplexed' on their account; he did not know what to think of them, and their state; sometimes he hoped well of them, at other times he was ready to despair."

### John Wesley:
1. "I could wish to be present with you now â€” Particularly in this exigence."
2. "And to change â€” Variously to attemper."
3. "My voice â€” He writes with much softness; but he would speak with more. The voice may more easily be varied according to the occasion than a letter can."
