# Galatians 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your determination to be under the law is opposed by Scripture, if you will understand it: the bondmaid, representing Hagar, and the free woman, representing Sarah. Abraham had two sons - Ishmael, the son of Hagar, and Isaac, the son of Sarah. The bondmaid, Hagar, symbolizes a well-known character, while the free woman, Sarah, signifies freedom and liberty. Let us know, then, that the true meaning of Scripture is the natural and obvious meaning, and let us embrace and abide by it resolutely, for it is written in Genesis 16:15 and Genesis 21:2.
