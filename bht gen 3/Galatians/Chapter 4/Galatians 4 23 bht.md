# Galatians 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Isaac, the son of Sarah, was not born like any ordinary child. He was born by virtue of the promise, contrary to all calculations of flesh and blood. This miraculous birth was a result of Abraham's faith in God's promise. In contrast, Ishmael was born after the flesh, according to the regular course of nature. Isaac's birth highlights the importance of living by faith alone, as it is through the promise that God's purposes are fulfilled, not through human effort or natural means.
