# Galatians 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hagar, as a geographical proper name in Arabia, corresponds with the present Jerusalem, both being in slavery. Mount Sinai is well suited to represent the law's spirit of bondage, just as Jerusalem, under Roman rule, is in bondage to the law. The Arabians, descendants of Abraham and Hagar, exemplify this parallel. By drawing parallels between Hagar and Sarah, Ishmael and Isaac, the old covenant and the new covenant, and the earthly and heavenly Jerusalem, Paul emphasizes the contrast between temporal Jerusalem's bondage and the freedom of the gospel.
