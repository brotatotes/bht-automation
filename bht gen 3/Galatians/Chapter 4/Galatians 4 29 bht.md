## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And this would be quite ground enough for the word here, for the spirit of persecution was begun." 
2. "In virtue of the promise, which was given by the Spirit."
3. "Or, 'by virtue of the Spirit's agency.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Being the older by natural birth, he haughtily prided himself above him that was born by promise: as Cain hated Abel's piety."
2. "The language, though referring primarily to Isaac, born in a spiritual way, is so framed as especially to refer to believers justified by Gospel grace through faith, as opposed to carnal men, Judaizers, and legalists."
3. "The Jews persecuted Paul, not for preaching Christianity in opposition to heathenism, but for preaching it as distinct from Judaism."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The persecution here referred to, was the injurious treatment which Isaac received from Ishmael, or the opposition which subsisted between them."

2. "No persecution ought to distress us so much as to see our calling attempted to be undermined by the reproaches of wicked men."

3. "And this same conduct is repeated also by the bigoted Judaizing party against the free evangelical church of the Gentiles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Persecuted (ÎµÎ´Î¹Ï‰ÎºÎµÎ½). Imperfect active of Î´Î¹Ï‰ÎºÏ‰, to pursue, to persecute."
2. "Genesis 21:9 has in Hebrew 'laughing,' but the LXX has 'mocking.'"
3. "So now (Î¿Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï‚ ÎºÎ± Î½Ï…Î½) the Jews were persecuting Paul and all Christians (1 Thessalonians 2:15)."

1. "Just as they were born; there is nothing but flesh in them; they are without God, and Christ, and the Spirit, and have neither true faith, nor hope, nor love, not any other grace."
