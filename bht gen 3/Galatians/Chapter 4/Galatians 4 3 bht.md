# Galatians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the time before Christ, both Jews and Gentiles were in bondage. The Jews, as representatives of the world, were under the law, while the Gentiles experienced a discipline suitable to nonage. The Jewish economy provided only the elementary lessons of outward things, like the rudiments of the world. The ordering of the religious life was regulated by the order of nature, with festivals dependent on the movements of the heavenly bodies. This bondage was a state from which we could not escape until the epoch of faith came and we were emancipated by Christ.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Before the epoch of faith came, both Jews and Gentiles were under the law as paedagogue, guardians, and stewards. For the Jews, their bondage to the law of Moses represented the bondage of all mankind. Even the Gentiles were under this bondage, in a state of discipline suitable to nonage. The Jewish economy, as representative of the world, contained only the first elements of a spiritual system. The ordering of the religious life was regulated by the order of nature, the elements of the world being the personal, elemental spirits. Before the time of Christ, our knowledge was rudimentary, involved in earthly figures and confined to the physical universe. In this state, we were in permanent bondage, closely kept to school, and in continual fear and correction. Only through the coming of Christ were we emancipated from this state and able to enter into a deeper understanding of spiritual truth.
