## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notwithstanding the fact of the persecution, just mentioned."
2. "The quotation is adapted from the Septuagint, where my son Isaac (as in our English text) stands for 'the son of the freewoman.'"
3. "The Apostle is allegorizing the whole history, and thus every part of it assumes a significance in the allegory."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
2. "Cast outâ€”from the house and inheritance: literally, Ishmael; spiritually, the carnal and legalists."
3. "shall not be heirâ€”The Greek is stronger, 'must not be heir,' or 'inherit.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nevertheless...Cast out the bondwoman and her son - This was the language of Sarah, in an address to Abraham, requesting him to cast out Hagar and Ishmael; Genesis 21:10. That was done. Paul uses it here as applicable to the case before him."
2. "As used by him the meaning is, that everything like servitude in the gospel is to be rejected, as Hagar and Ishmael were driven away. It does not mean, as it seems to me, that they were to expel the Jewish teachers in Galatia, but that they were to reject everything like servitude and bondage; they were to adhere only to that which was free."
3. "Paul cannot here mean that the passage in Genesis 21:10, originally had reference to the gospel, for nothing evidently was further from the mind of Sarah than any such reference; nor can it be shown that he meant to approve of or vindicate the conduct of Sarah; but he finds a passage applicable to his purpose, and he conveys his ideas in that language as exactly expressing his meaning."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us be instructed by this beautiful passage, 'not to fret ourselves because of evil-doers, neither be envious against the workers of iniquity,'"
2. "There are many pretended Christians, or strangers, who hold a place in the Church, but who afterwards give evidence of their departure from the faith, as he who, proud of his birthright, at first reigned, was cast out like a foreigner with the posterity of Ishmael."
3. "The casting out of Ishmael was nothing else than the consequence and the accomplishment of that promise, 'In Isaac shall thy seed be called,' â€” not in Ishmael."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Judaism and Christianity, bondage and freedom, cannot exist together: the one must exclude the other."
2. "The Apostles were no slavish literalists, but used the Bible freely in the very Spirit which gave it."
3. "The Apostle thus confidently sounds the death-knell of Judaism at a time when one half of Christendom clung to the Mosaic law with a jealous affection little short of frenzy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The law and the gospel cannot co-exist. The law must disappear before the gospel" (Lightfoot).
2. "Shall not inherit. The law and the gospel cannot co-exist. The law must disappear before the gospel" (Lightfoot).
3. "The law must disappear before the gospel" (Lightfoot).

### John Gill:
1. "The casting of Hagar and Ishmael out of Abraham's family was a type and emblem of the rejection of the carnal and self-righteous Jews from the Gospel church state."
2. "Nor ought any carnal persons, any that are after the flesh, unregenerate ones, or that trust to their own righteousness, to be in a Gospel church."
3. "The reason assigned for non-inheritance in the text implies that the children of the free woman, the spiritual seed of Abraham, shall inherit the privileges of God's house, the blessings of grace, and eternal glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "But what saith the scripture â€” Showing the consequence of this."
2. "Cast out the bondwoman and her son â€” Who mocked Isaac."
3. "In like manner will God cast out all who seek to be justified by the law; especially if they persecute them who are his children by faith."
