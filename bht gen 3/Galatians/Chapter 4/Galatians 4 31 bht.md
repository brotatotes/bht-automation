# Galatians 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are acknowledged heirs, not children of the bondwoman, but of the freewoman. This distinction is crucial, for we are accepted as sons and heirs, not cast out like Ishmael. Through faith, we become children of Abraham and the freewoman, partaking in the new covenant. In Christ, we are made free, delivered from the bondage of the first covenant and the power of sin. Let us hold fast to this freedom and reject the servile Mosaic dispensation.
