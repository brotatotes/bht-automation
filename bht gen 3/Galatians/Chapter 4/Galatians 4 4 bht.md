## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The manifestation of man's guilt was complete:â€”and the way of the Lord was prepared, by various courses of action which He had brought about by men as his instruments."
2. "sent forth cannot,â€”however little, for the purposes of the present argument, the divine side of our Lordâ€™s mission is to be pressed,â€”mean anything less than sent forth from Himself."
3. "born under the law, introduces another condition, in virtue of which He became the Redeemer of those who were under a special revelation and covenant."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God does nothing prematurely, but, foreseeing the end from the beginning, waits till all is ripe for the execution of His purpose."
2. "Had Christ come directly after the fall, the enormity and deadly fruits of sin would not have been realized fully by man, so as to feel his desperate state and need of a Savior."
3. "It was essential to the honor of God's law to permit evil long before He revealed the full remedy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It may be observed, however, that this delay of redemption was in entire accordance with the whole system of divine arrangements, and with all the divine interpositions in favor of men."
2. "It was important that such an event should be predicted in order that there might be full evidence that he came from heaven; and yet in order that prophecy may be seen to have been uttered by God, it must be so far before the event as to make it impossible to have been the result of mere human conjecture."
3. "The promise was Genesis 3:15 that the Messiah should be the 'seed' or the descendant of woman; and Paul probably here alludes to the fulfillment of that promise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fullness of the time. The moment by which the whole pre-messianic period was completed." 
2. "Sent forth. From himself: from his heavenly glory. This does not mean that God then, for the first time, embodied what had previously been a mere ideal, but that he sent forth a preexisting person." 
3. "Under the law. The earthly being of Christ began under the law. He was not only of human birth, but of Jewish birth; subjected to all the ordinances of the law, as circumcision for instance, like any other Jewish boy."

### John Calvin:
1. "When the fullness of the time was come. He proceeds with the comparison which he had adduced, and applies to his purpose the expression which has already occurred, 'the time appointed by the Father,' â€” but still shewing that the time which had been ordained by the providence of God was proper and seasonable."
2. "God sent forth his Son. These few words contain much instruction. The Son, who was sent, must have existed before he was sent; and this proves his eternal Godhead. Christ therefore is the Son of God, sent from heaven."
3. "To redeem them that were under the law. We must here observe, the exemption from the law which Christ has procured for us does not imply that we no longer owe any obedience to the doctrine of the law, and may do whatever we please; for the law is the everlasting rule of a good and holy life. From subjection to that law we are redeemed, because it is no longer what it once was."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words 'fulness of the time' express, as in a nutshell, the whole philosophy of history before Christ, and the central position of the incarnation."
2. "Hence we begin our era with His birth. He himself commenced his preaching with the declaration, Mark 1:15: 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand.'"
3. "He was not only born of a woman, i.e., a true man, like all others, but a full member of a particular nation and the Jewish theocracy, and hence subject to all its religious ordinances and obligations, in order to redeem those who were under the legal covenant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God sent forth his preexisting Son when the time for his purpose had come."
2. "Whatever view one holds about Paul's knowledge of the Virgin Birth of Christ one must admit that Paul believed in his actual personal preexistence with God."
3. "The purpose of God thus was plainly to redeem those under the law, and so under the curse."

### John Gill:
1. "The time agreed and fixed upon between God and his Son from all eternity."
2. "God sent forth his Son, not without his consent or against his will."
3. "Made of a woman, of her flesh and blood, of which he took part; and which denotes the low estate and great humiliation of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "But when the fulness of the time â€” Appointed by the Father, Galatians 4:2."
2. "God sent forth â€” From his own bosom. His Son, miraculously made of the substance of a woman - A virgin, without the concurrence of a man."
3. "Made under the law â€” Both under the precept, and under the curse, of it."
