# Galatians 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, being born under the law as a Jewish child, fulfilled it perfectly and by enduring its curse on the tree, bought off those who were under the law. In doing so, He accomplished the redemption not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles, including all men, bestowing upon them the adoption of sons. This adoption is not a recovery of the state before the fall, but a more glorious thing, the bestowal of a sonship that Adam never had.
