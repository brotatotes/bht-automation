## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the Spirit of adoption...into our hearts...crying, Abba, Father." 
2. "Father is not a mere Greek explanation of Abba, but an address by His name of relation."
3. "the term Abba was used more as a token of affection than as conveying its real meaning of 'my father.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "YE ARE sons, therefore ye need not be as children (under the tutorship of the law), as being already in the free state of 'sons' of God by faith in Christ."
2. "The Spirit of his Sonâ€”By faith ye are one with the Son, so that what is His is yours His Sonship ensures your sonship; His Spirit ensures for you a share in the same."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It follows as a part of his purpose of adoption that his children shall have the spirit of the Lord Jesus."
2. "[The spirit] is that language used by Christians when they have evidence of adoption; the expression of the warm, and elevated, and glowing emotions which they have when they can approach God as their God, and address him as their Father."
3. "The language which Christians are here represented as using is the language of freemen, and denotes that they are not under the servitude of sin."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The Holy Spirit which animated Jesus in his human life, and which, in the risen Christ, is the life - principle of believers."
3. "The Spirit gives the inspiration of which the believer is the organ."

### John Calvin:
1. "In venturing, he says, to call God your Father, you have the advice and direction of the Spirit of Christ; therefore it is certain that you are the sons of God." 
2. "Paul's language does not relate to idle boasting, or to the proud opinion of himself which any man may entertain, but to the testimony of a pious conscience which accompanies the new birth."
3. "Let it be observed, that Paul ascribes this universally to all Christians; for where this pledge of the Divine love towards us is wanting, there is assuredly no faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Holy Spirit so deeply sinks into the spirit of believers and so closely identifies himself with them that He prays in them and through them as their advocate."
2. "â€˜Abbaâ€™ is the Aramaic word for â€˜Fatherâ€™ (in Hebrew Aph), so childlike in its very sound, and sanctioned by the beginning of the Lordâ€™s Prayer, as originally uttered, also by His prayer in Gethsemane, Mark 14:36."
3. "The emphasizing combination of the familiar Hebrew with the corresponding Greek name was probably a liturgical formula among Hellenistic Jews and Christians."

2. "The Spirit of his Son... The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son."
3. "Crying, Abba, Father... This cry comes from the Spirit of Christ in our hearts."

### John Gill:
1. "It is more to be a child of God than to be redeemed, pardoned, and justified; it is great grace to redeem from slavery, to pardon criminals, and justify the ungodly; but it is another and a higher act of grace to make them sons."
2. "The work he does [the Spirit] there is various, and consists of divers parts; as convincing of sin, and righteousness, working faith, and acting the part of a comforter; but what is here referred to, is the discharge of his office as a spirit of adoption, 'crying Abba, Father.'"
3. "The act of 'crying,' though it is here ascribed to the Spirit, yet is not properly his, but the believers; and is attributed to him because he excites, encourages, and assists them as a spirit of adoption to call God their Father; and may be understood both of the secret internal crying of the soul, or exercise of faith on God as its Father, and of an open outward invocation of him as such, with much confidence, freedom, and boldness."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Spirit of his Son into your hearts likewise, crying, Abba, Father - Enabling you to call upon God both with the confidence, and the tempers, of dutiful children."
2. "The Hebrew and Greek word are joined together, to express the joint cry of the Jews and gentiles."
3. "God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts."
