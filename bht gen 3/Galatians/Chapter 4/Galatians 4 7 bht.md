# Galatians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the triune God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, the redeemed are heirs. They are no longer servants, but children entitled to all the privileges of a son and regarded as an heir through the Redeemer. In the Christian Church, slavery no longer exists, and as sons and heirs, we may be corrected and chastised in a fatherly way, which demonstrates our sonship. We are heirs of all the promises and the all-sufficient God Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Through God combines, on behalf of our race, the whole before-mentioned agency of the Blessed Trinity: the Father hath sent the Son and the Spirit, the Son has freed us from the law, the Spirit has completed our sonship; and thus the redeemed are heirs through the tri-une God Himself, not through the law, nor through fleshly descent."
2. "In the assertion that they knew not God, there is no inconsistency with Rom. i. 21: there it is the knowledge which the Gentile world might have had: here, the matter of fact is alleged, that they had it not."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Then an heir. Kai marks the logical sequence. Comp. Romans 8:17. The figure is based upon Roman, not upon Jewish, law."
