# Galatians 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before receiving the gospel, both Jews and Gentiles were burdened by the yoke of slavery. The heathen, although initially having knowledge of God, corrupted the truth and worshiped false gods. The Galatians, who were once slaves to these false deities, were made free by the gospel. Their lapse into subjection to worldly elements is a stark contrast to the filial freedom they have in Christ. In the midst of the light of the gospel, it is disgraceful and inexcusable that they would fall into such gross errors and corrupt the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yet theirs, like yours, was a burdensome yoke; how then is it ye wish to resume the yoke after that God has transferred both Jews and Gentiles to a free service?" 
2. "The heathen originally knew God, as Romans 1:21 states, but did not choose to retain God in their knowledge, and so corrupted the original truth."
3. "They might still have known Him, in a measure, from His works, but as a matter of fact they knew Him not, so far as His eternity, His power as the Creator, and His holiness, are concerned."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the Jews were in such a state of servitude, how much more galling and severe was that of those who had been pagans."
2. "Yet from that servitude the gospel had delivered them, and made them freemen."
3. "Of all Christians it may be said that before their conversion they 'did service,' or were slaves to harsh and cruel masters; and nothing but the gospel has made them free."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Over against their filial freedom in Christ, Paul sets their lapse into subjection to the elements of the world."
2. "Ye did service. Better, were in bondage or were slaves."
3. "By nature. Not denying their existence but their deity."

### John Calvin:
1. "You were then wandering in darkness, but how disgraceful is it that in the midst of light you should fall into such gross errors!"
2. "The main inference is, that the Galatians were less excusable for corrupting the gospel than they had formerly been for idolatry."
3. "The lawful worship of God, therefore, must be preceded by just views of his character. By nature, that is, in reality, they are no gods."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Formerly (before your conversion, comp. Galatians 4:7) when ye knew not God. A description of the heathen state, which, compared with the knowledge of the only true and living God through revelation, was dark ignorance."
2. "Indefinite Knowledge is definite ignorance. Comp. 1Th 4:5 ; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; Ephesians 2:12."
3. "If the negation is put before â€˜natureâ€™: â€˜to those who are gods not by nature,â€™ we must supply: â€˜but only in reputeâ€™ (comp. 1 Corinthians 8:5: â€˜though there be that are called godsâ€™). In this case the Apostle would deny the existence of the heathen gods altogether and hold them to be mere creatures of fancy (or personifications of the powers of nature)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To them which by nature are not gods."
2. "He terms them 'demons,' the 'so-called gods.'"
3. "Worshipping images made by hands."

### John Gill:
1. "Whilst in Gentilism, and in a state of unregeneracy, they had no true knowledge of God."
2. "They knew not the God of Israel; they did not know God in Christ."
3. "Only by name, and in the opinion of men, but have no divinity in them, are only called gods, mere nominal, fictitious deities."

### John Wesley:
1. "Indeed then when ye knew not God, ye served them that by nature â€” That is, in reality." 
2. "Are no gods â€” And so were under a far worse bondage than even that of the Jews." 
3. "For they did serve the true God, though in a low, slavish manner."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Before receiving the gospel, both Jews and Gentiles were burdened by the yoke of slavery, with the Gentiles having even more severe servitude. The heathen, although initially having knowledge of God, chose not to retain that knowledge and corrupted the truth. While they may have known God through His works to some extent, they lacked true knowledge of His eternity, power, and holiness. In their ignorance, they worshiped false gods, including images made by human hands. The Galatians, who were once slaves to such false deities, were made free by the gospel. Their lapse into subjection to worldly elements is a stark contrast to the filial freedom they have in Christ. It is therefore disgraceful and inexcusable that, in the midst of the light of the gospel, they would fall into such gross errors and corrupt the truth.
