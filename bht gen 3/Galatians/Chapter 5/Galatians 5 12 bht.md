# Galatians 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the community of believers, there are unsettling individuals causing havoc. The term cut off implies a harsher sense, akin to amputation. Though it may not be agreeable today, we should consider the interpretations of the past. Circumcision alone, devoid of faith, love, and obedience, signifies mere physical mutilation. The expressed wish is for the removal of these disruptors from the church, driven by a concern for God's glory and the welfare of His people.
