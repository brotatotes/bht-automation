# Galatians 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In your Christian calling, which is unto freedom, it is important to not let your liberty become an opportunity for sinful desires. Instead, embrace the bondage of love and serve one another. Gospel liberty consists of freedom from the Mosaic yoke, sin, and fear. Do not misuse your Christian liberty as a pretext for indulgence or license. Let your freedom be guided by the law of love and mutual service, and fulfill the purpose for which you have been called to salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Because they were striking at the very root of their Christian calling, which was unto (or, on condition of) freedom."
2. "Only (make not) your liberty into (or, use it not for) an occasion (opportunity) for the flesh (for giving way to carnal passions)."
3. "By means of (your) love be in bondage (so literally: the word is used in opposition to freedom) to one another."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The state or condition in which ye have been called to salvation is one of liberty. Gospel liberty consists in three things, freedom from the Mosaic yoke, from sin, and from slavish fear."
2. "Do not give the flesh the handle or pretext for its indulgence which it eagerly seeks for, do not let it make Christian 'liberty' its pretext for indulgence."
3. "While free as to legalism, be bound by Love to serve one another."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You are called to liberty, but it is not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. It is not freedom from virtuous restraints, and from the laws of God. It is liberty from the servitude of sin, and religious rites and ceremonies, not freedom from the necessary restraints of virtue."
2. "There has been a strong tendency, as the history of the church has shown, to abuse the doctrine of grace. The doctrine that Christians are 'free;' that there is liberty to them from restraint, has been perverted always by Antinomians, and been made the occasion of their indulging freely in sin. And the result has shown that nothing was more important than to guard the doctrine of Christian liberty, and to show exactly what Christians are freed from, and what laws are still binding on them."
3. "By the proper manifestation of love one to another strive to promote each otherâ€™s welfare. To do this will not be inconsistent with the freedom of the gospel. When there is love there is no servitude. Duty is pleasant, and offices of kindness agreeable. Paul does not consider them as freed from all law and all restraint; but they are to be governed by the law of love. They were not to feel that they were so free that they might lawfully give indulgence to the desires of the flesh, but they were to regard themselves as under the law to love one another; and thus they would fulfill the law of Christian freedom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Well may I speak thus strongly of those who thus overthrow your whole polity and enslave you, for ye are called for freedom."
2. "Christian freedom is not to be abused for selfish ends."
3. "Individual liberty is subject to the law of love and mutual service."

### John Calvin:
1. "Liberty lies in the conscience, and looks to God; the use of it lies in outward matters, and deals not with God only, but with men."
2. "Liberty is not granted to the flesh, which ought rather to be held captive under the yoke, but is a spiritual benefit, which none but pious minds are capable of enjoying."
3. "A good conscience submits to no slavery; but to practice outward slavery, or to abstain from the use of liberty, is attended by no danger."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "True freedom is self-government and inseparable from law; it is a law to itself."
2. "Show your freedom by love, and your love by service. This kind of bondage is honorable and delightful."
3. "To serve God is true freedom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye were called for freedom...on the basis of, for the purpose of." 
2. "Turn not your liberty into an occasion for the flesh, as a spring board for license."
3. "Liberty so easily turns to license."

### John Gill:
1. "He asserts that they were 'called' not merely externally, but internally, by the effectual grace of God, out of bondage to sin, Satan, and the law, unto the liberty of the Gospel and of the grace of God."
2. "Christ's free men should not [misuse their Christian liberty]...that is to disgrace the doctrine of Christian liberty, to enthral themselves in bondage instead of using their liberty aright."
3. "Gospel liberty and the service of the saints are not at all inconsistent; as it becomes them to love one another, as the new command of Christ, their profession of religion, and their relation to each other, require, so they should show their love by their service."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye have been called to liberty â€” From sin and misery, as well as from the ceremonial law."
2. "Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh â€” Take not occasion from hence to gratify corrupt nature."
3. "But by love serve one another â€” And hereby show that Christ has made you free."
