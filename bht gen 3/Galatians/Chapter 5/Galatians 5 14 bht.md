# Galatians 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love fulfills the whole law, specifically the law of Moses. By viewing the commands of the law as subordinate to the law of love, Paul emphasizes that whoever fulfills the command of love must be treated as having fulfilled the entire law. This love is not limited to acts of kindness, but rather a love that surpasses all other commands. It is a love that unites all people and springs from our love for God. Obedience to the command to love our neighbor expresses the law of Christ and embraces all people, surpassing boundaries.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole law cannot, from the circumstances of the whole Epistle, mean anything but 'the whole law of Moses;' but by placing ourselves on the lofty spiritual level from which St. Paul looked down, and saw all other commands of the Law so far subordinated to the law of love, that whoever had fulfilled this command, must be treated as having fulfilled the whole." 
2. "For he says not only ye bite, which is the act of a man enraged, but also ye devour, which belongs to one persisting in his crime. He that bites gives way to a paroxysm of anger: but he that devours, gives example of the fiercest brutality. And he is speaking of bites and devourings which are not corporeal, but far more savage."
3. "For dissension and strife is corruptive both of the defenders and of the aggressors, and eats out everything worse than the moth."

2. "Love is 'the law of Christ.'"

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "The difference is between statement and accomplishment."

### John Calvin:
1. "The present commendation of love is intended to inform the Galatians, that love forms the chief part of Christian perfection."
2. "Love to men springs only from the fear and love of God; and therefore we need not wonder if, by a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the whole, the effect include under it the cause of which it is the sign."

3. "The measure or rule of love is, 'as thyself'; and designs not an equality of affection, but a likeness of effects; that is, to do the same kind acts of love to others, one would choose to have done to ourselves."

### John Wesley:
