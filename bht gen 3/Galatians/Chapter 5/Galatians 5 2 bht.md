# Galatians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold! I, Paul, make a strong statement against the false apostles who teach that circumcision is necessary for salvation. If you continue to be circumcised, you disbelieve in the power of grace and Christ will profit you nothing. Circumcision is a sign of subjection to the law, and by choosing it, you relinquish Christ. Therefore, if you submit to circumcision, you lose the whole of Christ, not just a part.

If you continue to be circumcised, you disbelieve in the power of grace and Christ will profit you nothing. Circumcision is a sign of subjection to the law, and by choosing it, you relinquish Christ.

- Attempt 4 BHT: If you choose to be circumcised as a means of seeking justification, you are rejecting the doctrine of justification by Christ and abandoning your faith in him. This directly opposes the teachings of the Judaizers, who believed that circumcision was necessary for salvation. By choosing the law over Christ, you are forfeiting the full extent of his grace and rendering his sacrifice meaningless. Remember that circumcision symbolizes subjection to the law, and by accepting it, you are relinquishing your connection to Christ. Trusting in works and righteousness subtly undermines the sufficiency of Christ and makes him unprofitable to you. Choose Christ alone and fully embrace the blessings that come through faith in him.

- Attempt 5 BHT: If you go on being circumcised under the notion of its necessity for justification, you are disbelieving in the power of grace and rejecting the full extent of Christ's help. Choosing circumcision over Christ is choosing subjection to the law and relinquishing the blessings that come through faith. Trusting in works and righteousness renders Christ unprofitable, making his sacrifice and righteousness useless. Do not divide the honor with Christ's death by clinging to rites and observances as essential for salvation. Choose Christ alone and embrace the complete blessings through faith in him.
