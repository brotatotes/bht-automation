# Galatians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Choosing circumcision as a means of salvation nullifies the Gospel of grace, for faith and works cannot coexist for justification. By seeking to be justified through circumcision, one renounces Christ as the sole source of salvation. Trusting in works renders Christ unprofitable, gaining nothing from the power of grace. Therefore, Paul, in asserting his authority, warns that embracing circumcision will render Christ useless and ineffective in helping you.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is to be ‚Äòa whole Saviour.‚Äô No one is to share with him in the honor of saving people; and no rite, no custom, no observance of law, is to divide the honor with his death."
2. "But if, as the false teachers in Galatia claimed, as a thing essential to salvation, as indispensable to justification and acceptance with God, then the matter assumed a different aspect; and then it became in fact a renouncing of Christ as himself sufficient to save us."
3. "Rites and ceremonies in religion may be in themselves well enough, if they are held to be matters not essential; but the moment they are regarded as vital and essential, that moment they begin to infringe on the doctrine of justification by faith alone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Behold. Imperative singular, appealing to each individual reader."
2. "The question with the Galatians was circumcision as a condition of salvation."

- Attempt 1 BHT: If you, as the Galatians, choose to be circumcised under the notion of it being necessary for salvation, then the Gospel of grace is nullified, for righteousness of works and justification by faith cannot co-exist. Christ cannot be divided in this way, and by seeking to be justified through circumcision, you renounce him as the sole means of salvation. Trusting in works renders Christ unprofitable, and you gain nothing from that which you distrust. Therefore, Paul asserts his authority and warns that if you embrace circumcision as essential for salvation, Christ will profit you nothing, and he will not help you at all.
