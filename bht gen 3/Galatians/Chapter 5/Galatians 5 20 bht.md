## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word rendered sorcery may also mean ‚Äòpoisoning.‚Äô But the former is preferable, as more frequently its sense in the Septuagint and New Test., and because Asia was particularly addicted to sorceries (Acts xix. 19)."
2. "jealousy (in bad sense)‚Äîreff. wrath] passionate outbreaks."
3. "self-seeking] not ‚Äòstrife,‚Äô as A.V. and commonly, in error: see note on Rom. ii. 8,‚Äîbut unworthy compassings of selfish ends."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "witchcraft‚Äîsorcery; prevalent in Asia (Acts 19:19; compare Galatians 5:21)." 
2. "variance‚ÄîGreek, 'strife'; singular in the oldest manuscripts."
3. "seditions‚Äî'dissensions,' as to secular matters. Heresies‚Äîas to sacred things."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Seditions - See the note at Romans 16:17.
Heresies - See the note at Acts 5:17; 1 Corinthians 11:19.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Witchcraft [œÜŒ±œÅŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒπŒ±] . Or sorcery. Elsewhere only Revelation 18:23. From farmakon a drug."
2. "Wrath [Œ∏œÖŒºŒøŒπ] . Lit. wraths. See on John 3:36."
3. "Heresies [Œ±ŒπœÅŒµœÉŒµŒπœÇ] . In Paul only here and 1 Corinthians 11:19. See on 2 Peter 2:1. Parties, into which divisions crystallize."

### John Gill:
1. "Hatred: internal hatred of any man's person, even of our very enemies, is forbidden; in the original text it is 'enmities': as the carnal mind is nothing else but enmity against God and Christ, against law and Gospel, and all good men, and everything that is good."
2. "Wrath or 'wraths': violent emotions of the mind, moving to revenge, and seeking the hurt and mischief of others."
3. "Heresies: bad principles and tenets, relating to doctrine, which are subversive of the fundamentals of the Gospel and the Christian religion; and are the produce of a man's own invention, and the matter of his choice, without any foundation in the word of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Idolatry, witchcraft ‚Äî That this means witchcraft, strictly speaking, (not poisoning,) appears from its being joined with the worship of devil-gods, and not with murder."
2. "To deny therefore that there is, or ever was, any such thing, is, by plain consequence, to deny the authority both of the Old and New Testament."
3. "Divisions ‚Äî In domestic or civil matters. Heresies are divisions in religious communities."
