# Galatians 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Divisions often lead to heresies, as people stubbornly follow their own will. The apostle emphasizes the impending day of retribution, warning us beforehand. The mentioned sins, such as murders and revelings linked with drunkenness, indicate a consistent lifestyle. These sins demonstrate that one does not belong to or inherit the Kingdom of God. Heaven is a realm of absolute purity, and those who are unclean cannot enter. However, through repentance and sanctification, one can hope to see the Lord. God's warnings of judgment call us to repentance and stand as evidence against the unrepentant.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Divisions can lead to heresies as people choose their own self-willed path and adhere to it. The apostle forewarns us of the impending day of retribution and highlights the importance of his message by stating it both in the present and past. The sins listed in this passage, such as murders, revelings, and drunkenness, are indicative of a lifestyle rather than occasional actions. The presence of these sins in one's life is proof that they do not belong to the Kingdom of God and will not inherit it.
