## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The works of the flesh are no fruit."
2. "loveâ€”at the head, as chiefâ€”1 Cor. xiii."
3. "faith, in the widest sense: faith, towards God and man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Loveâ€”the leader of the band of graces."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The virtues which he enumerates are produced by a foreign influence - the agency of the Holy Spirit. Hence, Paul does not trace them to our own hearts, even when renewed."
2. "This is one of the regular effects of the Spiritâ€™s operations on the heart. Religion makes no one crabby, and morose, and sour. It sweetens the temper; corrects an irritable disposition; makes the heart kind; disposes us to make all around us as happy as possible."
3. "The Christian is faithful as a man; faithful as a neighbor, friend, father, husband, son. He is faithful to his contracts; faithful to his promises."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Love is really the weaker expression for love, as that term is conventionally used. It is judicial rather than affectionate."
2. "The attempt to carry out consistently the classical distinction between these two must be abandoned. Both are used of the love of parents and children, of the love of God for Christ, of Christ for men, of God for men, of men for Christ and of men for men."
3. "Love, in this passage, is that fruit of the Spirit which dominates all the others."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing but what is evil comes from man; nothing good comes but from the Holy Spirit."
2. "Joy does not here, I think, denote that 'joy in the Holy Ghost' (Romans 14:17,) of which he speaks elsewhere, but that cheerful behavior towards our fellow-men which is the opposite of moroseness."
3. "But if spiritual men are known by their works, what judgment, it will be asked, shall we form of wicked men and idolaters, who exhibited an illustrious resemblance of all the virtues? [...] a single virtue will not entitle us to conclude that a man is spiritual."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fruit of the Spirit [...] is a beautiful tree of fruit that Paul pictures here with nine luscious fruits on it." 
2. "Paul has a better list than the four cardinal virtues of the Stoics (temperance, prudence, fortitude, justice), though they are included with better notes struck."
3. "Temperance is alike, but kindness is better than justice, long-suffering than fortitude, love than prudence."

### John Gill:
1. "Love. This the apostle begins with, it being the fulfilling of the law, the bond of perfectness."
2. "joy, even that which is in the Holy Ghost, and has him for its author."
3. "peace, which is another fruit of the Spirit: and designs peace with God in a man's own conscience, produced there by the Spirit of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Love - The root of all the rest."
2. "Gentleness - Toward all men; ignorant and wicked men in particular."
3. "Goodness - The Greek word means all that is benign, soft, winning, tender, either in temper or behaviour."
