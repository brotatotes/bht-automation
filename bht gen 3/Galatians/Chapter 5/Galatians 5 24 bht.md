- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who belong to Jesus Christ have crucified the flesh and its passions and desires. They are completely separated from the law and dead to its demands, which are meant for the flesh. This crucifixion happened when they believed in and were baptized into Christ, and now they keep the flesh in a state of crucifixion. Through the power of the Spirit, they are able to produce the fruit of the Spirit without being hindered by the flesh. Believers are to be executioners, ruthlessly dealing with the body of sin that caused Christ's sufferings. This concept of crucifying the flesh is similar to the idea of dying to sin in Romans 6 and dying to the law in Romans 7. The flesh refers to the force in humans that tends toward evil and corruption. By crucifying the flesh with Christ, believers are completely exterminating this evil force and guaranteeing victory over their passions and evil inclinations.
