- Attempt 1 BHT: When the apostle Paul asserts that receiving circumcision obligates one to keep the whole law, he emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of this commitment. By becoming circumcised, one not only assumes the solemn obligation to obey all the special laws of the Jewish religion but also binds oneself to the complete adherence to the moral and ritual requirements of the Mosaic law. It is crucial to understand that submission to circumcision signifies an acceptance of the entire law and all its responsibilities and duties, leaving no room for partial observance. Therefore, those who choose to be circumcised, seeking righteousness and life through this act, also choose to be burdened by the impossibility of perfectly satisfying the law and consequently face the curse associated with it.
