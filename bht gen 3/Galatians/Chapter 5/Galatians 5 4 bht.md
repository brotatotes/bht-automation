# Galatians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By seeking justification through the law, one falls away from grace and dissolves their union with Christ. When trying to unite the Christian economy with the law, the value of Christ's grace is disregarded and His work becomes unnecessary. The two are mutually exclusive, as righteousness through personal works diminishes the significance of Christ's grace. Making a choice between the law and grace leads to separation from Christ and voiding oneself from His grace, renouncing the new covenant.
