# Galatians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the state of a Christian, confirmation of the words is found by faith in Christ Jesus. This faith, which works by love, is not the basis for justification, but rather the manifestation of the faith that justifies. All distinctions, whether circumcised or not, are leveled in Christ. Therefore, let us seek the love that is inseparable from true faith and allow it to exhibit its living energy through our actions.

3. "When you are engaged in discussing the question of justification, beware of allowing any mention to be made of love or of works, but resolutely adhere to the exclusive particle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working (or operative) through love."
2. "May we not add in the very spirit of Paul? â€˜neither episcopacy nor presbytery, neither presbytery nor independency, neither immersion nor sprinkling, neither Calvinism nor Arminianism, neither Catholicism nor Protestantism, nor any other isms, however important in their place, are of any account, when compared with the fundamental difference between faith and infidelity, between Christ and anti-Christ."
3. "The sentence, â€˜faith working through love,â€™ reconciles the doctrine of Paul with that of James."

3. "But faith which works by love; faith has a concern in justification and salvation, not by way of causal influence, but as it is that grace which receives the righteousness of Christ, through which we are saved, and kept by the power of God unto salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "For in Christ Jesus...according to the tenor of the Christian covenant."
