# Galatians 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The persuasion to subject yourselves to the Jewish law does not proceed from him who called you to freedom in Christ. This new persuasion then has come from some other quarter; and if you wish to have it thought that your calling is from God, beware of lending an ear to those who thrust upon you their new inventions. This your present persuasion cometh not from God, who called you to his kingdom and glory.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The persuasion that some Galatians were yielding to, the belief that they must obey the Jewish law to be saved, did not come from God, who called them to freedom in Christ. This new persuasion was not consistent with their calling from God, and it certainly did not originate from Him. It was important for the Galatians to be aware of who was influencing them, as this belief did not align with the truth of the gospel. Instead, they were being persuaded by the false apostles who sought to impose their own inventions on them. They needed to stay faithful to the calling they had received from God, which was to the grace of Christ and the knowledge of Him.
