# Galatians 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a fellow believer falters and succumbs to sin, it is crucial that our response is one of gentleness and meekness. Our aim should not be to condemn or accuse, but rather to restore them to a place of spiritual wholeness. We must approach them with humility, recognizing our own vulnerabilities to temptation, and should seek to bring them back on track in a kind and compassionate manner. Like setting a dislocated bone, the process of restoring a fallen brother or sister requires a gentle touch and a heart filled with love and understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If another has really been overtaken in a fault the first; for often he who is first to find fault, is the very one who has first transgressed."
2. "Such is the tenderness with which we should treat a fallen member of the Church in restoring him to a better state."
3. "Meekness" is that temper of spirit towards God whereby we accept His dealings without disputing; then, towards men, whereby we endure meekly their provocations, and do not withdraw ourselves from the burdens which their sins impose upon us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians do not commit sin deliberately, and as a part of the plan of life; but they may be surprised by sudden temptation, or urged on by impetuous or headstrong passion."
2. "Reformers should be holy persons; people who exercise discipline in the church should be 'spiritual' men - people in whom implicit confidence may be properly reposed."
3. "No one should attempt to rebuke or admonish another who cannot do it in the spirit of meekness; no man should engage in any way in the work of reform who has not such a temper of mind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means lit. to take before; to anticipate or forestall. [...] But surprised by the fault itself; hurried into error."
2. "The word is used of reconciling factions [...] The idea of amendment is prominent: set him to rights: bring him into line."
3. "Before you deal severely with the erring brother, consider your own weakness and susceptibility to temptation, and restore him in view of that fact."

### John Calvin:
1. "To gain this object, he explains the design of pious reproofs, which is, to restore him who is fallen, to place him in his former condition. That design will never be accomplished by violence, or by a disposition to accuse, or by fierceness of manner or language; and consequently, we must display a gentle and meek spirit, if we intend to heal our brother." 
2. "Another argument for gentleness in correcting brethren is contained in the expression, ‚Äúif a man be overtaken. ‚Äù If he has been carried away through want of consideration, or through the cunning arts of a deceiver, it would be cruel to treat such a man with harshness."
3. "Whenever we have occasion to pronounce censure, let us begin with ourselves, and, remembering our own weakness, let us be indulgent to others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Spiritual life must show itself in spiritual action, especially in charity, meekness, and modesty."
2. "Brethren. A word of love more potent than argument."
3. "True charity is a test of spirituality. True strength and freedom show themselves in bearing and forbearing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If a man be overtaken...Condition of third class...to surprise, to detect."
2. "Trespass...a falling aside, a slip or lapse...in the papyri rather than a wilful sin."
3. "The spiritually led...the spiritual experts in mending souls."

### John Gill:
1. "Professors fallen into sin are like broken and dislocated bones; they are out of their place, and lose both their comfort and usefulness, and are to be restored by gently telling them of their faults, and mildly reproving them for them."
2. "A spiritual man should consider himself as in the body, and as carrying about with him a body of sin, a corrupt and treacherous heart, that is full of deceitful lusts, by which he may be tempted also, and drawn away and enticed."
3. "The relation the saints stand in to one another, as 'brethren', should excite them to seek each other's welfare, and to restore any that are fallen, and to abstain from all roughness and severity."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye who are spiritual ‚Äî Who continue to live and walk by the Spirit."
2. "Restore such an one ‚Äî By reproof, instruction, or exhortation. Every one who can, ought to help herein; only in the spirit of meekness."
3. "Lest thou also be tempted ‚Äî Temptation easily and swiftly passes from one to another; especially if a man endeavours to cure another without preserving his own meekness."
