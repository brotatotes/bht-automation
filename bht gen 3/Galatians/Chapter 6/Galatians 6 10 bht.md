# Galatians 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as a farmer has a specific season for sowing and reaping, we too must make the most of our opportunities to do good. The limited time we have on this earth should fuel our zeal to counteract evil through acts of kindness. Our generosity should extend to all members of the household of faith, as well as strangers and even our enemies. Let us seize the privilege of doing good, for it begins at home but should not be limited to our immediate circle.
