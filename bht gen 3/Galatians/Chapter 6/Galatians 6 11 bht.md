## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "See in how large letters (in what great and apparently unsightly characters: see note on next verse. 'The original will not bear the rendering how large a letter, as A.V.) I have written (not referring to the following verses only, but to the whole Epistle, see below) unto you with my own hand." 
2. "I do not see how it is possible to avoid the inference that these words apply to the whole Epistle."
3. "I should rather believe, that on account of the peculiar character of this Epistle, St. Paul wrote it all with his own hand,‚Äîas he did the pastoral Epistles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "See in how large letters I have written." 
The mention of these is as a token by which they would know that he wrote the whole Epistle with his own hand.
2. "He usually dictated his Epistles to an amanuensis, excepting the concluding salutation, which he wrote himself." 
This letter, he tells the Galatians, he writes with his own hand, no doubt in order that they may see what a regard he had for them.
3. "If English Version be retained, the words, 'how large a letter,' will not refer to the length of the Epistle absolutely, but that it was a large one for him to have written with his own hand." 
NEANDER supports English Version, as more appropriate to the earnestness of the apostle and the tone of the Epistle: "How large" will thus be put for "how many."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense is not materially different whichever translation is adopted. The object of the apostle is, to direct their attention to the special proof of his love, which he had manifested in writing such a letter."
2. "He might not, says Doddridge, have been well versed in the Greek characters; or 'this inaccuracy of his writings might have been owing to the infirmity or weakness of his nerves.'"
3. "According to this interpretation, it was proof of special interest in them, and regard for them, that he had written to them a whole letter with his own hand."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "How large a letter... with how large letters."
2. "It is therefore quite probable that Paul may have wished to call special attention to these verses."
3. "Mark carefully these closing words of mine. I write them with my own hand in the large characters which you know."

### John Calvin:
1. "To convince the Galatians more fully of his anxiety about them, and at the same time to ensure their careful perusal, he mentions that this long Epistle had been written with his own hand." 
2. "The greater the toil to which he had submitted on their account, the stronger were their inducements to read it, not in a superficial manner, but with the closest attention."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "See in what large letters (or characters) I write unto you with mine own hand."
2. "It refers to the handwriting, not to the contents."
3. "The Greek (œÄŒ∑ŒªŒπÃÅŒ∫ŒøŒπœÇ ) refers to large size only, and may indicate the emphasis laid on these concluding sentences."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Certainly not 'how large a letter.' It has been suggested that he employed large letters because of defective eyesight or because he could only write ill-formed letters because of his poor handwriting (like the print letters of children) or because he wished to call particular attention to this closing paragraph by placarding it in big letters (Ramsay)." (Commentary)
2. "Artisans write clumsy letters, yes, and scholars also." (Commentary)
3. "The contrast seen in papyri often between the neat hand of the scribe and the big sprawling hand of the signature." (Commentary)

### John Gill:
1. "Ye see how large a letter...how large a letter, or 'with what letters'; which some understand of the largeness of the characters he wrote in; others of the deformity of them...but he intends the length of the epistle, the prolixity of his writing."
2. "...he took so much pains to write so long a letter to them, in order to set things right in their view, and recover them from error."
3. "...that amidst so much work, and such labours

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye see how large a letter ‚Äî St. Paul had not yet wrote a larger to any church."
2. "I have written with my own hand ‚Äî He generally wrote by an amanuensis."
