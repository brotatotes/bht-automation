# Galatians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The desire of some to make a fair show in the flesh and gain external glory from others is contrasted with true discipleship. The Judaizers sought popularity and avoided suffering by blending Judaism with Christianity, emphasizing outward conformity and circumcision. In contrast, true followers embraced the crucified Messiah, relying solely on faith for justification. The pressure to conform and fear of persecution motivated the Judaizers' actions, but Paul urged the Galatians to resist and remain steadfast in the truth of the gospel.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse reminds us of the contrast between true discipleship and the false pretenses of those who sought to please others and avoid suffering. The Judaizers, in their attempt to blend Judaism with Christianity, emphasized the outward conformity to the law, such as circumcision, to escape persecution and maintain their reputation. Their focus was on making a fair show in the flesh, seeking popularity and avoiding the offense of the cross. However, true followers of Christ were called to a different path, one that embraced the crucified Messiah and relied solely on faith. The pressure to conform to external rites and the fear of persecution were motives behind the Judaizers' actions, but Paul urged the Galatians to resist their persuasion and remain steadfast in the truth.
