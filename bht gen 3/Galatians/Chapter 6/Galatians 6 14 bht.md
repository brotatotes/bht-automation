# Galatians 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is only fitting to boast in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, for it is through His atoning death that we are reconciled with God. Through the cross, the world and all its unspiritual aspects have been crucified to me, showing my union with Christ and victory over worldly influences. The cross, which once brought shame and offense, is now a source of glory, as it represents the defeat of death by Christ. It is through the power of the cross that we are freed from the attractions and desires of the world.
