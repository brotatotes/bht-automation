## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And as many (reference to the ‚Äúas many‚Äù of ver. 12) as shall walk by this rule (of ver. 15. The word means a ‚Äòstraight rule,‚Äô to detect crookedness: hence a rule of life), peace be (not ‚Äòis:‚Äô it is the apostolic blessing, so common in the beginnings of his Epistles: see also Eph. vi. 23) upon them (come on them from God)"
2. "and (and indeed) upon the Israel of God (the subject of the whole Epistle seems to have given rise to this expression. Not the Israel after the flesh, among whom these teachers wish to enrol you, are blessed"
3. "but the ISRAEL OF GOD, described ch. iii. 28, 29. Jowett compares, though not exactly parallel, yet for a similar apparent though not actual distinction, 1 Cor. x. 32)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "as many‚Äîcontrasting with the 'as many,' Galatians 6:12."
2. "rule‚Äîliterally, a straight rule, to detect crookedness; so a rule of life."
3. "Israel of God‚Äînot the Israel after the flesh, among whom those teachers wish to enroll you; but the spiritual seed of Abraham by faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As many as walk - As many as live, for so the word walk is used in the Scriptures." 
2. "Peace be on them." 
3. "And upon the Israel of God - The true church of God; all who are his true worshippers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In other words, they who walk according to this rule form the true Israel of God."
2. "Then osoi will refer to the individual Christians, Jewish and Gentile, and Israel of God to the same Christians, regarded collectively, and forming the true messianic community."
3. "The explicative kai is at best doubtful here, and is rather forced, although clear instances of it may be found in 1 Corinthians 3:5; 1 Corinthians 14:38."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those who teach this doctrine are worthy of all esteem and regard, and those who reject it do not deserve to be heard."
2. "Faithful and upright teachers, and all who allow themselves to conform to this rule, must derive singular encouragement from this passage, in which God, by the mouth of Paul, pronounces on them a blessing."
3. "He gives the appellation of the Israel of God to those whom he formerly denominated the children of Abraham by faith, and thus includes all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, who were united into one church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peace be on them and mercy, ‚Äò Peace‚Äô with God and with themselves, the precious fruit of the atonement and the greatest Christian blessing, which the world cannot give nor take away (John 14:27)."
2. "'Mercy' is coupled with peace (1 Timothy 1:2 ; 2 Timothy 1:2; 2 John 1:3). In the other Pauline Epistles we have ‚Äògrace and peace‚Äô in the salutation."
3. "And (namely) upon the Israel of God, the true children of Israel, the people of God, as distinct from the mere carnal descendants."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "And as many as walk according to this rule,... the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ, the subject of this epistle, the truth the apostle had been explaining, vindicating, and confirming."
2. "By peace he means, a view of their peace with God, made by the blood of Christ; peace in their own consciences... and also peace with one another, among themselves as brethren, which is a very desirable blessing."
3. "The 'Israel of God'... the spiritual Israel, as distinct from Israel according to the flesh... includes all God's elect, whether Jews or Gentiles."

### John Wesley:
1. "Glorying only in the cross of Christ."
