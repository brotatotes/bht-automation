# Galatians 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly sympathize with and carry the burdens of others, we must discard the hindrance of self-conceit. If we believe ourselves to be superior or exempt from human frailty, we are deceiving our own minds and leading ourselves astray. Instead, we must acknowledge our own insignificance and embrace humility. Genuine greatness lies in recognizing our own weakness and relying on God's grace rather than exalting ourselves.

- Attempt 4 BHT: To effectively empathize with the burdens of others, we must rid ourselves of self-conceit, as it is the primary obstacle to showing forbearance and compassion.

Our self-deception not only fails to impress others but also renders us insignificant. True humility arises from recognizing our own nothingness and dispelling the illusion of self-importance.

- Attempt 5 BHT: To truly show empathy towards others and carry their burdens, we must let go of self-conceit. Believing we are superior or immune to the weaknesses of others is self-deception and leads to our own downfall. Instead, we need to recognize our own nothingness and embrace humility. Forbearance towards others is motivated by understanding our own weaknesses. In Christian morality, self-esteem is vanity and, ultimately, nothingness. It is only when we acknowledge our own insignificance that we can extend true grace and support to others.
