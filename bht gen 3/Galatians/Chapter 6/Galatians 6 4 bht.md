# Galatians 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A person should examine their actions and put them to the test, finding the sole basis for their boasting in themselves and not in comparison to others. This self-reflection is not about finding merit or feeling superior to others, but about having a good conscience and glorying in the testimony of one's own actions. It is not through comparing oneself to others, but through a sincere examination of their own heart and conduct in life that a person can find true cause for rejoicing. This requires a humble and honest evaluation, devoid of any desire to diminish others.
