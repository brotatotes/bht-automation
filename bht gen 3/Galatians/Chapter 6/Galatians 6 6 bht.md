## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But the two senses come nearly to the same: he who shares in the necessities of the saints, can only do so by making that necessity partly his own, i.e. by depriving himself to that extent, and communicating to them." 
2. "From the mention of bearing one anotherâ€™s burdens, he naturally passes to one way, and one case, in which those burdens may be borneâ€”viz. by relieving the necessities of their ministers."
3. "The word, in its very usual sense of the Gospel,â€”the word of life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "BUT I do not intend that he should not think of others, and especially of the wants of his ministers."
2. "Impart a share unto his teacher: literally, 'him that teacheth catechetically.'"
3. "In every kind of the good things of this life, according as the case may require."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let him that is taught in the word - In the word of God; that is, the gospel."
2. "Communicate unto him - Let him share with him who teaches; let there be a common participation of all good things."
3. "In all good things - In everything that is needful for their comfortable subsistence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "But, although each man is thus individualized as regards his burdens, Christian fellowship in all morally good things is to be maintained between the teacher and the taught."
2. "The exhortation therefore is, that the disciple should make common cause with the teacher in everything that is morally good and that promotes salvation."
3. "Hold fellowship with; partake with. Not impart to. The word is used of giving and receiving material aid: of moral or spiritual participation: of participation in outward conditions: in sufferings."

### John Calvin:
1. "How disgraceful is it to defraud of their temporal support those by whom our souls are fed! â€” to refuse an earthly recompense to those from whom we receive heavenly benefits!"
2. "It is one of the tricks of Satan to defraud godly ministers of support, that the Church may be deprived of such ministers."

3. "Who sows grain will reap grain, who sows tares will reap tares; who sows plentifully will reap plentifully, who sows sparingly will reap sparingly."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The active (Ï„Ï‰ ÎºÎ±Ï„Î·Ï‡Î¿Ï…Î½Ï„) joined with the passive is interesting as showing how early we find paid teachers in the churches." 
2. "For this late and rare verb ÎºÎ±Ï„Î·Ï‡ÎµÏ‰, see on Luke 1:4; Acts 18:25; 1 Corinthians 14:19. It occurs in the papyri for legal instruction." 
3. "There was a teaching class thus early (1 Thessalonians 5:12; 1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:17)."

### John Gill:
1. "He that is taught in this, is... one that has been taught to know himself, and his lost state by nature; to know Christ, and salvation by him; to know the truths of the Gospel, and to deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly." 
2. "It may include everyone that is only outwardly taught, that is but an external hearer." 
3. "Temporal things are good as they are of God, and in themselves, and when rightly used answer good purposes."
