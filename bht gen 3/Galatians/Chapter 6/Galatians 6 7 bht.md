# Galatians 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God cannot be mocked, for there is no such thing as mocking Him in reality, despite what people may think in their minds. The truth is that whatever a person sows, they will eventually reap. This principle of reaping what we sow goes beyond the immediate context and is connected to the final judgment at the end of the world. Excuses for withholding support in God's cause may seem valid to humans, but they hold no weight before God. We must not be deceived, for God will judge each person according to their works, which are seeds sown for eternity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God is not mocked:‚Äîthough men in their own minds mock God, this mocking has no objective existence: there is no such thing as mocking of God in reality."
2. "That (emphatic, that and nothing else) shall he also (by the same rule) reap, viz. eventually, at the great harvest."
3. "The final judgment is necessarily now introduced by the similitude ('the harvest... is the end of the world'), but does not any the more belong to the context in ver. 5."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God does not suffer Himself to be imposed on by empty words: He will judge according to works, which are seeds sown for eternity of either joy or woe."
2. "Excuses for illiberality in God's cause seem valid before men, but are not so before God."
3. "Reap at the harvest, the end of the world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God could not be imposed on, or could not be insulted with impunity, or successfully."
2. "No zeal, however ardent; no prayers, however fervent or long, no professions, however loud, would impose on God."
3. "Every kind of grain will produce grain like itself. So it is in regard to our works."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be not deceived. For the phrase see 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Corinthians 14:33; James 1:16. Deceive is a secondary sense; the primary meaning being lead astray."
2. "Is not mocked. Quite often in LXX See 1 Kings 18:27; 2 Kings 19:21; Job 22:19; Proverbs 1:30. Also the noun mukthrismov mockery... The verb, literally, to turn up the nose at."
3. "That. Most emphatic. That and nothing else. Comp. Matthew 7:16; 2 Corinthians 9:6."

### John Calvin:
1. "The consequence is, that, while such multitudes withhold their aid, the few persons who do their duty are generally unable to contribute the necessary support. These apologies Paul utterly rejects, for a reason which the world little considers, that this transaction is with God." 
2. "Our liberality is restrained by the supposition, that whatever passes into the hands of another is lost to ourselves, and by the alarm we feel about our own prospects in life. Paul meets these views by a comparison drawn from seed-time, which, he tells us, is a fit representation of acts of beneficence."
3. "Happy would it be for us if this truth were deeply impressed upon our minds. How 'very gladly' would we 'spend and be spent' for the good of our neighbors, encouraged by the hope of the coming harvest!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stop being led astray" (ŒºŒ∑ œÄŒªŒ±ŒΩŒ±œÉŒ∏Œµ).
2. "God is not mocked" (ŒøœÖ ŒºœÖŒ∫œÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒ∂ŒµœÑŒ±).
3. "Reaping what we sow is a fundamental principle" (Œø ŒµŒ±ŒΩ œÉœÄŒµŒπœÅŒ∑ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ).

### John Gill:
1. "God is not mocked; nor will he be."
2. "Withholding from his ministers... is mocking of him, and which he will not suffer with impunity."
3. "If he sows bountifully, he shall reap bountifully; but if he sows sparingly, he shall reap sparingly."

### John Wesley:
1. God is not mocked ‚Äî Although they attempt to mock him, who think to reap otherwise than they sow.
