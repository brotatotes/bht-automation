### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians sometimes become weary. There is so much opposition to the best plans for doing good; there is so much to be done; there are so many calls on their time and their charities; and there is often so much ingratitude among those whom they endeavor to benefit, that they become disheartened."
2. "He who becomes disheartened, and who gives over his efforts; he that is appalled by obstacles, and that faints on account of the embarrassments thrown in his way; he that pines for ease, and withdraws from the field of benevolence, shows that he has no true attachment to the cause, and that his heart has never been truly in the work of religion."
3. "He who becomes a true Christian, becomes such for eternity. He has enlisted, never to withdraw. He becomes pledged to do good and to serve God always."

3. "Faint. Only here in Paul. Lit. to be loosened or relaxed, like the limbs of the weary."

### John Calvin:
1. "Well-doing (ÎºÎ±Î»á½¸Î½) does not simply mean doing our duty, but the performance of acts of kindness."
2. "We are instructed not to be weary in assisting our neighbours... our warmth is abated by the coolness of other men."
3. "Let no man, from a wish to gather the fruit in this life, or before its proper time, deprive himself of the spiritual harvest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But let us not be weary (lose heart) in well doing. Not only in regard to the duty of liberality, but in every good work."
2. "In due season we shall reap, in the time of harvest."

1. "And let us not be weary in well doing... in doing which men should not be weary; nor are they, when their spiritual strength is renewed, and grace is in exercise..."
2. "For in due time we shall reap... either in this world, sooner or later; in proper time, in God's own time, by enjoying an increase of the fruits of righteousness..."
3. "If we faint not; but continue to the end, persevere constantly in doing acts of beneficence, and patiently wait... for there must be a distance of time between sowing and reaping; men must not expect to reap as soon as they sow..."
