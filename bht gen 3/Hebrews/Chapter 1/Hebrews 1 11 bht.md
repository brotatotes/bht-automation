## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They (the heavens) shall perish...but thou remainest."
2. "They all shall wax old as a garment... and as a mantle shalt thou fold them up."
3. "Thou art the same...and thy years shall not fail."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Perish" does not mean annihilation; just as it did not mean so in the case of "the world that being overflowed with water, perished" under Noah (2 Peter 3:6).
2. The covenant of the possession of the earth was renewed with Noah and his seed on the renovated earth. So it shall be after the perishing by fire.
3. "[You] remainest through all changes, as . . . a garment" (Isaiah 51:6).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea is, that though the heavens and earth should suddenly disappear, or though they should gradually wear out and become extinct, yet there is one infinite being who remains unaffected and unchanged."
2. "Let us not be alarmed then at any revolution. Let us not fear though we should see the heavens rolled up as a scroll, and the stars falling from their places. God, the Creator and the Redeemer, presides over all. He is unchanged. He ever lives."
3. "Can there be constant exhaustion, a constant burning like that, and yet no tendency to decay at some far distant period? Not unless the material for its splendor shall be supplied from the boundless resources of the Great Source of Light - God; and when he shall choose to withhold it, even that glorious sun must be dimmed of its splendor, and shine with enfeebled beams."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. They [Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î¹] . The heavens : not heaven and earth. 
Remainest [Î´Î¹Î±Î¼ÎµÎ½ÎµÎ¹Ï‚] . Note the present tense : not shalt remain. Permanency is the characteristic of God in the absolute and eternal present.


### Philip Schaff:
1. Hebrews 1:11. They all, i.e the heavens and the earth. The language and the imagery are taken largely from Isaiah 34:4; Isaiah 51:6.

### John Gill:
1. "They shall perish... the heavens and the earth... the present form and fashion of them shall pass away..." 
2. "But thou remainest; without any change or alteration... as a priest, he has an unchangeable priesthood, and ever lives to make intercession... his kingdom is an everlasting one, and of it there will be no end... he will be the everlasting light of his people." 
3. "They all shall wax old as doth a garment... the heavens, and the light thereof, are as a garment and a curtain... these, together with the earth, will in time come to their end of usefulness, in the present form of them."
