# Hebrews 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No angel has ever been given the honor to sit at God's right hand and have their enemies placed under their feet. Only Christ, as the ultimate fulfillment of Psalm 110, is deserving of this exalted position. The phrase sit thou signifies the authority and honor given to Christ as the Son of God, while footstool represents the complete subjugation of his enemies. This quotation from Psalm 110 is evidence of the Son's superiority to angels, establishing him as the Father's chief minister and vicegerent.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.

2. "Hardly any Psalm is so often quoted in the New Test. with reference to Christ, as Ps. cx. And no Psalm more clearly finds its ultimate reference and completion only in Christ."
3. "On the theocratic principle of interpretation, there is not the slightest difficulty in the application of the words directly to Him who is (and was ever regarded, even in Davidâ€™s time) Israelâ€™s King, the Head and Chief of the theocracy."

1. "This form of expression, as I have already said, means the same, as though it was said, that the second place was given him by the Father; for it is a metaphor which signifies that he is the Fatherâ€™s vicegerent and his chief minister in exercising authority, so that the Father rules through him. No one of the angels bears so honorable an office; hence Christ far excels all." 
2. "But the promise, that Christ shall never be thrust from his seat, takes away from us every fear; for ho will lay prostrate all his enemies."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This seventh quotation is proof of the Son's superiority as the Son of God (his deity) to angels."

3. "Till I make."

### John Gill:

2. "Yet this he said to his Son... for to him, the Messiah, are they spoken, and have had their fulfillment in him."
3. "And therefore he must be greater than the angels."

### John Wesley:
1.  Psalm 110:1.
