# Hebrews 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Angels, as ministering spirits, are sent forth for the sake of those who are about to inherit salvation. However, the Son of God is proven superior to these angels, as they worship and serve Him. While angels are sent on ministrations to God and Christ, they ultimately serve the purposes of those who will be saved. Their ministry is unseen, yet very real, as they aid and assist believers. The ministry of angels is a testament to God's provision for our well-being in both temporal and spiritual matters.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Are they not all (all the angels) ministering... spirits... sent forth for ministry... on behalf of those who are about to inherit salvation." 
2. "The ministry is not a waiting upon men, but a fulfilment of their office as ministers of God." 
3. "Thus the Son of God is proved superior to the angels‚Äîi.e. to the highest of created beings: who, so far from being equal with Him, worship Him, and serve His purposes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are incorporeal spirits, as God is, but ministering to Him as inferiors."
2. "Angels are sent forth on ministrations to God and Christ, not primarily to men, though for the good of 'those who are about to inherit salvation.'"
3. "So the superiority of the Son of God to angels is shown. They 'all,' however various their ranks, 'minister'; He is ministered to. They 'stand' before God, or are 'sent forth' to execute the divine commands on behalf of them whom He pleases to save; He 'sits on the right hand of the Majesty on high.' He rules; they serve."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are employed to render 'aid' or 'assistance' to others - to wit, to Christians. 'Sent forth.' Appointed by God for this. They are 'sent;' are under his control; are in a subordinate capacity."
2. "To me there seems to be a beautiful propriety in bringing 'aid' from another race, as 'ruin' came from another race; and that as those endowed with angelic might, though with fiendish malignity, ruined man, those with angelic might, but heavenly benevolence, should aid in his recovery and salvation."
3. "I know that they are unseen. They no longer appear as they once did to be the visible protectors and defenders of the people of God. But no small part of the aid which we receive from others comes from sources unseen by us. We owe more to unseen benefactors than to those whom we see, and the most grateful of all aid, perhaps, is what is furnished by a hand which we do not see, and from quarters which we cannot trace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Summing up the function of the angels as compared with Christ. Christ's is the highest dignity." 
2. "He is co-ruler with God."
3. "The angels are servants appointed for service to God for the sake of the heirs of redemption."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first word means the same, as though ale had said, that they were officials; but to minister imports what is more humble and abject." 
2. "The difference then is great; for what is natural to them is, as it were, adventitious or accidental to Christ, because he took our flesh; and what necessarily belongs to them, he of his own accord undertook."
3. "Well then has God provided for our infirmities by giving us such assistants to oppose Satan, and to put forth their power in every way to defend us!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The play upon the words ‚Äòministering spirits sent forth to minister‚Äô is not in the Greek. The original is simply ‚Äòministering spirits continually sent forth on (or for) service.‚Äô" 
2. "The worship and the work of angels is carried on in the great temple of nature and grace, and their service originates in the needs and claims of those who are soon to possess complete salvation."
3. "Of their ministry, for the benefit of all who believe, we have many examples under both Testaments. It is none the less real now that it is unseen."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word is made from ŒªŒµŒπœÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒπŒ± (Luke 1:23; Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:21)." 
2. "Sent forth repeatedly, from time to time as occasion requires." 
3. "We do not have here the doctrine of special guardian angels for each of us, but simply the fact that angels are used for our good."

### John Gill:
1. "Are they not all ministering spirits... and therefore must be inferior to the Son of God."
2. "The ministry of angels to... the heirs of salvation, lies in things temporal and spiritual."
3. "They are 'sent forth' to minister to them... according to the will of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ministering spirits, sent forth to men."
2. "To attend on them in numerous offices of protection, care, and kindness."
3. "Having patiently continued in welldoing, shall inherit everlasting salvation."
