## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "At the end of these days would mean, â€˜at the end of this age,â€™ in the technical sense of these words as signifying the whole world-period, the latter boundary of which is the Resurrection."
2. "We now pass off into a description of the dignity, and person, and work, of this Son of God: which description ends in asserting and proving Him to be higher than angels, the loftiest of created beings."
3. "He not only appointed the Son heir of all things, before the Creation; but He also made the worlds by Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The days of Messiah were the transition period or 'last part of these days,' the close of the existing dispensation, and beginning of the final dispensation of which Christ's second coming shall be the crowning consummation."
2. "His being made heir follows His sonship, and preceded His making the worlds."
3. "The promise to Abraham that he should be heir of the world had its fulfillment, and will have it still more fully, in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It might be a very long period, but it would be the 'last' one; and so far as the meaning of the phrase is concerned, it might be the longest period, or longer than all the others put together, but still it would be the 'last' one."
2. "We have what he spoke and caused to be recorded for our direction."
3. "Christ came to make [God] known as a merciful being, and to show how he could be merciful as well as just. The views given of God by the Lord Jesus are far more clear than any given by the ancient prophets; compared with those entertained by the ancient philosophers, they are like the sun compared with the darkest midnight."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The first period is the period of the old covenant; the second that of the new covenant."
2. "Christ attained the messianic lordship through incarnation."
3. "Christ is here represented as a mediate agency in creation."

### John Calvin:
1. "He also intimates that no good can be found apart from him, as he is the heir of all things. It hence follows that we must be very miserable and destitute of all good things except he supplies us with his treasures." 
2. "Nor is it any derogation to his power that he is said to have created the world, as though he did not by himself create it. According to the most usual mode of speaking in Scripture, the Father is called the Creator; and it is added in some places that the world was created by wisdom, by the word, by the Son, as though wisdom itself had been the creator, [or the word, or the Son.]"
3. "But the word heir is ascribed to Christ as manifested in the flesh... We hence only then begin to enjoy by right the good things of God, when Christ, the universal heir, admits to a union with himself; for he is an heir that he may endow us with his riches."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Old Testament slopes upward to Christ."
2. "The revelation was a son-revelation."
3. "The Son as Heir is also the Intermediate Agent in the work of creation."

### John Gill:
1. "the general design of this epistle is to show the superior excellency of the one [Gospel revelation] to the other [previous revelation]"
2. "the Messiah must be come; that the Mosaic economy, and Jewish worship, will never be restored again"
3. "the Gospel revelation being made in the last days, ought to be regarded the more, it being the last revelation God will ever make"

### John Wesley:
1. "Whom he hath appointed heir of all things."
2. "The Son is the firstborn, born before all things."
3. "Therefore the Son was before all worlds."
