He is the brightness of the Father's glory, the embodiment of God's nature and perfections.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Son of God now becomes Himself the subject."
2. "The Son of God is, in this his essential majesty, the expression, and the sole expression, of the divine Light."
3. "The Son of God before his Incarnation was over Creation: but after his work in the flesh he had become also Head of Creation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Who is so senseless as to doubt concerning the eternal being of the Son? For when has one seen light without effulgence?" 
2. "The Sun of God in glory beams, Too bright for us to scan; But we can face the light that streams For the mild Son of man." 
3. "Our nature, as guilt-laden, could not, without our great High Priest's blood of atonement sprinkling the heavenly mercy seat, come into immediate contact with God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was the embodied representation of the Deity. He was pure - like God. He was benevolent - like God. He spake to the winds and storms - like God. He healed diseases - like God."
2. "There are not two Gods - as there are not two suns when the sun shines. It is the one God, in a mysterious and incomprehensible manner shining into the world in the face of Jesus Christ."
3. "What a conception! That one simple command should do all this! So the world was made when God 'spake and it was done; he commanded and it stood fast;' Psalms 33:9.

### John Calvin:
1. "When, therefore, thou hear that the Son is the brightness of the Fatherâ€™s glory, think thus with thyself, that the glory of the Father is invisible until it shines forth in Christ, and that he is called the impress of his substance, because the majesty of the Father is hidden until it shows itself impressed as it were on his image."
2. "We are blind as to the light of God, until in Christ it beams on us."
3. "As, then, he ought to be loved on account of his redemption, so he ought to be adored on account of his royal magnificence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The express image, the impress or stamp wherein and whereby the divine essence is made manifest: and all this He is in His own nature, so the Greek implies."
2. "What higher honour can be given to our Lord? He is the glory the love and holiness of God made visible; the very essence, the nature of the Father in loving embodiment."
3. "Note that God not only acted in creating all things; He acts still in upholding them. A creation regulated by dead law alone is not Scripture teaching. And it is in and through Christ this is done."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The writer is using metaphors which had already been applied to Wisdom and the Logos."
2. "The meaning 'effulgence' suits the context better, though it gives the idea of eternal generation of the Son."
3. "Jesus is here pictured as King (Prophet and Priest also) Messiah seated at the right hand of God."
