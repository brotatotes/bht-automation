# Hebrews 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son of God is superior to the angels, as He always had Sonship, but obtained the name 'Son' in His incarnation. The manifestations of God through angels in the Old Testament did not bring personal union between man and God, as the manifestation of God in human flesh does. Jesus' name differs from that of the angels and he became superior to them, resuming his preincarnate dignity. By so much, Jesus is better and more excellent than the angels, being exalted above them to his mediatorial throne.
