## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thou (the seed of David, anointed in God‚Äôs counsels as king on his holy hill of Sion: see above) art my Son, I (emphatic: ‚ÄúI and no other:‚Äù expressed also in the Hebrew) this day have begotten thee."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ has a fourfold right to the title 'Son of God'; (1) By generation, as begotten of God; (2) By commission, as sent by God; (3) By resurrection, as 'the first-begotten of the dead'; (4) By actual possession, as heir of all." 
2. "The triumph of David over Hadadezer and neighboring kings is a type of God's ultimately subduing all enemies under His Son, whom He sets on His 'holy hill of Zion,' as King of the Jews and of the whole earth."
3. "'I the Everlasting Father have begotten Thee this day, that is, on this day, the day of Thy being manifested as My Son, 'the first-begotten of the dead'.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is treated and addressed as a Son. In his original existence this was so. In his incarnation this was so. When on earth this was so; and in his resurrection, ascension, and session at the right hand of God, he was treated in all respects 'as a Son' - as superior to all servants, and to all ministering spirits."
2. "The promise, therefore, which is here made is, that God would be to him, in a special sense, a Father, and he should be a Son. It does not, as I suppose, pertain originally exclusively to the Messiah, but included him as a descendant of David. To him it would be applicable in an eminent sense."
3. "That in this series of promises the 'Messiah' was included as a descendant of David, was the common opinion of the Jews, of the early Christians, and has been of the great body of interpreters."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The writer takes these passages as messianic, and applies them accordingly; and that we must distinguish between the doctrine and the method of argumentation peculiar to the time and people."
2. "In the O. T. son is applied to angels collectively, but never individually."
3. "This official installation appears to have its N. T. counterpart in the resurrection of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the same reason David was called the son of God, having been especially chosen to perform great things; but his glory was hardly a spark, even the smallest, to that glory which shone forth in Christ, on whom the Father has imprinted his own image."
2. "The sacraments, though in themselves lifeless, are yet honored with titles which angels cannot claim without being guilty of sacrilege. It is hence evident that the argument derived from the term Son, is well grounded."
3. "Christ doubtless is the eternal Son of God, for he is wisdom, born before time; but this has no connection with this passage, in which respect is had to men, by whom Christ was acknowledged to be the Son of God after the Father had manifested him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "My Son art thou, today have I begotten thee. These words have been referred to the incarnation, when the ‚Äòholy thing‚Äô born of the Virgin was called Son of God (Luke 1:35); or to His resurrection and exaltation, when He is marked out as Son of God in regal dignity, ‚Äòin power‚Äô as Messianic King (Romans 1:4)." 
2. "Others refer the words to the essential nature of our Lord, as Son of the Father by ‚Äòeternal generation,‚Äô as it is called. God sent the Son, it is said, and so He had dignity before His incarnation and before His resurrection." 
3. "The fact is, the word Son describes His relation to the Father, both personal and official; and ‚ÄòI have begotten thee‚Äô applies to every state to which the word ‚ÄòSon‚Äô applies His original nature, His incarnation, and His kingship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To which (Œ§ŒπŒΩ). 'To which individual angel.' As a class angels are called sons of God (Elohim) (Psalms 29:1), but no single angel is called God's Son like the Messiah in Psalms 2:7." 
2. "Dods takes 'have I begotten thee' (Œ≥ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ∑Œ∫Œ± œÉŒµ, perfect active indicative of Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ±œâ) to refer to the resurrection and ascension while others refer it to the incarnation."
3. "This quotation is from 2 Samuel 7:14. Note the use of ŒµŒπœÇ in the predicate with the sense of 'as' like the Hebrew (LXX idiom), not preserved in the English."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the Son of God, not by Creation, nor by adoption, nor by office, but by nature; he is the true, proper, natural, and eternal Son of God."
2. "The foundation of which relation lies in the begetting of him; which refers not to his nature, either divine or human, but to his divine person."
3. "The date of it, today, designs eternity, which is one continued day, an everlasting now; and this may be applied to any time and case, in which Christ is declared to be the Son of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou art my Son ‚Äî God of God, Light of Light."
2. "This day have I begotten thee ‚Äî I have begotten thee from eternity, which, by its unalterable permanency of duration, is one continued, unsuccessive day."
3. "I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son ‚Äî I will own myself to be his Father, and him to be my Son, by eminent tokens of my peculiar love."
