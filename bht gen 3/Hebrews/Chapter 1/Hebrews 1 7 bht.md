# Hebrews 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's messengers, the angels, are compared to winds and flames of fire, symbolizing their role in carrying out His purposes swiftly and with burning devotion. However, these angelic beings are creatures, subject to change, in contrast to the Son who is the unchanging Creator. While the angels faithfully serve as ministering spirits, they are not equal to the Son, who holds a supreme and eternal position. The imagery of winds and fire highlights the power and obedience of the angels, highlighting their unique function within God's plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He makes his messengers winds, i.e. He causes his messengers to act in or by means of the winds; his servants flames of fire, i.e. commissions them to assume the agency or form of flames for His purposes."
2. "Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: and the rod (i. e. sceptre: see especially Esth. iv. 11; Amos i. 5, where the same Hebrew word occurs) of thy kingdom is the rod of straightness (i. e. righteousness, justice)."
3. "Thou lovedst (the Writer refers the words to the whole life of our Lord on earth, as a past period) righteousness, and hatedst iniquity; for this cause (because of His love of righteousness and hatred of iniquity, shewn by his blameless life and perfect obedience on earth) God (some render this first, 'O God,' but apparently without necessity), thy God, anointed thee (how? and when? We must distinguish this anointing from what is said in Acts x. 38, 'God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit, and with power,' and the anointing of Isa. lxi. 1. For it is a consequent upon the righteous course of the Son of God in his Humanity, and therefore belongs to his triumph, in which He is exalted above his fellows [see below]. Again, the 'oil of gladness' below seems rather to point to a festive and triumphant, than to an inaugurative unction. We should therefore rather take the allusion to be, as in Ps. xxiii. 5; xcii. 10, to the custom of anointing guests at feasts: so that, as the King in the Psalm is anointed with the oil of rejoicing above his fellows, because of his having loved righteousness and hated iniquity, so Christ, in the jubilant celebration of His finished course at his exaltation in heaven, is anointed with the festive oil above His fellows [see below]."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Who employeth His angels as the winds, His ministers as the lightnings; or, He maketh His angelic ministers the directing powers of winds and flames, when these latter are required to perform His will." 
2. "As 'spirits' implies the wind-like velocity and subtle nature of the cherubim, so 'flame of fire' expresses the burning devotion and intense all-consuming zeal of the adoring seraphim."
3. "'Maketh' implies that, however exalted, they are but creatures, whereas the Son is the Creator."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are mere ministers, and have not ascribed to them the name of 'Son.' They have a name which implies a more humble rank and office - the name 'spirit,' and the appellation of a 'flame of fire.' They obey his will as the winds and the lightnings do."
2. "The passage 'might' be translated, 'Who maketh his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire;' that is, 'who makes his angels like the winds, or as swift as the winds, and his ministers as rapid, as terrible, and as resistless as the lightning.'"
3. "The attending retinue of God, when he manifests himself with great power and glory, is like the winds and the lightning. His angels are like them. They are prompt to do his will - rapid, quick, obedient in his service; they are in all respects subordinate to him, and occupy, as the winds and the lightnings do, the place of servants."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The emphasis, therefore, is not on the fact that the angels are merely servants, but that their being is such that they are only what God makes them according to the needs of their service, and are, therefore, changeable, in contrast with the Son, who is ruler and unchangeable."
2. "The Rabbis conceived the angels as perishable."
3. "Day by day the angels of service are created out of the fire stream, and sing a song, and disappear, as is said in Lamentations 3:23, 'they are new every morning.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "But it seems preferable to me to consider this testimony is brought forward for this purpose, that it might by a similitude be applied to angels, and in this way David compares winds to angels, because they perform offices in this world similar to what the angels do in heaven." 
2. "Hence I think that the argument is one of likeness or similarity when the Apostle transfers to angels what properly applies to the winds."
3. "The meaning would be thus more apparent, â€” 'Who maketh like his angels the winds, and like his ministers the flaming fire,' that is, the winds are subject to him as the angels are, and also the flaming fire as his ministers or attendants."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As to angels, moreover, they were made by Him (not begotten). They are spirits, not sons; and His servants or ministers, a â€˜flame of fire.â€™" 
2. "They do His will, as do the tempest and the lightning." 
3. "The angels are expressly called â€˜ministering spiritsâ€™ a name that recalls both the names given in Hebrews 1:7, spirits and ministers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The meaning apparently is one that can reduce angels to the elemental forces of wind and fire (Moffatt)."
2. "Preachers also are sometimes like a wind-storm or a fire."
3. "That is all true, but that is not the point of this passage."

### John Gill:
1. "They are 'spirits', created ones, and so differ from God the Creator: they are incorporeal ones, and so differ from men; they are immaterial, and so die not; they are spiritual substances subsisting in themselves."
2. "And they are ministers to Christ; they attended at his incarnation: were solicitous for his preservation, ministered to him in distress, assisted at his resurrection, and accompanied him in his ascension, and will be with him at his second coming."
3. "Angels sometimes appear in fiery forms; the chariots and horses of fire, by which Elijah was carried up to heaven, were no other than angels, in such forms."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who maketh his angels... they are only creatures, whereas the Son is eternal, Hebrews 1:8; and the Creator himself, Hebrews 1:10."
2. "Spirits and a flame of fire... intimates not only their office, but also their nature; which is excellent indeed, the metaphor being taken from the most swift, subtle, and efficacious things on earth; but nevertheless infinitely below the majesty of the Son."
3. "They are creatures; the Son is the Creator."
