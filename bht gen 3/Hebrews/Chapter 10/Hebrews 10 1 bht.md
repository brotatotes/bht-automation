# Hebrews 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law, acting as a mere shadow, could not bring about perfection for the worshippers. With the repetition of the same sacrifices, the law revealed its own inability to reach completion. Its purpose was to give a dim outline of the good things to come, while realizing that those heavenly verities would be fulfilled by Christ. Year after year, the lawâ€™s sacrifices testified to their incapacity to make the worshippers perfect. It is clear that the law was just a fading shadow compared to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.

3. "Now, though the Papists should cry out a thousand times that the sacrifice which Christ once offered is the same with, and not different from what they make daily, I shall still always contend, according to the express words of the Apostle, that since the offerings of Christ availed to pacify God, not only an end was put to former sacrifices, but that it is also impious to repeat the sacrifice."

1. "For the law having a shadow of good things to come... the ceremonial law is intended; this was a 'shadow', a figure, a representation of something true, real, and substantial; was dark and obscure... and was like a shadow, fleeting and transitory..." (70 words)

(66 words)

3. "How is it possible, that any who consider this should suppose the attainments of David, or any who were under that dispensation, to be the proper measure of gospel holiness; and that Christian experience is to rise no higher than Jewish?"

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The law, with its shadowy representation of the good things to come, could never perfect the worshippers. Year after year, the repetition of the same sacrifices testified to its inability to bring about true perfection. This was because the law could only give a dim outline of the heavenly verities that Christ would later fulfill. The law was a continual process of acted prophecy, proving that its counterparts should comeâ€”a truth exemplified by the yearly day of atonement. The sacrifices of the law were but a mere shadow of the sacrifice that Christ would offer. Therefore, we can understand that the sacrifices of the law, with their ever-recurring cycle, could never make those who draw near to God perfect.
