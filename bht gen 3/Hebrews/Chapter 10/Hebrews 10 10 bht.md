# Hebrews 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is no real difference between the will of God to redeem us by the sufferings and death of Christ and the will of God as fulfilled by Christâ€™s obedience. It is through the Blood of Christ that we are reconciled to God, but it is through the offering of His Body that we are made holy. This pertains to our acceptance as acquitted from sin as well as our perfection in holiness through union with Christ and participation in His Spirit. Christ's offering of Himself has sanctified us once for all and permanently.
