# Hebrews 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Under the Old Covenant, the priests continuously stood and offered daily sacrifices, which, though producing a sense of forgiveness, could not completely remove guilt. In stark contrast, Christ, our exalted Savior, sat down at the right hand of God after offering himself as the one perfect sacrifice. This single offering, once for all, strips off our guilt entirely. The wearisome repetition of the same sacrifices by the priests highlights their insufficiency, while Christ's sacrifice stands as the ultimate and complete atonement for our sins.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And‚Äîa new point of contrast; the frequent repetition of the sacrifices."
2. "standeth‚Äîthe attitude of one ministering; in contrast to 'sat down on the right hand of God,' Hebrews 10:12, said of Christ; the posture of one being ministered to as a king."
3. "Legal sacrifices might, in part, produce the sense of forgiveness, yet scarcely even that (see on Hebrews 10:1); but entirely to strip off one's guilt they never could."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And every priest standeth daily ministering - That is, this is done every day."
2. "The object of the apostle is to prove that under the Jewish economy sacrifices were repeated constantly, showing their imperfection, but that under the Christian economy the great sacrifice had been offered once, which was sufficient for all."
3. "And offering oftentimes the same sacrifices - The same sacrifices were offered morning and evening every day."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Servile attitude, contrasted with that of the exalted Savior."
2. "The wearisome round of daily offerings, always the same, contrasted with the one offering, once for all."
3. "The verb literally means to strip off all round."

### John Calvin:
1. "He has hitherto labored enough, and more than enough, in defending the priesthood of Christ; the conclusion then is, that the ancient priesthood, which is inconsistent with this, has ceased."
2. "By saying, them who are sanctified, he includes all the children of God; and he reminds us that the grace of sanctification is sought elsewhere in vain."
3. "If then our faith seeks Christ sitting on God‚Äôs right hand, and recumbs quietly on him as there sitting, we shall at length enjoy the fruit of his victory; yea, when our foes, Satan, sin, death, and the whole world are vanquished, and when corruption of our flesh is cast off, we shall triumph for ever together with our head."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Standeth (ŒµœÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ). Perfect active indicative of ŒπœÉœÑŒ∑Œº (intransitive), vivid picture."
2. "Ministering and offering (ŒªŒµŒπœÑŒøœÖœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ Œ∫Œ± œÄœÅŒøœÉœÜŒµœÅœâŒΩ). Present active participles graphically describing the priest."
3. "Take away (œÄŒµœÅŒπŒµŒªŒµŒπŒΩ). Second aorist active infinitive of œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœâ, old verb to take from around, to remove utterly as in Acts 27:20."

### John Gill:
1. "Every priest standeth daily ministering... The apostle passes from the anniversary sacrifices offered by the high priest on the day of atonement, having shown the insufficiency and imperfection of them, to the lambs of the daily sacrifice."
2. "When he says 'every priest', it supposes there were more than one... and everyone of them 'standeth' at the altar, showing that his work was not done."
3. "And offering oftentimes the same sacrifices... this frequent offering, and the offering of the same things, show that they were such which can never take away sins."

### John Wesley:
1. Every priest standeth ‚Äî As a servant in an humble posture.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Under the Old Covenant, the priests were constantly standing, ministering, and offering sacrifices. However, these repeated sacrifices could never completely remove the guilt and bring true forgiveness. In contrast, Christ, our exalted Savior, sat down at the right hand of God after offering himself as the one perfect sacrifice. His sacrifice, offered once for all, is sufficient to completely strip off our guilt and provide everlasting forgiveness. As believers, we find our sanctification in Christ alone, and by placing our faith in him, we can rest in his victory and triumph over sin, Satan, and death. The continuous standing and offering of the priests highlight the insufficiency of their work, and the repetition of the same sacrifices emphasizes their inability to take away sins. Indeed, the ancient priesthood has ceased, and now we solely rely on the priesthood of Christ, who ministered and offered himself as the Lamb of God.
