# Hebrews 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son waits, invisibly reigning, for the moment when the Father will send Him to triumph over His foes. His expectant attitude reflects His certainty of final victory, as seen in John 16:33 and 1 Corinthians 15:24-28. This victory will be fully realized in His second advent, after which He will subject Himself to the Father as the Head of the Church. His waiting is not passive; it is an active anticipation of the subjection of His enemies as promised in Psalm 110:1.
