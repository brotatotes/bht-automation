## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here again the writer adds 'their iniquities' (œÑœâŒΩ Œ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒπœâŒΩ) to 'sins' of Hebrews 8:12." 
2. "It is uncertain also whether the writer means verse Hebrews 10:17 to be the principal clause with Hebrews 10:15; Hebrews 10:16 as subordinate or the whole quotation to be subordinate to ŒºŒµœÑŒ± œÑŒø ŒµŒπœÅŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩŒ± of verse Hebrews 10:15 with anacoluthon in verse Hebrews 10:18." 
3. "At any rate verse Hebrews 10:17 in the quotation does not follow immediately after verse Hebrews 10:16 as one can see in Hebrews 8:10-12 (skipping part of Hebrews 8:10 and all of Hebrews 8:11)."

### John Gill:
1. "The principal thing for which they are cited here, is to observe God's promise of non-remembrance of sin." 
2. "Which is no other than remission of sin, and which is not consistent with legal sacrifices."
