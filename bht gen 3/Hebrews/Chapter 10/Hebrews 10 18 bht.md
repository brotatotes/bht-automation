# Hebrews 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the new covenant, forgiveness of sins is the defining characteristic, leaving no need for further offerings. Christ's one high-priestly self-sacrifice, offered through the eternal Spirit, is of everlasting power, making the repetitive sacrifices of the Levitical priesthood unnecessary. Through His sacrifice, we have both present possession and future completion of salvation, as certain as His reign as Priest and King. There is no longer a place for the Levitical sacrifices under the new covenant, for Christ's sacrifice is complete and triumphant.
