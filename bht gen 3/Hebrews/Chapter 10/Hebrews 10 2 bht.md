# Hebrews 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the sacrifices of the law truly perfected the worshippers, they would have ceased to be offered. The repetition of sacrifices revealed their inadequacy in fully cleansing the soul from sin. The constant offering of sacrifices reminded the worshippers of their sins, burdening their conscience. However, if once purified, they would no longer have any consciousness of guilt. Only through the blood of Christ can one be discharged from the guilt of sin and find peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "(if it were so, if the law were able to perfect the worshippers) would they (the same sacrifices) not have ceased being offered." 
2. "on account of the worshippers (the servers in the service of the tabernacle, used here in a wide sense, including priests and people) having no longer any conscience of sins (guilt of sin on the conscience, consciousness of the guilt of sin)."
3. "if once (for all) purified."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The very fact that they were repeated showed that there was some deficiency in them as to the matter of cleansing the soul from sin."
2. "If their sacrifices had so availed as to remove their past sins, and to procure forgiveness, they would have had no more trouble of conscience on account of them."
3. "The remembrance of it will humble him; it will serve to exalt his conceptions of the mercy of God and the glory of the atonement, but it will no longer overwhelm the mind with the dread of hell."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To be offered [œÄœÅŒøœÉœÜŒµœÅŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒ±Œπ] . The present participle brings out more forcibly the continuous repetition : "Ceased being offered."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Else would they these same sacrifices not have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers both priests and people would have had no longer any conscience any consciousness of the guilt of sin being once for all completely purified?"
2. "The whole clause is best treated as a question, as is clear from the next verse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Elipsis of condition after ŒµœÄŒµ (since if they really did perfect) with the conclusion of the second-class condition (Œ±ŒΩ and the aorist middle indicative of œÄŒ±œÖŒøŒºŒ±)." 
2. "Regular idiom, participle (present passive) with œÄŒ±œÖŒøŒºŒ± (Acts 5:42)." 
3. "Rather 'consciousness of sins' as in Hebrews 9:14."

### John Gill:
1. "If perfection had been by the legal sacrifices, they would have ceased to have been offered..."
2. "Because the worshippers, once purged, would have had no more conscience of sins..."
3. "...they are discharged from the guilt of sin, and are not liable to condemnation for it; and through the application of the blood of Christ to them, have peace with God, and joy in the Holy Ghost."

### John Wesley:
1. They who had been once perfectly purged, would have been no longer conscious either of the guilt or power of their sins.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: If the sacrifices under the law were truly sufficient in purifying the worshippers from sin, then there would have been no need for them to be continually offered. The fact that these sacrifices were repeated revealed their inadequacy in fully cleansing the soul. The repetition of these sacrifices only served to remind the worshippers of their sins and maintain a troubled conscience. However, if the sacrifices had truly cleansed them once for all, their consciousness of guilt would have been completely removed. Only through the blood of Christ can one be discharged from the guilt of sin and find peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
