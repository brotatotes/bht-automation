# Hebrews 10:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us approach God with a true heart and full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. This true heart is one without hypocrisy, thoroughly imbued with the truth. Through the shedding of Christ's blood, our consciences are cleansed from guilt, and we are once and for all washed in body and soul. This purification is required to enter the true sanctuary, and it is through faith that we experience the effects of Christ's sacrifice ‚Äî pardon, moral renewal, and deliverance.

3. "What follows, our bodies washed with pure water, is generally understood of baptism; but it seems to me more probable that the Apostle alludes to the ancient ceremonies of the Law; and so by water he designates the Spirit of God, according to what is said by Ezekiel, 'I will sprinkle clean water upon you.'"

3.

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "To 'draw near' to him is a sacerdotal act, common to all the saints, who are made priests to God; and includes the whole of divine worship, but more especially designs prayer." 
2. "A full assurance of faith, with respect to the object drawn nigh unto, and of the way unto him, and of acceptance with him through Christ, and of having the petitions put up to him granted, is very comfortable to believers, greatly becomes them, and is well pleasing to God."
