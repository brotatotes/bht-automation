# Hebrews 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we willingly sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is no longer left remaining a sacrifice for sins. For there is no more sacrifice for sins which could save us if we reject the one sacrifice made for sin. After men have embraced and professed the truths of the Gospel, yet against all evidence, they wilfully deny this truth and obstinately persist in the denial of it. There is no more, no other sacrifice for sin, no other Saviour, nor any salvation in any other way, the case of these men must be desperate; there is no help for them, nor hope of them.

### Henry Alford:
1. "If we willingly sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is no longer left remaining a sacrifice for sins." 
2. "He has in fact, as Delitzsch observes, shut the door of repentance behind him, by the very fact of his being in an abiding state of willing sin." 
3. "It is the fire of God‚Äôs presence, identified with Himself exactly as in ch. xii, 29: and it is the zeal, the fervour, the excandescence of this consuming fire, which awaits the apostate from Christ."
