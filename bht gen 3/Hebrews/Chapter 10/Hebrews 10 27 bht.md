## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The indefiniteness, as of something peculiar of its kind, makes the description the more terrible."
2. "The transition is easy from 'giving a reception to' something or someone, to 'looking for'."
3. "Fire is personified: glow or ardor of fire, that is, of Him who is 'a consuming fire'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If there was voluntary apostasy after having embraced the Christian religion, there could be nothing but an expectation of the judgment to come."
2. "The 'fearful apprehension' or expectation here does not refer so much to what would be in the mind itself, or what would be experienced, as to what must follow."
3. "Fire is often used in the Scriptures as an emblem of fierce punishment. The idea is, that the person referred to could expect nothing but the wrath of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "a kind of fearful expectation."
2. "Fiery indignation."
3. "The adversaries."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means the torment of an evil conscience which the ungodly feel, who not only have no grace, but who also know that having tasted grace they have lost it forever through their own fault... they war rebelliously against God, for they cannot endure so strict a Judge." 
2. "They indeed try in every way to remove the sense of God’s wrath, but all in vain; for when God allows them a short respite, he soon draws them before his tribunal, and harasses them with the torments which they especially shun."
3. "He reminds us, that they are all to be counted the enemies of Christ who have refused to hold the place granted them among the faithful; for there is no intermediate state, as they who depart from the Church give themselves up to Satan."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only thing left is a fearful award, an awful reservation, of judgment and fiery indignation."
2. "The word ‘reservation,’ ‘award,’ is found only here in the New Testament, though the verb is not infrequent."
3. "It describes not what is expected, but what will certainly be, and in truth what is already in reserve ‘a reception of judgment.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Expectation (εκδοχη). Usually reception or interpretation from εκδεχομα (Hebrews 11:10), only here in N.T. and in unusual sense like προσδοκια, like απεκδεχομα (Romans 8:19; Romans 8:23; Romans 8:25), this sense apparently "coined by the writer" (Moffatt) from his use of εκδεχομα in Hebrews 10:13."
2. "A fierceness of fire (πυρος ζηλος). An anger (zeal, jealousy) marked (genitive) by fire. Language kin to that in Isaiah 26:11; Zephaniah 1:19; Psalms 79:5. See also 2 Thessalonians 1:8-10 for a like picture of destined doom."
3. "Devour (εσθιειν). "To eat" (figuratively), present active infinitive. The adversaries (τους υπεναντιους). Old double compound adjective (υπο, εν, αντιος), in N.T. only here and Colossians 2:14. Those directly opposite."

### John Gill:
1. "Now there is in this life an expectation in men of a future judgment, and in wicked men it is a fearful one; it is dreaded by them, and more especially in such men before described, when their consciences are awakened; it is a very dreadful one, inexpressibly so."
2. "Perhaps some fiery judgment, expressive of the wrath and indignation of God, such as befell Sodom and Gomorrah, the two sons of Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and the men that rose up with Korah against Moses and Aaron."
3. "The fire of hell, which is not corporeal and material, but is the wrath of God let down into the conscience; which shows the vile nature of sin, the strictness of God's justice, and the intolerableness of future punishment."
