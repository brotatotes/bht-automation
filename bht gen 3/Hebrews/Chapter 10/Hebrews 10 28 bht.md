# Hebrews 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If one could face the doom of death for violating Moses' law, how much more deserving of punishment is the one who fully disregards the gospel? Apostasy, the utter violation of the old covenant, equates to a complete denial of Christ. Just as transgressors under the law died without mercy, those who renounce Christ find no provision for pardon. The severity of judgment without mercy is highlighted by the principle of multiple witnesses from the law.
