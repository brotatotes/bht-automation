# Hebrews 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Old Testament sacrifices were constant reminders of sins, failing to fully satisfy the conscience. Each sacrifice acknowledged guilt and brought sins to mind. However, the Gospel provides complete remission of sins, so that they are remembered no more by God. It is crucial not to forget this once-for-all purgation and to cease fearing past sins. The sacrifices of old were insufficient for easing the conscience, but the sacrifice of Christ brings genuine and lasting atonement.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Which cessation is far from being the case, as is the having no more conscience of sin."
2. "But (on the contrary, opposes the whole question of ver. 2, in both its clauses) in them (the sacrifices: not in the fact of their being offered, but in the course of their being offered on the day of atonement, see below) there is a recollection."
3. "Where sins are continually called to mind, there clearly the conscience is not clear from them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Contrast: a remembranceâ€”a recalling to mind by the high priest's confession, on the day of atonement, of the sins both of each past year and of all former years, proving that the expiatory sacrifices of former years were not felt by men's consciences to have fully atoned for former sins in fact, the expiation and remission were only legal and typical."
2. "The Gospel remission, on the contrary, is so complete, that sins are 'remembered no more' by God."
3. "It is unbelief to 'forget' this once-for-all purgation, and to fear on account of 'former sins'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As often as a sacrifice was offered, it was an acknowledgment of guilt on the part of those for whom it was made."
2. "All the efficacy which could be pretended to belong to those sacrifices, was that they made expiation for the past year."
3. "These sacrifices, therefore, could not make the atonement which man needed. They could not make the conscience easy; they could not be regarded as a sufficient expiation for the time to come."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Each successive sacrifice was a fresh reminder of sins to be atoned for; so far were the sacrifices from satisfying the conscience of the worshipper."
2. "A remembrance of sins... a calling to mind."
3. "The sacrifices were far from satisfying the conscience of the worshipper."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the Gospel is a message of reconciliation with God, yet it is necessary that we should daily remember our sins..."
2. "It is not, then, any kind of remembrance that is here meant, but that which might lead to such a confession of guilt before God..."
3. "With whatever masks, then, they may cover their mass, they can never escape the charge of an atrocious blasphemy against Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is in those sacrifices a remembrance made... of sins year by year." 
2. "A recalling to mind, on the part of the worshipers and on God's part."
3. "A remembrance made... on God's part of sins year by year."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  A remembrance (Î±Î½Î±Î¼Î½Î·ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚). A reminder. Old word from Î±Î½Î±Î¼Î¹Î¼Î½Î·ÏƒÎºÏ‰, to remind, as in Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:24. 


### John Gill:
1. "There is a remembrance of sins made again every year; of all the sins that were committed the year past, and even of those that were expiated typically by the daily sacrifice."
2. "These sacrifices were so far from inducing an oblivion of sins, that they themselves brought them to remembrance, and were so many acknowledgments of them."
3. "Legal sacrifices were...a remembrance of sins...and were so many acknowledgments of them." 

### John Wesley:
1. There is a public commemoration of the sins both of the last and of all the preceding years; a clear proof that the guilt thereof is not perfectly purged away.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The sacrifices of the Old Testament were not able to provide a complete and lasting purification from sin. Instead, they served as reminders of sin, continually calling to mind the need for atonement. Each sacrifice served as a fresh acknowledgment of guilt and a reminder of the sins that needed to be covered. These sacrifices were incapable of truly satisfying the conscience of the worshipper. In contrast, the Gospel offers a complete remission of sins, to the point that they are remembered no more by God. It is unbelief to forget this once-for-all purgation and to fear on account of former sins. The sacrifices of old were not enough to make the conscience easy, but the sacrifice of Christ provides true and lasting atonement.
