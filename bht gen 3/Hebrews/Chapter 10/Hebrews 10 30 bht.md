### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Vengeance belongeth unto meâ€”Greek, 'To Me belongeth vengeance': exactly according with Paul's quotation."
2. "Lord shall judge his peopleâ€”in grace, or else anger, according as each deserves."
3. "Here, 'judge,' so as to punish the reprobate apostate; there, 'judge,' so as to interpose in behalf of, and save His people."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Vengeance belongeth unto me ... - This is found in Deuteronomy 32:35; see it explained in the notes on Romans 12:19. It is there quoted to show that we should not avenge ourselves; it is here quoted to show that God will certainly inflict punishment on those who deserve it."
2. "If any should apostatize in the manner here referred to by the apostle, they would, says he, be guilty of great and unparalleled wickedness, and would have the certainty that they must meet the wrath of God."
3. "The mere fact that they are his people will not save them from punishment if they deserve it, any more than the fact that one is a beloved child will save him from correction when he does wrong."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The retribution is certain, because assured by the word of God in Scripture."
2. "Vengeance... conveys the idea of vindictiveness which does not reside in the Greek word. It is the full meting out of justice to all parties."

### John Calvin:
1. "We may always conclude from his words that it is the peculiar office of God to take vengeance on the ungodly. Nor does he pervert his testimony who hence proves that the contempt of God will not be unpunished; for he is a righteous judge who claims to himself the office of taking vengeance." 
2. "God cannot govern the Church without purifying it, and without restoring to order the confusion that may be in it. Therefore this governing ought justly to be dreaded by hypocrites, who will then be punished for usurping a place among the faithful, and for perfidiously using the sacred name of God, when the master of the family undertakes himself the care of setting in order his own house." 
3. "Whenever our flesh allures us or we flatter ourselves by any means in our sins, this admonition alone ought to be sufficient to arouse us, that 'it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God;' for his wrath is furnished with dreadful punishments which are to be forever."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God is the God of justice."
2. "He is patient, but he will punish."
3. "God lives and is true to his word."

### John Gill:
1. "Vengeance belongs to God, not as to the affection, as if there was any such passion in him; but as to the effect, there being that produced by him, which answers to the effect of such a passion among men, namely punishment."
2. "Punishment for sin belongs to God, against whom it is committed; and not to Heathen deities, one of which goes by the name of Vengeance, Acts 28:4 nor to Satan, and his spiteful angels; nor to men, to exercise it in a private and personal way."
3. "The Lord shall judge his people; such as are truly so, his chosen and covenant people, his redeemed and called ones; these he judges by chastising them in a fatherly way, that they may not be condemned with the world; and by governing and protecting them; and by vindicating and pleading their cause, and avenging them on their enemies."

### John Wesley:
1. The Lord will judge his people â€” Yea, far more rigorously than the heathens, if they rebel against him. Deuteronomy 32:35, etc.
