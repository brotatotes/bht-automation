# Hebrews 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blood of bulls and goats in the Old Testament sacrifices could not take away sin as they lacked the power for complete vicarious propitiation. These sacrifices were only exhibitions and reminders of the need for a true Propitiation, pointing to the hope of coming redemption promised by God. The blood of animals did not possess the efficacy to cleanse souls or weigh against the guilt of a nation, but what these creatures could not do, the blood of Christ has done by completely removing sin from the sight of justice and the consciences of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "It was shed, as Ebrard well observes, not as the instrument of complete vicarious propitiation, but as an exhibition of the postulate of vicarious propitiation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The blood of bulls...sacrificed, had power but it was only in virtue of the power of the one real antitypical sacrifice of Christ; they had no power in themselves; they were not the instrument of perfect vicarious atonement, but an exhibition of the need of it, suggesting to the faithful Israelite the sure hope of coming redemption, according to God's promise."
2. "The blood of beasts could not take away the sin of man. A MAN must do that."
3. "The Greek, 'take away utterly.' The blood of beasts could not take away the sin of man."
