# Hebrews 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God expressed no pleasure in the animal offerings, the meal offerings, the burnt offerings, or the sin offerings of the Old Testament. Although these offerings were acts of obedience, they lacked the inherent ability to serve as atonement for sin. They were not capable of fulfilling God's purpose as Christ's sacrifice did through His obedience unto death. These offerings were only pleasing to God insofar as they symbolized and had regard for the sacrifice of His Son.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: God did not find pleasure in the animal offerings, the meal offerings, the burnt offerings, or the sin offerings of the Old Testament. These offerings, while acts of obedience to God's command, were not sufficient to atone for sin. They lacked the intrinsic efficacy that Christ's sacrifice had. God's pleasure was not in these offerings, but in the obedience they represented. They could not take the place of Christ's obedience unto death, which was the only way to fulfill God's purpose. These offerings were only pleasing to God insofar as they symbolized and pointed to the sacrifice of His Son.

- Attempt 4 BHT: God did not find pleasure in the animal offerings‚Äîspecifically, the whole burnt offerings, the meal offerings, the burnt offerings, or the sin offerings‚Äîof the Old Testament. These offerings, though obedient acts, were unable to atone for sin on their own. God's approval of them was limited to their representation of obedience to His commands, but their efficacy paled in comparison to the sacrifice of Christ. It was only in their connection to His ultimate sacrifice that these offerings found favor in God's sight.
