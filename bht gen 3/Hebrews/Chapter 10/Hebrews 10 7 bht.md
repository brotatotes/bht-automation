## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here we have the creed, as it were, of Jesus: 'I am come to fulfill the law,' to preach, to call sinners to repentance, to send a sword and to set men at variance, I came down from heaven to do the will of Him that sent me, I am sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, I am come into this world for judgment, I am come that they might have life, and might have it more abundantly, to save what had been lost, to seek and to save that which was lost, to save men's lives, to send fire on the earth, to minister, as 'the Light,' to bear witness unto the truth." 
2. "See, reader, that thy Saviour obtain what He aimed at in thy case. Moreover, do thou for thy part say, why thou art come here? Dost thou, then, also, do the will of God? From what time? and in what way?"
3. "'By this very passage 'written of Me,' I undertake to do Thy will [namely, that I should die for the sins of the world, in order that all who believe may be saved, not by animal sacrifices, but by My death].' This is the written contract of Messiah...whereby He engaged to be our surety. So complete is the inspiration of all that is written, so great the authority of the Psalms, that what David says is really what Christ then and there said."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not easy to see how this could be applied to David in any circumstance of his life... The time here referred to by the word 'then' is when it was manifest that sacrifices and offerings for sin would not answer all the purposes desirable, or when in view of that fact the purpose of the Redeemer is conceived as formed to enter upon a work which would effect what they could not."
2. "But what volume is here intended? And where is that written which is here referred to? If David was the author of the Psalm from which this is quoted Psalms 40:0, then the book or volume which was then in existence must have been principally, if not entirely, the five books of Moses..."
3. "The whole language of the institution of sacrifices, and of the Mosaic economy, was, that a Saviour would hereafter come to do the will of God in making an atonement for the sin of the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the volume of the book." 
2. "The extremity or end, as the capital of a column."
3. "A roll of parchment, a book - roll."

### John Calvin:
1. "He deemed himself to be in the catalogue of those who render themselves obedient to God."
2. "He testifies that he obeyed his vocation, by adding, I come to do thy will; and this peculiarly belongs to Christ."
3. "Christ is a pattern of perfect obedience for this end, that all who are his may contend with one another in imitating him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To do the will of God is to obey His commands, and especially in this context the command to lay down His life."
2. "That He might render this obedience a body was prepared for Him, and a nature capable of those sufferings both in heart and in life which were necessary to expiate sin, and fulfil the one righteousness whereby many were to be made righteous."
3. "This was, indeed, the chief design of His coming."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Messiah is represented as offering himself to do God's will."
2. "In the roll of the book it is written of me."
3. "Here it refers 'to the O.T. as a prediction of Christ's higher sacrifice' (Moffatt)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ observing that legal sacrifices were not acceptable to God; that there was a body prepared for him; and that it was written of him in the book of God, that he should come; and the time being now come, with a note of attention and admiration, he cheerfully expresses his readiness to come, immediately, without any compulsion, even he himself, and not another."
2. "There are things written of Christ in all the writings of the Old Testament, in the law, and in the prophets, and in the psalms."
3. "When he came, he set about with the utmost delight, diligence, and faithfulness, in preaching the Gospel, performing miracles, doing good to the bodies and souls of men, and in finishing the great work of man's redemption, which was the main part of his Father's will he came to do; and which he did, by fulfilling the law in its precept and penalty; by offering himself a sacrifice to God; by suffering death, the death of the cross; by destroying all his and our enemies, and so working out everlasting salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. In the volume of the book â€” In this very psalm it is written of me. Accordingly I come to do thy will - By the sacrifice of myself.
