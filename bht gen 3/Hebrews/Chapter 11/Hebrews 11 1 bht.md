# Hebrews 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith is the confident assurance and demonstration of the things we hope for, even though they are not yet seen. By faith, we treat the future blessings as if they are already present, grasping the reality of what is not revealed to our senses. It is through faith that we assent to the truths testified by God in His Word, trusting in His promises. Faith gives substance and weight to the unseen, allowing us to hold firmly to what we cannot yet fully perceive.
