2. "He calls heaven a city that has foundations because of its perpetuity; for in the world there is nothing but what is transitory and fading."
3. "The Apostle teaches us that all weariness is relieved by expectation, so that we ought never to be weary in following God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For (the reason of his being a sojourner only) he looked, or waited, for a city which hath foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God."
