# Hebrews 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in faith died, not having seen their promised blessings, but they embraced them as though within reach, confessing themselves as strangers and pilgrims. These believers, like seamen waving a greeting from afar, clung to their faith, even though they did not fully possess what their faith promised. Just as Abraham rejoiced at the distant sight of Christ's day, they accepted their circumstances with the resignation of faith, trusting in the assurance of future rest.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "died in faithâ€”died as
	believers, waiting for, not actually seeing as yet
	their good things promised to them." 
2. "embraced themâ€”as though
	they were not 'afar off,' but within reach, so as to draw
	them to themselves and clasp them in their embrace."
3. "Worldly men hold
	fast the world; believers sit loose to it. Citizens of the world
	do not confess themselves 'strangers on the earth.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase used here, 'these all died in faith,' does not mean that they died in the exercise or possession of religion, but more strictly that they died not having possessed what was the object of their faith."
2. "Having seen that they would be fulfilled in future times...the 'promises' to which they trusted included all these things."
3. "It was not a cold and formal reception of them, but a warm and hearty welcome. Such is the nature of true faith when it embraces the promises of salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Having seen them from afar and greeted them" : as seamen wave their greeting to a country seen far off on the horizon, on which they cannot land.
2. "Confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims."
3. "They admitted and accepted the fact with the resignation of faith, and with the assurance of future rest."

### John Calvin:
1. "They despised all that was in the world; and they never forgot the taste of them, however small it was either in life or in death."
2. "Though God gave to the fathers only a taste of that grace which is largely poured on us, though he showed to them at a distance only an obscure representation of Christ, who is now set forth to us clearly before our eyes, yet they were satisfied and never fell away from their faith."
3. "If the land of Canaan did not engross their attention, how much more weaned from things below ought we to be, who have no promised habitation in this world?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In faith (ÎºÎ±Ï„Î± Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½). Here a break in the routine Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Îµ (by faith), 'according to faith,' either for literary variety 'or to suggest Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¹Ï‚ as the sphere and standard of their characters' (Moffatt)."
2. "Abraham rejoiced to see Christ's day in the dim distance (John 8:56)."
3. "But they 'confessed' it (Genesis 23:4; Genesis 47:9)."

### John Gill:
1. "They died in faith, having the grace itself, which being once implanted, can never be lost."
2. "They died according to the life of faith they lived, and the doctrine of faith they professed, being the Lord's both living and dying."
3. "And they confessed themselves to be such, nor are believers ashamed to own and confess their mean estate in this world."

### John Wesley:
1. "In death faith acts most vigorously."
2. "The promised blessings."
3. "Embraced as one does a dear friend."
