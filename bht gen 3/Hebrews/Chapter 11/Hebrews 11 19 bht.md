## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Abraham's faith was able, in anticipation, to clear the suspicion of Godâ€™s faithfulness by the suggestion of His power." 
2. "It was not Godâ€™s power to raise Isaac, but Godâ€™s power, generally, to raise from the dead, that Abraham believed."
3. "The true identification of the parable is I am persuaded to be found in the figure under which Isaac was sacrificed, viz. the ram, as already hinted by Chrysostom."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith answered the objections which reason brought against God's command to Abraham to offer Isaac, by suggesting that what God had promised He both could and would perform, however impossible the performance might seem."
2. "He received him back, risen from that death which he had undergone in, under, the figure of the ram."
3. "The figure to be the representation which the whole scene gave to Abraham of Christ in His death and resurrection."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To fulfil these promises, therefore, there was no other way possible but for him to be raised up from the dead, and Abraham fully believed that it would be done."
2. "The strength of his faith was seen in the fact that in obedience to the simple command of God, all the strong feelings of a father were overcome."
3. "The faith of Abraham in this remarkable instance shows us that the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead [...] was early believed in the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nor did hope disappoint Abraham, for it was a sort of resurrection when his son was so suddenly delivered from the midst of death."
2. "However, I do not dislike what some say, who think that our flesh, which is subject to death, is set forth in the ram which was substituted for Isaac."
3. "But I have now to state what the Apostle meant, not what may in truth be said; and the real meaning here, as I think, is, that Abraham did not receive his Son otherwise than if he had been restored from death to new life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And the reason was that he reckoned the faithfulness of God to be safe in the keeping of His almightiness; he believed that God would keep His word, even if it was necessary for Him to effect a resurrection from the dead."
2. "Whence and from the dead he did receive him back (used of captives delivered of hostages sent home), not in a literal resurrection indeed, but in what was an equivalent; the fatherâ€™s heart was as resigned, and the bitterness of the separation was as complete."
3. "Perhaps â€˜in a figureâ€™ has a further reference to â€˜the ramâ€™ which was offered in his stead the victim of Godâ€™s providing, while the son was set free; or possibly the whole transaction may be a figure of the death and resurrection of our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God is able (Î´Ï…Î½Î±Ï„Î± Î¿ Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï‚). God had given him Isaac in his old age. God can raise him from the dead. It was Abraham's duty to obey God."
2. "Because of (Î¿Î¸ÎµÎ½, whence) Abraham's superb faith Isaac was spared and so he received him back (ÎµÎºÎ¿Î¼Î¹ÏƒÎ±Ï„Î¿) as almost from the dead."
3. "This is the test that Abraham stood of which James speaks (James 2:23)."

### John Gill:
1. "His reasoning was the reasoning of faith; and the conclusion of it was...that he was able to do it."
2. "Abraham received his son in the similitude of a resurrection; it was as life from the dead."
3. "The Jews speak of him as if he was just dead; they say, 'when he saw the sword over his neck, his breath fled from him, and came to the place of the soul, as if he was at the point of giving up the ghost.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Accounting that God was able even to raise him from the dead â€” Though there had not been any instance of this in the world."
2. "From whence also â€” To speak in a figurative way."
3. "He did receive him â€” Afterwards, snatched from the jaws of death."
