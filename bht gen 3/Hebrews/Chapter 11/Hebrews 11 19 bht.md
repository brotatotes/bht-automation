# Hebrews 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith in God's power was so strong that he believed God could raise Isaac from the dead. Even when faced with the contradiction between God's command and His promise, Abraham believed that God would be faithful in keeping His word. In a figure, Abraham saw the representation of Christ's death and resurrection in the scene with the ram. This remarkable instance of faith also serves as an early belief in the resurrection of the dead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Abraham‚Äôs faith was able, in anticipation, to clear the suspicion of God‚Äôs faithfulness by the suggestion of His power." 
2. "It was not God‚Äôs power to raise Isaac, but God‚Äôs power, generally, to raise from the dead, that Abraham believed."
3. "Abraham virtually sacrificed his son: God designated Isaac for the burnt-offering, but provided a ram in his stead. Under the figure of that ram, Isaac was slain, being received back by his father in his proper person, risen from that death which he had undergone ·ºêŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒª·øá, in, under, the figure of the ram."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith answered the objections which reason brought against God's command to Abraham to offer Isaac, by suggesting that what God had promised He both could and would perform, however impossible the performance might seem."
2. "Able to raise from the dead."
3. "Understanding the figure to be the representation which the whole scene gave to Abraham of Christ in His death and resurrection."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not doubt that be who had given him to him in a manner at first so contrary to all human probability, could restore him again in a method as extraordinary." 
2. "God is to be obeyed. His command and arrangements are to be yielded to, though most tender ties are rent asunder, and though the heart bleeds."
3. "The faith of Abraham in this remarkable instance shows us that the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, not withstanding the limited revelations then enjoyed, and all the obvious difficulties of the case, was early believed in the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nor did hope disappoint Abraham, for it was a sort of resurrection, when his son was so suddenly delivered from the midst of death."
2. "The real meaning here, as I think, is, that Abraham did not receive his Son otherwise than if he had been restored from death to new life."
3. "Abraham had, as to his purpose, sacrificed him, so that he considered him as dead; and he received him back from the dead, not really, but in a way bearing a likeness to such a miracle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And the reason was that he reckoned the faithfulness of God to be safe in the keeping of His almightiness; he believed that God would keep His word, even if it was necessary for Him to effect a resurrection from the dead."
2. "The father‚Äôs heart was as resigned, and the bitterness of the separation was as complete."
3. "Perhaps ‚Äòin a figure‚Äô has a further reference to ‚Äòthe ram‚Äô which was offered in his stead the victim of God‚Äôs providing, while the son was set free; or possibly the whole transaction may be a figure of the death and resurrection of our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Abraham had God's clear command that contravened God's previous promise. This was his solution of his difficult situation."
2. "God is able. God had given him Isaac in his old age. God can raise him from the dead. It was Abraham's duty to obey God."
3. "Because of Abraham's superb faith Isaac was spared and so he received him back as almost from the dead. This is the test that Abraham stood of which James speaks."

### John Gill:
1. "Abraham did not go about this affair without thought; and yet he did not consult with flesh and blood; his reasoning was the reasoning of faith; and the conclusion of it was, not that he believed that God would raise his son from the dead, but that he was able to do it."
2. "and though his faith did not prescribe to God, yet as he believed the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, he might believe that God would raise his son from the dead, rather than that his promise should fail; and this conclusion proceeded upon the power and faithfulness of God."
3. "as a type of the death and resurrection of Christ, whose type he was in other things, as well as in this; as in his birth, and the circumstances of it; he was long promised and expected, as Christ, was; his birth was beyond the ordinary course of nature, and attended with great joy."

### John Wesley:
1. "Accounting that God was able even to raise him from the dead ‚Äî Though there had not been any instance of this in the world."
2. "From whence also ‚Äî To speak in a figurative way."
3. "He did receive him ‚Äî Afterwards, snatched from the jaws of death."
