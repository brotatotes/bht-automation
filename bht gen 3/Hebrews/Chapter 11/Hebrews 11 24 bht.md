## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So far from faith being opposed to Moses, he was an eminent example of it." 
2. "Faith made him to prefer the adoption of the King of kings, unseen, and so to choose things, the very last which flesh and blood relish." 
3. "He threw on the ground the diadem put on him in jest, a presage of his subsequent formal rejection of Thermutis' adoption of him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He believed that he was able to deliver them, and he so trusted in him that he was willing at his command to forego the splendid prospects which opened before him in Egypt."
2. "Yet all this, it is said, he 'refused.' There is indeed no express mention made of his formally and openly refusing it, but his leaving the court, and identifying himself with his oppressed countrymen, was in fact a refusal of these high honors, and of these brilliant prospects."
3. "It is not impossible that when he became acquainted with his real history, there was some open and decided refusal on his part, to be regarded as the son of the daughter of this pagan monarch."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith creates close personal relation."
2. "God's beneficent will and attitude toward the seeker are not always apparent at the first approach. In such cases, there is occasion for faith, in the face of delay, that diligent seeking will find its reward."
3. "By his faith thus manifested he announced the condemnation of the world to destruction. World is to be taken as in 2 Peter 2:5. It is not used in Heb. in the ethical sense so common in John and Paul."

### John Calvin:
1. "But if faith is to be considered as the main thing in Moses, it would be very strange and unreasonable that he should draw them away to anything else. It hence follows that all they make a poor proficiency in the Law who are not guided by it to faith."
2. "That we may then know that nothing was done thoughtlessly, and without a long deliberation, the Apostle says, that he was of mature age..."
3. "This the Apostle ascribes to faith; for it would have been much better for him to remain in Egypt, had he not been persuaded of the blessing promised to the race of Abraham; and of this blessing, the only witness was Godâ€™s promise; for he could see nothing of the kind with his eyes. It hence appears, that he beheld by faith what was far removed from his sight."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having become great" (from Exodus 2:11).
2. "He was of age and made his choice not from ignorance."
3. "Son" (Ï…Î¹Î¿Ï‚). Predicate nominative with Î»ÎµÎ³ÎµÏƒÎ¸Î± (to be spoken of, present passive infinitive, of Î»ÎµÎ³Ï‰).

### John Gill:
1. "He refused all this honour, both in words, and by facts; he denied that he was the son of Pharaoh's daughter, as the words will bear to be rendered."
2. "And this discovered great faith; and showed that he preferred being called an Israelite to any earthly adoption, and the care of the church, and people of God, to his own worldly honour and interest."
3. "He believed the promises of God, before the flatteries of a court; and esteemed afflictions and reproaches, with the people of God, and for his sake, better than sinful pleasures, and earthly riches."

### John Wesley:
1. Refused to be called â€” Any longer.
