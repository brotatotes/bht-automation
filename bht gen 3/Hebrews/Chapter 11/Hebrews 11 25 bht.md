## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Choosing" implies a deliberate resolution, not a hasty impulse. He was forty years old, a time when the judgment is matured.
2. If the world has "pleasure" (Greek, "enjoyment") to offer, it is but "for a season." If religion bring with it "affliction," it too is but for a season; whereas its "pleasures are for evermore."
3. He balanced the best of the world with the worst of religion, and decidedly chose the latter.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If he sought to elevate and deliver them, such an undertaking could not but be one of great peril and hardship."
2. "Yet he 'chose' this. He on the whole preferred it. He left the court...because he deliberately preferred to share the trials and sorrows of the friends of God."
3. "So every one who becomes a friend of God and casts in his lot with his people, though he may anticipate that it will be attended with persecution, with poverty, and with scorn, prefers this to all the pleasures of a life of gaiety and sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To suffer affliction...than to be evil entreated."
2. "To enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season..."
3. "To have temporary enjoyment of sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Choosing rather (ŒºŒ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ ŒµŒªŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ). 'Rather having chosen' (second aorist middle of Œ±ŒπœÅŒµœâ, to take for oneself a position)."
2. "To be entreated with (œÉœÖŒΩŒ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÖœáŒµŒπœÉŒ∏Œ±). Present passive infinitive of the double compound œÉœÖŒΩŒ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÖœáŒµœâ (from œÉœÖŒΩ, Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÉ, Œµœáœâ), to treat ill with (associative instrumental case)."
3. "To enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫Œ±ŒπœÅŒøŒΩ ŒµœáŒµŒπŒΩ Œ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ±œÇ Œ±œÄŒøŒªŒ±œÖœÉŒπŒΩ). Literally, 'to have temporary pleasure of sin.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,.... The Israelites, who were God's chosen and peculiar people, and were the true worshippers of him, Moses chose to be with those: the company and conversation of such is most eligible to every good man because God is with them." 
2. "But then those are a poor, and an afflicted people; affliction is with them, for the sake of God, and Christ, and the truths which they profess, and the worship and service they are engaged in; and their afflictions are many and grievous."
3. "And the reasons which might induce Moses, and so every good man, to such a choice, may be taken partly from the nature of afflictions themselves, which are such that God has chosen for them, and appointed them unto, and which he gives them to suffer for his name, and which are an honour to them, and issue in their good, and in the glory of God."
