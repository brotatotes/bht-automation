## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Choosing" implies a deliberate resolution, not a hasty impulse. He was forty years old, a time when the judgment is matured.
  
2. If the world has "pleasure" (Greek, "enjoyment") to offer, it is but "for a season." If religion bring with it "affliction," it too is but for a season; whereas its "pleasures are for evermore."
3. He balanced the best of the world with the worst of religion, and decidedly chose the latter.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He left the court, not because he was driven away; not because there was nothing there to gratify ambition or to be a stimulus to avarice; and not on account of harsh treatment...but because he deliberately preferred to share the trials and sorrows of the friends of God."
2. "Every one who becomes a friend of God and casts in his lot with his people, though he may anticipate that it will be attended with persecution, with poverty, and with scorn, prefers this to all the pleasures of a life of gaiety and sin, and to the most brilliant prospects of wealth and fame which this world can offer."
3. "In view of all the 'pleasures' which sin can furnish, and in view of the most brilliant prospects which this world can hold out, religion enables man to pursue a different path. They who become the friends of God are willing to give up all those fair and glittering anticipations, and to submit to whatever trials may be incident to a life of self-denying piety."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To be evil entreated."
2. "To have temporary enjoyment of sin."
3. "The emphasis is first on temporary and then on sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rather having chosen" (second aorist middle of Œ±ŒπœÅŒµœâ, to take for oneself a position)."
2. "To treat ill with (associative instrumental case), only known example save one in the papyri (second century A.D.), though Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÖœáŒµœâ in Hebrews 11:37; Hebrews 13:3."
3. "Literally, 'to have temporary pleasure of sin.' ŒëœÄŒøŒªŒ±œÖœÉŒπœÇ is old word from Œ±œÄŒøŒªŒ±œÖœâ, to enjoy, in N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 6:17."

### John Gill:
1. "Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God."
2. "But then those are a poor, and an afflicted people; affliction is with them."
3. "And this was more eligible to him, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season."
