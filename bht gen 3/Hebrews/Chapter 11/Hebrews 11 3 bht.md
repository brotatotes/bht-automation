# Hebrews 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By faith, we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen did not come from what is visible. It is through faith that we grasp the truth of creation by God, a conviction that goes beyond the limitations of our senses. This belief in the origin of the visible universe is the foundation of all faith. Recent works by scientists confirm the existence of a Supreme Mind behind the universe, rejecting the idea of the eternity of matter.
