## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By faith (shewn in her confession...), Rahab the harlot did not perish with them who were disobedient." 
2. "Not to be softened into an innkeeper, as some have done... Clement of Rome devotes to her a whole chapter... and has no idea of her other than as an harlot."
3. "Having received the spies with peace, so that they had nothing hostile to fear from her."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Rahab showed her 'faith' in her confession, Joshua 2:9; Joshua 2:11, 'I know that Jehovah hath given you the land; Jehovah your God, is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.'" 
2. "Her former life adds to the marvel of her repentance, faith, and preservation." 
3. "Thus Paul, quoting the same examples...for the power of faith, as James does for justification by works evidentially, shows that in maintaining justification by faith alone, he means not a dead faith, but 'faith which worketh by love'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The usual and the fair meaning of the word is what is given in our translation, and there is no good reason why that signification should not be retained here... It is not implied by the use of the word here, however, that Rahab was an harlot at the time to which the apostle refers; but the meaning is, that this had been her character, so that it was proper to designate her by this appellation."
2. "This case - supposing that she had been a woman of bad character, but now was truly converted - does not stand alone. Other females of a similar character have been converted, and have subsequently led lives of piety... This record, therefore, is one of encouragement for the most abandoned sinners; and one too which shows that strangers, even in a public house, may do good to those who have wandered far from God and virtue, and that we should never despair of saving the most abandoned of our race."
3. "That she was not perfect is true. That she did some things which cannot be vindicated is true also - and who does not? But admitting all that may be said about any imperfection in her character, (compare Joshua 2:4), it was still true that she had strong faith - and that is all that the apostle commends."

### John Calvin:
1. "He has hitherto shown that the Patriarchs, whom the Jews most honored and venerated, did nothing worthy of praise except through faith; and that all the benefits conferred on us by God, even the most remarkable, have been the fruits of the same faith: but he now teaches us, that an alien woman, not only of a humble condition among her own people, but also a harlot, had been adopted into the body of the Church through faith."
2. "It hence follows, that those who are most exalted, are of no account before God, unless they have faith; and that, on the other hand, those who are hardly allowed a place among the profane and the reprobate, are by faith introduced into the company of angels."
3. "She is mentioned as a harlot, in order to amplify the grace of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nor does previous personal character hinder its power, or previous separation from the covenant people." 
2. "Her faith showed its reality in her receiving and protecting the spies, and found its reward in her preservation, and finally in her becoming an ancestress of our Lord." 
3. "A careful attention to the tenses, and to the absence of the article whereby this clause is closely connected with the preceding, would be sufficient of itself to reconcile the teaching of Paul and James."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having received the spies with peace." 
2. "ÎšÎ±Ï„Î±ÏƒÎºÎ¿Ï€Î¿Ï‚ is an old compound."
3. "Used of scout or spy, in LXX, here only in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "This woman was a wonderful and singular instance of the free, sovereign, distinguishing, powerful, and efficacious grace of God."
2. "Her temporal salvation was an emblem and type of her spiritual salvation."
3. "The scarlet thread, that was hung out, was an emblem of the blood of Christ, by which sins, though as scarlet, are made white as wool."

### John Wesley:
1. Rahab â€” Though formerly one not of the fairest character.
