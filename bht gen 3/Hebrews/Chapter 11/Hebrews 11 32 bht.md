## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "for the time (which might be reasonable for writing an epistle) will fail me narrating (if I narrate) concerning Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah, and David, and Samuel, and of the prophets."
2. "through faith, instead of 'by faith,' for the first time in the chapter, suits perhaps better the miscellaneous verbs of predication which follow, e.g. quenched the violence of fire."
3. "they obtained promises, but not the promises which were yet future."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Just as Samson for the same reason is put before JephthÃ¦."
2. "The mention of JephthÃ¦ as an example of 'faith,' makes it unlikely he sacrificed the life of his daughter for a rash vow."
3. "David, the warrior king and prophet, forms the transition from warrior chiefs to the 'prophets,' of whom 'Samuel' is mentioned as the first."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle does not commend all which they did. He does not deny that they were very imperfect men, nor that they did many things which cannot be approved or vindicated. He commends only one thing - their faith."
2. "Even in the great and improper sacrifice of his only daughter which the obvious interpretation of the record respecting him in Judges 11:39, leads us to suppose he made, he did it as an offering to the Lord, and under these mistaken views of duty, he showed by the greatest sacrifice which a man could make - that of an only child that he was disposed to do what he believed was required by religion."
3. "The single reason why the piety of Jephtha has ever been called in question has been the fact that he sacrificed his own daughter. If he did not do that, no one will doubt his claims to an honored rank among those who have evinced faith in God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus, in all the saints, something reprehensible is ever to be found; yet faith, though halting and imperfect, is still approved by God." 
2. "The Apostle declares that there are none of these things which ought not to be ascribed to faith." 
3. "Since all these things were done by faith, we must feel convinced, that in no other way than by faith is Godâ€™s goodness and bounty to be communicated to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The groups named in this verse are really two; and though there are various readings as to the connecting particles, they necessitate no change."
2. "Samuel is probably put last to connect his name with the prophets, to which class he belongs (see Acts 3:23)."
3. "Gideon and Samson are probably put before Barak and Jephthah respectively, because they are of greater celebrity as men of faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He feels helpless to go on in the same style as he has done from Abel to Rahab."
2. "Vivid and picturesque description of the author's embarrassment of riches as he contemplates the long list of the heroes of faith during the long years in Palestine."
3. "He mentions six names (Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephtha, David, Samuel) and then summarizes the rest under 'the prophets' of whom Samuel was the leader."

### John Gill:
1. "...the elders, by [faith], had obtained a good report; and yet he had not said all he could; and that he had so much to say, that he could not say all"
2. "It may be observed, that many, who are not mentioned by name, do not stand excluded from being believers; and that the number of believers, under the Old Testament, was very large"
3. "[David's] faith appeared in his dependence on God, when he fought with Goliath; in encouraging himself in the Lord his God, when in exile and distress; and in believing his interest in the covenant of grace, when his house and family were in a disagreeable situation, and he just going out of the world"

### John Wesley:
1. "David also was a prophet; but he was a king too."
2. "The prophets â€” Elijah, Elisha, etc., including likewise the believers who lived with them."
3. (None)
