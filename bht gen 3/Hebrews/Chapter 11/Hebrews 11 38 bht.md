# Hebrews 11:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Cast out and persecuted by the world, these holy individuals wandered through deserts, mountains, and caves, taking refuge in the very earth. The world's rejection of them exposed its own unworthiness, for it shut out a source of blessing. In condemning these righteous ones, the world condemned itself. Like lost sheep, they sought shelter in the chinks of the earth, enduring hardships as they journeyed. Such was the wickedness of the world that it did not deserve to have these holy men among its midst.
