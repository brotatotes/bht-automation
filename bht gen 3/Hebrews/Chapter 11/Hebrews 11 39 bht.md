# Hebrews 11:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers who lived by faith in the past did not receive the promise of final salvation, the eternal inheritance. For them, the promise was purely future, while for us, it is a present reality as well. At the death of Christ, believers were perfected in title and conscience, but the full blessedness of body and soul will be attained when the full number of the elect is completed. These faithful ones may not have seen the fulfillment of the Messianic promise, but their witness through faith is a testament to their righteousness.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The believers of the past, commended for their faith, did not receive the full fulfillment of the promise of final salvation. They trusted in God and their faith bore witness to their righteousness, but they did not live to see the Messianic promise. However, the promise they longed for is now present for us, as Jesus' death on the cross brought about the perfecting of believers in both title and conscience. We, the present-day believers, are doubly ungrateful if we do not show the same faith and resilience that the patriarchs exemplified under the Law. Let us remember the noble examples of patience and perseverance as we hold fast to our faith in Christ and willingly suffer for His sake, knowing that the promise is not just for the saints of old, but for us as well.
