# Hebrews 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The excellence of Abel's sacrifice was not in its nature, but in the disposition with which it was offered. What made Abel's offering acceptable was his faith, which caused his person to be accepted before God. Through his faith, he still speaks to us today, even though he is long dead. By sacrificing in faith, Abel looked beyond his offering to the sacrifice of Christ. His faith and sacrifice serve as a reminder of the value of religion and the need for an atonement by blood.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The excellence of Abel's sacrifice in Hebrews 11:4 is not attributed to the nature of the sacrifice itself, but rather the disposition with which it was offered. Abel's faith is what made his sacrifice acceptable to God. It is believed that God's command to sacrifice animals as a symbol of the forfeiture of life by sin and a type of the promised Savior, resulted in a flame issuing from the Shekinah during the first offerings. Through his faith, Abel's sacrifice still speaks to us today, reminding us of the value of religion and the necessity of an atonement. His faith allowed him to acknowledge his sin, lay hold of God's mercy, and look through his sacrifice to the sacrifice of Christ. Abel obtained both righteousness and a testimony of it through his faith, and even in death, he continues to speak to us about the acceptance of sinners through faith in the great sacrifice.
