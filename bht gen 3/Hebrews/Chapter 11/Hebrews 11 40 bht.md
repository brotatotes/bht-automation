# Hebrews 11:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Old Testament saints patiently awaited the ultimate state of glorious perfection, which will only come with the completion of the elect. Through God's provision of everlasting glory, they, along with us, will be made perfect. Unlike the ancient believers, we have the privilege of clear revelation and the fulfillment of promised salvation in Christ. It is our responsibility to prove ourselves worthy and remain loyal to Christ, who justifies, sanctifies, and glorifies us all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Fathers generally interpret it of the ultimate state of glorious perfection, which shall only then come in, when all the number of the elect shall be accomplished."
2. "The design of God in this provision of something better for us was, that they, the Old Test. saints, should not be perfected without us, i.e. independently of the New Test. salvation of which we are partakers."
3. "Their and our perfection was all brought in at the same time, when Christ 'by one offering perfected for ever them that are sanctified.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They had not in this world, 'apart from us,' the clear revelation of the promised salvation actually accomplished, as we now have it in Christ."
2. "The connection is, You, Hebrews, may far more easily exercise patience than Old Testament believers; for they had much longer to wait, and are still waiting until the elect are all gathered in."
3. "They in soul share our blessedness, being 'the spirits of the just made perfect.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'better things' then referred to here as possessed by Christians, are the privilege of seeing those promises fulfilled in the Messiah; the blessings resulting from the atonement; the more expanded views which they have under the gospel; the brighter hopes of heaven itself, and the clearer apprehension of what heaven will be, which they are permitted to enjoy."
2. "Of all those holy men who made these sacrifices, which of them ever regretted it, when he came calmly to look over his life, and to review it on the borders of the eternal world? None. Not one of them ever expressed regret that he had given up the world; or that he had obeyed the Lord too early, too faithfully, or too long."
3. "Whatever our religion may have cost us, we shall not feel that we began to serve God too early, or served him too faithfully. Whatever pleasure, gain, or splendid prospects we gave up in order to become Christians, we shall feel that it was the way of wisdom, and shall rejoice that we were able to do it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God having provided. Some better thing. That apart from us they should not be made perfect."
2. "This glorious and gracious purpose (foresight) of God is not due to any special merit in us."
3. "But all the same and all the more (noblesse oblige), we should prove worthy of our heritage and of God's goodness to us and be loyal to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus Christ was the same in the yesterday of the Old Testament, as he is in the present day of the Gospel dispensation."
2. "We have a better covenant, or a better administration of the covenant of grace; we have a better priesthood, and a better sacrifice."
3. "The Old Testament saints are perfectly justified, perfectly sanctified, and perfectly glorified; but their perfection was not by the law, which made nothing perfect, but by Christ, and through his sacrifice, blood, and righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. God having provided some better thing for us â€” Namely, everlasting glory.
That they might not be perfected without us â€” That is, that we might all be perfected together in heaven.
