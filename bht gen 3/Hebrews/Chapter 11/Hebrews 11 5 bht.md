### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "The Scripture testimony virtually expresses that he pleased God, namely, 'Enoch walked with God.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is an encouragement to piety. It shows that God regards his friends; that their fidelity and holy living please him; and that 'in the midst of eminent wickedness and a scoffing world it is possible so to live as to please God.'"
2. "The removal of Enoch shows that the same thing would be 'possible' in the case of every saint. God could do it in other cases, as well as in his, with equal ease."

### John Calvin:
1. "Had he died as other men, it would have not occurred to any, that he was thus preserved from the prevailing contagion by Godâ€™s providence; but, as he was taken away without dying, the hand of God from heaven, removing him as it were from the fire, was openly manifested." 
2. "It was not an ordinary honor with which God had favored him." 
3. "Let us leave this airy philosophy to those light and vain minds, which cannot be satisfied with what is solid. Let it suffice us to know, that their translation was a sort of extraordinary death; nor let us doubt but that they were divested of their mortal and corruptible flesh, in order that they might, with the other members of Christ, be renewed into a blessed immortality."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was not found. Translated. Translation. He hath had witness borne him. That he had been well-pleasing unto God."
2. "Was still not found."
3. "Quoted here from Genesis 5:22; Genesis 5:24. The word is common of a servant pleasing his master."

### John Gill:
1. "[Enoch's translation] is a translation of him, soul and body, to heaven, to eternal glory and happiness, by a change from mortality to immortality, which passed upon him; and which is a pledge of the resurrection of the dead." 
2. "He did those things which pleased [God]; he walked with God... by faith in the ways of his worship and service; and he was acceptable to him in Christ." 
3. "He has obtained a better testimony than those men give him."
