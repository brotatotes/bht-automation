# Hebrews 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without faith, it is impossible to please God. This is because faith is the foundation and assurance of our belief in God's existence and His faithfulness to reward those who diligently seek Him. Our works and desires must be rooted in this intelligent faith, as works without faith are just splendid sins. We must have confidence in God, in His fidelity, truth, wisdom, and promises, to truly please Him. If we doubt His declarations and promises, if we do not believe that He hears our prayers, then there can be no encouragement to call upon Him. Therefore, our relationship with God is built upon the conviction that He is, and that He is a rewarder to all who seek Him.
