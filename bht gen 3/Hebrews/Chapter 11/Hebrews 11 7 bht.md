### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "moved with fearâ€”not mere slavish fear, but as in Hebrews 8:5- :; see on Hebrews 5:7; Greek, 'reverential fear': opposed to the world's sneering disbelief of the revelation, and self-deceiving security." 
2. "Join 'by faith' with 'prepared an ark' (Hebrews 5:7- :)."
