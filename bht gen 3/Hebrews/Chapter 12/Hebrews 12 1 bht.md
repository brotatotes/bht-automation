## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse is altogether made up of words derived from the games... And this being so, who can help referring this cloud of witnesses which surrounds us to the scene in the games which is depicted, and regarding them as lookers on while our race is run?"
2. "The best note on the whole idea and imagery is that of Schlichting: 'He introduces us as it were into an immense theatre, where a vast crowd of spectators has assembled... Now as of old such a multitude of spectators added courage to the combatants, and was a great stimulus to use every effort for victory: so to us also, so many witnesses, who also themselves have toiled in the same conflict, ought to add alacrity, and cause us to run with all our force the race which we have begun.'"
3. "And he calls them witnesses, not only in a figure, allusive to the spectators of a contest... but, and much more, because they witness concerning God and His goodness and justice, and all as with one mouth declare that God is, and is a rewarder of those who seek Him: that with Him, as the Chief Lord of the games, there is laid up a prize for earnest contenders: that He is true in His promises; that even after death He can render those happy who for His sake have given their lives."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'witnesses' answer to the spectators pressing round to see the competitors in their contest for the prize." 
2. "The cloud of witnesses who have themselves been in the same contest, ought to increase our earnestness, testifying, as they do, to God's faithfulness." 
3. "Carnal and worldly lusts, and all...that would impede the heavenly runner, are the spiritual weight to be laid aside."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In like manner, the apostle represents Christians as encompassed with the multitude of worthies to whom he had referred in the previous chapter. It cannot be fairly inferred from this that he means to say that all those ancient worthies were actually looking at the conduct of Christians, and saw their conflicts. It is a figurative representation, such as is common, and means that we ought to act as if they were in sight, and cheered us on."
2. "Whatever it may be, we are exhorted to lay it aside, and this general direction may be applied to anything which prevents our making the highest possible attainment in the divine life."
3. "Encouraged by the example of the multitudes who have run the same race before us, and who are now looking out upon us from heaven, where they dwell, we are to persevere as they did to the end."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Therefore let us also (as they did) run our appointed race with patience."
2. "The writer's picture is that of an arena in which the Christians whom he addresses are contending in a race, while the vast host of the heroes of faith...watches the contest from the encircling tiers of the arena, compassing and overhanging it like a cloud, filled with lively interest and sympathy, and lending heavenly aid."
3. "The readers are exhorted to lay aside every worldly hindrance or embarrassment to their Christian career."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that we are so surrounded by this dense throng, that wherever we turn our eyes many examples of faith immediately meet us." 
2. "Whosoever, then, would run in the course prescribed by Christ, must first disentangle himself from all these impediments." 
3. "By this word patience, we are ever reminded of what the Apostle meant to be mainly regarded in faith, even that we are in spirit to seek the kingdom of God, which is invisible to the flesh, and exceeds all that our minds can comprehend."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Us also (Œ∫Œ± Œ∑ŒºŒµŒπœÇ). We as well as 'these all' of Hebrews 11:39 and all the more because of the 'something better' given us in the actual coming of Christ."
2. "Laying aside (Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏ŒµŒºŒµŒΩŒø). Second aorist-middle (indirect, from ourselves) participle of Œ±œÄŒøœÑŒπŒ∏Œ∑Œº, old verb as in Colossians 3:8 (laying off old clothes). The runners ran in the stadium nearly naked."
3. "The sin which doth so easily beset us (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµœÖœÄŒµœÅŒπœÉœÑŒ±œÑŒøŒΩ Œ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩ). 'The easily besetting sin.' There are a dozen possible renderings of this double compound verbal from ŒµœÖ, well, and œÄŒµœÅŒπŒπœÉœÑŒ∑Œº, to place around or to stand around (intransitive). Probably this is the true idea here, 'the easily encompassing (or surrounding) sin.' In this case apostasy from Christ was that sin. In our cases it may be some other sin."

### John Gill:
1. "Let us lay aside every weight; or burden; every sin, which is a weight and burden to a sensible sinner, and is an hinderance in running the Christian race."
2. "The sin which doth so easily beset us; [refers to] the corruption of nature in general, which is always present, and puts upon doing evil."
3. "And let us run with patience the race that is set before us... it is a motion forward, a pressing towards the mark for the prize, a going from strength to strength."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let us throw off whatever weighs us down, or damps the vigour of our Soul."
2. "And the sin which easily besetteth us ‚Äî As doth the sin of our constitution, the sin of our education, the sin of our profession."
3. "A great multitude, tending upward with a holy swiftness."
