# Hebrews 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Writer draws a clear contrast between the discipline of earthly parents and that of our heavenly Father. Earthly parents may chastise us according to their own judgment and pleasure, but God's discipline is always for our ultimate profit and to partake in His holiness. While the discipline of human parents is temporary and limited to this life, God's discipline has eternal significance. Through His correction, our flesh is subdued and we are sanctified, ultimately becoming holy like God Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For they indeed (our earthly parts) for a few days chastised us after their own pleasure, but He in order to that which is profitable, in order to our partaking of His holiness."
2. "For a few days has been understood by many of the duration of our natural life, as the term to which the chastisement of our natural parents had reference, whereas that of our heavenly Father regarded eternity. But this cannot be the meaning of the Writer."
3. "Surely the true antithesis is that pointed out by the order of the clauses themselves, and by their correspondence: 1) 'for a few days,' and 'for our profit,' 2) 'after their pleasure,' and 'that we may be partakers of his holiness.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their rule of chastening is what may seem fit to their own often erring judgment, temper, or caprice."
2. "The two defects of human education are: (1) the prevalence in it of a view to the interests of our short earthly term of days; (2) the absence in parents of the unerring wisdom of our heavenly Father."
3. "To become holy like God is tantamount to being educated for passing eternity with God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Much more cheerfully ought we to submit to that discipline from the hand of our heavenly Father which is designed to extend its benefits through eternity."
2. "We may be assured that our trials are always adapted to that end [our real welfare]."
3. "To be holy as God is holy; to be so holy that it may be said that we 'are partakers of his holiness,' is a richer blessing than health, and property, and friends, without it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Subjection to the Father of spirits, the source of all life, has an eternal significance." 
2. "The discipline of the human father is brief in duration, and its significance is confined to the present life." 
3. "The human parent may not have dealt with us to our profit. Sumferein means to bring together: to collect or contribute in order to help: hence, to help or be profitable."

### John Calvin:
1. "God's chastisements are appointed to subdue and mortify our flesh, so that we may be renewed for a celestial life."
2. "The spiritual holiness conferred by God far exceeds the advantages which belong to the body."
3. "God's chastisements are profitable to make men partners of his holiness, not by making us really holy, but by helping to sanctify us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For they (our earthly parents) for a few days chastened us according as it seemed good to them, but he for our profit."
2. "The contrast here is perfect between seeming and reality between their pleasure and God‚Äôs noble purpose."
3. "'His holiness' is, no doubt, a holiness completely like His own."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They (Œø ŒºŒµŒΩ)... Chastened (ŒµœÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµœÖŒøŒΩ)."
2. "For our profit (ŒµœÄ œÑŒø œÉœÖŒºœÜŒµœÅŒøŒΩ)."
3. "That we may be partakers (ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒπŒΩ)."

### John Gill:
1. "saints are no losers by afflictions; they lose nothing but their dross and tin; they do not lose the love of God; nor their interest in the covenant of grace; nor the presence of God; nor grace in their own hearts; nor spiritual peace and comfort: on the contrary, they are real gainers by them"
2. "their graces gain by them fresh lustre and glory; they obtain a greater degree of spiritual knowledge; and a larger stock of experience"
3. "afflictions are designed as means to bring persons to this end; to bring them to a sense of sin, an acknowledgment of it, an aversion to it, and to a view of pardon of it; to purge it away; to wean the saints from this world; to increase their grace, and lead them on to a perfect state of glory, where there will be no more sin, and no more sorrow."

### John Wesley:
1. "How few are even all our day on earth!"
2. "But he always, unquestionably, for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness."
3. "That is, of himself and his glorious image."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The Writer of Hebrews contrasts the discipline of earthly parents with the discipline of our heavenly Father. Earthly parents may chastise according to their own judgment or whim, focusing on short-term benefits. However, God's discipline is always for our ultimate profit, so that we may partake in His holiness. The difference lies in the duration and significance of the chastening. Earthly discipline is brief and limited to this life, whereas the discipline from our heavenly Father carries eternal significance. His aim is to educate us for an everlasting life with Him, where we become holy like Him. Through God's correction, our flesh is subdued, our spiritual holiness exceeds any worldly advantages, and we are sanctified. These trials, though temporary, refine our faith, increase our knowledge, and lead us to a state of perfect glory in the presence of God.
