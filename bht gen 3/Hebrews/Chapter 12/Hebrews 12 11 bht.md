## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All chastisement, properly so called, and answering its proper purpose."
2. "All chastisement for the time present seems not to be matter of joy, but of grief, but afterwards it yields peaceable fruit of righteousness."
3. "And this fruit, thus considered, is the practical righteousness which springs from faith, not the forensic righteousness which comes by faith."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The real object of the fathers in chastening is not that they find pleasure in the children's pain. Gratified wishes, our Father knows, would often be our real curses." 
2. "Fruit of righteousnessâ€”righteousness (in practice, springing from faith) is the fruit which chastening, the tree yields. 'Peaceable' in contrast to the ordeal of conflict by which it has been won. 'Fruit of righteousness to be enjoyed in peace after the conflict.'" 
3. "Chastisement is the exercise to give experience, and make the spiritual combatant irresistibly victorious. 'Oh, happy the servant for whose improvement his Lord is earnest, with whom he deigns to be angry, whom He does not deceive by dissembling admonition!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It enables him to bear the pain without complaining; and,
 (2)It turns the affliction into a blessing on his soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Every kind of chastisement."
2. "To be of joy but of grief."
3. "Fruit which consists in righteousness or is righteousness."

### John Calvin:
1. "Chastisements cannot be estimated aright if judged according to what the flesh feels under them, and that therefore we must fix our eyes on the end."
2. "We shall thus receive the peaceable fruit of righteousness."
3. "In adversities we are alarmed and disquieted, being tempted by impatience, which is always noisy and restless; but being chastened, we acknowledge with a resigned mind how profitable did that become to us which before seemed bitter and grievous."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now no chastening (either Godâ€™s or any other) seemeth for the present to be joyous, but grievous (literally, a matter of joy, but of grief); nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness ( i.e righteousness is the fruit; and as the conflict is over, it is enjoyed in peace) unto them that have been exercised thereby."
2. "Such is the general interpretation of the passage. The objection to it is that the last part of the verse is not true of all chastisement, but only of what God sends."
3. "The chapter is a striking lesson on â€˜analogyâ€™ the word which underlies the command (â€˜considerâ€™) with which it begins. Christ Himself (Hebrews 12:3), human institutions (the Grecian games), the common relationship of life (parents and children), are all introduced to strengthen the, argument, and most impressive lessons are drawn from them all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not joyous, but grievous."
2. "Peaceable fruit."
3. "Exercised thereby."

### John Gill:
1. "Though they really are, when viewed by faith, and judged of by sanctified reason; for they are tokens of the love of God and Christ; are evidences of sonship; and work together either for the temporal, or spiritual, or eternal good of the saints." 
2. "But for the present, and when carnal sense and reason prevail, it must be allowed, that they are not matter of joy, but grievous; or matter, cause, and occasion of grief; they cause pain and grief to the afflicted, and to their friends and relations about them."
3. "Moreover, the fruit of holiness may be designed, which saints by afflictions are made partakers of, and the peace enjoyed in that; for there is a peace, which though it does not spring from, yet is found in the ways of righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "All chastening...yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness." 
2. "Whether from our earthly or heavenly Father, [chastening] is for the present grievous." 
3. "To them that are exercised thereby...improve it according to his will."
