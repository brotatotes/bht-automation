# Hebrews 12:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All chastisement, whether divine or human, initially seems to bring grief rather than joy. Yet, its purpose is not to produce pleasure through pain, but rather to yield a practical righteousness that arises from a victorious spiritual combat. Chastisement serves to give experience and strength, even though it may not be joyous in the present moment. However, it ultimately brings about a peaceable fruit of righteousness that is treasured and valued; a result of faith and the sanctified perspective that sees afflictions as tokens of God's love and evidences of sonship.
