# Hebrews 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To see the Lord, we must diligently pursue peace with all and strive for sanctification. Following after peace means actively seeking moral and spiritual ends, while sanctification requires consecration and becoming holy as God is holy. Without holiness, we cannot enter into the presence of the holy God, and it is through holiness that we are able to appreciate and enjoy Him. Therefore, our part is to put on His holiness and be sanctified, so that we may have communion with Him both in this life and in the life to come.
