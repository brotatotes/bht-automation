## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "lest any . . . fall‚ÄîGreek, 'lest any (namely, through sloth in running) failing,' or 'falling short of the grace of God . . . trouble you.' The image is taken from a company of travellers, one of whom lags behind, and so never reaches the end of the long and laborious journey." 
2. "root of bitterness‚Äînot merely a 'bitter root,' which might possibly bring forth sweet fruits; this, a root whose essence is 'bitterness,' never could."
3. "many‚Äîrather, 'the many,' that is, the whole congregation. So long as it is hidden under the earth it cannot be remedied, but when it 'springs up,' it must be dealt with boldly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is implied that there are reasons why we should take special care. Those reasons are found in the propensities of our hearts to evil; in the temptations of the world; in the allurements to apostasy presented by the great adversary of our souls."
2. "As every man is in danger, it is his personal duty to see to it that his salvation be secure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Looking diligently [ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒµœÇ] ... The idea is exercising oversight." 
2. "Fail of [œÖœÉœÑŒµœÅœâŒΩ Œ±œÄŒø] ... implying a previous attainment. The present participle marks something in progress: 'lest anyone be falling back.'"
3. "Root of bitterness [œÅŒπŒ∂Œ± œÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒπŒ±œÇ] ... A bad man in the church. The participle pictures the springing up in progress; the root gradually revealing its pernicious character."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is easy to fall away from the grace of God; for it is not without reason that attention is required, because as soon as Satan sees us secure or remiss, he instantly circumvents us."
2. "We have, in short, need of striving and vigilance, if we would persevere in the grace of God."
3. "When the Lord stimulates us by warning and exhortation, he at the same time moves and stirs up our hearts, that his exhortations may not be in vain, or pass away without effect."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lest any man fail of (come short of by willfully relinquishing) the grace of God."
2. "The characteristic of the Gospel is ‚Äògrace,‚Äô apart from the works of the Law; and a man falls from it who puts himself at a distance from the blessing, and so gives it up."
3. "Lest any root, or plant, of bitterness, trouble the sacred enclosure of the Church, and thereby the many (the larger part of the ground even) be defiled (corrupted)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lest there be any man falleth short of the root of bitterness... springing up."
2. "The contagion of sin is terrible as any disease."
3. "The vivid picture of the root of bitterness sprouting quickly."

### John Gill:
1. "Lest any man fail of the grace of God; not the free favour and love of God in Christ, which is everlasting, unchangeable, and from whence there is no separation... but either the whole doctrine of the Gospel, which is a declaration of the grace of God; or particularly the doctrine of free justification by the righteousness of Christ, which men may receive in vain, and fall from..." (79 words)
2. "Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, [and] thereby many be defiled... either the corruption of nature in general, which is a root that lies hidden in a man's heart... or errors and heresies... which sometimes, like roots, lie under ground, secret and undiscovered and are bitter ones in their effects, bringing ruin and swift destruction on the souls of men..." (83 words)
3. "Now, care should be taken, that no such person be in churches, holding such an error; because of the glory of God, Father, Son, and Spirit; the comfort of souls; the peace of the church, and the growth and increase of it, which must be hurt by such men and doctrines..." (49 words)
