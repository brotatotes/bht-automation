# Hebrews 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Esau's sin of fornication is almost like gluttony, as he cast away his spiritual privilege for the sake of satisfying his appetite. The smallness of the inducement only adds to the guilt of trading eternity for such a trivial thing. By selling his birthright, Esau profaned what was sacred and trodden underfoot. This warns believers to exercise self-control and not forfeit their blessings, just like Esau did, reminding them to renounce the world and resist worldly temptations.
