# Hebrews 12:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For he found not place of repentance... It means he found no way to reverse what he had done by repentance. The sin had been committed and the consequence was irrevocable. We do not mean an opportunity to be sorry for what has been done, but a chance to repair through repentance. It is obvious that our interpretation cannot exclude any sinner from repentance. His tears were of vain regret and remorse, not of true repentance. Tears alone are not proof of genuine repentance. (Quote 1, 4, 5, 6)
