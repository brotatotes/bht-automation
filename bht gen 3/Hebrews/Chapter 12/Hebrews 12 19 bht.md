# Hebrews 12:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When God spoke to the people at Mount Sinai, they were not refusing to hear His words, but rather they were overwhelmed by the direct communication. The sound of the trumpet amidst the tempest intensified the fear of the scene. The voice of words, particularly the Decalogue, spoken by God Himself without any visible form, was so awe-inspiring that the people entreated for the word not to be spoken anymore. This interaction was intended to show that God had ascended His tribunal as a strict judge, but the Gospel offers love when received by faith.
