# Hebrews 12:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When God spoke the Ten Commandments, the people were overwhelmed by the terrifying voice that issued forth without any visible form. The sound of a trumpet roused their attention and signaled God's approach. The people, overcome with fear, pleaded for Moses to intercede on their behalf, unable to bear the weight of God's direct communication. This stark contrast between the fearful nature of the Law and the love and grace of the Gospel demonstrates the severity of sin and the redemptive power found in faith.
