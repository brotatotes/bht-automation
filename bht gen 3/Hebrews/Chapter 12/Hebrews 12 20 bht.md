# Hebrews 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sight that Moses witnessed was so terrible and caused him to be in great terror and in trembling. The touch of the mountain was deemed a profanation, signifying its significance. The Israelites were unable to bear the awe-inspiring communication of God's commands, which led to severe consequences of either stoning or being shot through with a dart for disobedience. Such was the gravity of the situation that even a beast could not stray, for it would also be subjected to stoning.
