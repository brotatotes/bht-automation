# Hebrews 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses' trembling and fear at the appearance and manifestation of God reveal the awe-inspiring power and holiness of God's presence. Even though these specific words are not recorded in Exodus, Paul, inspired by God, supplies this detail to emphasize the genuine fear that Moses experienced. When Moses heard the ten commandments spoken by the voice of Jehovah, he surely had a similar fear and trembling. This demonstrates that even the most righteous individuals, like Moses, cannot stand before a holy God and His law without trembling in reverent awe.
