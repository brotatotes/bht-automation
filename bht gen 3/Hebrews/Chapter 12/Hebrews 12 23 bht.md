## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Writer has prepared the way for such a designation, while at the same time...the long sentence beginning at ver. 18 aims at this 'that Christians may be defended against unbelief, and may learn to know their rights of inheritance.' There is no distinction between first-born and later-born Christians, but all Christians as such are called firstborn because of their heritorship of the heavenly inheritance."
2. "We also thus obtain an explanation of the juxtaposition in the sentence of the myriads of angels and the myriads of the firstborn: the key to it being found in ch. i. 14, where God is said to have apportioned the angels as ministering spirits to minister to the heirs of salvation."
3. "The blood of Christ is called 'the blood of sprinkling,' inasmuch as, like that sacrificial blood of old materially, it is spiritually sprinkled on the conscience of those who come unto God by Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All those who at the coming of 'God the Judge of all'...shall be found 'written in heaven,' that is, in the
Lamb's book of life."
2. "Though still fighting the good fight on earth, still, in
respect to your destiny, and present life of faith which
substantiates things hoped for, ye are already members of the heavenly citizenship."
3. "The resurrection bodies of the saints shall be bodies
in which the spirit shall altogether preponderate over the
animal soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Christian is united in feeling, in honor, and in destiny, with the excellent of all the earth, and of all times."
2. "He should feel it, therefore, an honor to be a Christian; he should yield to no temptation which would induce him to part from so goodly a fellowship."
3. "Most Christians have among the redeemed already not a few of their most tenderly beloved friends. It should be a powerful motive with us so to live as to be prepared to be reunited with them in heaven."

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds, which are written in heaven, because God is said to have all the elect enrolled in his book or secret catalogue."
2. "This seems to have been said to inspire fear, as though he had said, that grace is in such a way altered to us, that we ought still to consider that we have to do with a judge, to whom an account must be given if we presumptuously intrude into his sanctuary polluted and profane."
3. "He adds this to intimate that we are joined to holy souls, which have put off their bodies, and left behind them all the filth of this world; and hence he says that they are consecrated or 'made perfect', for they are no more subject to the infirmities of the flesh, having laid aside the flesh itself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Church of the firstborn... equivalent to the kingdom of God."
2. "Enrolled as citizens of heaven even while on earth."
3. "People should not forget that God is the Judge of all men."

### John Gill:
1. "The church of God, consisting of all his elect, both Jews and Gentiles, and the meeting of them together."
2. "The persons, that belong to this church, are styled the 'firstborn'; who are not the apostles only, who received the first fruits of the Spirit; nor the first converts among the Jews, who first trusted in Christ; but also the chosen of God, who are equally the sons of God, and born of him; are equally loved by him, and equally united to Christ, and interested in him."
3. "Believers, in the present state of things, may be said to be come to them, being come to the Church below, which is a part of that above; as also in hope, expectation, and desire."

### John Wesley:
1. "The word properly signifies a stated convention on some festival occasion."
2. "Of the first-born-The first-born of Israel were enrolled by Moses; but these are enrolled in heaven, as citizens there. It is observable, that in this beautiful gradation, these first-born are placed nearer to God than the angels."
3. "The separate souls. Of just men â€” It seems to mean, of New Testament believers. The number of these, being not yet large, is mentioned distinct from the innumerable company of just men whom their Judge hath acquitted. These are now made perfect in an higher sense than any who are still alive."
