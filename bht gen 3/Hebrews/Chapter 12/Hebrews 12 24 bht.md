## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of Jesus, the Perfecter of our faith, and Himself perfected through sufferings and death, in His resurrection and ascension, is naturally suggested by the mention of 'the just made perfect' at their resurrection."
2. "His blood was entirely 'poured out' of His body by the various ways in which it was shed, His bloody sweat, the crown of thorns, the scourging, the nails, and after death the spear, just as the blood was entirely poured out and extravasated from the animal sacrifices of the law."
3. "This sprinkling is analogous to the sprinkled blood of the Passover. His blood introduced into heaven took away the dragon's right to accuse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The highest consideration which can be urged to induce anyone to persevere in a life of piety is the fact that the Son of God has come into the world and died to save sinners."
2. "The blood of Jesus speaks better things than Abel did; that is, that the blood of Jesus is the 'reality' of which the offering of Abel was a 'type.'"
3. "The object here is to compare the Redeemer with Abel, not in the sense that the blood shed in either case calls for vengeance, but that salvation by blood is more clearly revealed in the Christian plan than in the ancient history."

### John Calvin:
1. "He alone through whom the Father is reconciled to us, and who renders his face serene and lovely to us, so that we may come to him without fear."

3. "Abel's blood still speaks, but it is as nothing compared to that of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Coming to Christ is by faith; and is different from a corporeal coming to him in the days of his flesh; and from an outward attendance on ordinances; it is a coming to him under a sense of want, and upon a sight of fulness; and is the produce of God's efficacious grace." 
2. "The blood of Christ...denote the application of Christ's blood to his people, for justification, pardon, and cleansing, which is their great mercy and privilege."
3. "Christ's blood cries for peace and pardon, both in the court of heaven, where it is pleaded by Christ, and in the court of conscience, where it is sprinkled by his spirit."

2. "This blood of sprinkling was the foundation of our Lord's mediatorial office."
