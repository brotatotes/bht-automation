## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Receiving as we do a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have thankfulness, by which let us serve God well-pleasingly with reverent submission and fear." 
2. "The participle, receiving, is descriptive of our Christian state of privilege and expectation: designating us by anticipation as in possession of that, whose firstfruits and foretastes we do actually possess." 
3. "Let us have thankfulness, by which let us serve God well-pleasingly with reverent submission and fear."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let us have graceâ€”'let us have thankfulness'... 'whereby we may serve God,' suits the English Version 'grace' (that is Gospel grace, the work of the Spirit, producing faith exhibited in serving God), but does not suit 'thankfulness.'" 
2. "Acceptablyâ€”Greek, 'well-pleasingly.'"
3. "Reverent caution and fearâ€”The oldest manuscripts read, 'reverent caution and fear.' Reverent caution lest we should offend God, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. Fear lest we should bring destruction on ourselves."

2. "This is the only kingdom in which we can be certain that there will be no revolution; the only empire which is destined never to fall."

3. "the true and right way of serving him is acceptably, with reverence, and godly fear"

### John Wesley:
1. "Hold fast the grace, whereby we may serve God â€” In every thought, word, and work."
