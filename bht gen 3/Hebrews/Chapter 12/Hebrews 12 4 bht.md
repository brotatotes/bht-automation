# Hebrews 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our fight against sin requires courage and perseverance, like an athlete who experiences bruises. Just as an athlete cannot bring great courage to the contest without being bruised, we must face sin head-on and not let our spirits be cast down. It is through our resistance to sin that we grow stronger and more determined. While our struggle may not entail the shedding of our blood, it is important to recognize that our trials and sufferings are part of the process of subduing sin and increasing holiness.

3. "Now this is said, to sharpen and increase the saints resentment and indignation against it, as being their antagonist, with whom they strive and combat, and which is the cause of all the evils in the world, exposes to wrath to come, and separates from communion with God; and to encourage them to bear their sufferings patiently, since they are not without sin, as Christ was; and since their afflictions and sufferings are for the subduing of sin, and the increase of holiness."

### John Wesley:
1. Unto blood — Unto wounds and death.
