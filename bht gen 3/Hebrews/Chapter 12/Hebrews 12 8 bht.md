# Hebrews 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we are without chastisement, we are not true sons, but rather bastards. Chastisement is a mark of our genuine sonship, demonstrating that our Heavenly Father is concerned for our moral well-being. All the witnesses mentioned in Hebrews 11 have experienced this discipline, and it is necessary for us as well. We may think that if we are God's children, we would not suffer, but in fact, suffering is a sign of our true sonship. We should not reject or resent chastisement, for it proves that we have not been cast off by God, but rather that He cares for us as a father cares for his legitimate children.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if ye are without (separate from, no partakers in) chastisement, of which all (God's sons: or those above mentioned, ch. xi., which is better, on account of the perfect verb) have been made partakers, then ye are bastards (beneath the attention and affectionate superintendence of the father), and not sons."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Since then not to be chastised is a mark of bastardy, we ought [not to refuse, but] rejoice in chastisement, as a mark of our genuine sonship."
2. "Every right-minded father is concerned for the moral well-being of his legitimate son."
3. "All the worthies enumerated in the eleventh chapter: all the witnesses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God has not cast them off. In every way he evinces toward them the character of a father."
2. "If it should be that they passed along through life without any occurrence that would indicate the paternal care and attention designed to correct their faults, it would show that they never had been his children, but - were cast off and wholly disregarded."

### Philip Schaff:
