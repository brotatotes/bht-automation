# Hebrews 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We Christians have an altar, not to be emphasized or exalted, but still our altar. It sets us apart from those who serve the tabernacle, as we have no right to partake in their sacrifices. This spiritual altar represents the cross, and the bread and wine of the Lord's table represent the sacrifice offered on it. It encompasses the ideas of approach to God, sacrifice, atonement, pardon, acceptance, and salvation. Those who don't approach this altar lack the bread of God and demonstrate pride in their separation from the congregation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We have an altar... That is our altar: not to be emphasized, nor exalted into any comparison with the adorable Victim thereon offered; but still our altar, that wherein we glory that for which as for our altars. we contend." 
2. "We Christians have an altar whereof [even] they who serve the [Christian] tabernacle have no right to eat: i.e. as explained by Hofmann, as the high priest himself did not eat of the sin-offerings whose blood was brought into the tabernacle, but they were burnt without the camp, so we Christians have no sacrifice of which we have any right to eat, no further profit to be derived from that one sacrifice, by which we have been reconciled to God."
3. "Thus, and thus only, does the whole context stand in harmony. Thus the words in they that serve the tabernacle keep their former meanings: see ch. viii. 5, where we have 'such as have the delineation and the shadow of heavenly things.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christianity and Judaism are so totally distinct, that 'they who serve the (Jewish) tabernacle' have no right to eat our spiritual Gospel meat."
2. "The Lord's table represents this altar, the cross; as the bread and wine represent the sacrifice offered on it."
3. "That not a literal eating of the sacrifice of Christ is meant in the Lord's Supper, but a spiritual is meant, appears from comparing Hebrews 13:9; Hebrews 13:10, 'with GRACE, NOT with MEATS'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the apostle is to show that the same thing substantially, so far as 'privilege' and 'sanctifying influence' were concerned, was enjoyed by Christians."
2. "But the apostle says that there is a higher and more valuable sacrifice of which they have no right to partake while they remain in the service of the 'tabernacle' or temple; that is, while they remain Jews."
3. "however much they might value themselves on the privilege of partaking of the sacrifices offered under the Jewish Law, that of partaking of the great sacrifice made by the Son of God was much greater."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The ideas of approach to God, - sacrifice, atonement, pardon and acceptance, salvation, - are gathered up and generally represented in the figure of an altar, even as the Jewish altar was the point at which all these ideas converged."
2. "If one be not within the altar, he lacketh the bread of God.... Whosoever, therefore, cometh not to the congregation, he doth thereby show his pride, and hath separated himself."
3. "Jehovah thus condescended to be the guest of his worshippers."

### John Calvin:
1. "No wonder if the rites of the Law have now ceased, for this is what was typified by the sacrifice which the Levites brought without the camp to be there burnt."
2. "For as the ministers of the tabernacle did eat nothing of it, so if we serve the tabernacle, that is, retain its ceremonies, we shall not be partakers of that sacrifice which Christ once offered, nor of the expiation which he once made by his own blood."
3. "For his own blood he brought into the heavenly sanctuary that he might atone for the sin of the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We Christians have a spiritual altar, not a literal one." 
2. "Our spiritual altar." 
3. "The tabernacle being used for 'the whole ceremonial economy' of Judaism."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ himself, who is altar, sacrifice, and priest."
2. "Christ is a refuge to his people, that come from the four corners of the earth; and who believe in him, and lay hold on him, are preserved and protected by his power and grace."
3. "Those who served the tabernacle, or adhered to the service of the ceremonial law, they had no right to eat of this altar."

### John Wesley:
1. "We have an altar â€” The cross of Christ."
2. "Whereof they have no right to eat â€” To partake of the benefits which we receive therefrom."
3. "Who serve the tabernacle â€” Who adhere to the Mosaic law."
