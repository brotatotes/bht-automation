# Hebrews 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as our great Sacrifice, suffered outside the gate of ceremonial Judaism, resembling a sacrifice that was wholly burned outside. His sacrifice is distinct from those in which the priests took part, and it is similar to the offering on the Day of Atonement. The shedding of Christ's blood and its sprinkling upon the throne of grace brings reconciliation, while the old economy adherents do not partake in these privileges. The sacrifices in the old system were wholly consumed, and no Jew ever ate them, unlike Christ, who is our sin-offering.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "There was a distinction in the sacrifices as to the subsequent participation of certain parts of them by the priests." 
3. "Without the camp refers to the time when Israel was encamped in the wilderness: the enclosure of the camp was afterwards succeeded by the walls of Jerusalem, so that without the gate below answers to it)."

3. "The sin offerings are twofold: the outward, whose blood was sprinkled on the outward altar, and of whose bodies the priests might eat; and the inward, the reverse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this verse the consideration is, that the bodies of the beasts that were burnt were taken without the camp, and that in like manner the Lord Jesus suffered without the gate of Jerusalem, and that we should be willing to go out with him to that sacrifice, whatever reproach or shame it might be attended with."

2. "The victims for the Day of Atonement were a bullock and two young goats for sin-offerings, and two rams for burnt-offerings."
3. "Burning without the camp was also required in the case of victims offered at the consecration of the priests, Exodus 29:14; at the sin-offering for the priest, Leviticus 4:11, Leviticus 4:12; and at the sin-offering for the congregation, Leviticus 4:21."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The antecedent (Œ∂œâœâŒΩ) of œâŒΩ is here incorporated and attracted into the case of the relative, 'the blood of which beasts'..."

2. "The shedding of his blood; the carrying of it into heaven; the sprinkling it upon the throne of grace and mercy; by which reconciliation is made for the sins of all God's people."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Our great Sacrifice, Jesus, suffered outside the gate of ceremonial Judaism, similar to the way in which sacrifices were wholly burned outside the camp. This signifies that His sacrifice is not like those in which the priests could partake. Just as the shedding of the blood of the sacrificial animals made atonement for the sins of the people, the shedding of Christ's blood and its sprinkling upon the throne of grace brings reconciliation for all believers. Therefore, since Christ is our sin-offering, those who adhere to the old economy cannot partake in the privileges of the new.
