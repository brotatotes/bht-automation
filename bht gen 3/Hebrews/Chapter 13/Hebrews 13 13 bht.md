# Hebrews 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us come out from all carnalism, formalism, and sensuous worship, and know Jesus in His spiritual power apart from worldliness. Bearing His reproach means being willing to identify with Him, follow Him, and be regarded as His friend, even if it subjects us to shame and reproach. This passionate plea to go out and bear His reproach is the central message of the Epistle because faith considers Jerusalem as a camp, not a city, and the Christians have access to the open altar in heaven while the Jews serve an earthly sanctuary.
