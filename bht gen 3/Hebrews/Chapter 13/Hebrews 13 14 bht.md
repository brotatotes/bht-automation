# Hebrews 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For here we have no continuing city, but we seek for that which is to come. The short-lived nature of the earthly Jerusalem, destroyed shortly after the writing of this Epistle, highlights the transient nature of our present earthly order. Those who cling to this earth, like those who clung to the earthly sanctuary, are reminded of our exclusion from its religious fellowship when we embrace the faith of Christ. As followers of Christ, we are no longer drawn to Jerusalem but instead seek our permanent home in the heavenly city.

- Attempt 1 BHT: For here we have no continuing city, but we seek for that which is to come. We are reminded that the earthly Jerusalem was not an abiding city, as it was soon destroyed. It served as a type of our present earthly order, which is also destined to perish. Those who hold onto the earthly sanctuary represent all who cling to this earth. However, we are excluded from its religious fellowship by embracing the faith of Christ, who suffered outside the gate. Seeking establishment through meats, which represent the economy that denies Christ, excludes us from the only vehicle of grace. Jerusalem has lost its charm for followers of Christ, and now we find ourselves where Abraham once was. We should consider that our permanent home is not here, but in heaven, and when driven from place to place, we are reminded to turn our eyes up to heaven. Let us seek for that which is to come, a city prepared by God, an unchanging and eternal abode.
