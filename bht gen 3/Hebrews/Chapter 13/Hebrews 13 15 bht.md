# Hebrews 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through Him, not by means of the Jewish ritual observances, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God. In praising a creature, we may easily exceed the truth, but in praising God we have only to go on confessing what He really is to us. The sacrifice of thanksgiving is to take the place of the animal sacrifice and the fruit of our lips is a good confession to God, confessing to His name.
