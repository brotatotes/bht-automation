# Hebrews 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As bound with them, bound to sympathy with prisoners, and subject to evil treatment, we are reminded of the duty to entertain strangers, for it is through them that we may be honored with the presence of those whose society will be a blessing and honor. The influence of such guests is invaluable to a family and can even lead to the conversion of a child. Like God, who loves strangers and may send His angels in disguise, we should remember to show love and hospitality, for it may result in deliverance and deepen our gratitude.
