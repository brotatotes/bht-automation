2. "The only hope that they would do the will of God was, that he would, by his own agency, cause them to do what was well-pleasing in his sight."
3. "God does not directly, and by his own immediate agency, convert and sanctify the heart, but it is through the gospel of Christ, and all good influences on the soul must be expected through the Saviour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Make you perfect (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÅœÑŒπœÉŒ±). First aorist active optative of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ∂œâ, to equip, as in Hebrews 10:5. A wish for the future." 
2. "Working in us (œÄŒøŒπœâŒΩ ŒµŒΩ ŒµŒºŒπŒΩ). 'Doing in us.' Some MSS. read 'in you.'"

"Men are naturally unfit for good works; in order to do them aright, it is necessary that they should have knowledge of the will of God; that they be regenerated and created in Christ; that they be sanctified and cleansed, and so meet for the master's use; that they have the Spirit of God, and strength from Christ; and that they be believers in him."
3. "All the grace necessary for the beginning and carrying on, and finishing of the good work of grace, and for the performance of every good work, comes through the hands of Christ, in whom all fulness of it dwells; and through the blood and intercession of Christ, by virtue of which it is communicated; and all become acceptable to God through him, as the persons of the Lord's people, so the grace that is wrought in them, and the works that are done by them."
