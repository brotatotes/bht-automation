Our brother Timothy has been set at liberty, possibly from prison. The timing of his release is uncertain, but it is likely that Timothy was sent on an important mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So Aristarchus was imprisoned with Paul." 
2. "Paul, though now at large, was still in Italy." 
3. "He probably left Timothy there and went to Philippi as he had promised."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is a strong circumstance showing that Paul was the author of the Epistle, for from the first acquaintance of Timothy with Paul he is represented as his constant companion, and spoken of as a brother..."
2. "There is no other one of the apostles who would so naturally have used this term respecting Timothy..."
3. "The meaning, then, I take to be this, that Timothy was then sent away on some important embassage; that the apostle expected his speedy return; and that then he trusted that he would be able with him to visit those to whom this Epistle was written."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our brother Timothy. Paul's habit, when using the word brother with a proper name, is to put the proper name first."
2. "Set at liberty. Nothing is known of the fact referred to."
3. "Apoluein of releasing from confinement, Matthew 27:15; John 19:10; Acts 3:13; Acts 4:21, Acts 4:23; Acts 5:40."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Know ye...that our brother Timothy is set at liberty...one of the prisoners whose bonds you shared in spirit is now free." 
2. "The most natural rendering. The word is used for entering on some official work...but a fuller description would have been necessary if that had been the meaning here." 
3. "This language does not prove that Paul wrote the Epistle, but it intimates that the readers knew the writer, and it is certain that no one stood in closer relation to Paul than Timothy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath been set at liberty." 
2. "Possibly from prison if he came to Rome at Paul's request."
3. "Shortly (Ï„Î±Ï‡ÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½). Same comparative as in verse Hebrews 13:19, 'sooner' than I expect (?)."

### John Gill:
1. "he was set at liberty, or 'dismissed'; either by the apostle, by whom he was sent into some parts, upon some business; or rather was loosed from his bonds, having been a prisoner for the sake of Christ and the Gospel" 
2. "it was a piece of good news to them to hear of his release"
3. "when, if he should, they would both come together, and visit the Hebrews; which looks as if the apostle was at liberty himself, or at least had some hopes of his deliverance from prison"

### John Wesley:
1. If he come â€” To me.
