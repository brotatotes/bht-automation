# Hebrews 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Diversifying from the one true faith in Jesus Christ is cautioned against in this verse. The ceremonial observances of Judaism, like distinctions between clean and unclean meats, brought no lasting benefit. It is foolish to forsake Christ for Pharisaism or Moses. Instead, the heart finds stability and true sustenance in the grace of Christ. In this atmosphere of grace, amidst the delusions of Satan, lies the solid and stable experience of God's saving operation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Diversâ€”differing from the one faith in the one and the same Jesus Christ, as taught by them who had the rule over you."
2. "Established with grace; not with meatsâ€”not with observances of Jewish distinctions between clean and unclean meats, to which ascetic Judaizers added in Christian times the rejection of some meats, and the use of others."
3. "Christ's body offered once for all for us, is our true spiritual 'meat' to 'eat', 'the stay and the staff of bread', the mean of all 'grace'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle does not exhort them to adhere to an opinion merely because they had before held it, or because it was an old opinion, nor does he forbid their following the leadings of truth though they might be required to abandon what they had before held."
2. "The heart should be established with the love of God, with pure religion, and then we shall love the truth, and love it in the right manner."
3. "It is better to have the heart established in the grace of God than to have the most accurate knowledge of the distinctions which are made on useless or unimportant subjects of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These teachings represent various phases of one radical error - the denial of Jesus's messiahship and of his messianic economy as superseding Judaism and all other means of salvation."
2. "The heart is the proper seat of the work of grace. Free grace is the motive - power of Christ's sacrifice...and is the energetic principle of its saving operation."
3. "This ceremonial system yielded no permanent benefit to those who lived under it."

### John Calvin:
1. "We hence conclude that all who are ignorant of Christ are exposed to all the delusions of Satan; for apart from him there is no stability of faith, but innumerable tossings here and there."
2. "We are hereby also reminded how we are to proceed, if we would make a due proficiency in the Scripture, for he who takes not a straight course to Christ, goes after strange doctrines."
3. "It is the spiritual grace of God, and not the observance of meats, that will really establish us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For it is a good thing (a fine thing, a thing that has the beauty of virtue as well as the substance of it) that the heart be established (be made strong and firm) with grace..."
2. "The precepts of a ritual law have no living power, no saving efficacy."
3. "The simplicity of Gospel rites is as certainly helpful to holiness as the purity of Gospel truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The new is not always wrong any more than the old is always right."
2. "How true it is that in the atmosphere of so many windy theories only the heart is stable that has an experience of God's grace in Christ."
3. "Mere Jewish ceremonialism and ritualism failed to build up the spiritual life. It was sheer folly to give up Christ for Pharisaism or for Moses."

### John Gill:
1. "The doctrine of the Scriptures, of Christ, and his apostles, is but one; it is uniform, and all of a piece."
2. "The doctrine of grace...establishes the heart, with respect to the love and favour of God, and builds souls upon the foundation, Christ."
3. "They [meats] were only profitable to the body; and could be of no other use to the soul...for they were of no advantage to hypocrites and carnal men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Be not carried about with various doctrines â€” Which differ from that one faith in our one unchangeable Lord."
2. "Strange â€” To the ears and hearts of all that abide in him."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The teachings that the first-tier commentators provide about Hebrews 13:9 emphasize the dangers of diversifying from the one true faith in Jesus Christ. They stress that adherence to Jewish distinctions and ceremonial observances, such as clean and unclean meats, does not establish the heart with grace. In fact, this ceremonial system failed to yield any lasting benefit and it is sheer folly to abandon Christ for Pharisaism or Moses. Instead, the heart should be firmly established with the grace of Christ, which is the true spiritual sustenance and the means of all grace. Only in the atmosphere of God's grace can the heart find stability and a true experience of salvation. As second-tier commentators explain, it is better to have the heart established in the grace of God than to be preoccupied with unimportant religious matters. The simplicity of Gospel truths and their alignment with Gospel rites are essential for holiness and spiritual growth. Therefore, it is important to steer clear of any strange doctrines and constantly pursue the one true faith in Christ to have a stable and established heart.
