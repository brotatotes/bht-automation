# Hebrews 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Since Christ the Mediator of the new covenant is far above all angels, we must give even more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest they flow past us and we drift away. Drifting from truth and goodness is often the result of inattention, and giving heed is a mark of life. Neglect can destroy the soul, so we should be cautious and attentive to the important truths spoken by the Son of God and his apostles. Let us diligently give heed to avoid letting the truths slip away like water from a leaky vessel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thereforeâ€”Because Christ the Mediator of the new covenant is so far above all angels, the mediators of the old covenant." 
2. "the more earnestâ€”Greek, 'the more abundantly.'"
3. "let them slipâ€”literally 'flow past them'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When the Son of God speaks to people, every consideration makes it appropriate that we should attend to what is spoken."
2. "We should be very cautious that the important truths spoken by the Redeemer and his apostles should not be suffered to 'glide by' us without attention, or without profit."
3. "It needs not great sins to destroy the soul. Simple 'neglect' will do it as certainly as atrocious crimes."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Should drift past them... Lapse from truth and goodness is more often the result of inattention than of design."
3. "Drifting is a mark of death: giving heed, of life."

### John Calvin:
1. "The import of the whole is this, that the higher the dignity of Christ is than that of angels, the more reverence is due to the Gospel than to the Law. Thus he commends the doctrine by mentioning its author."
2. "He ought indeed always to be heard with equal attention whenever he may speak, and yet that the fuller he reveals himself to us, it is but right that our reverence and attention to obedience should increase in proportion to the extent of his revelations."
3. "To give heed, or to attend and to let slip, are opposites; the first means to hold a thing, and the other to let off like a sieve, or a perforated vessel, whatever may be poured into it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The dignity of the messenger adds greatly to the responsibility of those who hear the message." 
2. "It is not the truths of the Gospel that slip away, but we who slip or 'fleten' past them."
3. "We have simply to do nothing, and we shall be carried along to our ruin. To fall away requires no effort. To stand firm, to hold stedfast, is the difficulty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because Jesus is superior to prophets and angels and because the new revelation is superior to the old."
2. "The metaphor is that 'of being swept along past the sure anchorage which is within reach,' a vivid picture of peril for all."
3. "A pungent exhortation to give heed more earnestly to the things that were heard, lest haply we drift away."

### John Gill:
1. "Therefore the greater regard should be had to the Gospel spoken by him: even to the things which we have heard."
2. "It becomes the hearers of it to give heed, or attend unto it, to beware of that which is pernicious and hurtful, and to regard that which is good and profitable."
3. "The metaphor seems to be taken either from leaking vessels, which let out what is put into them; or to strainers, which let the liquor through, and it falls on the ground, and cannot be gathered up, and so becomes useless."

### John Wesley:
1. Lest we should let them slip â€” As water out of a leaky vessel. So the Greek word properly signifies.
