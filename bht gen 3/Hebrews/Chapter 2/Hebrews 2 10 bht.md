# Hebrews 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It was fitting for God to bring many sons to glory as the scheme of redemption harmonizes perfectly with His attributes of justice, goodness, and wisdom. Through the voluntary humiliation of Christ, being made a little lower than the angels, God perfected His Son in His human life and death for His task as Redeemer and Saviour. This process of perfecting Jesus corresponds to Him being crowned with glory and honor, and He became a complete and perfect Saviour through His sufferings.
