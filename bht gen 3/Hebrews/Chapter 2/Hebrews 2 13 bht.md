## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And again, I will put my trust in Him...Behold I and the children which God gave me." 
2. "The matter illustrated is...the great Prophet himself fulfilled the same office, and had the same hopes, and bore the same relation to those among whom He prophesied, praising God with them, leading them in confidence on God, and speaking of them as one family and stock with Himself."
3. "So that our passage forms a notable instance of the prophetic office of Christ being taken as the antitype of the official words and acts of all the Prophets."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I will put my trust in Him" expresses His filial confidence in God as His Father, to whom He flees from His sufferings, and is not disappointed; which His believing brethren imitate, trusting solely in the Father through Christ, and not in their own merits.
2. "Sons" (Hebrews 2:10), "brethren" (Hebrews 2:12), and "children" imply His right and property in them from everlasting.
3. Christ, the antitypical Prophet, instead of the human confidences of His age, Himself, and with Him God the Father's children, trust wholly in God for salvation.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was one with his people, and shared their 'dependence' and their piety - using language which showed that he was identified with them, and could mingle with the tenderest sympathy in all their feelings."
2. "There was such a remarkable similarity in the circumstances that the same language would express the condition of both [Isaiah and Jesus]. Both had delivered a solemn message to people; both had come to exhort them to turn to God, and to put their trust in him and both with the same result."
3. "The 'point' is, that he was a man; that since those who were to be redeemed partook of flesh and blood, he also took part of the same Hebrews 2:14, and thus identified himself with them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our writer ignores the historical sense of the words, takes a part of a sentence and puts a messianic meaning into it, inferring from it the oneness of Jesus and his people, and the necessity of his assuming their nature in order to be one with them."
2. "He treats the two parts of the passage separately, emphasizing in the first part Messiah's trust in God in common with his human brethren, and inserting ejgw I into the LXX text in order to call special attention to the speaker as Messiah."
3. "In the second part, he expresses the readiness of himself and his children to carry out God's will."

### John Calvin:
1. "But it ought not a little to encourage us to trust in God, that we have Christ as our leader and instructor; for who would fear to go astray while following in his steps? Nay, there is no danger that our trust should be useless when we have it in common with Christ; who, we know, cannot be mistaken."
2. "See then how this passage may be fitly applied to Christ: the Apostle concludes, that we are one with him, because he unites us to himself, when he presents himself and us together to God the Father: for they form but one body who obey God under the same rule of faith."
3. "Let not therefore the impiety of almost all ranks, ages, and nations, disturb us, provided Christ gathers together his own, who have been committed to his protection. If the reprobate rush headlong to death by their impiety, in this way the plants which God has not planted are rooted up. Let us at the same time know that his own are known to him, and that the salvation of them all is sealed by him, so that not one of them shall be lost. Let us be satisfied with this seal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christâ€™s oneness with us is not only proved by the fact that we have one Father and are brothers, all â€˜partakers of a Divine nature,â€™ but by the further fact that we have the same trials and struggles, and faith the principle of our spiritual life." 
2. "The brotherhood, moreover, that begins on His part with His incarnation and sufferings continues till His work is complete, and all the children, Himself and we, are presented perfect before God."
3. "The brotherhood, moreover, that begins on His part with His incarnation and sufferings (Hebrews 2:12; see Psalms 22:0) continues till His work is complete, and all the children, Himself and we, are presented perfect before God (Hebrews 2:13; see Isaiah 8:18)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I will put my trust in him." 
2. "The author represents the Messiah as putting his trust in God as other men do."
3. "The Messiah shows himself closely linked with the children of God, the sons of verse Hebrews 2:10."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are very applicable to him, for as man he had every grace of the Spirit in him; and this of faith, and also of hope, very early appeared in him; he trusted in God for the daily supplies of life, and that he would help him in, and through the work of man's salvation." 
2. "And this is a citation pertinent to the purpose, showing that Christ and his people are one, and that they are brethren; for he must be man, since, as God, he could not be said to trust; and he must be a man of sorrows and distress, to stand in need of trusting in God." 
3. "In which may be observed, that the saints are children with respect to God, who has adopted them, and with respect to Christ, who is their everlasting Father; that they were given to Christ as his spiritual seed and offspring, as his portion, and to be his care and charge; and that this is worthy of attention, and calls for admiration, that Christ and his people are one, and that he is not ashamed to own them before God and men."

### John Wesley:
1. "I will put my trust in him - To carry me through them all."
2. "Behold I and the children whom thou hast given me."
