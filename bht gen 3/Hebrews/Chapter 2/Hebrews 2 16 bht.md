# Hebrews 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For, as we well know, it is not angels that He helpeth, but it is the seed of Abraham that He helpeth. The seed of Abraham refers to the Jewish race, among whom Christ was born in the flesh and whom He came primarily to help. By taking hold of the seed of Abraham, the church of God, and becoming like his brethren, tempted as they are, Christ acts as a faithful high priest, making reconciliation for sin. Through this act, he does away with the fear of death and enables his people to draw near to God with boldness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For, as we well know, it is not angels that He helpeth, but it is the seed of Abraham that He helpeth."
2. "The seed of Abraham then means, the Jewish race, among whom Christ was born in the flesh, and whom He did come primarily to help."
3. "And the peculiarity of the expression must be explained, Estius,‚Äî 'This whole epistle prudently dissimulates the calling of the Gentiles, either because the mention of them would be unpleasing to the Hebrews, or because that mention was not necessary to its design.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For as we all know"; "For as you will doubtless grant." 
2. "It is not angels that He is helping but it is the seed of Abraham that He is helping."
3. "He views Christ's redemption with reference to Abraham's seed, the Jewish nation, primarily not that he excludes the Gentiles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He took not on him the nature of angels - Margin, 'He taketh not hold of angels, but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold.' The word used here - ŒµÃìœÄŒπŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ±ÃÅŒΩŒµœÑŒ±Œπ epilambanetai - means, to take hold upon; to seize; to surprise; to take hold with a view to detain for oneself... Here it means to lay hold with reference to 'aid,' or 'help;' and the meaning is, that he did not seize the nature of angels, or take it to himself with reference to rendering 'them' aid, but he assumed the nature of man - in order to aid 'him.'"
2. "But he took on him the seed of Abraham - He came to help the descendants of Abraham, and consequently, since they were men, he became a man. Writing to Jews, it was not unnatural for the apostle to refer particularly to them as the descendants of Abraham, though this does not exclude the idea that he died for the whole human race."
3. "The fact that I love one of my children, and that I make provision for his education, and tell him so, does not exclude the idea that I love the others also - and that I may make to them a similar appeal when it shall be proper."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He did not appropriate the nature of angels. Angels did not need to be delivered from the fear of death."
2. "Not of angels doth he take hold. It is not angels who receive his help."
3. "Christ takes hold of the seed of Abraham, the church of God, and is made like unto his brethren, tempted as they are, in order that he may be a faithful high priest, making reconciliation for sin, thus doing away with the fear of death, and enabling his people to draw near to God with boldness."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this comparison he enhances the benefit and the honor with which Christ has favored us, by putting on our flesh; for he never did so much for angels."
2. "There is therefore no reason for us to glory as though we were superior to angels, except that our heavenly Father has manifested toward us that ampler mercy which we needed, so that the angels themselves might from on high behold so great a bounty poured on the earth."
3. "But we see that the Apostle‚Äôs meaning was very different, for his object was to teach us that we find in the Son of God a brother, being a partaker of our common nature."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Verily is feeble, as is even assuredly. The word means, it is known, admitted, and admitted everywhere; it is nowhere questioned."
2. "He took not on him... but on the seed of Abraham He laid hold, i.e to help and save them."
3. "It is not angels whom Christ delivers... but the seed of Abraham, the theocratic name of the people of God peculiar to Paul."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Verily (Œ¥Œµ œÄŒøœÖ). 'Now in some way,' only here in N.T."
2. "Doth he take hold (ŒµœÄŒπŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒµœÑŒ±). Present middle indicative and means to lay hold of, to help, like Œ≤ŒøŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑œÉŒ± in verse Hebrews 2:18."
3. "The seed of Abraham (œÉœÄŒµœÅŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ ŒëŒ≤œÅŒ±Œ±Œº). The spiritual Israel (Galatians 3:29), children of faith (Romans 9:7)."

### John Gill:
1. "He never took, as the Vulgate Latin version more rightly renders it; at no time, in no place; nor is it said in any place of Scripture that he did; this is a certain truth, and not to be disputed."
2. "Christ assumed human nature as derived from Abraham... and with great vehemence and affection to hold anything fast, that it be not lost, and to help persons, and do good unto them; all which may be observed in this act of Christ's..."
3. "From hence may be learned the deity and eternity of Christ, who was before Abraham, as God, though a son of his as man; and his real humanity, and that it was not a person, but a seed, a nature he assumed; and also the union and distinction of natures in him."

### John Wesley:
1. "He does not take their nature upon him."
2. "He takes human nature upon him."
3. "To Abraham was the promise made."
