## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Because then He had this work to do for the seed of Abraham (sons of men, in the wider reference),â€”viz. to deliver them from fear of death, He must be made like them in all things, that He may be a merciful and faithful High Priest."
 
2. "That he might become (become, not simply be, because the High Priesthood of Christ in all its fulness, and especially in its work of mercy and compassion and succour, was not inaugurated, till He entered into the heavenly place."
 
3. "His High Priesthood was, strictly speaking, begun, as its one chief work in substance was accomplished, here below, during His time of suffering. That it is still continued in heaven, and indeed finds its highest and noblest employ there, is no reason against this view."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mercy is a prime requisite in a priest, since his office is to help the wretched and raise the fallen: such mercy is most likely to be found in one who has a fellow-feeling with the afflicted, having been so once Himself."
2. "God's love is as much from everlasting as His justice; therefore, lest Christ's sacrifice, or its typical forerunners, the legal sacrifices, should be thought to be antecedent to God's grace and love, neither are said in the Old or New Testament to have propitiated God; otherwise Christ's sacrifices might have been thought to have first induced God to love and pity man, instead of (as the fact really is) His love having originated Christ's sacrifice, whereby divine justice and divine love are harmonized."
3. "He had no sin Himself, and 'made reconciliation for the iniquity' of all others."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a fitness that nothing should be wanting in him in reference to the innocent propensities and sympathies of human nature."
2. "He might know how to pity us in our infirmities and trials, by having a nature like our own."
3. "He might be qualified as a high priest to perform the great work of rendering God propitious in regard to sins."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There was a complete and real likeness to humanity, a likeness which was closest just where the traces of the curse of sin were most apparent - in poverty, temptation, and violent and unmerited death."
2. "That he might be compassionate, and so (in consequence of being compassionate), a faithful high priest."
3. "The idea of a compassionate and faithful high priest would appeal powerfully to Jewish readers, who knew the deficiency of the Aaronic priesthood in that particular."

### John Calvin:
1. "But he teaches us that Christ was made subject to human affections, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest."
2. "Whenever any evils pass over us, let it ever occur to us, that nothing happens to us but what the Son of God has himself experienced in order that he might sympathize with us; nor let us doubt but that he is at present with us as though he suffered with us."
3. "He is compassionate, because he can sympathize with the tempted, having been himself tempted; and he is a true and faithful high priest, because he really expiated the sins of the people: and that he might be all this, he became like his brethren that is, by taking their nature."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The quality of mercy in the priest is really part of the thought. How much we need a merciful high priest, as well as one who shall be faithful to his trust, is shown by the preceding description of our state. It is the one quality which is needed to win men to God."
2. "This proof is supplied by Christ as incarnate, and perhaps Christ as incarnate and suffering became capable of higher sympathy than the blessed God Himself."
3. "When followed by the word 'sin' or its equivalent, the Hebrew and Greek mean to make atonement for; when followed by a word describing a person, they mean to pacify or appease, to make propitiation, with special reference to the moral sentiment of justice or right in the person appeased."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus fought through to victory over Satan."
2. "Christ, our Elder Brother, resembles us in reality."
3. "These two adjectives (ÎµÎ»ÎµÎ·Î¼Ï‰Î½ and Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï‚) touch the chief points in the function of the high priest, sympathy and fidelity to God."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's incarnation was in time, and after that many of the brethren existed; and it was only for their sakes that he assumed human nature; and therefore it was proper he should be like them in that nature, in all things."
2. "He could not be an high priest, offer sacrifice for sin, and make intercession, unless he was man; nor could he be a 'merciful' and compassionate one, sympathize with his people in their sorrows, temptations, and sufferings, unless he was like them in these."
3. "In order to [make reconciliation], which could not be done without blood, without sufferings and death, it was proper he should be man, and like unto his brethren."

### John Wesley:
1. "To be made in all things â€” That essentially pertain to human nature, and in all sufferings and temptations."
2. "A priest or high priest is one who has a right of approaching God, and of bringing others to him."
3. "In things pertaining to God, to expiate the sins of the people â€” Offering up their sacrifices and prayers to God; deriving God's grace, peace, and blessings upon them."
