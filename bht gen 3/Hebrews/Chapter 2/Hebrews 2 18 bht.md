# Hebrews 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For He Himself having been tempted in that which He hath suffered, He is able to succour them that are (now) tempted. The ability to succour here is not to be understood of the power to which the Lord has been exalted through death and suffering to be a Prince and a Saviour,â€”but of the power of sympathy acquired by personal experience of our sufferings. He is able to succor them that are being tempted in the same temptation, knowing our trials not only as God but also as man through experimental feeling.
