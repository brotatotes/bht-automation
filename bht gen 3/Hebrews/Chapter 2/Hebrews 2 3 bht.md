- Attempt 1 BHT: How can we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? The Lord Himself, the Master of angels, first brought this doctrine of salvation to us. It is not simply something we have believed, but rather, we have been helped by signs and wonders, proving that we have not believed them, but God Himself. This salvation is embodied in Jesus, who not only delivers us from foes and death, but also grants us the grace of the Spirit, forgiveness of sins, and the promise of heaven, glory, and eternal life. The difference between the law and the Gospel is the instrumentality by which each was promulgated. We, to whom God has spoken through His Son, have even more reason to give heed. This salvation was sure, just as the word spoken by angels was sure, and it was confirmed by the testimony of ear-witnesses.
