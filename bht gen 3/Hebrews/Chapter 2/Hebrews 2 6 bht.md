# Hebrews 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man, seemingly insignificant in comparison to the heavens, holds a special place in God's plan. This is especially true for Jesus, who, as the second Adam, has restored what the first Adam lost. The Psalm reference points not only to man generally, but ultimately to the Messiah. Man, subject to death because of sin, finds honor through Jesus' union with humanity. By assuming our nature, obeying, suffering, and ascending to his throne, Jesus exalts our human nature and displays God's amazing grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is far otherwise, for..."
2. "Whatever belongs to man by the constitution of his nature, belongs superlatively to that MAN, who is the constituted HEAD of man‚Äôs nature, the second Adam, who has more than recovered all that the first Adam lost."
3. "And yet, both of these are concealed and spoiled, unless we take these words of the Psalm, and the argument founded on them, of man generally, and then, and not till then, of Jesus, as man like ourselves."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul proves that it is to MAN, not to angels, that God has subjected the 'world to come.'"
2. "How insignificant in himself, yet how exalted by God's grace!"
3. "Unlike, seemingly, the lord of creation, such as he was originally, and such as he is designed to be, and such as he actually is by title and shall hereafter more fully be in the person of, and in union with, Jesus, pre-eminently the Son of man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Originally this control was given to man. It was absolute and entire. All things were subject to him, and all obeyed. Man was made a little lower than the angels, and was the undisputed lord of this lower world."
2. "The grand and ultimate reference, in Psalms 8:1-9, is to the person of the Messiah, none can reasonably doubt. Both our Lord and his apostles have affirmed it."
3. "The wonder is not yet solved; and we may well suppose that the angelic ranks look with amazement - but without envy - on the fact that 'man,' by his union with the Deity in the person of the Lord Jesus, has been raised above them in rank and in glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Hebrew interrogation, mah, what, what kind of, implies 'how small or insignificant' compared with the array of the heavenly bodies; not 'how great is man.'" 
2. "The verb only here in Hebrews, o P., very often in LXX See on Matthew 25:36. Here in the sense of graciously and helpfully regarding; caring for."
3. "He who has been described as superior to the angels, was, for a short time, on the same plane with man, and identified with an economy which was under the administration of angels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is human nature that is thus honored - human nature, not probably in its original state, but as subject to death because of sin, the chief quality in which angels excel men."
2. "Both senses are true of man as fallen and redeemed, and of Christ as incarnate and suffering."
3. "‚ÄòBut Jesus, in amazing grace, assumed our nature as His own, obeyed and suffered in our place, then took it with Him to His throne."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But one somewhere (Œ¥Œµ œÄŒøœÖ œÑŒπœÇ)."
2. "Hath testified (Œ¥ŒπŒµŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÑŒø). First aorist middle indicative of Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒøŒºŒ±, old verb to testify vigorously."
3. "The son of man (œÖŒπŒøœÇ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÖ). Not Œø œÖŒπŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÖ which Jesus used so often about himself, but literally here 'son of man' like the same words so often in Ezekiel, without Messianic meaning here."

### John Gill:
1. "nor can it so well suit with him, to be said to be made a little lower than the angels, and then crowned with glory and honour"
2. "for he was a man encompassed with infirmities; of no note and esteem among men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with griefs; was subject to death, and did die"
3. "God was 'mindful of him'; which may be expressive of his love and delight in, and choice of his human nature, to be taken into union with his divine person; and of his counsel and covenant in preparing it for him; and of his uniting it to his person; and of his providential care of it, and great affection for it"

### John Wesley:
1. "What is man ‚Äî To the vast expanse of heaven, to the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained!"
2. "The words here cited concerning dominion were doubtless in some sense applicable to Adam; although in their complete and highest sense, they belong to none but the second Adam."
3. "Or the son of man, that thou visitest him ‚Äî The sense rises: we are mindful of him that is absent; but to visit, denotes the care of a present God."
