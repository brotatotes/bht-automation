# Hebrews 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man, invested with kingly majesty on earth, was made a little lower than angels, but still not far behind the divine attributes. The Psalmist marvels at God's purpose in creating man with such honor, placing him as the ruler over the works of His hands. This honor, expressed in the exaltation of humanity, finds its ultimate realization in Jesus Christ, who assumed human nature, becoming a little lower than angels. Through His suffering, death, and resurrection, Jesus proved His superiority over the angels, now reigning over them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Man, who was left not far behind the divine attributes themselves, was also invested with kingly majesty on earth, put into the place of God Himself in sovereignty over the world."
2. "The angelic nature, being the lowest of that which is divine and heavenly, marks well the terminus just beneath which man is set."
3. "That this has only been realized in the man Christ Jesus, is not brought out till below, and forms the central point of the argument."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a little lower than the angels"; though this is not the primary reference here, but man in general.
2. "crownedst him with glory and honour‚Äîas the appointed kingly vicegerent of God over this earth"
3. "didst set him over the works of thy hands"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God had made man but little inferior to the angels in rank. He was inferior, but still God had exalted him almost to their rank."
2. "The wonder of the Psalmist is, that God had given to human nature so much honor - a wonder that is not at all diminished when we think of the honor done to man by his connection with the divine nature in the person of the Lord Jesus."
3. "That such honor should be put on 'man' is what is suited to excite amazement, and well may one continue to ask why it has been done?"

### John Calvin:
1. "A little, Œ≤œÅŒ±œá·Ωª œÑŒπ seems to refer to time, as it means a little while, and designates the abasement of Christ‚Äôs humiliation; and he confines the glory to the day of resurrection, while David extends it generally to the whole life of man."
2. "The meaning of David is this, ‚Äî 'O Lord, thou hast raised man to such a dignity, that it differs but little from divine or angelic honor; for he is set a ruler over the whole world.'"
3. "To be mindful and to visit mean the same thing, except that the second is somewhat fuller, for it sets forth the presence of God by the effect."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou madest him a little lower... to lessen, to decrease, to make less." 
2. "Beside angels" like œÄŒ±œÅŒ± with the accusative of comparison.
3. "The Psalmist refers to God's purpose in creating man with such a destiny as mastery over nature."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was made a little lower than the angels, through the assumption of the human nature, which is inferior to angels."
2. "He was made lower than they when he was deprived of the gracious presence of God, and in the time of his sufferings and death."
3. "He is now above them, though once for a while below them, and they are now subject to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou hast made him ‚Äî Adam."
2. "A little lower than the angels ‚Äî The Hebrew is, a little lower than (that is, next to) God."
3. "These words are also in a farther sense, as the apostle here shows, applicable to the Son of God."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Man, created by God, was given incredible honor and majesty on earth, just beneath the heavenly realm of the angels. This exaltation of humanity can be seen in the fact that God appointed man as His vicegerent over the works of His hands, allowing him to exercise dominion over the earth. The Psalmist marvels at this, recognizing the immense privilege and dignity bestowed upon mankind. The fulfillment of this divine purpose is ultimately realized in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who, through His incarnation, became a little lower than the angels, sharing in our humanity. Through His suffering, death, and resurrection, Jesus triumphed over the angels, now ruling over them. Hence, the Psalmist's words not only celebrate the exaltation of humanity but also foreshadow the supreme glorification of Christ.
