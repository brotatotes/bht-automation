# Hebrews 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Universal dominion was bestowed upon man at his creation, but it finds its fulfillment and assurance exclusively in Christ, who leads us into glory through suffering. While we do not yet see all things subjected to man, we do observe the prophecy being realized in Jesus' life, suffering, and death. Jesus, as the ideal man, is crowned king of nature with divine authority over creation, a reality that has not been achieved even in our modern world.

3. "He, being of our flesh and blood, and having been Himself made perfect by suffering, and calling us His brethren, can lead us up through sufferings into glory, freed from guilt by His sacrifice for our sins."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Hebrews 2:8, we see that man was originally created by God with universal dominion, the authority to rule over all things. However, this dominion is fully realized and assured only in Christ, who, being made perfect through suffering, can lead us into glory. Although we do not yet see all things subjected to man, we do see the fulfillment of this prophecy in Jesus' life, suffering, and death. Jesus, as the ideal man, is crowned king of nature and has been given divine authority over creation. It is important to note that even in the modern world, man has not achieved this goal of complete dominion.

- Attempt 3 BHT: Man was originally created to have universal dominion, but it is only through Christ that this is fully realized. As God has put all things in subjection under man, this includes both earthly and heavenly things. However, currently, we do not see all things subjected to man. Nevertheless, through Jesus' life, suffering, and death, we witness the beginning fulfillment of this prophecy. Man's sovereignty was intended to extend to the administration of the world to come, and Jesus, as the perfect human, is crowned king over all creation. Yet, even in our modern age, man has not achieved this complete dominion. Though we may not see the fulfillment now, we can be assured that in due time, Christ will have complete control over all things.
