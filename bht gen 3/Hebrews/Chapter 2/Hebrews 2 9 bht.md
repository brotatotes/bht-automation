# Hebrews 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus suffered death and was crowned with glory and honor through the grace of God. His exaltation as the divine Head of our humanity, the channel of grace, and the Captain of our salvation came as a result of his humiliation and death. Without his exaltation, his death would have been in vain, but now it is applicable for every individual. His incarnation and death on the Cross were motivated by his love and grace, and his death was not merely an example, but a surety, as he died in our place and for the whole body of the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We behold (notice the difference between the half-involuntary words 'we see' above, the impression which our eyes receive from things around us,‚Äîand the direction and intention of the contemplating eye [here, of faith: ch. iii. 19; x. 25] in this word, we behold), (namely) Jesus, on account of his suffering of death."
2. "By the grace of God (how is this to be understood? At all events we have strong Scripture analogy for such an expression....So that, in point of meaning, no difficulty need be found in the words. It was by the love and grace, the kindness and love towards men of the Father, that all Redemption was effected, and above all that One Sacrifice which was the crowning act of Redemption."
3. "And this exaltation has made Him the divine Head of our humanity‚Äîthe channel of grace, and the Captain of our salvation. Without His exaltation, his death would not have been effectual."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His exaltation after sufferings is the perfecting or consummation of His work for us: without it His death would have been ineffectual; with it, and from it, flows the result that His tasting of death is available for every man." (Hebrews 2:9)
2. "He is crowned as the Head in heaven of our common humanity, presenting His blood as the all-prevailing plea for us. This coronation above makes His death applicable for every individual man." (Hebrews 2:9)
3. "Christ [...] tasted [death] Himself, though He had no need." (Hebrews 2:9)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hence, learn Hebrews 2:6-9, from the incarnation of the Son of God, and his exaltation to heaven, what an honor has been conferred on human nature."
2. "What an honor to us it was that he should take our nature into intimate union with himself - passing by the angelic hosts, and becoming a man!"
3. "I see, therefore, the most honor done to my nature as a man, not in the deeds of proud conquerors; not in the lives of sages and philanthropists... but in the fact that the Son of God has chosen a body like my own in which to dwell; in the inexpressible loveliness evinced in his pure morals, his benevolence, his blameless life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ's exaltation and preeminence over the angels was won through humiliation and death."
2. "The humiliation is only the glory not yet begun."
3. "To be called to the office of 'apostle and high-priest of our confession'... was to be 'crowned with glory and honor,' and was a signal token of God's favor."

### John Calvin:
1. "He refers to the cause and the fruit of Christ‚Äôs death, lest he should be thought to detract anything from his dignity."
2. "For when we hear that so much good has been obtained for us, there is no place left for contempt, for admiration of the divine goodness fills the whole mind."
3. "And it is added, that this was done through the grace of God, for the cause of redemption was the infinite love of God towards us, through which it was that he spared not even his own Son."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Even Jesus... has conquered death."
2. "Jesus in his humanity was put lower than the angels 'for a little while'... Because of the suffering of death we see Jesus crowned, crowned already 'with glory and honour'."
3. "This purpose clause is pregnant with meaning... The author interprets and applies the language of the Psalm to Jesus and here puts Christ's death in behalf of, and so instead of, every man as the motive for his incarnation and death on the Cross."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus became lower than the angels, by, or through suffering death; in that respect he was lower than they, who die not; this proved him to be in a condition below them, and showed how pertinent the above words were to him, and how they were fulfilled in him."
2. "Christ died, not merely as an example, or barely for the good of men, but as a surety, in their room and stead, and that not for every individual of mankind; for there are some he knows not; for some he does not pray; and there are some who will not be saved."
3. "The word 'man' is not in the original text, it is only œÖœÄŒµœÅ œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøœÇ, which may be taken either collectively, and be rendered 'for the whole'; that is, the whole body, the church for whom Christ gave himself, and is the Saviour of; or distributively, and be translated, 'for everyone'; for everyone of the sons God brings to glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is done only with regard to Jesus, God-Man, who is now crowned with glory and honour - As a reward for his having suffered death."
2. "He was made a little lower than the angels ‚Äî Who cannot either suffer or die."
3. "That by the grace of God, he might taste death ‚Äî An expression denoting both the reality of his death, and the shortness of its continuance."
