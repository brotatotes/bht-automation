# Hebrews 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The New Testament Messiah, as the Son of the house, is above Moses, the servant, because He a) is above him who was only the servant of the house, and b) because He has finished the work of bringing Israel into rest. As the Apostle and High Priest, He is the Ambassador sent by the Father, pleading the cause of God with us and our cause with God. We are called to fix our eyes and minds on Him, considering Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The New Test. Messiah is above Moses, because He a) of Himself, as Son of the house (iii. 6), is above him who was only the servant of the house (compare with iii. 5,â€“i. 14), and b) because the work, of bringing Israel into rest, which was not finished by Moses, is now finished by Him (iv. 1 ff.)."
2. "The Son of the house of Israel higher than the servant of the house, iii. 1â€“6."
3. "The invitation, or summons, of God, calling men to His glory in Christâ€”and hence the state which is entered by them in pursuance of that calling."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whence, that is, seeing we have such a sympathizing Helper you ought to 'consider attentively,' 'contemplate'; fix your eyes and mind on Him with a view to profiting by the contemplation (Hebrews 12:2)."
2. "There is but one Greek article to both nouns, 'Him who is at once Apostle and High Priest'â€”Apostle, as Ambassador (a higher designation than 'angel'-messenger) sent by the Father, pleading the cause of God with us; High Priest, as pleading our cause with God."
3. "The words 'of our profession,' mark that it is not of the legal ritual, but of our Christian faith, that He is the High Priest. Paul compares Him as an Apostle to Moses; as High Priest to Aaron. He alone holds both offices combined, and in a more eminent degree than either, which those two brothers held apart."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The character and work of the Son of God are worthy of the profound and prayerful consideration of every man; and especially every Christian should reflect much on him."
2. "The Lord Jesus, under the new dispensation, filled the place of Moses and of the high priest under the old, and that the office of 'apostle' and 'high priest,' instead of being now separated, as it was between Moses and Aaron under the old dispensation, was now blended in the Messiah."
3. "It became necessary, therefore, to show that all that was dignified and valuable in that [high priest] office was to be found in the Christian system."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Wherefore [Î¿Î¸ÎµÎ½] . Drawing a conclusion from ch. 2 9 - 18."
2. "Holy brethren [Î±Î´ÎµÎ»Ï†Î¿Î¹ Î±Î³Î¹Î¿Î¹] . The phrase N. T. o. jAdelfoi brethren, in address, is not found in the Gospels."
3. "The calling comes from that world and is to that world. See ch. Hebrews 13:14."

### John Calvin:
1. "If then we seek rightly to know him, we must inquire what sort of being he is; yea, he must be clothed with his own power, lest we lay hold on an empty shadow and not on him."
2. "We ought not therefore to regard this as said only to the Jews, but that it is a general truth addressed to all who desire to come into the kingdom of God; they ought sedulously to attend to Christ, for he is the sole instructor of our faith, and has confirmed it by the sacrifice of himself."
3. "The calling of the godly cannot be otherwise confirmed than by a thorough surrender of themselves to Christ. We ought not therefore to regard this as said only to the Jews, but that it is a general truth addressed to all who desire to come into the kingdom of God; they ought sedulously to attend to Christ, for he is the sole instructor of our faith, and has confirmed it by the sacrifice of himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Holy brethren. No mere complimentary title, but descriptive of the blessed brotherhood to which Christ and all who believe belong."
2. "Partakers of, partners in a â€˜callingâ€™ that comes from heaven and leads to it, besides giving the tastes and spirit appropriate to our destiny."
3. "The true reading is Jesus simply, with special reference to His human nature and His connection with ourselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The call comes from heaven and is to heaven in its appeal."
2. "Consider...Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession."
3. "They do not begin to understand what Jesus is and means if they are tempted to give him up."

### John Gill:
1. "They all had the same Father, belonged to the same family, were the adopted sons of God, the brethren of Christ, of one another, and of the apostle."
2. "an internal special call of grace, to the enjoyment of the blessings of grace here, and to glory hereafter; and which is not according, to works, but according to the grace of God, and is by powerful, efficacious, and irresistible grace."
3. "The high priest among the Jews was, on the day of atonement, considered as 'an apostle', or 'messenger'."

### John Wesley:
1. "The heavenly calling â€” God calls from heaven, and to heaven, by the gospel."
2. "Consider the Apostle â€” The messenger of God, who pleads the cause of God with us."
3. "And High Priest â€” Who pleads our cause with God. Both are contained in the one word Mediator."
