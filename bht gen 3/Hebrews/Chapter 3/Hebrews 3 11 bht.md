## BHT:
The threat in Hebrews 3:11 extends beyond the exclusion from the literal land of rest. The promised rest for believers is yet to be fulfilled, aligning with Christ's beatitude. Swearing signifies the certainty of God's punishment, while the correlation between the oath and disobedience emphasizes God's determination and the consequences.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the threat extended farther than the exclusion of the unbelieving from the literal land of rest"
2. "the rest promised to the believing in its full blessedness was, and is, yet future"
3. "Christ's own beatitude (Matthew 5:5) all accord with this"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God is often represented in the Scriptures as 'swearing' - and usually as swearing by himself, or by his own existence. Of course, this is figurative and denotes a strong affirmation, or a settled and determined purpose."
2. "The word 'if' has this negative meaning in Hebrew, and this meaning is transferred to the Greek word 'if.' It is called 'my rest' here, meaning that it was such rest as God had provided, or such as he enjoyed."
3. "The particular 'rest' referred to here was that of the land of Canaan, but which was undoubtedly regarded as emblematic of the 'rest' in heaven. Into that rest, God solemnly said they should never enter."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord calls the land, where they might have had their dwelling, his rest."
2. "For nowhere can we have a settled dwelling, except where we are fixed by his hand."
3. "By no chastisement could they have been restored to a sound mind, but they continually added new offenses."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Hebrews 3:11. So; rather ‚Äòas,‚Äô though without much difference in meaning: the acts corresponded to the punishment is the meaning of ‚Äòas;‚Äô the punishment corresponded to the acts is the meaning of so. The former is the common meaning of the Greek.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As I sware (œâœÇ œâŒºŒøœÉŒ±). 'Correlating the oath and the disobedience' (Vincent)." 
2. "They shall not enter (Œµ ŒµŒπœÉŒµŒªŒµœÖœÉŒøŒΩœÑŒ±). Future middle of ŒµŒπœÉŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒ± with Œµ as an anacoluthon for the Hebrew im (not)." 
3. "Into my rest (ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÄŒ±œÖœÉŒπŒΩ ŒºŒøœÖ). Old word from Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÄŒ±œÖœâ (Hebrews 4:8), to give rest, in LXX, in N.T. only in Acts 7:49; Hebrews 3:11-4."

### John Gill:
1. "Swearing is ascribed to God, to show the certainty of the thing spoken of; as of mercies, when he swears in love, and by his holiness; so here, of punishment, when he swears in wrath, in indignation, in sore displeasure, and the threatened evil is irrevocable and inevitable."
2. "into the land of Canaan, called God's rest, because he promised it, and gave it to the Israelites as their rest; and where he himself had a place of rest; and where he gave the Messiah, the author of peace and rest; and which was a type of heaven, that rest from toil and labour, which remains for the people of God."
3. "for the Jews say, 'the generation of the wilderness have no part in the world to come:' but this seems too harsh, for doubtless there were many who died in the wilderness, that went safe to heaven, notwithstanding all their sins and provocations."
