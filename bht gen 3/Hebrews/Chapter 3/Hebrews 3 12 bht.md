- Attempt 1 BHT: Beware, my brethren, of cultivating an evil heart that lacks belief, leading you to drift away from the presence of our living God. This unbelief that the Hebrews are being cautioned against is not just a simple act of disobedience or disbelief, but a rejection of the personal union with God that faith brings. It is a departure from the God who is the source of all life, holiness, and happiness. Just as the Israelites were warned against apostasy, we too must be vigilant in our faithfulness to Christ, for to turn away from Him is to apostatize from the very God we have found in Him. Therefore, let us hold fast to our trust in the faithful Christ and guard against the treacherous inclinations of our hearts.
