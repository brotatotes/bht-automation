# Hebrews 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us exhort ourselves and one another within the church, for we have the power to help and encourage towards salvation. We must not be deceived by the deceitfulness of sin, allowing it to harden our hearts and lead us astray. Tomorrow is Satan's today; we must not delay in pursuing righteousness. This is the day of grace, where salvation through Christ is attainable, but we must be vigilant against the trickery of sin. Let us exhort and comfort one another daily, while it is still called Today, for this opportunity will not last forever.
