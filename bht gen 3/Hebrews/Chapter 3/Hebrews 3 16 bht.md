# Hebrews 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites, as a collective, provoked God through their unbelief, leading to their exclusion from entering His rest. This warning against apostasy urges us to consider who provoked God and reminds us that a good beginning does not guarantee a good ending. Many of God's chosen people failed to reach the Promised Land due to their disobedience, ultimately perishing in their sin. Let us be cautious against unbelief and draw inspiration from the faithful few who remained devoted to God in the midst of adversity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The faithful exceptions are overlooked, and the whole of Israel is included in the provocation, to make the exhortation fall more forcibly on the readers."
2. "You need indeed to be careful against unbelief:‚Äîfor on account of this very unbelief all our fathers were excluded."
3. "And to whom sware He that they should not enter into His rest, except to those who disobeyed."

2. "The 'For' implies, Ye need to take heed against unbelief: for, was it not because of unbelief that all our fathers were excluded?"
3. "'Nay (why need I put the question?), was it not all that came out of Egypt?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The truth was that a large proportion of them rebelled against God, and provoked him to indignation."
2. "Like the Hebrews who heard God speak from Mount Sinai, it is possible that those who witness the mercies of God in redemption may be in danger of abusing all those mercies and perishing."
3. "The exception [of those who did not rebel] was so small that the apostle had no scruple in saying in general that they were all rebellious."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "They were those who had fairly begun their journey to Canaan, as you have begun your Christian course. They provoked God, so may you."
3. "So far from its being true that a good ending necessarily follows a good beginning, a whole generation of God's chosen people failed to reach the Land of Promise because they provoked God."

2. "The whole people were justly condemned for unbelief when the body was torn and mutilated by the defection of the greatest part."
3. "As God forbids you to follow the unbelief of the fathers, so he sets before you other fathers whose faith is to be your example."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Who (Œ§ŒπŒΩŒµœÇ). Clearly interrogative, not indefinite (some)."
2. "Did provoke (œÄŒ±œÅŒµœÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±ŒΩŒ±ŒΩ). First aorist active indicative of œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒπŒΩœâ, apparently coined by the LXX like œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±œÉŒºŒøœÇ (verse Hebrews 3:15) to which it points, exasperating the anger of God."
3. "Nay, did not all (Œ±ŒªŒª' ŒøœÖ œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ). 'A favourite device of the diatribe style' (Moffatt), answering one rhetorical question with another (Luke 17:8) as in verses Hebrews 3:17; Hebrews 3:18, There was a faithful minority mentioned by Paul (1 Corinthians 10:7)."

### John Gill:
1. "The aggravation of their sin is, that they did it when they had heard the Gospel, and while they were hearing it; which shows that the Gospel may be heard to no advantage."
2. "Hence the Gospel heard, comes to be an aggravation of men's condemnation."
3. "God will have a few to serve him in the worst of times."

### John Wesley:
1. "An awful consideration! The whole elect people of God (a very few excepted) provoked God presently after their great deliverance..."

3. "[They] perished in their sin!"
