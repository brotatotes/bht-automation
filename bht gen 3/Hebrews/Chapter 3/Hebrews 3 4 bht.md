# Hebrews 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every house is established by someone, and the house of God is no exception. The Son, being God, is the one who established this spiritual house. This proves Christ's superiority over Moses, as He is not only the Establisher of all things, but also of the house itself. It is important to note that while Christ is the instrumental Establisher, His role does not diminish God's role as the general Foundership. Therefore, Christ's position as the builder of all things confirms His divinity and places Him above Moses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every house is established by someone... arrangement implies an arranger, design a designer."
2. "He, as the Son, is He that established the house of God."
3. "The sentiment itself is entirely irrelevant here. If the Writer was proving Christ to be greater than Moses inasmuch as He is God, the founder of all things, then clearly the mere assertion of this fact would have sufficed for the proof."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Someone must be the establisher of every house."
2. "Christ, as being instrumentally the Establisher of all things, must be the Establisher of the house, and so greater than Moses."
3. "He who established all things, and therefore the spiritual house in question, is God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Every family must have a founder; every dispensation an author; every house a builder."
2. "The Lord Jesus is worthy of more honor than Moses. He is so, as the maker of a house deserves more honor than the house."
3. "Being, therefore, over all things, and at the head of all dispensations, he must be more exalted than Moses."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that built all things is God." 
2. "The application of built or established to Christ is guarded against possible misapprehension. Christ is the establisher, but not by any independent will or agency."
3. "The special foundership of Christ does not contradict or exclude the general foundership of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are then to understand that nothing is done in the Church which ought not to be ascribed to God's power." 
2. "He alone has founded it by his own hand."
3. "It will appear that how much soever God may use the labors of men in building his Church, yet he himself performs everything â€” the instrument derogates nothing from the workman."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Is God (Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï‚). God is the Creator of all things and so of his "house" which his Son, Jesus Christ, founded and supervises. 


### John Gill:
1. "For every house is built by some man....this is true of houses properly taken, or improperly, as nations, tribes, families, and kindred, of the whole church in general, of particular congregations, and of individual believers..."
2. "...the apostle's design is to bring down the high esteem the Jews had of Moses, that they might rightly value Christ."
3. "Christ has built all things, and therefore he is God, and must be infinitely above Moses;...all which prove him to be God, and above Moses."

### John Wesley:
1. Now Christ, he that built not only this house, but all things, is God - And so infinitely greater than Moses or any creature.
