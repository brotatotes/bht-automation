# Hebrews 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The caution in question warns against hardening one's heart, emphasizing the people's murmuring and lack of faith at Rephidim. This initial offense is sternly reproved as it can pave the way for further transgressions. Harden not carries the connotation of stirring up bitterness and irritability. The wanderings in the wilderness were characterized by provocations and temptations, such as demanding bread and water, the golden calf incident, and rejecting the opportunity to enter Canaan. Rebellion against God arises from deliberate wickedness and the hindrance of His grace. We must remain cautious against acquiring a habitual hardness of heart through neglecting worship, keeping bad company, and succumbing to lesser sins.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Harden not your hearts‚ÄîThis phrase here only is used of man's own act; usually of God's act."

2. "In order to resist the appeals of God, people must resort to the means of 'voluntarily' hardening the heart. This they do by setting themselves against the truth; by the excuses which they offer for not becoming Christians."
3. "The word 'wilderness' in the Scriptures commonly means a 'desert'... One provocation was in demanding bread at Sin; a second for want of water at Massah or Meribah; a third time at Sinai with the golden calf; a fourth time at Taberah for want of flesh; a fifth time at Kadesh when they refused to go up into Canaan, and the oath came that they should die in the wilderness."

3. "We are not to defer too much to the authority of the fathers lest it should draw us away from God...David distinctly commanded their children to beware of being like them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two words which are here translated ‚Äòprovocation‚Äô and ‚Äòtemptation‚Äô are in the Hebrew proper names, 'Meribah' (strife) and 'Massah' (temptation)."
2. "Their wanderings began and ended in tempting and proving God; forty years long did their unbelief last."
3. "Not for single acts were they finally condemned, but for settled habits and a fixed character."
