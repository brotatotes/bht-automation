### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Let us fear therefore, lest, a promise being still left us, any one of you appear to have fallen short of it. This present verse is crucial to understanding the nature of the rest mentioned, as it signifies not the land of Canaan, but rather the heavenly home foreshadowed by the earthly rest. We are called to fear, not with slavish terror, but with godly fear and trembling, recognizing the peril and danger that lies before us. The promise of God's rest remains unchanged and trustworthy, and to think that we have come too late to inherit it is to disbelieve in God's unchangeable promise. Just as the Israelites perished due to their disbelief, we too face a real peril if we fail to trust in the promise of God's rest.
