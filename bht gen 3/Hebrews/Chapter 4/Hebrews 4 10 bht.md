# Hebrews 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have entered into God's rest have ceased from their works, just as God rested from His own. This rest is not mere abstinence from labor, but a state of refreshment and beneficent activity, a union with God where we find true happiness and satisfaction. While we may not fully attain this rest in this life, we should strive for it, knowing that a fuller rest awaits us.
