## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let us therefore approach with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may receive compassion."
2. "and find grace for help in time."
3. "This is decidedly the right interpretation, and not as many Commentators and the A.V. 'in time of need,' 'as often as we want it,' which would be both flat, and hardly justified by usage."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "comeâ€”rather as Greek, 'approach,' 'draw near.'"
2. "boldlyâ€”Greek, 'with confidence,' or 'freedom of speech'."
3. "A supply of grace is in store for believers against all exigencies; but they are only supplied with it according as the need arises."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A throne of grace is designed to represent a sovereign seated to dispense mercy and pardon."
2. "We come not depending on our own merits, but we come where a sufficient sacrifice has been offered for human guilt; and where we are assured that God is merciful."
3. "Even when pardoned, we need grace to keep us from sin, to aid us in duty, to preserve us in the day of temptation."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is hence obvious to conclude, that under the Papacy the light of the Gospel is extinct, for miserable men are bidden to doubt whether God is propitious to them or is angry with them."
2. "For we must hold this principle, â€” that Christ is not really known as a Mediator except all doubt as to our access to God is removed; otherwise the conclusion here drawn would not stand, 'We have a high priest Who is willing to help us; therefore we may come bold and without any hesitation to the throne of grace.'"
3. "The import of the whole is, that we are to call upon God without fear, since we know that he is propitious to us, and that this may be done is owing to the benefit conferred on us by Christ."

1. "But with the trust that tells all its wants to the throne of grace."
2. "We need continual forgiveness for continual sin."
3. "Whatever we need to perfect our holiness and happiness, those gifts of free favour which prove God to be our friend."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let us keep on coming to our high priest, this sympathizing and great high priest. Instead of deserting him, let us make daily use of him." 
2. "Hence we should come 'with boldness', telling Jesus the whole story of our shortcomings." 
3. "We are sure to gain both of these aims because Jesus is our high priest on the throne."

### John Gill:
1. "And coming to him as a priest upon his throne is very proper...since he stands in the relations of a Father, husband, and brother, and from him they may expect receive mercy...and in him they may hope to find grace."
2. "This coming to him is a sacerdotal act, for every believer is a priest...and is not local, but spiritual, and with the heart, and by faith; and chiefly regards the duty of prayer."
3. "This may be done 'boldly'; or 'with freedom of speech'; speaking out plainly all that is in the heart, using an holy courage and intrepidity of mind, free from servile fear, and a bashful spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let us therefore come boldly - Without any doubt or fear."
2. "Unto the throne of God, our reconciled Father."
3. "Even his throne of grace - Grace erected it, and reigns there, and dispenses all blessings in a way of mere, unmerited favour."
