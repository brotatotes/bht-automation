# Hebrews 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The good news of rest has been proclaimed to both us and them, but the word heard did not benefit them because they did not have faith in what they heard. They did not correspond with faithful hearers in their reception of the word, just as those who did not enter the earthly Canaan did not have faith. It is not enough to simply hear the word; it must be received in faith and digested like food. Those who are disobedient and separate themselves from the Christian community are like Korah, and they will not receive the promised rest.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stress is not, 'we, as well as they:' but lies on have good tidings been preached, which includes both us and them."
2. "Nevertheless the word of [their] hearing did not profit them, unmingled as they were in faith with its hearers."
3. "And so these men received no benefit from 'the word of hearing,' because they were not one in faith with its hearers; did not correspond, in their method of receiving it, with faithful hearers, whom it does profit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They should look beyond to the heavenly land of rest, to which faith is the avenue, and from which unbelief excludes, as it did from the earthly Canaan."
2. "The word heard being the food which, as the bread of life, must pass into flesh and blood through man's appropriating it to himself in faith. Hearing alone is of as little value as undigested food in a bad stomach."
3. "The disobedient, instead of being blended in 'the same body,' separated themselves as Korah: a tacit reproof to like separatists from the Christian assembling together."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The good news, or glad tidings of 'rest' is announced to us as really as it was to them." 
2. "They derived no advantage from it...what they hear exerts no saving influence on their hearts." 
3. "If properly received; if mixed or united with faith, [the word of God] becomes the means of spiritual support and life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reference is to the special announcement of the rest of God; the glad tidings that God has provided a rest for his people."
2. "The emphasis is on the entire statement, 'we have had the good tidings proclaimed to us,' rather than on we as contrasted with they."
3. "The word did not profit them because it (the word) was not assimilated by faith in those that heard. They did not make the promise of rest their own."

### John Calvin:
1. "The calling of God will in no degree be more profitable to us than it was to them, except we make it sure by faith."
2. "Faith is not to be separated from the word, and the word separated from faith can confer no good."
3. "The hearing must ever precede faith, and that indeed that we may know that God speaks and not men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For unto us has the Gospel been preached as well as unto them, i.e we both have our Gospel or glad tidings of a future rest, equally a Divine message, though given with different degrees of fulness."
2. "But the word heard (literally, of hearing), was of no use to them, brought no profit, because they were not united (literally ‘mingled’) by (and in) faith with them that heard it."
3. "The word ‘not united,’ ‘unmingled,’ is found only here and in 1 Corinthians 12:24, and describes a state that follows from affinity and sympathy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us... to bring good news, used here in its original sense..."
2. "We have the promise of rest as the Israelites had. The parallel holds as to the promise, the privilege, the penalty."
3. "The word of hearing... the word marked by hearing (the word heard)."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel is the good news and glad tidings of salvation by Christ; [...] when they preach Christ and salvation alone by him."
2. "The Gospel is a report of Christ, his person and offices; of his great love to sinners, and of what he has done for them; but though it is a word of hearing, a report made, and the word preached, yet to some it is unprofitable;"
3. "The Gospel is as food, and faith is the hand that receives it, and takes it, and tastes of it, and eats it, and concocts and digests it; and when this is the case, it is profitable and nourishing."

### John Wesley:
1. "The word which they heard did not profit them - So far from it, that it increased their damnation."
