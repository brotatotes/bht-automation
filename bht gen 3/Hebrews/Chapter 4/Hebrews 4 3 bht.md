# Hebrews 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promised rest, which we as believers are called to enter, is a future reality that characterizes us. God's works were finished from the foundation of the world, yet the rest we are to enter has not yet been obtained. It is a rest that remains for the people of God in heaven. The condition for entering this rest is faith, as those who did not believe were not permitted to enter. God's promise of rest still stands, and as believers, we can be sure that we will enter in, trusting in His word.
