# Hebrews 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's rest is not a result of weariness or idleness; rather, it is the continuous upholding and governing that began with Creation. This rest is not limited to a single day, but an enduring state that believers will enter into in the future. It's worth noting that God's rest does not mean a complete cessation of creative activity, as confirmed by Jesus in John 5:17. Genesis 2:2 attests to the ongoing nature of God's rest, reflecting a deep sense of satisfaction and delight in what He has accomplished.
