# Hebrews 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The failure of individuals does not negate God's purpose, as the promise of entering His rest still stands. Those who did not believe and disobeyed were unable to enter, but this does not nullify the promise for believers. The rest was not prepared in vain; it awaits those who have faith and enter into it. This reveals that God's rest is not meant to be empty, but rather filled with those who trust and obey Him.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since there is a rest spoken of in the Scriptures, implying that it is to be enjoyed by some, and since they to whom it was first promised did not inherit it, it follows that it must still be in reserve."
