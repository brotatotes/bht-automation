# Hebrews 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The objection that those who entered the promised land with Joshua fulfilled God's rest is confirmed, but if Canaan was that rest, God would not have spoken of another day to enter it. Canaan was a symbol, not the complete rest God intended. The verse refers to a future divine rest, distinct from Canaan. Joshua, a type of Jesus, led the people to Canaan, but Christ offers a spiritual rest as the true Savior.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Confirmation can be found in the verse for the objection that those who entered the promised land with Joshua did enter into God's rest. However, if the rest of God meant Canaan, God would not have later spoken of another day of entering the rest. The rest in Canaan did not fulfill the divine ideal of rest. Joshua, whose name is the Greek form of Jesus, led the people into Canaan but it was not the complete rest that God intended. The land of Canaan was not as valued except for being an image and symbol of the spiritual inheritance. The verse speaks of a divine rest that is different from the rest of Canaan and is still future.

The divine rest referred to in the passage is yet to be entered, and it is distinct from the rest experienced in Canaan.
