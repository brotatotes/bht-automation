# Hebrews 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rest mentioned in the passage is not a temporary one but a higher and nobler rest. It is a rest from weariness, sorrow, and sin, and a rest in the completion of God's new creation. This rest, known as the Sabbath-rest or Sabbatism, marks the ideal rest where everything is perfectly adjusted to God. It is the consummation of the new creation in Christ. This rest, which remains for the people of God, is a spiritual rest that believers have in Christ, and it is an eternal rest that awaits them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The people of God, doubtless with a reference to the true spiritual character of Israelites indeed, represented under their external name."
2. "Their rest is no longer a 'rest' merely, but (see below) is called by a higher and nobler name."
3. "Therefore...there is yet reserved...a keeping of sabbath...for the people of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a restâ€”Greek, 'Sabbatism.' In time there are many Sabbaths, but then there shall be the enjoyment and keeping of a Sabbath-rest: one perfect and eternal."
2. "Rest from weariness, sorrow, and sin; and rest in the completion of God's new creation."
3. "The whole renovated creation shall share in it; nothing will there be to break the Sabbath of eternity; and the Triune God shall rejoice in the work of His hands."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There remaineth, therefore, a rest... that according to the Scriptures there is 'now' a promise of rest made to the people of God... It is 'still' true that the promise of rest pertains to 'all' the people of God of every generation."
2. "It properly means 'a keeping Sabbath'... and refers undoubtedly to heaven, as a place of eternal rest with God."
3. "To the Christian it is the subject of the highest joy in anticipation that heaven is to be 'one long unbroken' Sabbath - an eternity of successive Sabbath hours."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Man's portion in the divine rest inaugurated at creation has never been really appropriated: but it still remaineth."
2. "The Sabbath rest points back to God's original rest, and marks the ideal rest - the rest of perfect adjustment of all things to God."
3. "The Sabbath-rest is the consummation of the new creation in Christ, through whose priestly mediation reconciliation with God will come to pass."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore there remains (still unrealized in any rest that Israel then enjoyed) a sacred rest, a Sabbath-rest (the word is now changed), for the people of God." 
2. "The use of the word Sabbath in this sense for the rest which God provides under the Gospel was quite familiar to the Jews." 
3. "Into that rest all enter who believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A sabbath rest..." (ÏƒÎ±Î²Î²Î±Ï„Î¹ÏƒÎ¼Î¿Ï‚). Late word from ÏƒÎ±Î²Î²Î±Ï„Î¹Î¶Ï‰ (Exodus 16:30) to keep the Sabbath, apparently coined by the author (a doubtful passage in Plutarch). Here it is parallel with ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Ï€Î±Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚ (cf. Revelation 14:13).
2. "For the people of God..." (Ï„Ï‰ Î»Î±Ï‰ Ï„Î¿Ï… Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï…). Dative case of blessed personal interest to the true Israel (Galatians 6:16).

### John Gill:
1. "There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God." 
2. "the rest which remains for them is not a new sabbath day, but a sabbatism"
3. "rather this intends the spiritual rest believers have in Christ under the Gospel dispensation"

### John Wesley:
1. Therefore â€” Since he still speaks of another day, there must remain a farther, even an eternal, rest for the people of God.
