# Hebrews 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, addressed and saluted by God, was formally recognized as High Priest after being 'made perfect.' His obedience was perfected through suffering, subjecting Himself to the law's requirements. Melchizedek bears resemblance to Christ, as both share characteristics of priesthood, installation, and serve as an eminent type of each other. Concealing the true identity of Melchizedek, the Holy Spirit highlighted his role as a priest and king of Jerusalem. Ultimately, Jesus is known as 'the Son of God.'

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Being formally recognized by God as High Priest at the time of His being 'made perfect'." 
2. "He was High Priest already in the purpose of God before His passion."
3. "After [His passion], when perfected, He was formally addressed so."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Called of God - Addressed by him, or greeted by him."
2. "The word used here does not mean that he was 'appointed' by God, or 'called' to the office, in the sense in which we often use the word, but simply that he was 'addressed' as such."
3. "Whether the word 'priest,' or 'high priest,' be used here, does not affect the argument of the apostle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He learned His obedience, not sympathy merely, nor merely priestly fitness for His work. Though Son, with all the love and trust of a Divine Son, He yet acquired and manifested a measure of obedience which else had been unattainable."
2. "He was made, moreover, under the law subject to its requirements. Created under it, He was to be judged by it; and though this subjection was His own act, it was as complete as if He had claimed His descent entirely from the first transgressor."
3. "His suffering was obedience, His obedience was intensest suffering from the beginning of His public ministry even to its close; and if He was subject to the laws of human growth, faculties strengthened by reason of use, emotion made more mighty and more tender, obedience more easy by repetition, we may say that as Christ was truly man His obedience was learned and perfected by suffering."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Named of God (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ±Œ≥ŒøœÅŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµŒπœÇ). First aorist passive participle of œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ±Œ≥ŒøœÅŒµœÖœâ, old verb to salute, to address, only here in N.T. Common in Plutarch. 


### John Gill:
1. "There is a resemblance between Melchizedek and Christ; many things that are said of the one, agree with the other."
2. "There is a likeness in Melchizedek to Christ; in his person, and what is said of him, that he was without father and mother; and in his office as a priest, and in the manner of his instalment into it; and in the antiquity, dignity, and perpetuity of it."
3. "This does not so much design the constitution of Christ as priest, nor the call of him to that office, as the denomination or surnaming of him a priest of Melchizedek's order, because of the agreement between them."

### John Wesley:
1. "His name is, 'the Son of God.'"
2. "The Holy Ghost seems to have concealed who Melchisedec was, on purpose that he might be the more eminent type of Christ."
3. "This only we know, - that he was a priest, and king of Salem, or Jerusalem."
