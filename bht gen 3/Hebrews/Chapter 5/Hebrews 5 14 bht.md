# Hebrews 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Solid food, or strong meat, is for the spiritually mature who have cultivated their spiritual senses to discern between good and evil, which refers to excellence and inferiority in doctrine, not moral qualities. By continually practicing and habitually exercising these senses, full-grown men gain the ability to distinguish between sound and unsound teaching. This discernment is not based on personal experience or carnal reasoning, but on the Scriptures of truth. They are able to comprehend the deeper truths of the faith and engage in these matters with ease and readiness.
