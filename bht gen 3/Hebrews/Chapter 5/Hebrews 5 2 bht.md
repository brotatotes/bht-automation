# Hebrews 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest is called to be compassionate towards the ignorant and erring, making allowances for their weaknesses and showing leniency. His duty is not to please himself, but to sympathize with the sinner and plead with God on their behalf. Despite his own infirmities, he must withhold irritation and indulgence, understanding the frailty and deception that can lead astray. This compassion is necessary because the priest himself is encompassed with weaknesses, enabling him to effectively intercede for guilty and misguided people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "being (one who is) able (this clause is closely bound to the last, and belongs to it, not to the whole sentence) to be compassionate towards the ignorant and erring"
2. "towards those who [possibly after all] are ignorant and deluded"
3. "ignorance and error, being the results of weakness, with which he himself is encompassed"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The high priest is taken from among men, in order that he may have a fellow-feeling for those on whose behalf he officiates."
2. "He is liable to err; He is subject to temptation; he must die, and appear before God - and encompassed with these infirmities, he is better qualified to minister in behalf of guilty and dying people."
3. "They are of like passions with others. They are sinners; they are dying men. They can enter into the feelings of those who are conscious of guilt; they can sympathize with those who tremble in dread of death; they can partake of the emotions of those who expect soon to appear before God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is not identical with sunpaqhsai(ch. 4 5), but signifies to be moderate or tender in judgment toward another's errors."
2. "The high priest must not be betrayed into irritation at sin and ignorance, neither must he be weakly indulgent."

3. "The sum of what is said is, that Christ is a brother to us... so that he is led, and as it were formed, to show forbearance and kindness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The true position of a priest in relation to those who are not only suffering, but are also guilty, is between the two. His is a blended feeling of sorrow and blame."
2. "The persons for whom the priest acts are not innocent, or the function would cease; they are sinners, and are described as ignorant and out of the way."
3. "All men are blameably ignorant, and are out of the way; every sin is want of knowledge, as well as want of wisdom; we all have gone astray, and for all the priest acts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If the priest is cordially to plead with God for the sinner, he must bridle his natural disgust at the loathsomeness of sensuality, his impatience at the frequently recurring fall, his hopeless alienation from the hypocrite and the superficial, his indignation at any confession he hears from the penitent" (Dods).
2. "The one article with both participles probably makes it a hendiadys, sins of ignorance (both accidence and sudden passion) as opposed to high-handed sins of presumption and deliberate purpose."
3. "The priest himself has weakness lying around him like a chain. Not so Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Who can have compassion on the ignorant... pities them, and sympathizes with them... and bears with them with great moderation and temper."
2. "and on them that are out of the way... who transgress the law of God, and err from it."
3. "for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;... he was 'clothed' with it... as Joshua the high priest was with filthy garments."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who can have compassion â€” In proportion to the offence: so the Greek word signifies."
2. "Seeing himself also is compassed with infirmity â€” Even with sinful infirmity; and so needs the compassion which he shows to others."
3. "And the wandering â€” Them that are in sin."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The high priest, being able to be compassionate towards the ignorant and erring, is not to please himself, but rather to show leniency and make allowances for their weaknesses. Despite his own infirmities, he must refrain from being irritated or indulgent, bridling his natural disgust and impatience. He is called to sympathize and plead with God for the sinner, understanding the frailty and deception that can lead them astray. This compassion is necessary because the priest himself is encompassed with weaknesses, not unlike the individuals he ministers to. It is through this compassionate understanding that the priest can effectively intercede on behalf of guilty and misguided people, who, like all humanity, are prone to ignorance and sin.
