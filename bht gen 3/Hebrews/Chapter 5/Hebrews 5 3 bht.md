# Hebrews 5:3 Commentary Help Text

The high priest, due to his own infirmities, is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins. This duty applies not just to the people but also to himself, and it stems from the awareness that the priest, being a sinner, requires the same atonement he promotes to others. However, Christ's priesthood sets him apart. While other priests have their own sins to atone for, Christ has none, yet he offers sacrifices on behalf of others, demonstrating the uniqueness of his role.
