# Hebrews 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The office of the high priest, exemplified by Aaron, was not one that could be taken upon oneself or obtained through any unjust means. It was a divine appointment, an ideal that finds its fulfillment in Christ, the Great High Priest who is a lawful and unquestionable priest called by God. In the Christian faith, while all believers have a metaphorical priesthood, ministers must also be God-called individuals, refraining from self-imposed or unauthorized positions. The authority to appoint priests and accept offerings ultimately rests with God alone.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse reminds us that the office of the high priest, like Aaron's, is a divine appointment that cannot be taken upon oneself. This underscores the importance of a God-called minister in the Christian faith, as all Christians, whether ministers or people, have a metaphorical priesthood and are part of a priesthood of all believers. Christ alone, as the Great High Priest, had the true sacrifice to offer. It is necessary for the high priest, or any minister, to be divinely called and not push themselves into the ministry or ecclesiastical office. We must recognize that the appointment to priesthood, and the acceptance of offerings by God, belong solely to Him.
