# Hebrews 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ did not appoint Himself as the Son of God or the High Priest, but it was God the Father who declared Him to be His Son and bestowed upon Him the glory and honor of the priesthood. This divine appointment as High Priest was necessary because only the divine Son could fulfill such an office. Jesus did not seek this honor for Himself, but humbly received it from the Father. Thus, the priesthood of Christ is an essential part of His identity as the Son.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thus Christ also (as well as those others) did not glorify HIMSELF to be made High Priest... but He (i. e. the Father) who spake to Him, Thou art my Son, I have this day begotten thee."
2. "The true account seems to be this: the word glorified contains in it the whole process of exaltation [through suffering] by which the Lord Jesus has attained the heavenly High Priesthood."
3. "He did not constitute himself the Son of God, in virtue ultimately of which sonship He became High Priest. And therefore in proving this, the sacred Writer adduces first the declaration of the Father which sets forth this His generation as Son of God, on which all His process of glorification depended, and then... the direct declaration of his High Priesthood, also by the Father."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Hebrews 5:5: 'but he that saidâ€”that is, the Father glorified Him or appointed Him to the priesthood. This appointment was involved in, and was the result of, the Sonship of Christ, which qualified Him for it.'"
2. "Hebrews 5:5: 'None but the divine Son could have fulfilled such an office.'"
3. "Hebrews 5:5: 'Christ did not constitute Himself the Son of God, but was from everlasting the only-begotten of the Father. On His Sonship depended His glorification, and His being called of God, as Priest.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that Jesus was not ambitious; that he did not obtrude himself into the great office of high priest; he did not enter upon its duties without being regularly called to it."
2. "Thou art my Son - Psalms 2:7. It is used here with reference to the designation to the priestly office, though in the Psalm more particularly to the anointing to the office of king."
3. "The propriety of this application is founded on the fact that the language in the Psalm is of so general a character, that it may be applied to 'any' exaltation of the Redeemer, or to any honor conferred on him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He did not glorify himself, but God who styled him 'son' glorified him."
2. "Thou art my Son is introduced thus in close connection with the call to the priesthood, in recognition of the fact that the priesthood of Christ had its basis in his sonship."
3. "Christ's priestly vocation ceases to be an accident in his history, and becomes an essential characteristic of his position as Son: sonship, christhood, priestliness, inseparably interwoven."

### John Calvin:
1. "The begetting of Christ, of which the Psalmist speaks, was a testimony which the Father rendered to him before men."
2. "What sort of Son did God manifest to us? One indued with no honor, with no power? Nay, one who was to be a Mediator between himself and man; his begetting then included his priesthood."
3. "Christ did not make himself a high priest but God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These requisites of the high priests are all found in Christ, and found in Him in such a degree as proves Him to be superior to all others."
2. "Thus Christ also (as well as others) glorified not himself, took not the honour upon Himself to be made High Priest."
3. "Others who regard the quotation as giving honour to the Son without making that honour an assertion of His Priesthood, interpret simply Christ did not Himself assume the office of Priest; God who acknowledges Him as His Son in a sense that raises Him above all creatures, God gives Him the office."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus had divine appointment as high priest also."
2. "Jesus himself repeatedly claimed that the Father sent him on his mission to the world."
3. "Clearly the Father nominated the Son to the Messianic priesthood."

### John Gill:
1. "It was a glorifying of Christ, to make him an high priest; not as God, for as such no addition can be made to his glory."
2. "But Christ did not take this high and honourable office to himself, nor the glory of it; indeed, he did not receive it from man, nor was he made a priest according to the ceremonial law."
3. "These words are taken out of Psalms 2:7, and they are not to be considered as constitutive of Christ's priesthood, as if that was intended by the begetting of him as a Son; but as descriptive of the person, who called him to it, who stood in the relation of a Father to Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "So also Christ glorified not himself to be an high priest...did not take this honour to himself, but received it." 
2. "[Christ] received it from him who said, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
3. "Not, indeed, at the same time; for his generation was from eternity."
