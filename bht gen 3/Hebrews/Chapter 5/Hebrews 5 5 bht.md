# Hebrews 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's appointment as a high priest after the order of Melchizedek was not an accident, but a result of his eternal Sonship. The Father's declaration, Thou art my Son, was a testimony of the divine appointment already involved in Christ's eternal generation. This appointment glorified Christ, as he did not assume the honor himself, but received it from the Father. His divine appointment as high priest was an essential characteristic of his position as the Son and another aspect of his mission sent by the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But He (i. e. the Father) who spake to Him, Thou art my Son, I have this day begotten thee (...) asserts, that such divine appointment was wrapped up and already involved in that eternal generation to the Sonship which was declared in these words."
2. "The word glorified contains in it the whole process of exaltation [through suffering] by which the Lord Jesus has attained the heavenly High Priesthood. This whole process was not his own work, but the Father's."
3. "He, in whom all the theocratic promises find their fulfilment, in whom the true Kingdom of God comes and is summed up, was to be, as in Zech, vi. 12 ff., 'a priest upon His throne,' and such a priest [i. e. necessarily High Priest, if a King; as indeed the word is given in ver. 10 and ch. vi. 20], as should be after the order of Melchisedec."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "glorified not himselfâ€”did not assume the glory of the priestly office... without the call of God" 
2. "This appointment was involved in, and was the result of, the Sonship of Christ, which qualified Him for it."
3. "Christ did not constitute Himself the Son of God, but was from everlasting the only-begotten of the Father."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul claimed that Christ held that office; but, as he was not descended from Aaron, and as no one might perform its duties without being regularly called to it, it was incumbent on him to show that Jesus was not an intruder, but had a regular vocation to that work."
2. "But he that said unto him - That is, he who said to him 'Thou art my Son,' exalted him to that office. He received his appointment from him. This was decisive in the case, and this was sufficient, if it could be made out, for the only claim which Aaron and his successors could have to the office, was the fact that they had received their appointment from God."
3. "The propriety of this application is founded on the fact that the language in the Psalm is of so general a character, that it may be applied to 'any' exaltation of the Redeemer, or to any honor conferred on him. It is used here with strict propriety, for Paul is saying that Jesus did not exalt 'himself,' and in proof of that he refers to the fact that God had exalted him by calling him his 'Son'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He did not glorify himself, but God who styled him 'son' glorified him." 
2. "The priesthood of Christ had its basis in his sonship." 
3. "'Christ's priestly vocation ceases to be an accident in his history, and becomes an essential characteristic of his position as Son: sonship, christhood, priestliness, inseparably interwoven' (Bruce)."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must however bear especially in mind what we said on the first chapter; that the begetting of Christ, of which the Psalmist speaks, was a testimony which the Father rendered to him before men."
2. "Now, what sort of Son did God manifest to us? One indued with no honor, with no power? Nay, one who was to be a Mediator between himself and man; his begetting then included his priesthood."
3. "It is the same as though he had said, 'Christ did not make himself a high priest but God.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These requisites of the high priests are all found in Christ, and found in Him in such a degree as proves Him to be superior to all others."
2. "Thus Christ also (as well as others) glorified not himself, took not the honour upon Himself to be made High Priest."
3. "Others who regard the quotation as giving honour to the Son without making that honour an assertion of His Priesthood, interpret simply Christ did not Himself assume the office of Priest; God who acknowledges Him as His Son in a sense that raises Him above all creatures, God gives Him the office."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus had divine appointment as high priest also."
2. "Clearly the Father nominated the Son to the Messianic priesthood."
3. "Jesus himself repeatedly claimed that the Father sent him on his mission to the world."

### John Gill:
1. "It was a glorifying of Christ, to make him an high priest; not as God, for as such no addition can be made to his glory; yea, it was a condescension in him to become a priest: but as man."
2. "It was an honour to the human nature to be united to the Son of God; and to be separated from others to this office; and to be called unto it, qualified for it, and invested with it."
3. "These words are...not to be considered as constitutive of Christ's priesthood, as if that was intended by the begetting of him as a Son; but as descriptive of the person, who called him to it, who stood in the relation of a Father to Christ, and Christ in the relation of a Son to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ glorified not himself to be an high priest...did not take this honour to himself, but received it from him..." 
2. "...Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee..." 
3. "...his generation was from eternity."
