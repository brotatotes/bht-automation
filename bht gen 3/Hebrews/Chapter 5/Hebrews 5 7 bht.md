## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He was heard, not in the sense of the cup passing away from Him, which indeed was not the prayer of his cautious fear,‚Äîbut in strength being ministered to Him to do and to suffer that will of his Father, to fulfil which was the prayer of that cautious fear‚Äî 'not my will but thine be done.'"
2. "Christ was a Son: as a Son, He was ever obedient, and ever in union with His Father‚Äôs will: but His special obedience, that course of submission by which He became perfected as our High Priest, was gone through in Time, and matter of acquirement for Him, and practice, by suffering."
3. "In the words, all them that obey Him, there is probably an allusion to 'His obedience' above. As he obeyed the Father, so must we obey Him, if we would be brought to that 'eternal salvation' into which he has led the way."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His crying and tears were part of the experimental lesson of obedience which He submitted to learn from the Father."
2. "His cry showed His entire participation of man's infirmity: His reference of His wish to the will of God, His sinless faith and obedience."
3. "His prayer was 'heard' in His Father's strengthening Him so as to hold fast His unwavering faith under the trial and soon removing it in answer to His cry."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Son of God wept - and if he poured forth tears it cannot be wrong for us. Besides, it is a great law of our nature that in suffering we should find relief by tears."
2. "The fact that the Son of God thus wept should be allowed deeply to effect our hearts... That man must have a hard heart who has never had an emotion when he has reflected that the Son of God wept, and bled, and died for him."
3. "A prayer may be 'heard' and yet not literally answered; it may be acceptable to God, though it may not consist with his arrangements to bestow the very blessing that is sought."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To save him from death may mean to deliver him from the fear of death, from the anguish of death, or from remaining a prey to death. In either case, the statement connects itself with the thought of Christ 's real humanity."
2. "He was under the pressure of a sore human need which required divine help, thus showing that he was like unto his brethren."
3. "He was heard, for his prayer was answered, whatever it may have been. God was able to save him from death altogether. He did not do this. He was able to sustain him under the anguish of death, and to give him strength to suffer the Father 's will : he was also able to deliver him from death by resurrection : both these he did."

### John Calvin:
1. "His wonderful goodness shines forth especially in this respect, that he for our good subjected himself to our infirmities." 
2. "We may conclude that God often hears our prayers, even when that is in no way made evident. For though it belongs not to us to prescribe to him as it were a fixed rule, nor does it become him to grant whatsoever requests we may conceive in our minds or express with our tongues, yet he shows that he grants our players in everything necessary for our salvation."
3. "He then obtained what he prayed for, when he came forth a conqueror from the pains of death, when he was sustained by the saving hand of the Father, when after a short conflict he gained a glorious victory over Satan, sin, and hell."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having offered up and being heard... He learned obedience, etc. All the tenses refer to one and the same process of discipline; they describe His life not in distinct and successive portions, but as a whole, though no doubt the description is specially true of His final agony."
2. "His tears are also once named at least (Luke 19:41), and seem implied in such passages as Matthew 26:38; Matthew 27:46. The very agony of the final struggle has its prelude at an earlier stage (John 12:27), and was not without its parallel even in the wilderness."
3. "And God heard Him, not by delivering Him from the necessity of dying, not even by raising Him from the dead, but by strengthening Him to bear all (Luke 22:43), and by making the pangs of death the birth-throes of an endless life for him, and for all who were to believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Since Jesus was 'without sin' he did not have to offer sacrifices 'for himself,' yet in all other points he felt the sympathy of the human high priest, even more so by reason of his victory over sin." (Commentary)
2. "Supplications. The word ŒπŒ∫ŒµœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøœÇ is an adjective from ŒπŒ∫ŒµœÑŒ∑œÇ (a suppliant from ŒπŒ∫œâ, to come to one) and suggests one coming with an olive-branch (ŒµŒªŒ±ŒπŒ±). Here only in the N.T." (Commentary)
3. "Having been heard for his godly fear. Fine picture of Christ's attitude toward the Father in the prayer in Gethsemane and in all his prayers. Jesus in Gethsemane at once surrendered his will to that of the Father who heard his plea and enabled him to acquiesce in the Father's will." (Commentary)

### John Gill:
1. "The days of Christ's flesh were filled up with prayers and supplications, so should ours be also." 
2. "Christ's crying and tears were confined to the days of his flesh, or to the time of his life here on earth, so shall ours be also." 
3. "He was heard because of his fear, or reverence; either because of the dignity and reverence of his person, in which he was had by God; or because of his reverence of his Father."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thrice. With strong crying and tears - In the garden." 
2. "But what he most exceedingly feared was the weight of infinite justice; the being 'bruised' and 'put to grief' by the hand of God himself."
3. "Throughout his whole life, he showed that it was not the sufferings he was to undergo, but the dishonour that sin had done to so holy a God, that grieved his spotless soul."
