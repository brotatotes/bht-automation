## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He was heard, not in the sense of the cup passing away from Him, which indeed was not the prayer of his cautious fear,â€”but in strength being ministered to Him to do and to suffer that will of his Father, to fulfil which was the prayer of that cautious fearâ€” 'not my will but thine be done.'"
2. "Christ was a Son: as a Son, He was ever obedient, and ever in union with His Fatherâ€™s will: but His special obedience, that course of submission by which He became perfected as our High Priest, was gone through in Time, and matter of acquirement for Him, and practice, by suffering."
3. "He was made, by means of that course which ended in His perfection. In the words, all them that obey Him, there is probably an allusion to 'His obedience' above."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His crying and tears were part of the experimental lesson of obedience which He submitted to learn from the Father (when God was qualifying Him for the high priesthood)."
2. "The tears" are an additional fact here communicated to us by the inspired apostle, not recorded in the Gospels, though implied."
3. "The cup of death He prayed to be freed from was, not corporal, but spiritual death, that is, the (temporary) separation of His human soul from the light of God's countenance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the days of his flesh - When he appeared on earth as a man... The particular time here referred to, evidently, was the agony in the garden of Gethsemane."
2. "Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus John 11:35, and over Jerusalem; Luke 19:41. It is not 'improper' to weep. The Son of God wept - and if he poured forth tears it cannot be wrong for us."
3. "No one can doubt that Jesus offered the prayer of faith; and it is as little to be doubted, if he referred in the prayer to the death on the cross, that it was not 'literally' answered... Christians, even in the highest exercise of faith, are not inspired to know what is best for them, and as long as this is the case, it is possible that they may ask for things which it would not be best to have granted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "During his mortal life."
2. "He appealed to one who could answer his prayer."
3. "He was heard on account of his godly fear."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, he says, did not undergo death and other evils because he disregarded them or was pressed down by no feeling of distress, but he prayed with tears, by which he testified the extreme anguish of his soul."
2. "Whenever our evils press upon us and overwhelm us, we may call to mind the Son of God who labored under the same; and since he has gone before us there is no reason for us to faint."
3. "Thus it often happens that we ask this or that, but not for a right end; yet God, not granting what we ask, at the same time finds out himself a way to succor us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having offered up and being heard ... He learned obedience." 
2. "These prayers and entreaties were addressed unto him that was able to save from death, and he was heard in that he feared."
3. "And God heard Him, not by delivering Him from the necessity of dying, not even by raising Him from the dead, but by strengthening Him to bear all, and by making the pangs of death the birth-throes of an endless life for him, and for all who were to believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Since Jesus was 'without sin' he did not have to offer sacrifices 'for himself,' yet in all other points he felt the sympathy of the human high priest." 
2. "An allusion to the Agony of Christ in Gethsemane."
3. "A reference to the cry of Jesus in Gethsemane."

### John Gill:
1. "When he had offered up prayers and supplications; as he often did in many parts of his life, particularly in the garden, and upon the cross, when he offered up himself."
2. "With strong crying and tears; with a most vehement outcry, with a loud voice, as when on the cross... which shows the weight of sin, of sorrow, and of punishment, that lay upon him."
3. "He was always heard by him, and so he was in the garden, and on the cross; and was carried through his sufferings, and was delivered from the fear of death, and was saved from the dominion and power of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having offered up prayers and supplications â€” Thrice. With strong crying and tears â€” In the garden." 
2. "But what he most exceedingly feared was the weight of infinite justice; the being 'bruised' and 'put to grief' by the hand of God himself." 
3. "Indeed, his human nature needed the support of Omnipotence; and for this he sent up strong crying and tears: but, throughout his whole life, he showed that it was not the sufferings he was to undergo, but the dishonour that sin had done to so holy a God, that grieved his spotless soul."
