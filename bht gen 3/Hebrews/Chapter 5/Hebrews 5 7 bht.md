## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were all in subjection to the will of the Father: they were all parts of his œÑŒµŒªŒµŒØœâœÉŒπœÇ, by virtue of which He is now, in the fullest and most glorious sense, our High Priest."
2. "being made perfect, became the cause of eternal salvation to all who obey Him, being addressed by God as High Priest after the order of Melchisedek."
3. "Christ was a Son: as a Son, He was ever obedient, and ever in union with his Father‚Äôs will; but ·º° ·ΩëœÄŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒÆ, His special obedience, that course of submission by which He became perfected as our High Priest, was gone through in Time, and matter of acquirement for Him, and practice, by suffering."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His crying and tears were part of the experimental lesson of obedience which He submitted to learn from the Father."
2. "His holy filial love must rightly have shrunk from this strange and bitterest of trials without the imputation of impatience."
3. "His prayer was 'heard' in His Father's strengthening Him so as to hold fast His unwavering faith under the trial and soon removing it in answer to His cry during the darkness on the cross."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They who maintain that the prayer of faith is always literally answered, must hold that the Christian is under such a guidance of the Spirit of God that he cannot ask anything amiss."
2. "A prayer may be 'heard' and yet not literally answered; it may be acceptable to God, though it may not consist with his arrangements to bestow the very blessing that is sought."
3. "To show this was an object of inestimable value, and much as it cost the Saviour was worth it all. So now it is worth much to see what Christian piety can endure; what strong temptations it can resist; and what strength it has to bear up under accumulated woes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To save him from death may mean to deliver him from the fear of death, from the anguish of death, or from remaining a prey to death."
2. "He was under the pressure of a sore human need which required divine help, thus showing that he was like unto his brethren."
3. "He was heard, for his prayer was answered, whatever it may have been. God was able to save him from death altogether. He did not do this. He was able to sustain him under the anguish of death, and to give him strength to suffer the Father 's will : he was also able to deliver him from death by resurrection : both these he did."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, he says, did not undergo death and other evils because he disregarded them or was pressed down by no feeling of distress, but he prayed with tears, by which he testified the extreme anguish of his soul."
2. "Even this, that whenever our evils press upon us and overwhelm us, we may call to mind the Son of God who labored under the same; and since he has gone before us there is no reason for us to faint."
3. "And hence we may conclude that God often hears our prayers, even when that is in no way made evident. For though it belongs not to us to prescribe to him as it were a fixed rule, nor does it become him to grant whatsoever requests we may conceive in our minds or express with our tongues, yet he shows that he grants our prayers in everything necessary for our salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Prayers and supplications. The word for ‚Äòprayers‚Äô expresses a deep feeling of need; the word ‚Äòsupplications‚Äô is a term taken from the olive branch wrapped with wool which was held out of old as an earnest entreaty for protection and help."
2. "With strong crying and tears; with a most vehement outcry, an outcry of intensest feeling."
3. "And God heard Him, not by delivering Him from the necessity of dying, not even by raising Him from the dead, but by strengthening Him to bear all, and by making the pangs of death the birth-throes of an endless life for him, and for all who were to believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In all other points he felt the sympathy of the human high priest, even more so by reason of his victory over sin."
2. "ŒºŒµœÑŒ± Œ∫œÅŒ±œÖŒ≥Œ∑œÇ ŒπœÉœáœÖœÅŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ± Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÅœÖœâŒΩ... a picture of the scene in Gethsemane (anguish and pathos)."
3. "Jesus in Gethsemane at once surrendered his will to that of the Father who heard his plea and enabled him to acquiesce in the Father's will."

### John Gill:
1. "In the time of his humiliation, when he was attended with the sinless infirmities of the flesh, or human nature..."
2. "With a most vehement outcry, with a loud voice, as when on the cross; and though there is no mention of his tears at that time, or when in the garden, no doubt but he shed them..."
3. "He was always heard by him, and so he was in the garden, and on the cross; and was carried through his sufferings, and was delivered from the fear of death, and was saved from the dominion and power of it, being raised from the dead by his Father..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who in the days of his flesh ‚Äî Those two days, in particular, wherein his sufferings were at the height."
2. "And being heard in that which he particularly feared - When the cup was offered him first, there was set before him that horrible image of a painful, shameful, accursed death, which moved him to pray conditionally against it."
3. "Indeed, his human nature needed the support of Omnipotence; and for this he sent up strong crying and tears: but, throughout his whole life, he showed that it was not the sufferings he was to undergo, but the dishonour that sin had done to so holy a God, that grieved his spotless soul."
