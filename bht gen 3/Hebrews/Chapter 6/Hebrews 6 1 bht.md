# Hebrews 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us press on to maturity by leaving behind the discussion of the beginning and the doctrines of washings and laying on of hands. Like a builder leaving the foundation in erecting a building, it is important for us to have a firm foundation, but we must not remain stuck only in laying the foundation. Instead, let us go on to the stage of adults, able to digest solid spiritual food and press forward in our faith, leaving the rudiments behind and striving for a more perfect knowledge of God's truth.
