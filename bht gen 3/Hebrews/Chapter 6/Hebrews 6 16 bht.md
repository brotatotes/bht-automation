# Hebrews 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
An oath serves as a lawful and conclusive means to settle disputes and confirm promises. Christians are reminded of the legitimacy of swearing an oath, in contrast to the views of those who wish to abolish it. When men swear by someone greater, it establishes the truthfulness of their statements. However, God's own oath carries unparalleled weight, confirming His promises with unwavering certainty. Believers should recognize the importance of oaths as a religious practice, providing assurance and putting an end to contradictions in disputes.
