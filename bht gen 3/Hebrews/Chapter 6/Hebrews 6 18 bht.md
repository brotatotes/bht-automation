# Hebrews 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's promise and oath, both unchangeable, provide strong consolation and encouragement. Jesus, our holy refuge, governs with strength and is a fortress to those who trust in Him. By laying hold upon the hope set before us, the promise apprehended by faith, we can find solace in the unwavering and trustworthy nature of God's Word. This hope, received by faith, is not a mere abstract promise, but rather the assurance that comes from believing in the unchangeable counsel and oath of our faithful God.
