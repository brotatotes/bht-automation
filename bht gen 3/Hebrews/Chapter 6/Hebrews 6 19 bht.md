# Hebrews 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hope, our anchor of the soul, is not satisfied with merely earthly and visible goods, but penetrates even to those within the veil, fastening on heavenly goods. It makes those that are earthly become heavenly and gives the strength to cling to God Himself and His promises. Life without this blessed hope based on Christ would be hopeless. The anchor of hope, though unseen, will not slip or lose its grip. It enters into heaven and provides firmness and security, allowing us to endure the storms of life.

2. "Hope, entering within heaven, hath made us already to be in the things promised to us, even while we are still below, and have not yet received them; such strength hope has, as to make those that are earthly to become heavenly."
3. "The soul clings, as one in fear of shipwreck to an anchor, and sees not whither the cable of the anchor runsâ€”where it is fastened: but she knows that it is fastened behind the veil which hides the future glory."
