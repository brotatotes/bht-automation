# Hebrews 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers of Jewish background easily transitioned to the Christian practices of baptism and the laying on of hands, which paralleled Jewish purifications and John's baptism. These practices represented the elementary principles of the doctrine of Christ and shed new light on the tenets of resurrection and eternal judgment already held by the Jews.

Resurrection and eternal judgment are foundational beliefs that transcend earthly matters.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jewish believers passed, by an easy transition, from Jewish baptismal purifications, baptism of proselytes, and John's baptism, and legal imposition of hands, to their Christian analogues, baptism, and the subsequent laying on of hands, accompanied by the gift of the Holy Ghost."
2. "The six particulars here specified had been, as it were, the Christian Catechism of the Old Testament; and such Jews who had begun to recognize Jesus as the Christ immediately on the new light being shed on these fundamental particulars, were accounted as having the elementary principles of the doctrine of Christ."
3. "Resurrection, held already by the Jews from the Old Testament: confirmed with clearer light in Christian teaching or 'doctrine.' Eternal judgmentâ€”judgment fraught with eternal consequences either of joy or of woe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There are two baptisms whose necessity is taught by the Christian religion - baptism by water, and by the Holy Spirit; the first of which is an emblem of the second."
2. "Still, if it be regarded as a 'simple form of admission to a church,' without claiming that it is enjoined by God, or that it is connected with any authority to impart the Holy Spirit, no objection can be made to it any more than there need be to any other form of recognizing Church membership."
3. "The belief of the resurrection of the dead is an elementary article in the system of Christianity. It lies at the foundation of all our hopes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning here is lustral rites in general, and may include the baptism of John and Christian baptism." 
2. "Both resurrection and future judgment were Jewish tenets requiring exposition to Jewish converts as regarded their relations to the same doctrines as taught by Christianity." 
3. "The phrase eternal judgment expresses a judgment which shall transcend all temporal judgments; which shall be conducted on principles different from those of earthly tribunals."

### John Calvin:
1. "For what is the doctrine of baptism but what he mentions here, faith in God, repentance, judgment, and the like?"
2. "And this passage tends to confirm pedobaptism; for why should the same doctrine be called as to some baptism, but as to others the imposition of hands, except that the latter after having received baptism were taught in the faith, so that nothing remained for them but the laying on of hands?"
3. "To understand the different things mentioned in the first two verses, we must consider the particulars stated in the 4th and the 5th verses; they are explanatory of each other."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The plural Î²Î±Ï€Ï„Î¹ÏƒÎ¼Ï‰Î½ 'by itself does not mean specifically Christian baptism either in this epistle (Hebrews 9:10) or elsewhere (Mark 7:4), but ablutions or immersions such as the mystery religions and the Jewish cultus required for initiates, proselytes, and worshippers in general' (Moffatt)."
2. "'The laying on of hands' seems to us out of place in a list of elementary principles, but it was common as a sign of blessing (Matthew 19:13), of healing (Mark 7:32)... in the bestowal of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:17; Acts 19:6), in separation for a special task (Acts 13:3), in ordination (1 Timothy 4:14; 1 Timothy 5:22; 2 Timothy 1:6)."
3. "The resurrection of the dead (both just and unjust, John 5:29; Acts 24:15) is easily seen to be basal (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:0) as well as eternal judgment (timeless and endless)."

### John Gill:
1. "But now, since this blood was shed, they were no more to teach nor learn the doctrine of cleansing by the blood of Christ this way; nor any more to be led unto it through these divers baptisms, ablutions, and purifications."
2. "It has no reference to the right of laying on of hands by the apostles, either in private persons, or officers of churches; but to the rite of laying on of hands of the priests, and of the people, upon the head of sacrifices."
3. "These are doctrines of pure revelation, and were taught under the Old Testament, and were believed by the generality of the Jews, and are articles which they hold in common with us Christians; yet the believing Hebrews were not to rest in the knowledge of these things, and in the smaller degrees of light they had in them, under the former dispensation; but were to go on to perfection, and bear forward towards a greater share of knowledge of these, and other more sublime doctrines of grace."
