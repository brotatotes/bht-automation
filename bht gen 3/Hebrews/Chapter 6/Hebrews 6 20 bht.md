# Hebrews 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in His role as our High Priest, has gone before us and entered a place where we long to be. His ascension was not for Himself, but rather for us, to open the way into fellowship with God. As our forerunner, He ensures that we can follow Him into the presence of God. In contrast to the Levitical high priest, who could only enter on behalf of the people, Jesus invites us to share in His intimate relationship with the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'where' of the Greek implies being IN a place: 'whither' is understood to 'entered,' taken out of 'where'; whither Jesus entered, and where He is now."
2. "The 'for us' implies that it was not for Himself, as God, He needed to enter there, but as our High Priest, representing and introducing us, His followers, opening the way to us, by His intercession with the Father."
3. "Christ's ascension is our promotion: and whither the glory of the Head has preceded, thither the hope of the body, too, is called."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No man can be a Christian who does not do this, or who does not desire to be perfect as God is perfect."
2. "True piety is 'principle.' It is not fancy, or dreaming, or visions, or enthusiasm. It is based on knowledge, and does not go 'beyond' that."
3. "What encouragement there is, therefore, to labor in the promotion of his glory, and to do all we can for the advancement of his kingdom!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Levitical high priest did not enter the sanctuary as a forerunner, but only as the people's representative. He entered a place into which none might follow him; in the people's stead, and not as their pioneer."
2. "The peculiarity of the new economy is that Christ as high priest goes nowhere where his people cannot follow him. He introduces man into full fellowship with God."
3. "The significance of this sin lies in the mental and spiritual condition which it betrays. It is the recoil of conviction from Christ and the adoption of the contrary conviction."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whither as forerunner Jesus has entered for as, having become after the order of Melchisedec a High Priest for ever." 
2. "The Levitical high priest entered the Holy of Holies on behalf of the people, as Christ also entered into the Holiest of all."
3. "The 'priest for ever' of the Psalm is now changed into 'high priest,' a title made appropriate by the fact that it is not into the holy place simply, but into the immediate presence of God, He is gone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus has shown us the way, has gone on ahead, and is the surety and guarantor of our own entrance later."
2. "Our anchor of hope with its two chains of God's promise and oath has laid hold of Jesus within the veil."
3. "There he functions as our great high priest, better than Aaron for he is 'after the order of Melchizedek.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the most excellent runner; there is none like him; there is none that can come up to him; he has out ran and exceeded all others; he has performed in the best manner; he has run out his race first, and has entered into heaven first by his own blood."
2. "He has cleared the way thither, and opened the gates of heaven for his people; and is a guide and pattern for them to follow."
3. "He is entered into heaven for them, as man and Mediator, and as their high priest; where he represents their persons, appears and intercedes for them, takes care of their affairs, and presents their services; prepares mansions of glory for them, and takes possession of heaven in their name, and opens the way for them to follow him thither."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ who is gone before us is infinitely superior to us."
2. "What an honour is it to believers, to have so glorious a forerunner."
3. "Now appearing in the presence of God for them."
