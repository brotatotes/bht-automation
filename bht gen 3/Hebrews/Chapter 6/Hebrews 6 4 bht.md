## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if we go back, it will be to perditionâ€”a thing which we do not think of you and therefore expect your advance."
2. "It is impossible... for those who have been once enlightened... and have tasted of the heavenly gift."

2. "'Enlightened' here means knowledge of the word of truth."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "An examination of those phrases will show that he refers to those who are sincere believers."

### John Calvin:

2. "He falls away who forsakes the word of God, who extinguishes its light, who deprives himself of the taste of the heavens or gift, who relinquishes the participation of the Spirit. Now this is wholly to renounce God."

1. "As touching those who were once enlightened... The metaphorical sense here occurs in Polybius and Epictetus." 
2. "Tasted of the heavenly gift... usually with genitive as here." 
3. "Partakers of the Holy Ghost... These are all given as actual spiritual experiences."

### John Gill:
1. "But rather such are meant, who are so enlightened as to see the evil effects of sin, but not the evil that is in sin; to see the good things which come by Christ, but not the goodness that is in Christ; so as to reform externally, but not to be sanctified internally; to have knowledge of the Gospel doctrinally, but not experimentally; yea, to have such light into it, as to be able to preach it to others, and yet be destitute of the grace of God."
2. "Now there are some who have a saving spiritual taste of this gift; for though God's people, while unregenerate, have no such taste; their taste is vitiated by sin, and it is not changed; sin is the food they live upon, in which they take an imaginary pleasure, and disrelish every thing else; but when regenerated, their taste is changed, sin is rendered loathsome to them; and they have a real gust of spiritual things, and especially of Christ, and find a real delight and pleasure in feeding by faith upon him; whereby they live upon him, and are nourished up unto eternal life."
3. "But then such can never so fall away as to perish: a believer indeed may be without the sensible presence of the Spirit; the graces of the Spirit may be very low, as to their exercise; and they may not enjoy his comforts, gracious influences, and divine assistance; but the Spirit of God never is, in the above sense, in a castaway; where he takes up his dwelling, he never quits it; if such could perish, not only his own glory, but the glory of the Father, and of the Son, would be lost likewise."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is impossible for those who were once enlightened â€” With the light of the glorious love of God in Christ."
2. "And have tasted the heavenly gift â€” Remission of sins, sweeter than honey and the honeycomb."
3. "And been made partakers of the Holy Ghost â€” Of the witness and the fruit of the Spirit."

- Attempt 1 BHT: If we turn back from our faith, it will lead to destruction. It is impossible for those who have experienced the knowledge of the truth, tasted the sweetness of remission of sins, and become real sharers in the Holy Spirit to be renewed again to repentance if they fall away. The enlightenment they received should have been enough to prevent them from abandoning their faith. This heavenly gift, the Holy Spirit, is the transformative power that enables believers to see the evil effects of sin and the goodness that is found in Christ. Those who have experienced this spiritual taste have a real delight and pleasure in feeding on Christ and are nourished unto eternal life. Even though believers may experience seasons of spiritual dryness, the Spirit of God never abandons them. If they could perish, it would not only affect their own glory, but also the glory of the Father and the Son. Therefore, let us continue to press on towards perfection and rely on the enlightening work of the Spirit to keep us from falling away.
