# Hebrews 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have once experienced the power of Christ's sacrifice but now reject it have committed an offense of grave magnitude. In doing so, they crucify Christ anew and bring shame upon his name. Their chance for repentance becomes impossible, for they have fallen away from the faith and are devoid of God's Spirit. Only by a miracle of God's grace can they be restored, for this is a solemn reminder of the severe consequences that await those who deny Christ and the unfathomable depth of their transgression.

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "Nor is this inconsistent with other parts of Scripture, where Godâ€™s mercy is offered to sinners as soon as they sigh for it, (Ezekiel 18:27;) for repentance is required, which he never truly feels who has once wholly fallen away from the Gospel; for such are deprived, as they deserve, of Godâ€™s Spirit and given up to a reprobate mind, so that being the slaves of the devil they rush headlong into destruction."
2. "In short, the Apostle warns us, that repentance is not at the will of man, but that it is given by God to those only who have not wholly fallen away from the faith."
3. "But when any one rises up again after falling, we may hence conclude that he had not been guilty of defection, however grievously he may have sinned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a terrible picture and cannot be toned down."
2. "They crucify Christ."
3. "To make an example of, and in bad sense to expose to disgrace."

### John Gill:
1. "for, to renew them again unto repentance, is a thing impossible: [...] the apostle says is a thing 'impossible': the meaning of which is not only that it is difficult; or that it is rare and unusual; or that it is unsuitable and improper; but it is absolutely impossible" 
2. "it is impossible for ministers to renew them, to restore and bring them back, by true repentance; yea, it is impossible to God himself, not through any impotence in him, but from the nature of the sin these men are guilty of"
3. "this being the case, it makes their renewal to repentance impossible; because, as before observed, the sin they commit is unpardonable; it is a denial of Christ, who gives repentance; and such who sin it must arrive to such hardness of heart as to admit of no repentance"

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle here describes the case of those who have cast away both the power and the form of godliness; who have lost both their faith, hope, and love..." (Hebrews 6:6).
2. "It is impossible to renew them again to repentance... seeing they crucify the Son of God afresh." (Hebrews 6:6).
3. "And put him to an open shame â€” Causing his glorious name to be blasphemed." (Hebrews 6:6).

- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who have once known the power of Christ's sacrifice and yet reject it face a terrifying possibility: they cannot be renewed again to repentance. Their offense is grave, as they crucify Christ afresh and put him to open shame. This rejection reflects a denial of the meaning and virtue once attached to his crucifixion. Their conscience is seared, and they become like those who are twice dead, past hope unless God's grace works a miracle in their hearts. The enormity of this offense is impossible to tone down. They have fallen away from the Gospel, and without true repentance, they are deprived of God's Spirit and given over to destruction.
