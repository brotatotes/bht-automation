## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "but if it bear thorns and thistles is accounted worthless (‚Äòreprobate,‚Äô tried and found wanting. Being thus rejected, it gets no share of God‚Äôs blessing), and nigh unto cursing."
2. "There is considerable doubt both as to the connexion, and as to the interpretation of the sense when obtained. To what does of what, or whose, belong? to 'land,' or to 'cursing'?"
3. "The reference clearly is, as the whole context, and the finality of the expression 'whose end is unto' shew, not to purifying, but to consuming fire."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But if it (the 'land,' :-) bear; not so favorable a word as 'bringeth forth,' Hebrews 6:7, said of the good soil."
2. "The 'nigh' softens the severity of the previous 'It is impossible.'"
3. "The end is unto burning, namely, with the consuming fire of the last judgment."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "For such a man - in the church or out of it - we should have compassion. We have some compassion for an ox which is so stubborn that he will not work - and which is to be put to death; for a horse which is so fractious that it cannot be broken, and which is to be killed; for cattle which are so unruly that they cannot be restrained, and which are only to be fattened for the slaughter; and even for a field which is desolate and barren, and which is given up to be overrun with briars and thorns; but how much more should we pity a man all the efforts for whose salvation fail, and who is soon to be abandoned to everlasting destruction!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The contrast is between two classes of Christians under equally favorable conditions, out of which they develop opposite results."
2. "It is exposed to the peril of abandonment to perpetual barrenness."

2. "Rejected (Œ±Œ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒπŒºŒøœÇ). See 1 Corinthians 9:27; Romans 1:28."
3. "To be burned (ŒµŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±œÖœÉŒπŒΩ). 'For burning.' Common sight in clearing up ground."

### John Gill:
1. "Carnal professors, and especially apostates... may be compared, who are worldly, slothful, defrauding and overreaching, carnal and wanton."
2. "The things or actions produced by them are aptly expressed by 'thorns and briers'; such as errors, heresies, and evil works of all kinds."
3. "Such men are cursed already by the law, being under its sentence of curse and condemnation; and are nigh to the execution of it."
