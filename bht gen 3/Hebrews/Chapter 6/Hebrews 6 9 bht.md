## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved... that they may not think him their foe and hater, but might know that he is ardent with Christian love towards them."
2. "The things which are better... as regards your ultimate end. The latter is most probably the reference, seeing that what follows rests on God's ultimate faithfulness and justice in the day of retribution."
3. "Akin to salvation, if even we do thus speak."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "LOVE to you prompts me in the strong warnings I have just given, not that I entertain unfavorable thoughts of you; nay, I anticipate better things of you." 
2. "A confirmation of the Pauline authorship of this Epistle."
3. "Things that are linked unto salvation...In opposition to 'nigh unto cursing'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We confidently hope for better things respecting you. We trust that you are true Christians; that you will produce the proper fruits of holiness; that you will be saved."
2. "The form of expression seems to refer to what was said in Hebrews 6:8. The land overrun with briars was 'nigh' to cursing; the things which Paul saw in them were 'nigh' to salvation."
3. "Is not this verse a clear proof that Paul felt that it was certain that true Christians would never fall away and be lost? If he supposed that they might, how could he be persuaded that it would not happen to them? Why not to them as well as to others? Hence, learn that while we assure people that if they should fall away they would certainly perish we may nevertheless address them with the full persuasion that they will be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beloved. Only here in the epistle. It often suggests an argument."
2. "We are persuaded. We are firmly convinced. The verb indicates a past hesitation overcome."
3. "That accompany salvation. He is persuaded that they will give heed to all things which attend the work of salvation and will enjoy all that attaches to a saved condition."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever wishes to do good by teaching, ought so to treat his disciples as ever to add encouragement to them rather than to diminish it, for there is nothing that can alienate us more from attending to the truth than to see that we are deemed to be past hope."
2. "The Apostle then testifies that he thus warned the Jews, because he had a good hope of them, and was anxious to lead them to salvation."
3. "We hence conclude, that not only the reprobate ought to be reproved severely and with sharp earnestness, but also the elect themselves, even those whom we deem to be the children of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But even God cannot remember what they did not do." 
2. "Things holding on to salvation." 
3. "The better things" than those pictures in Hebrews 6:4-8.

### John Gill:
1. "Grace makes a man a good man, not gifts; a man may have great gifts and not be a good man; grace is useful to a man's self, gifts are chiefly useful to others; grace makes men fruitful, when gifts leave them barren in the knowledge of Christ; grace is lasting, when gifts fail, and cease and vanish away; grace will abide the fire of persecution, when gifts will not; grace is saving, gifts are not."
2. "And things that accompany salvation; which enter into salvation; are ingredients in it, and parts of it, and with which salvation is connected; such as faith, love, c. or which mutually touch or follow one another in the chain of salvation as to be predestinated, justified, called, adopted, sanctified, and, at last, glorified."
3. "The hard things spoken by him of some, were consistent with such persuasions in general; for there might be some among them to whom the aforesaid characters belonged; and saying such things might be a means to make others watchful and careful."

### John Wesley:
1. "But, beloved â€” in this one place he calls them so. He never uses this appellation, but in exhorting."
2. "We are persuaded of you things that accompany salvation â€” We are persuaded you are now saved from your sins; and that ye have that faith, love, and holiness, which lead to final salvation."
3. "Though we thus speak â€” To warn you, lest you should fall from your present steadfastness."
