## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Melchisedec is a prophetic symbol of Him who is not only righteous, but the fount and ground of all righteousness before God."
2. "Melchisedec had not, as mortal men, a definite beginning and end of his life."
3. "Christ is to be proved to be a High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "king . . . priest‚ÄîChrist unites these offices in their highest sense, and so restores the patriarchal union of these offices."
2. "the Most High God‚Äîcalled also 'Possessor of heaven and earth.' This title of God, 'the Most High,' handed down by tradition from the primitive revelation, appears in the Phoelignician god 'Elion,' that is, Most High."
3. "As priest he first blessed Abraham on God's part; next he blessed God on Abraham's part: a reciprocal blessing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Such is the record in Genesis 14:18. The word 'Salem' - ◊©◊Å◊ú◊ù shaleÃÑm - means 'peace;' and from this fact the apostle derives his illustration in Hebrews 7:2. He regards it as a fact worth remarking on, that the 'name' of the place over which he ruled expressed so strikingly the nature of the kingdom over which the Messiah was placed."
2. "That Melchizedek, who was a king, should also be a priest, was not, therefore, remarkable. The only thing remarkable is, that he should have been a priest 'of the true God.' In what way he became acquainted with Him, is wholly unknown. It may have been by tradition preserved from the times of Noah, as it is possible that the arrival of Abraham in that land may have been in some way the means of acquainting him with the existence and character of Jehovah."
3. "This gave a new consideration to the whole story; but moreover gave the church to know, that the priesthood, which it then had, was not always to continue, but that one of another nature was to be introduced, as was signified long before the institution of that priesthood which they enjoyed, Psalms 110:4. Yet the church was left greatly in the dark, and, at the coming of our Saviour, had utterly lost all knowledge of the mystery of the type, and the promise renewed in the Psalm."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. For this Melchisedec, etc. See Genesis 14:18-20; Psalms 110:0.


### John Calvin:
1. "It is indeed no wonder that he dwells so minutely on this subject. It was doubtless no common thing that in a country abounding in the corruptions of so many superstitions, a man was found who preserved the pure worship of God."
2. "And it was doubtless necessary that in him who was to be a type of the Son of God all things excellent should be found: and that Christ was shadowed forth by this type is evident from the Psalm referred to; for David did not say without reason, 'Thou art a priest forever after the order Melchisedec;' no, but on the contrary, by these words a sublime mystery was recommended to the Church."
3. "He is then called the King of righteousness, because of what he effects in diffusing righteousness on all his people. It hence follows, that out of his kingdom nothing but sin reigns among men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a daring thing to put Melchizedek above Aaron, but the author does it."
2. "The interpretation is rabbinical in method, but well adapted to Jewish readers."
3. "He is called 'priest' and note 'œÑŒøœÖ œÖœàŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ' applied to God as the Canaanites, Phoenicians, Hebrews did."

### John Gill:
1. "but it is not true of him, that he was without father, and without mother, an account of his descent being given in Scripture; nor is it probable that he should be a king of a single city in Ham's country, and Abraham be a stranger there."
2. "others take him to be a mere man, but an extraordinary one, eminently raised up by God to be a type of the Messiah; and think it most proper not to inquire curiously who he was, since the Scripture is silent concerning his genealogy and descent; and that as it should seem on purpose, that he might be a more full and fit type of Christ; and this sense appears best and safest."
3. "and though the Hebrew word "Cohen" sometimes signifies a prince, it cannot be so understood here, not only because the word is rendered "priest" by the Septuagint, and by the apostle, but because he is called the priest of God; and Christ is said to be of his order: and he is styled the priest of God, because he was called and invested by him with this office, and was employed in his service."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ, as appears from his type, Melchisedec, who was greater than Abraham himself, from whom Levi descended." 
2. "He has a priesthood altogether excellent, new, firm, perpetual." 
3. "Genesis 14:18, etc."
