# Hebrews 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Levitical priesthood, being unable to provide a perfectly adequate relation to God, revealed the need for a different and perfect priesthood that would bring man to his highest state of salvation and sanctification. This new priesthood would establish a perfect fellowship between God and the worshipper, signifying the establishment of a perfect fellowship between God and the worshipper. As the Scriptures predicted the coming of a priest of a different order, the imperfections of the Levitical priesthood became apparent, necessitating the establishment of a better priesthood and a more excellent dispensation.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Psalm tells us that in the person of the Messiah there was to arise a priest who did not belong to the order of Aaron, but to a different order; and this declaration implies that the priesthood of Aaron was not capable of securing the great end of a priesthood."
2. "If sinners are to be forgiven, forgiveness must be consistent with the Divine character and law; the conscience must be pacified and man made holy."
