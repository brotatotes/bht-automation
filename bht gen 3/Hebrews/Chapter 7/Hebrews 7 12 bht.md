# Hebrews 7:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If there is a change in the priesthood, there must also be a change in the law, as the two are inseparably bound together. The priesthood being changed signifies the abolishment of the entire legal system. God's choice of another kind of priesthood for His Son brings about a necessary transfer and alteration to a new basis. Through the completeness of Christ's work, there is a transformation in the access and forgiveness, fundamentally altering the nature of the old economy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if the priesthood is changed... there takes place of necessity a change of the law also."
2. "The change here in fact amounts to the disannulling in ver. 18, but is not yet so expressed."
3. "The Writer as yet expresses himself mildly and cautiously: the change here in fact amounts to the disannulling in ver. 18, but is not yet so expressed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The priesthood and the law are inseparably bound up together, they both stand and fall together."
3. "This is his answer to those who might object, What need was there of a new covenant?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the priesthood being changed - According to the prediction in Ps. cx., that it would be. When that occurs, the consequence specified will also follow."
2. "There is made of necessity a change also of the law - The Law so far as it grew out of that, or was dependent on it. The connection requires us to understand it only of the Law 'so far as it was connected with the Levitical priesthood.'"
3. "But the meaning is, that since a large number of laws - constituting a code of considerable extent and importance - was given for the regulation of the priesthood, and in reference to the rites of religion, which they were to observe or superintend, it followed that when their office was superseded by 'one of a wholly different order,' the Law which had regulated them vanished also, or ceased to be binding."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "A change [Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Î¸ÎµÏƒÎ¹Ï‚]. A transfer to a new basis."
3. "If the law failed to effect complete fellowship with God, the priesthood was shown to be a failure, and must be abolished; and the change of the priesthood involved the abolition of the entire legal system."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the whole is, that the ministry of Moses was no less temporary than that of Aaron; and hence both were annulled by the coming of Christ."
2. "But Moses was different from Christ in this respect, that while the love of the Gospel was not as yet made known, he kept the people under veils, set forth the knowledge of Christ by types and shadows, and, in short, accommodated himself to the capacity of ignorant people."
3. "Moreover, the impiety of the Pope is extremely arrogant, who has inserted this article in his decretals, that he himself is now invested with the same authority as Aaron formerly had, because the Law and also the priesthood have been transferred to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If Christ is made priest, the law is changed in its ceremonial and political arrangements, and even in the ethical relation of the people to God."
2. "They have another priest, and through the completeness of his work they have a freeness of access and a fulness of forgiveness which alters the very nature of their economy."

3. "God's choice of another kind of priesthood for his Son."

### John Gill:
1. "For the priesthood being changed,.... Not translated from one tribe, family, or order, but utterly abolished...it was of right abrogated at the death of Christ, and it is now in fact."
2. "There is made of necessity a change also of the law; not the moral law...though there is a sense in which it is abolished; as it is in the hands of Moses; as it is a covenant of works; as to justification by it...yet it still remains in the hands of Christ, and as a rule of walk and conversation."
3. "But the reasoning of the apostle is strong and unanswerable."

### John Wesley:
1. For â€” One of these cannot be changed without the other.
