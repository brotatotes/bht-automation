# Hebrews 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's appointment as a priest is not according to a statute, but based on His inherent power. His priesthood is eternal, contrasting the shortcomings of the Levitical priesthood. By resembling Melchizedek, Christ emphasizes their personal likeness. The need for this changed priesthood is evident, as Christ is a priest of a different order, surpassing the Levitical priesthood. This new order is marked by its spiritual nature, distinct from the external rituals of the old priesthood. Jesus, another priest, has risen, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah from the tribe of Judah and the order of Melchizedek.
