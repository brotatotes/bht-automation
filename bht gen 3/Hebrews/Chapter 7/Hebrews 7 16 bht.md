## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law can give a commandment, but it cannot give life."
2. "Our High Priest's inherent 'power,' now in heaven, has in Him 'life for ever.'"
3. "It is in the power of His resurrection life, not of His earthly life, that Christ officiates as a Priest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not after the law of a carnal commandment - Not according to the Law of a commandment pertaining to the flesh."
2. "The word 'carnal' means 'fleshly;' and the idea is, that the Law under which the priests of the old dispensation were made was external, rather than spiritual."
3. "But after the power of an endless life - By an authority of endless duration."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Such a priesthood cannot be eternal." 
3. "Jesus was high priest in virtue of the energy of indissoluble life which dwelt in him, unlike the priests who die."

### John Calvin:
1. "What was fulfilled in Christ by the hidden and celestial power of the Spirit, was shadowed forth under the Law by ointment, various vestments, the sprinkling of blood, and other earthly ceremonies."
2. "However spiritual then might have been the meaning of these shadows, they were yet but shadows in themselves; and as they were made up of the elements of this world, they may justly be called earthly."
3. "As Christ is a perpetual priest, it was necessary, that he should be different from Aaron as to the manner of his appointment; and so it was, for it was not Moses, a mortal man, who consecrated him, but the Holy Spirit, and that not with oil, nor with the blood of goats, nor with the outward pomp of vestments, but with celestial power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Carnal (œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒ∑œÇ). 'Fleshen' as in 1 Corinthians 3:1, not œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (fleshlike, 1 Corinthians 3:3). The Levitical priests became so merely by birth."
2. "Of an endless life (Œ∂œâŒ∑œÇ Œ±Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªœÖœÑŒøœÖ). Late compound (alpha privative and verbal adjective from Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªœÖœâ, to dissolve, as in 2 Corinthians 4:1), indissoluble."
3. "Jesus as priest lives on forever. He is Life."

### John Gill:

1. "Not after the law of a carnal commandment."
2. "Not according to the Mosaic law, which consisted chiefly of commandments that were carnal, compared to the spirituality of the gospel."
3. "But after the power of an endless life."
