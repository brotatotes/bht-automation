# Hebrews 7:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inclusion of Melchisedec in the biblical narrative signifies how God preserves an elect remnant amidst general apostasy. Unlike the Levitical priesthood, which served as a temporary interruption of the unity between kingship and priesthood, the patriarchal priesthood, exemplified by Melchisedec, foreshadows the unification that would be found in Christ's priesthood. The name Melchizedek, meaning King of righteousness and King of peace, accurately highlights the connection between righteousness and peace, which is seen in Christ as well. Abraham's recognition of Melchizedek as a priest of God attests to his divine authority. (80 words)

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Melchisedec is a sample of how God preserves, amidst general apostasy, an elect remnant."
2. "The Levitical was parenthetical, and severed the kingdom and priesthood; the patriarchal was the true forerunner of Christ's, which, like Melchisedec's, unites the kingship and priesthood."
3. "Christ is the true Prince of peace. The peace which He brings is the fruit of righteousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He doubtless recognized in Melchizedek one who was a minister of God, and to him as such he devoted the tenth of all which he had taken, as a proper acknowledgment of the goodness of God and of his claims."
2. "There was a propriety that one in whose 'order' the Messiah was to be found, should have such a name. It would be exactly descriptive of him, and it was 'worthy of observation' that he of whose 'order' it was said the Messiah would be, should have had such a name."
3. "His meaning appears to be merely that it was a fact worthy of remark, that the 'name' had a meaning which corresponded so entirely with the character of him who was to be a high priest of the same 'order.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The first designation is the literal interpretation of the Hebrew name. Being interpreted belongs only to this designation." (100 words)
2. "Then follows a designation derived from his character, king of peace. Supply being; not being interpreted." (100 words)
3. "The passage in Genesis, however, points to a place, and the writer might naturally have desired to indicate the typical meaning of the city over which Melchisedec reigned." (100 words)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Abraham recognized Melchizedek as a priest of God." 
2. "From this point till near the end of verse Hebrews 7:3 is a long parenthesis with Î¿Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï‚ of verse Hebrews 7:1 as the subject." 
3. "The author gives in Greek the meaning of the Hebrew words Melchizedek (King of righteousness) and Salem (peace)."

### John Gill:
1. "It was done but once, and not constantly, or every year; it was out of the spoils of the enemy, and not out of his own substance, or of the increase of the earth; nor was it for the maintenance of Melchizedek, as a priest, who also was a king, and was richly provided for; but to testify his gratitude to God, for the victory obtained, and his reverence of, and subjection to the priest of God."
2. "Who is righteous, not only as God, and as man, and as Mediator, but particularly in the administration of his kingly office: his kingdom lies in righteousness, as well as peace; the subjects of it are righteous persons, and all his ways are just and true; his Gospel, by which he rules, is a declaration of righteousness; and he himself is the author of righteousness to all his people."
3. "Christ, the Prince of peace; whose kingdom is a kingdom of peace; his sceptre is a sceptre of peace; his royal proclamation is the Gospel of peace; and his subjects are the sons of peace; and he himself is the author of peace, not only between Jew and Gentile, but between God and his people; and he is the donor of peace, external, internal, and eternal."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being first â€” According to the meaning of his own name."
2. "King of righteousness, then â€” According to the name of his city."
3. "King of peace â€” So in him, as in Christ, righteousness and peace were joined. And so they are in all that believe in him."
