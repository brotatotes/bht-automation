### John Gill:
1. "It was done but once, and not constantly, or every year; it was out of the spoils of the enemy, and not out of his own substance, or of the increase of the earth; nor was it for the maintenance of Melchizedek, as a priest, who also was a king, and was richly provided for; but to testify his gratitude to God, for the victory obtained, and his reverence of, and subjection to the priest of God."
2. "Who is righteous, not only as God, and as man, and as Mediator, but particularly in the administration of his kingly office: his kingdom lies in righteousness, as well as peace... and he himself is the author of righteousness to all his people."
3. "Christ, the Prince of peace; whose kingdom is a kingdom of peace; his sceptre is a sceptre of peace; his royal proclamation is the Gospel of peace; and his subjects are the sons of peace; and he himself is the author of peace, not only between Jew and Gentile, but between God and his people; and he is the donor of peace, external, internal, and eternal."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being first - According to the meaning of his own name."
2. "King of righteousness, then - According to the name of his city."
3. "King of peace - So in him, as in Christ, righteousness and peace were joined. And so they are in all that believe in him."
