# Hebrews 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Levitical priests were appointed in numbers, but their priesthood was hindered from continuing due to death, requiring constant renewal. Christ, on the other hand, has an unchangeable priesthood since He lives forever. Unlike the earthly priests who served one after another, Christ's priesthood is eternal. The transient and changing nature of the ancient priests contrasts with the enduring and unchanging priesthood of Christ, who alone serves as the perpetual high priest.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The Levitical priests appointed in numbers were hindered from continuing due to death, which necessitated their constant renewal. However, Christ, whose priesthood is unchangeable, does not die. Unlike the priests who served one after another, His priesthood persists forever. While the human priests were prevented from permanently continuing in their office, Christ's priesthood remains steadfast. He alone is the perpetual high priest, and there is no need for any other. The impermanence of the ancient priests, along with the frequent changes caused by death and the sale of the priesthood, contrasts with the enduring and unchanging nature of Christ's priesthood.
