# Hebrews 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's priesthood is singular and unchangeable, as God has uniquely placed him in this role. While other priests may pass their office to successors, Christ's priesthood remains forever because he continues to live and fulfill his priestly duties. His death, a part of his priestly office, did not mark the end of his priesthood, but rather he lives on as an eternal intercessor. No one else can assume his priesthood, as it is exclusive to him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "THOU art a priest"; singular, not priests, "many."
2. "Remaineth," namely, in life.
3. "hath His priesthood unchangeable"; not passing from one to another, intransmissible.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because he does not die, but ever lives, he has an unchanging priesthood."
2. "The reason in their case, why it passed to others, was not that they did not perform the office well, but that they were mortal."
3. "The idea is not strictly that it was 'unchangeable,' but that 'it did not pass over into other hands.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hath an unchangeable priesthood [Œ±œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ ŒµœáŒµŒπ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒπŒµœÅœâœÉœÖŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ] . Rend. hath his priesthood unchangeable." 
2. "The A. V. misses the possessive force of the article, his priesthood, and the emphasis is on unchangeable."
3. "Usage is in favor of the former meaning, but the other falls in better with the course of thought."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The active sense of the word rendered 'unchangeable' (‚Äòwhat does not pass over to another‚Äô) is very unusual, and therefore less likely; but either meaning makes a good, and nearly the same, sense."
2. "If this meaning seem preferable, it needs then to be kept in mind that the ‚Äòfor ever‚Äô of the Psalm relates to the priesthood of Christ, and answers to the ‚Äòfor ever‚Äô of the arrangement with Melchisedec."
3. "Though the life of Christ is eternal, as are the effects of His priesthood, yet His exercise of that office will cease when all the glorious ends of it are completely answered in the eternal salvation of the redeemed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because he abideth (Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑŒø ŒºŒµŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ). Same idiom as in verse Hebrews 7:23, 'because of the abiding as to him' (accusative of general reference, Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ)."
2. "Unchangeable (Œ±œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ). Predicate adjective in the accusative (feminine of compound adjective like masculine), late double compound verbal adjective in Plutarch and papyri, from alpha privative and œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±ŒπŒΩœâ, valid or inviolate."
3. "God placed Christ in this priesthood and no one else can step into it. See verse Hebrews 7:11 for ŒπŒµœÅœâœÉœÖŒΩŒ∑."

### John Gill:
1. "Though he died, death did not forbid him to continue, as it does other men..."
2. "...his death was a branch of his priestly office..."
3. "...he himself ever lives as an intercessor..."

### John Wesley:
1. He continueth for ever ‚Äî In life and in his priesthood.
That passeth not away ‚Äî To any successor.
