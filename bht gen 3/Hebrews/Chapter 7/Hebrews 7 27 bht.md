## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'daily' strictly belongs to Christ, not to the high priests, 'who needeth not daily, as those high priests (year by year, and their subordinate priests daily), to offer.'"
2. "The high priest's double offering on the day of atonement, the bullock for himself, and the goat for the people's sins, had its counterpart in the TWO lambs offered daily by the ordinary priests."
3. "The sufficiency of the one sacrifice to atone for all sins for ever, resulted from its absolute spotlessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was so holy that he needed no sacrifice for himself, and all that he did was in behalf of others."
2. "The offering which he made, though presented but once, was so ample and perfect that it had sufficient merit for all the sins of the world, and needed never to be repeated."
3. "Thus, he put an end to sacrifice, for when he made the great atonement it was complete, and there was no need that any more blood should be shed for human guilt."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who needeth not daily (kaq' hJmeran). Apparently inconsistent with ch. 9 7, but the sense is, 'who hath no need day by day as the high priest had (year by year) to offer sacrifices,' etc." 
2. "The great point is repetition, whether daily or yearly." 
3. "Once [ŒµœÜŒ±œÄŒ±Œæ] . Rend. once for all. Contrasted with daily."

### John Calvin:
1. "One of the defects of the ancient priesthood was, that the high priest offered sacrifices for his own sins; how then could he have pacified God for others, who had God justly displeased with himself?"
2. "Then they were by no means equal to the work of expiating for sins."
3. "The case with Christ was wholly different; for he himself needed no sacrifice, as he was sprinkled with no spot of sin; and such was the sacrifice, that it was alone sufficient to the end of the world, for he offered himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "œÄœÅŒøœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ. Regular adverb for comparison between two, though œÄœÅœâœÑŒøŒΩ often occurs also (John 1:41), with ŒµœÄŒµŒπœÑŒ± (then) following."
2. "For the sins (œÑŒøŒΩ). Only the article in the Greek with repetition of œÖœÄŒµœÅ or of Œ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒπœâŒΩ."
3. "When he offered up himself (ŒµŒ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ Œ±ŒΩŒµŒΩŒµŒ≥Œ∫Œ±œÇ). First aorist active participle of Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÜŒµœÅœâ, to offer up."

### John Gill:
1. "He (the high priest, they say) offers sacrifices for the sins of the people, for his own ◊ë◊ß◊ì◊û◊ô◊™◊ê, 'first,' ◊ï◊ú◊ë◊™◊®, 'and afterwards for the sins of the people.'" 
2. "Christ needed not to offer for his own, nor could he, for he had none of his own; what he had was by imputation."
3. "Christ offered himself, his whole human nature, soul and body, and both as in union with his divine nature; and this being offered to God freely and voluntarily, in the room and stead of his people, was acceptable to God: hereby justice was satisfied; the law fulfilled; sin taken away, and complete salvation obtained."

### John Wesley:
1. "He offered once for all: not for his own sins, for he then offered up himself "without spot to God.""
