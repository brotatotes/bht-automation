# Hebrews 7:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son, in contrast to mortal and sinful men, did not need to offer sacrifices for His own sin. Having been consecrated as a perfected priest through His perfect sacrifice, He stands alone as the only one who sustains this office. He is the ultimate High Priest who saves to the uttermost, making salvation complete. Unlike the inefficiency of the Levitical priests, Christ is sinless and perfectly equipped to meet our needs, having offered Himself as a perfect sacrifice. His priestly ministry is superior to theirs, being continuous and unchanging, and He remains a priest forever.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "Consecrated as a perfected priest by His perfected sacrifice, and consequent anointing and exaltation to the right hand of the Father."

2. "The great High Priest of the Christian profession is the only perfect priest... his office needs no change."
3. "Christ saves to the uttermost. He makes the salvation complete... as far as we can trace the departing soul when it goes into the dark valley, we receive the same assurance; and why should we doubt that the same grace is bestowed further onward, and that he saves 'to the uttermost'?"

### Marvin Vincent:
