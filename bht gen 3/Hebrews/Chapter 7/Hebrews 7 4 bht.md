# Hebrews 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the personal excellence and dignity of Melchizedek, to whom even Abraham, the esteemed patriarch and head of our Jewish nation, paid tithes out of the topmost and best portion of the spoils. This act of Abraham acknowledges the superiority and exceptional dignity of Melchizedek, emulating the honor that God bestowed upon him. The magnitude of Melchizedek's greatness is further emphasized by the fact that Abraham, being himself a patriarch, recognized his superiority and offer of tithes. Truly, if Abraham acknowledged the surpassing dignity of Melchizedek, then how much greater must Christ, the antitype of Melchizedek, be?
