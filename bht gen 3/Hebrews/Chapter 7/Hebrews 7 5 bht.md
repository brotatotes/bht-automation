# Hebrews 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They of the sons of Levi, specifically the family of Aaron, were appointed by God to receive tithes. The Levitical tithe, originally paid to the whole tribe, became attached to the priesthood. Despite descending from the same ancestor, Abraham, the Levites still collected tithes from the people. However, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham and his descendants, including the tribe of Levi. Therefore, the Levites were subordinate to the priests of the house of Aaron, who were in turn subordinate to Abraham and Melchizedek.

3. "The Levitical tithe right was all within the limits of one race, a privilege enjoyed by sons of Abraham over sons of Abraham, and therefore less to be wondered at, and involving less difference between man and man, than the tithe right of Melchisedec over Abraham, one of different race, and indeed over all his progeny with him."

1. "Though God granted to the Levites the right of requiring tithes from the people, and thus set them above all the Israelites, yet they have all descended from the same parent; and Abraham, the father of them all, paid tithes to a priest of another race: then all the descendants of Abraham are inferior to this priest."

### Philip Schaff:
1.

2.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Hebrews 7:5, the commentator explains that the priesthood of the sons of Levi, specifically the family of Aaron, was appointed by God to receive tithes. The Levitical tithe originally paid to the whole tribe of Levi eventually became attached to the priesthood. This distinction was important because although the Levites and the people were descended from the same ancestor, Abraham, the Levites still collected tithes from the people. However, the commentator emphasizes that Melchizedek was greater than Abraham and his descendants, including the tribe of Levi. Therefore, even though the Levites were priests, they were still subordinate to the priests of the house of Aaron and ultimately to Abraham and Melchizedek.

- Attempt 3 BHT: The sons of Levi, specifically the family of Aaron, received the priesthood and were given the authority to collect tithes from the people. This arrangement, according to the Law, distinguished the Levites as superior to the rest of the Israelites. However, despite their privileged position, the Levites were still subordinate to the priests of the house of Aaron, who traced their lineage back to Abraham. Nevertheless, Melchizedek held the highest position, surpassing even Abraham and his descendants, including the tribe of Levi.

- Attempt 4 BHT: The sons of Levi, particularly the family of Aaron, were designated by God to receive tithes as part of their priesthood. This practice originated with the tribe of Levi, but eventually became attached to the priesthood. The Levites, who were descended from Abraham along with the rest of the people, still collected tithes from their brethren. However, Melchizedek, being greater than Abraham and his descendants, including the tribe of Levi, holds the highest position. Thus, the Levites are subordinate to the priests, who are in turn subordinate to Abraham and Melchizedek.

- Attempt 5 BHT: The sons of Levi, particularly the family of Aaron, were appointed by God to receive tithes as part of their priesthood. While the Levites and the people shared a common ancestry in Abraham, the Levites still collected tithes from their brethren. However, Melchizedek's superiority over Abraham and his descendants, including the Levites, highlights his elevated status. Therefore, the Levites are subservient to the priests of the house of Aaron, who are themselves subservient to Abraham and Melchizedek.
