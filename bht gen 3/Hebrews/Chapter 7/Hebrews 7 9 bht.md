# Hebrews 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Hebrews 7:9, the writer highlights the significance of Abraham's action of paying tithes to Melchizedek. While some may argue that Abraham's act has no relevance to the Jewish priesthood because he wasn't a priest himself, the writer presents this as a third proof to demonstrate the superiority of Melchizedek's priesthood. Through Abraham, Levi himself, who was the patriarch of the Jewish priesthood, acknowledged Melchizedek's superiority and paid tithes. Though this statement may appear startling to a modern reader, it emphasizes the unique position of Melchizedek and the distinction of his priesthood.
