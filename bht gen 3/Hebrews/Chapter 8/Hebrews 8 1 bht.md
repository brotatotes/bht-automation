# Hebrews 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We have a High Priest who sits at the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens, ministering in the true tabernacle, the heavenly Jerusalem. The main point is that Christ is the minister of a better sanctuary, connected with a better covenant. Unlike the Levitical high priests who only stood briefly before the symbol of God's throne, Jesus sits on the throne of the Divine Majesty in heaven itself. He is the superior Priest who has obtained a better ministry, reigns with honor, glory, and authority for eternity.
