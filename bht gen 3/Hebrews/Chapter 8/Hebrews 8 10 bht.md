1. "The word of God never penetrates into our hearts, for they are iron and stone until they are softened by him; nay, they have engraven on them a contrary law, for perverse passions rule within, which lead us to rebellion."
2. "There would then be no stability in the covenant, except God gratuitously forgave our sins.

1. "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts by the laws of God are meant not the precepts of the ceremonial law, which were now abrogated, but either the moral law, and its commands...or else, since the word 'law' signifies sometimes no other than a doctrine, an instruction, the doctrines of grace, of repentance towards God, of faith in Christ, and love to him, and every other doctrine may be intended..."

3. "And I will be to them a God ‚Äî Their all-sufficient portion, and exceeding great reward."
