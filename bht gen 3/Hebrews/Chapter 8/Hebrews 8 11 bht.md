# Hebrews 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Under the new covenant, believers no longer rely on human teaching to know God. The Holy Spirit imparts the knowledge of Christ to each believer according to their spiritual growth and faith. This knowledge is not limited by age or status, unlike the old covenant. The understanding of God under the new covenant surpasses that of the Old Testament, as it is revealed by the Spirit and is not bound to the Jews but is extended to the Gentiles. All true Christians, from the least to the greatest, possess this knowledge of the Lord.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Under the new covenant, believers do not need to rely on other humans to teach them about God. The Holy Spirit, which is freely given to all who ask, reveals the knowledge of Christ to each believer, according to their spiritual growth and faith. This knowledge is not limited to a select few, but extends from the smallest to the greatest. In the new covenant, there is no distinction of age or status in the understanding of God, whereas in the old covenant, only the educated scribe had a deep understanding of the law. The knowledge of God under the new covenant is more certain and effectual, surpassing what could be learned from the revelations of the Old Testament. It is a wisdom beyond human comprehension, revealed by the Spirit. This knowledge is not limited to Jews, but is now extended to Gentiles, thanks to an abundant outpouring of the Spirit. Every true Christian, from the least to the greatest, will know the Lord, and teaching among believers will bring progress rather than mere elementary instruction.
