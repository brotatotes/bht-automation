# Hebrews 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The forgiveness of sins is, and will be, the root of this new state of inward grace and knowledge of the Lord. Their sins are not charged upon them, and they are no more punished than if they had passed entirely out of the recollection. By which are meant all kind of sin, original and actual; sins before and after conversion; every sin but that against the Holy Ghost, and that God's covenant people are never guilty of; these God remembers no more.

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Will I remember no more (Î¿Ï… Î¼Î· Î¼Î½Î·ÏƒÎ¸Ï‰ ÎµÏ„). Double negative Î¿Ï… Î¼Î· with first aorist passive subjunctive (volitive) of Î¼Î¹Î¼Î½Î·ÏƒÎºÏ‰, to recall."

### John Gill:
1. "And the way and means, in and by which God pardons, is the propitiatory sacrifice of his Son; and the word here rendered 'merciful', signifies 'propitious'; God pardons none but those to whom he is pacified, or rendered propitious by Christ; there is no mercy, nor pardon, but through him; he pardons on the foot of reconciliation and satisfaction for sin by Christ; so that forgiveness of sin is an act of justice, as well as of mercy; or it is an act of mercy streaming through the blood and sacrifice of Christ."
2. "By which are meant all kind of sin, original and actual; sins before and after conversion; every sin but that against the Holy Ghost, and that God's covenant people are never guilty of; these God remembers no more; he casts them behind his back, and into the depths of the sea, so that when they are sought for, they shall not be found; God will never charge them with them, or punish them for them."
3. "This is another phrase to express the forgiveness of sins, and distinguishes the new covenant from the old one, or the former dispensation; in which, though there were many typical sacrifices, and a typical removal of sin, yet there was a remembrance of it every year."

### John Wesley:
1. "For I will justify them, which is the root of all true knowledge of God."
2. "First, a sinner is pardoned: then he knows God, as gracious and merciful."
3. "God's laws are written on his heart: he is God's, and God is his."
