# Hebrews 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The writer of Hebrews shows that the new covenant renders the first covenant old, gradually diminishing and nearing its end. By emphasizing the word new, the writer proves the inspiration of Scripture and the superiority of the new covenant. It is clear that the writer deems the old covenant obsolete, expecting its complete disappearance as the new covenant of grace takes precedence. The process of obsolescence began with the mention of the new covenant and continues as the first covenant approaches its end.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A new [covenant], he hath made old (made old, viz. by speaking of,‚Äîand where God is the speaker, actually in decree establishing, seeing that all God's sayings are realities,‚Äîa new one) the first [covenant]."
2. "That which is being made old (the saying of God hath made old that first covenant: the state of antiquation thereby induced, continues, as the perfect tense shews,‚Äîand hence the covenant is continually being made old) and getting into old age is nigh unto vanishing away."
3. "At that time the being made old began, by the mention of a new covenant: and from that time the first covenant might be regarded as ever dwindling away, so to speak, and near its end, which God might bring on at any time."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Both covenants cannot exist side by side."
2. "Mark how verbal inspiration is proved in Paul's argument turning wholly on the one word 'NEW' (covenant), occurring but once in the Old Testament."
3. "The Greek for (Kaine) New (Testament) implies that it is of a different kind and supersedes the old: not merely recent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We can never approach the throne of mercy without having a high priest there - for he at all times, day and night, appears before God." 
2. "If there is any blessing for which we ought to be thankful, it is for the Christian religion." 
3. "The only assurance anywhere furnished that sin may be forgiven, is in the Bible."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In that he saith a new covenant [ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ ŒªŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπŒΩ Œ∫Œ±ŒπŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ]. Lit. 'in his saying new.' He hath made the first old [œÄŒµœÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπœâŒ∫ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄœÅœâœÑŒ∑ŒΩ]." 
2. "Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [œÑŒø Œ¥Œµ œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ≥Œ∑œÅŒ±œÉŒ∫ŒøŒΩ]. Rend. but that which is becoming old and waxing aged."
3. "The whole statement indicates that the writer regarded the Sinaitic covenant, even in Jeremiah's time, as obsolete, and that Jeremiah himself so regarded it."

### John Calvin:
1. "From the fact of one covenant being established, he infers the subversion of the other; and by calling it the old covenant, he assumes that it was to be abrogated; for what is old tends to a decay."
2. "But if the whole dispensation of Moses, as far as it was opposed to the dispensation of Christ, has passed away, then the ceremonies also must have ceased."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He hath made the first old...That which is becoming old and waxeth aged...Is nigh unto vanishing away."
2. "The author writes as if the Old Testament legal and ceremonial system were about to vanish before the new covenant of grace."
3. "If he wrote after A.D. 70, would he not have written 'has vanished away'?"

2. "the covenant of grace itself is older than this mode of administration of it"
3. "the dissolution or disappearance of this covenant was gradual; it began when the Chaldeans seized the land of Canaan"

### John Wesley:

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The author of Hebrews emphasizes the newness of the covenant by contrasting it with the old covenant. This new covenant made the first covenant old, causing it to gradually diminish and approach its end. The mention of a new covenant marked the beginning of the process of antiquation for the first covenant. As the first covenant aged and grew feeble, it was on the verge of disappearing. The writer highlights the significance of the word new in proving the inspiration of Scripture, showing the superiority and superseding nature of the new covenant. Therefore, both covenants cannot coexist. It is clear that the writer regarded the old covenant as obsolete, pointing to its ultimate dissolution. This understanding is further supported by the impermanence and gradual disappearance of the old covenant, reinforcing the writer's perspective that the old testament system would fade away in the presence of the new covenant of grace.
