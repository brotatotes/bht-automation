# Hebrews 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is necessary that our High Priest in heaven has something to offer, namely, the blood of the offering, Christ, which He bears into the Holy Place. Just as the high priest did not enter the Holy Place without blood, Christ has entered the heavenly Holy Place with His own blood. It is indispensable that Christian ministers bring a sacrifice to God, as the priesthood is an empty name without a sacrifice. Our prayers must be founded on the sacrifice of Christ, as all are without any sacrifice of their own to appease God.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: It is necessary that our High Priest in heaven has something to offer, namely, the blood of the offering, Christ, which He bears into the Holy Place. This sprinkling of blood is made effectual in heaven and is constantly repeated. Just as the high priest did not enter the Holy Place without blood, Christ has entered the heavenly Holy Place with His own blood. This is why the Hebrew Christians should not be ignorant of the doctrine of Christ's priesthood. As a priest, Christ has His blood as His oblation to offer before God. It follows that a priest must offer sacrifice, and for Christian ministers, it is indispensable that they bring a sacrifice to God. Without a sacrifice, the priesthood is an empty name. Therefore, it is essential that our prayers are founded on the sacrifice of Christ, as all are without any sacrifice of their own to appease God.
