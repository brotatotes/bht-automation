# Hebrews 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If His priesthood terminated on the earth, He would not even be called a priest. Christ's priestly office is exercised in the heavenly sanctuary, not on earth. His priesthood is not rooted in His earthly life, but in the power of His resurrection. Since Jesus was not of the tribe of Levi, He could not serve as a priest on earth. Therefore, Christ's priesthood operates on a heavenly level, separate from the Levitical priests who offered gifts according to the law.
