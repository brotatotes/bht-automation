2. "serve (the tabernacle which is but) the outline and shadow."
3. "an accurate representation, presented in vision to Moses, of the heavenly real sanctuary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The tabernacle was made after a pattern which was shown to Moses; it was made so as to have some faint resemblance to the reality in heaven, and in that 'copy,' or 'example,' they were appointed to officiate. Their service, therefore, had some resemblance to that in heaven."
2. "Compared with what is in heaven, it was what the shadow is compared with the substance."

### John Calvin:
1. "In short, he teaches us that the true worship of God consists not in the ceremonies of the Law, and that hence the Levitical priests, while exercising their functions, had nothing but a shadow and a copy, which is inferior to the prototype."
2. "This is a remarkable passage, for it contains three things entitled to special notice... We hence learn that the ancient rituals were not without reason appointed... There is, however, no reason that we should be here overcurious, so as to seek in every nail and minute things some sublime mystery..."
3. "Secondly, we are here taught that all those modes of worship are false and spurious, which men allow themselves by their own wit to invent, and beyond God's command... Thirdly, let us hence learn that there are no true symbols of religion but those which conform to what Christ requires."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A copy and shadow form a practical hendiadys for 'a shadowy outline'." 
2. "The tabernacle was to be patterned after the heavenly model." 
3. "The word 'God' is not used, but it is implied."

### John Gill:
1. "The ceremonious rites of the Jews were not, as some have affirmed, borrowed from the Egyptians; nor were they given as diversions to that people, nor only to preserve them from idolatry, and keep them separate from others, but were designed to lead them to Christ, whom they were typical of."
2. "Moreover, it may be gathered from hence, that whatever is done in a way of religious worship, should be according to a divine rule."
3. "A church of Christ ought to be formed according to the primitive pattern, and should consist, not of all that are born in a nation, province, or parish; nor should all that are born of believing parents be admitted into it; no unholy, unbelieving, and unconverted persons, only such as are true believers in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "The pattern and shadow of heavenly things â€” Of spiritual, evangelical worship, and of everlasting glory."
2. "The pattern â€” Somewhat like the strokes pencilled out upon a piece of fine linen, which exhibit the figures of leaves and flowers, but have not yet received their splendid colours and curious shades."
3. "And shadow â€” Or shadowy representation, which gives you some dim and imperfect idea of the body, but not the fine features, not the distinguishing air; none of those living graces which adorn the real person."
