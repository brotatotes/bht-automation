### John Gill:
1. "The tabernacle, and tabernacle worship, were of divine institution; the ceremonious rites of the Jews were not, as some have affirmed, borrowed from the Egyptians; nor were they given as diversions to that people, nor only to preserve them from idolatry, and keep them separate from others, but were designed to lead them to Christ, whom they were typical of." 
2. "Moreover, it may be gathered from hence, that whatever is done in a way of religious worship, should be according to a divine rule; a church of Christ ought to be formed according to the primitive pattern, and should consist, not of all that are born in a nation, province, or parish; nor should all that are born of believing parents be admitted into it."
3. "The ordinances are baptism, which should only be administered to believers, and by immersion, and the Lord's supper, of which none should partake, but those who have tasted that the Lord is gracious; and this should be performed as Christ performed it, and as the Apostle Paul received it from him; the discipline of Christ's house should be regarded, and all the laws of it carefully and punctually in execution; and a conversation becoming the Gospel should be attended to."

### John Wesley:
1. "The pattern and shadow of heavenly things â€” Of spiritual, evangelical worship, and of everlasting glory."
2. "The pattern â€” Somewhat like the strokes pencilled out upon a piece of fine linen, which exhibit the figures of leaves and flowers, but have not yet received their splendid colours and curious shades."
3. "And shadow â€” Or shadowy representation, which gives you some dim and imperfect idea of the body, but not the fine features, not the distinguishing air; none of those living graces which adorn the real person."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Hebrews 8:5, the author emphasizes that the Levitical system of worship was merely a copy and shadow of the heavenly reality. The earthly tabernacle, meticulously constructed to reflect the heavenly model shown to Moses, symbolized the spiritual, heavenly sanctuary. This earthly tabernacle served as a vague representation, a sketch or outline, devoid of the splendid colors and living graces found in the true worship of God. Therefore, true worship should conform to what Christ requires and should be in accordance with a divine rule. Only the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper, administered to believers, and adherence to the discipline and laws of Christ's house, are the genuine symbols of religion. All of these elements of worship lead believers to Christ, who is the epitome of heavenly things and the source of everlasting glory.
