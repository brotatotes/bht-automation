## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "After the sack of Jerusalem, Jeremiah with the other captives was brought in chains to Rama, where Nebuzaradan had his head-quarters. There took place, at Godâ€™s special command, his prophecies of the future entire restoration of Israel, of another David, of Rachelâ€™s wailing over her children at Rama, and their future return, of the new covenant resting on absolute and veritable forgiveness of sins which Jehovah would make with his people, these prophecies forming the third part of the third trilogy of the three great trilogies into which the prophecies of Jeremiah may be divided."
2. "The question which has before now been abundantly handled, whether the saying refers to the return of the exiles, or to the covenant of which Christ is the mediator, or to the future general conversion of the Jews, or whether some things in it to one of these, some to another, or whether the whole in its lower literal sense to the return of the exiles and in its higher spiritual sense to Christ and His kingdom, must be answered by the considerations before adduced on ch. i. 5."
3. "It belongs throughout to the cycle of Messianic prophecies, and is one of the most beautiful and sublime of them; and its true fulfillment can only sought in the covenant brought in by the Savior, and in the salvation through Him imparted to mankind, and ever more and more unfolded and completed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law is not in itself blamed, but the people who had not observed it."
2. "Spiritually fulfilled in the Gospel covenant, whereby God forgives absolutely His people's sins, and writes His law by His Spirit on the hearts of believers, the true Israel."
3. "A suitable expression as to the new covenant, which perfected what the old could not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'finding fault' properly means to censure, or to blame... It is language used where wrong has been done; where there is ground of complaint; where it is desirable that there should be a change." 
2. "This refers doubtless to the times of the Messiah. Phrases such as these, 'in the last days,' 'in after times,' and 'the time is coming,' are often used in the Old Testament to denote the last dispensation of the world... There can be no doubt that as it is used by Jeremiah it refers to the times of the gospel."
3. "The word 'covenant' with us commonly denotes a compact or agreement between two parties that are equal, and who are free to enter into the agreement or not... The word... is used in a more general sense, and more in accordance with the original meaning of the Greek word."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The writer assumes that Jeremiah's new covenant means the Christian covenant."
2. "I will conclude or consummate."
3. "Always kainh in the phrase new covenant, except Hebrews 12:24, where we have nea."

### John Calvin:
1. "To remedy this evil, he promised a new and a different covenant, the fulfillment of which prophecy was the abrogation of the old covenant."
2. "It is a common saying that the accessory is of the same character with his principal. No wonder, then, that the ceremonies, which are nothing more than appendages to the old covenant, should come to an end, together with the whole dispensation of Moses."
3. "Now, by the days which the prophet mentions, all agree that Christâ€™s kingdom is signified; it hence follows, that the old covenant was changed by the coming of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The covenant, as a revelation of Godâ€™s holiness, was faultless; but as the people fell away under it, it failed as a covenant of works to establish abiding fellowship between them and God, and so proved weak and profitless." 
2. "The prediction that follows is taken from the last great series of his prophecies (chaps, 30-31), which are distinctly Messianic It points to the new covenant which God will one day make with His people, based upon the absolute remission of sins and on a no less absolute change of heart."
3. "The covenant is â€˜forâ€™ them rather than with them, though in a sense it was both and is so described."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The covenant was all right, but the Jews failed to keep it. Hence God made a new one of grace in place of law." (Commentary)
2. "I will make (ÏƒÏ…Î½Ï„ÎµÎ»ÎµÏƒÏ‰). Future active of ÏƒÏ…Î½Ï„ÎµÎ»ÎµÏ‰, old compound verb to accomplish..." (Commentary)
3. "A new covenant (Î´Î¹Î±Î¸Î·ÎºÎ·Î½ ÎºÎ±Î¹Î½Î·Î½). In Hebrews 12:24 we have Î´Î¹Î±Î¸Î·ÎºÎ·Ï‚ Î½ÎµÎ±Ï‚, but ÎºÎ±Î¹Î½Î·Ï‚ in 1 Corinthians 11:25." (Commentary)

### John Gill:
1. "The new covenant is so called, not because newly made, but in distinction from the former administration of it, which is waxen old, and vanished away."

### John Wesley:

2. "It is new in many respects, though not as to the substance of it."
3. "Being ratified by the death of Christ."
