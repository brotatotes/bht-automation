# Hebrews 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The new covenant is distinct from the old one that the Israelites did not abide by, causing God to disregard them. The law acted as a representation of the Gospel, but its power derived from the Gospel and ceased once it arrived. Although God took the Israelites by the hand to guide them, they did not remain in the covenant, leading to its annulment. This highlights the importance of obedience and faithfulness, as exemplified in the comparison between the old and new covenants.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse describes how the new covenant is not like the old one that God made with the Israelites when He brought them out of Egypt. The first-tier commentaries explain that the old covenant was broken by the Israelites who did not abide in it, and therefore, God disregarded them. It is noted that the law served as a picture of the Gospel and had a delegated virtue from it. The commentaries also highlight that God took the Israelites by the hand to support and guide them, but they did not continue in the covenant, resulting in its annulment. God's disregard for them signifies that their adoption as His people was of no value unless He provided a new remedy. Through these insights, we see the contrast between the old and new covenants and the importance of obedience and faithfulness.
