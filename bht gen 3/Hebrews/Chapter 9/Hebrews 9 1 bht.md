# Hebrews 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first covenant had ordinances of service and a worldly sanctuary, while the new covenant offers the infinite superiority of access into the holiest place through Christ's sacrifice. The blood of bulls and goats was insufficient to cleanse sins, in stark contrast to the supreme efficacy of Christ's blood. The rituals and ceremonies of the Mosaic Law served as types and figures of Christ, pointing to their fulfillment in Him. It is clear that the old covenant, with its material and outward sanctuary, should yield to the greater access of the new covenant.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The main point of comparison in Hebrews 9:1 is the access into the holiest place. The first covenant had ordinances of service and a worldly, material sanctuary. While this sanctuary may have been beautiful, it was outward and perishing, and the blood of bulls and goats could not truly cleanse sins. The writer of Hebrews wants to prove that this old covenant, with its earthly sanctuary and insufficient access, should give way to the greater efficacy of Christ's blood and the new covenant. All the rituals and ceremonies of the Mosaic Law were merely types and figures of Christ, and their fulfillment is found in Him.
