# Hebrews 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law focused heavily on regulations about eating, while neglecting the topic of drinking. These rituals and ordinances of the flesh, such as meals and washings, were merely symbolic and could not bring about true inward change. The time of reformation came with Christianity, as God established a better covenant that surpassed the limitations of the old laws. This new covenant was a transformation of the current Judaism, fulfilling the promise made to Abraham and bringing about a perfect rectification through Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The law prescribed much about eating: nothing about drinking, except some general rules of uncleanness."
2. "The divers washings may refer to all the washings ordained by the law, but it seems likely that not the sacredotal washings, so much as those prescribed to or observed by the people, are mainly in view."
3. "They regarded material things, gifts, sacrifices, means, drinks, washings, which from their very nature could only affect the outward not the inward man."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The law prescribed many rules about eating, but was silent on drinking, focusing more on the outward cleanliness of the body than on matters of the heart. The rituals of eating and drinking were closely tied to the sacrifices, but their true value lay in their symbolism rather than their ability to truly cleanse. These ordinances were mere external observances, unable to bring about the inner transformation that was needed. The time of reformation came with the advent of Christianity, where God made a better covenant that surpassed the limitations of the old laws. The new covenant was a reformation, replacing the burdensome rituals of the old with the perfect sacrifice of Christ.
