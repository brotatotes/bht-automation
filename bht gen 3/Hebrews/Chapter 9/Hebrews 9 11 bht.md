# Hebrews 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, as the High Priest, appeared in a greater and more perfect tabernacle that does not belong to this world. This tabernacle is not built by human hands but by the Lord Himself, and it is meant for the glorious future. Through Christ's sacrifice, not our own righteousness or any other priest's sacrifice, atonement is achieved. This new age ushers in a time of reformation, introducing a higher sanctuary, better offering, and a more radical salvation where blessings are not just prophetic or hopeful, but actually attained.
