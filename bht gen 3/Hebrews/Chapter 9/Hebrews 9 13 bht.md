# Hebrews 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blood of Christ, offered without fault to God, purifies our conscience and renders us living and real in our communion with Him. Just as the water of separation, made from the ashes of the red heifer, cleansed those who were defiled, we continually need the cleansing effects of Christ's blood in our journey through the wilderness of life. The Levitical law provided remedies for specific defilement, but the Christian economy offers one solution for all phases of defilement. Christ's blood is the ultimate purification that brings complete and eternal salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For the blood of His self-offering purifies inwardly unto the living service of the living God."
2. "How much more shall the blood of [the] Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered HIMSELF without fault to God, purify our conscience."
3. "By the blood of Christ, shed in the power of the divine Spirit, thoroughly purified, freed from the terror of guilt, cleared from alienation from Him and from all selfish regards and carnal pretences, and rendered living and real as He is living and real."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If the blood of mere brutes could purify in any, however small a degree, how much more shall inward purification, and complete and eternal salvation, be wrought by the blood of Christ, in whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead?"
2. "The water of separation, made of the ashes of the red heifer, was the provision for removing ceremonial defilement whenever incurred by contact with the dead... The ashes were laid by for constant use; so the continually cleansing effects of Christ's blood, once for all shed."
3. "In our wilderness journey we are continually contracting defilement by contact with the spiritually dead, and with dead works, and need therefore continual application to the antitypical life-giving cleansing blood of Christ, whereby we are afresh restored to peace and living communion with God in the heavenly holy place."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The nature of these institutions also required that this should be in connection with 'sacrifice,' and in order to this, it was arranged that there should be this 'permanent sacrifice' - the ashes of the heifer that had been sacrificed - of which they could avail themselves at any time."
2. "It was, therefore, a provision of convenience, and at the same time was designed to keep up the idea, that all purification was somehow connected with the shedding of blood."
3. "The apostle goes on to argue that if they had such an efficacy, it was fair to presume that the blood of Christ would have far greater efficacy, and would reach to the conscience itself, and make that pure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Levitical law required two remedies : the Christian economy furnishes one for all phases of defilement."
2. "The blood of bulls and goats" refers to the sin - offerings, perhaps especially to the annual atonement... "the ashes of a heifer" to the occasional sacrifice of the red heifer for purification."
3. "The Christian economy furnishes one for all phases of defilement."

### John Calvin:
1. "The cleansing of the flesh they leave explained of what avails among men, as the heathens had their expiations to blot out the infamy of crimes."
2. "But this explanation is indeed very heathenish; for wrong is done to God‚Äôs promises, if we restrict the effect to civil matters only."
3. "The argument then is from the signs to the thing signified; for the effect by a long time preceded the reality of the signs."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This case of the 'ashes of the heifer' is one of the most suggestive symbols of the Law, and is well worth examination." 
2. "The heifer without spot, slain by the priest without the camp, its blood sprinkled in the direction of the tabernacle, the animal itself burnt with solemn rites, its ashes laid up in a clean place to be used with water in cleansing those who had been defiled by contact with a dead body, itself a symbol and a result of sin all are instructive."
3. "All was done to secure an outward purity only."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This ceremonial ritual does serve 'for the cleansing (Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅŒøœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±, old word here only in N.T.) of the flesh,' but not for the conscience (verse Hebrews 9:9)."
2. "The cow was Œ±ŒºœâŒºŒøŒΩ, the individual Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅŒøœÇ."
3. "The ashes mingled with water (ŒºŒµœÑŒ± œÖŒ¥Œ±œÑŒøœÇ, verse Hebrews 9:19) were sprinkled (œÅŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∂ŒøœÖœÉŒ±, present active participle of œÅŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∂œâ, in LXX, though œÅŒ±ŒπŒΩœâ more common) on the contaminated or defiled ones (Hebrews 9:19) as the blood of bulls and goats was offered for sins (Hebrews 9:16)."

### John Gill:
1. "Neither of them can purge from sin."
2. "The ashes and the water mixed together made the water of separation, or of sprinkling."
3. "This was the purification for sin, though it only sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh."

### John Wesley:
1. "If the ashes of an heifer ‚Äî Consumed by fire as a sin-offering, being sprinkled on them who were legally unclean."
2. "Purified the flesh ‚Äî Removed that legal uncleanness, and re-admitted them to the temple and the congregation."
3. "Numbers 19:17,18,19."
