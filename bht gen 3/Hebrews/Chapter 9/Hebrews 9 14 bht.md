# Hebrews 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The animals offered in sacrifice lacked enduring life and intrinsic efficacy, unlike Christ who willingly concurred with the Father's will of redemption, giving His offering eternal and infinite merit. The power of the cross lies not in the shedding of blood, but in the divine spirit of love, truth, and mercy demonstrated by Christ Himself. His sacrifice purifies works, filling them with the living energy of the eternal spirit, and His blood cleanses the conscience from guilt. Through His sacrifice, we can serve the living God with a purified conscience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The animals offered had no spirit or will to consent in the act of sacrifice; they were offered according to the law; they had a life neither enduring, nor of any intrinsic efficacy. But He from eternity, with His divine and everlasting Spirit, concurred with the Father's will of redemption by Him."
2. "The eternity and infinitude of His divine Spirit gives eternal and infinite merit to His offering, so that not even the infinite justice of God has any exception to take against it."
3. "The unrenewed cannot serve God in spiritual communion. Man's works before justification, however lifelike they look, are dead, and cannot therefore be accepted before the living God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the blood of an animal had any efficacy at all, even in removing ceremonial pollutions, how much more is it reasonable to suppose may be effected by the blood of the Son of God!"
2. "The only thing, therefore, which ever disturbs the conscience, and makes death dreadful, and God an object of aversion, and eternity awful, is guilt."
3. "The idea in this verse is, that it is only the sacrifice made by Christ which can remove the stain of guilt from the soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The offering was the offering of Christ's deepest self - his inmost personality. Therein consists the attraction of the cross, not to the shedding of blood, but to Christ himself."
2. "This is Christ's own declaration, John 12:32. 'I will draw all men unto me.' Therein consists its potency for men: not in Christ's satisfaction of justice by suffering a legal penalty, but in that the cross is the supreme expression of a divine spirit of love, truth, mercy, brotherhood, faith, ministry, unselfishness, holiness."
3. "The effect of Christ's sacrifice upon the conscience transmits itself to the works, and fills them with the living energy of the eternal spirit. It changes the character of works by purging them of the element of death."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ suffered as man; but that death becomes saving to us through the efficacious power of the Spirit." 
2. "Christ alone was the lawful victim and capable of appeasing God."
3. "The purgation through the blood of Christ should intervene, which alone can efface all stains."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The blood of Christ...cleanse your conscience from that impurity which shows the inward man to be as a dead corpse, producing only such works as have no pulse, no power or feeling of true and higher life."
2. "The purpose of this process is to secure not the common service of the Jewish worshipper the service of an outward life; but the inward spiritual service of the living God of God not as veiled and in symbols, but of God in His reality and holiness."
3. "This view is favored by the double fact that it is the writer's purpose to describe the intrinsic excellence of His offering, and that elsewhere 'the Spirit' is used in this sense when applied to our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is thus a moral quality in the blood of Christ not in that of other sacrifices."
2. "The voluntary character of Christ's death is again emphasized."
3. "A pause might be made before ŒµœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ, from dead--(not bodies but) works."

### John Gill:
1. "That if the ashes of the burnt heifer, which was a type of Christ in his sufferings, mixed with water, typically sanctified to the purifying of men externally, in a ceremonial way, then much more virtue must there be in the blood of Christ, to cleanse the soul inwardly."
2. "Christ is a priest, and the sacrifice he has offend up is 'himself'; not his divine nature, but his human nature, soul and body, as in union with his divine person; which gives his sacrifice the preference to all others."
3. "The end and use of such purgation is, 'to serve the living God'; so called to distinguish him from the idols of the Gentiles, and in opposition to dead works; and because he has life in himself, essentially and independently, and is the author and giver of life to others."

### John Wesley:
1. "How much more shall the blood of Christ." - The merit of all his sufferings.
2. "The work of redemption being the work of the whole Trinity." - Neither is the Second Person alone concerned even in the amazing condescension that was needful to complete it.
3. "Infinitely more precious than any created victim, and that without spot to God." - Offered himself, purging our conscience, from dead works, to serve the living God.
