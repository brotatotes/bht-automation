It brings attention to the distinction between a covenant and a testament, emphasizing that Christ's death was representative and essential to fulfill the testament.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (justification of the death taking place, by an appeal to common usage) where a testament is (that it is quite vain to attempt to deny the testamentary sense of diathek√© in this verse..."
2. "In the meaning, Christ is He that made it: and this agrees wonderfully with St. Luke‚Äôs manner of speaking in that text which is in fact the key-text to this: I appoint unto you, as my Father appointed unto me, a kingdom: the same verb being used as here..."
3. "he who speaks of a testament, at the same time, carries in to, involves in, that assertion, the death of him that made it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The need of death before the testamentary appointment takes effect, holds good in Christ's relation as MAN to us; Of course not in God's relation to Christ."
2. "Thus, Luke 22:29 may be translated, 'Blood of the covenant'; for a testament does not require blood shedding."
3. "It is true the heir is ordinarily the successor of him who dies and so ceases to have the possession. But in this case Christ comes to life again, and is Himself (including all that He hath), in the power of His now endless life, His people's inheritance; in His being Heir, they are heirs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word - Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ÃÅŒ∫Œ∑ diatheÃÑkeÃÑ - occurs in the New Testament thirty-three times... It is translated 'covenant' in the common version... In the remaining places it is rendered 'testament'... This is conceded on all hands, and is expressly admitted by Prof. Stuart; though he defends this use of the word in this passage."
2. "It is no less remarkable that neither in the Septuagint nor the New Testament is the word Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ÃÅŒ∫Œ∑ diatheÃÑkeÃÑ - 'diatheke' - 'ever' used in the sense of 'will' or 'testament,' unless it be in the case before us... The only literal 'covenant' which can he supposed in the plan of redemption is that between the Father and the Son - though even the existence of such a covenant is rather the result of devout and learned imagining than of any distinct statement in the volume of inspiration."
3. "The simple idea is, that God has made an 'arrangement' by which his worship may be celebrated and souls saved... He is comparing the Jewish and Christian dispensations, and the point of comparison in this chapter relates to the question about the efficacy of sacrifice in the two arrangements. He showed that the arrangement for blood-shedding by sacrifice entered into both; that the high priest of both offered blood as an expiation; that the holy place was entered with blood, and that consequently there was death in both the arrangements, or dispensations."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The English Version has involved this passage in hopeless obscurity by introducing the idea of a testament and a testator."
2. "That interpretation, however, is maintained by a very strong array of modern expositors."
3. "He meant to say that it was necessary that the institutor die representatively; that death should be born for him by an animal victim."

### John Calvin:
1. "And this he proves by referring to what is usually the case as to wills or testaments, the effect of which is suspended until the death of those whose wills they are."
2. "Now, as to the word used, he simply alluded, as I have already said, to the two meanings it has in Greek; he therefore dwells chiefly on the thing in itself."
3. "We must ever hold this truth, that no symbols have ever been adopted by God unnecessarily or unsuitably."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And it is a covenant with all the requisite validity."
2. "For where a covenant is, there must also be the death of the covenanting victim."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A testament (Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œ∑). The same word occurs for covenant (verse Hebrews 9:15) and will (verse Hebrews 9:16)."
2. "That made it (œÑŒøœÖ Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÖ). Genitive of the articular second aorist middle participle of Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÑŒπŒ∏Œ∑Œº from which Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œ∑ comes."
3. "For doth it ever avail while he that made it liveth? (ŒµœÄŒµ ŒºŒ∑ œÄŒøœÑŒµ ŒπœÉœáœÖŒµ ŒøœÑŒµ Œ∂Œ∑ Œø Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÉ?). This is a possible punctuation with ŒºŒ∑ œÄŒøœÑŒµ in a question (John 7:26). Without the question mark, it is a positive statement of fact."

### John Gill:
1. "The covenant of grace, is properly a covenant to Christ, and a testament or will to his people."
2. "The witnesses of it are Father, Son, and Spirit; and the seals of it are the blood of Christ, and the grace of the Spirit."
3. "Christ, as God, has an equal right to dispose of the inheritance, both of grace and glory; and as Mediator, nothing is given without his consent."

### John Wesley:
1. "I say by means of death; for where such a covenant is, there must be the death of him by whom it is confirmed." 
2. "Seeing it is by his death that the benefits of it are purchased." 
3. "It seems beneath the dignity of the apostle to play upon the ambiguity of the Greek word, as the common translation supposes him to do."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Hebrews 9:16, the commentary shed light on the significance of a testament. The commentators discussed the multiple meanings of the word diathek√©, which can refer to a testament, will, or covenant. They emphasized that, in this context, the focus was on a testament in which the death of the testator is necessary for fulfillment. Christ, as the institutor of the testament, needed to die representatively. However, it is important to note that this requirement does not apply to God's relation to Christ.

It is crucial to distinguish between the covenant of grace, which belongs to Christ, and the testament or will, which belongs to His people.
