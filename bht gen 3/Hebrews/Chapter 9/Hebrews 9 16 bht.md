## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (justification of the death taking place, by an appeal to common usage) where a testament is..."
2. "it is quite vain to attempt to deny the testamentary sense of diathek√© in this verse..."
3. "In the meaning, Christ is He that made it: and this agrees wonderfully with St. Luke‚Äôs manner of speaking..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The need of death before the testamentary appointment takes effect, holds good in Christ's relation as MAN to us; Of course not in God's relation to Christ."
2. "A testament does not require blood shedding. Compare Exodus 24:8 (covenant), which Christ quotes, though it is probable He included in a sense 'testament' also under the Greek word diathece (comprehending both meanings, 'covenant' and 'testament')."
3. "The covenanting parties used to pass between the divided parts of the sacrificed animals; but, without reference to this rite, the need of a sacrifice for establishing a covenant sufficiently explains this verse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ÃÅŒ∫Œ∑ diatheÃÑkeÃÑ - 'diatheke' - is never used in the New Testament in the sense of 'testament,' or 'will,' unless in this place." 
2. "The simple idea is, that God has made an 'arrangement' by which his worship may be celebrated and souls saved. ... The sacred writers with an uniformity which could have been secured only by the presiding influence of the One Eternal Spirit, have avoided the suggestion that God made with man either a 'compact' or a 'will.'"
3. "The death of a sacrificial victim was needful to confirm or ratify such a covenant with God. It was not secure, or confirmed, until blood was thus shed. ... Thus, all our approaches to God are based on the supposition of such a sacrifice, and are, as it were, ratified over it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The English Version has involved this passage in hopeless obscurity by introducing the idea of a testament and a testator."
2. "It is necessary that the death of the institutor should be born."
3. "He meant to say that it was necessary that the institutor die representatively; that death should be born for him by an animal victim."

### John Calvin:
1. "Even this one passage is a sufficient proof, that this Epistle was not written in Hebrew; for ◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ means in Hebrew a covenant, but not a testament; but in Greek, Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏·ΩµŒ∫Œ∑, includes both ideas; and the Apostle, alluding to its secondary meaning, holds that the promises should not have been otherwise ratified and valid, had they not been sealed by the death of Christ."
2. "We must ever hold this truth, that no symbols have ever been adopted by God unnecessarily or unsuitably. And God in establishing the covenant of the law made use of blood."
3. "If we consider that the Apostle reasons from the thing itself, and not from the word, and if we bear in mind that he avowedly takes as granted what I have already stated, that nothing has been instituted in vain by God, there will be no great difficulty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And it is a covenant with all the requisite validity."
2. "For where a covenant is, there must also be the death of the covenanting victim."
3. "There is necessarily implied the death of the covenanting victim."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We say today 'The New Testament' (Novum Testamentum) rather than 'The New Covenant.' Both terms are pertinent."
2. "A will is only operative then."
3. "For doth it ever avail while he that made it liveth?"

### John Gill:
1. "The covenant of grace, is properly a covenant to Christ, and a testament or will to his people."
2. "It is his and their Father's will, concerning giving them both grace and glory; it consists of many gifts and legacies."
3. "Christ, as God, has an equal right to dispose of the inheritance, both of grace and glory; and as Mediator, nothing is given without his consent; and whatever is given, is given with a view to his 'death', and comes through it, and by virtue of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "For where such a covenant is, there must be the death of him by whom it is confirmed." 
2. "It is by his death that the benefits of it are purchased."
3. "It seems beneath the dignity of the apostle to play upon the ambiguity of the Greek word, as the common translation supposes him to do."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Hebrews 9:16, the author argues that the death of the institutor, Jesus Christ, was necessary for the covenant to be established. This is supported by the common usage of diatheke, which refers to a testament or will. Although the English translation brings about obscurity, the concept of a testament aligns well with Christ's role as the one who made it. In this covenant, bloodshed is required for its validity, as seen with the sacrificial animal victims in the Old Testament.
