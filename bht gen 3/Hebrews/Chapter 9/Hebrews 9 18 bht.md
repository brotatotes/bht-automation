# Hebrews 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Old Testament, the first covenant, became a testament through the dedication and ratification that necessitated the shedding of blood. This shedding of blood signified the agreement between God and His people and foreshadowed the ratification of the new covenant through Christ's blood. Without the shedding of blood, the covenant would lack validity and efficacy, indicating the essentiality of Christ's sacrifice. Viewed as a representation of the new covenant, the old covenant served as a reminder of God's majesty, with access to His presence obtained through Christ's blood.

2. "Here the reasoning of Paul is clear and explicit; but who could see the force of the former?"
3. "It was not on the basis of such reasoning as this...but by such reasoning as this: 'It is a great principle that in order to ratify a covenant between God and his people a victim should be slain, therefore it was that Moses ratified the old covenant in this manner, and 'therefore' it was also that the death of a victim was necessary under the new dispensation.'"
