# Hebrews 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Water, scarlet wool, and hyssop were included in the ceremony as symbolical elements. Jesus, as the Lamb of God, wore a scarlet robe, representing the sins He bore, though He Himself had none. These ceremonial practices, such as sprinkling the book and all the people with blood, reflect the imperfection of the law and the need for Christ's sacrifice for redemption. The sprinkling of Christ's blood fulfills the law and purges people from their sins, just as the sacrifices in the establishment of the law covenant were not performed according to the Mosaic ritual.
