# Hebrews 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the outer holy place of the tabernacle, there were significant elements such as the golden lampstand with its seven branches, representing the church's role in spreading the light of the Gospel. Adjacent to it was the table covered in gold, holding the sacred loaves of shewbread symbolizing communion with Christ. These elements, along with the altar of incense in the more secluded holy of holies, were shadows and examples of heavenly things to come. The pot of manna and Aaron's rod were possibly stored with the two tables of the Ten Commandments in the ark.
