# Hebrews 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord has made with you concerning all these words. Christ has sealed the testament with His blood, of which the Lord's Supper is the sacramental sign. In both dispensations, the inheritance was bequeathed: in the new by One who has come in person and died; in the old by the same one, only typically and ceremonially present. The promises of God are then only profitable to us when they are confirmed by the blood of Christ. If we truly grasped that what we read is not written so much with ink as with the blood of Christ, that when the Gospel is preached, his sacred blood distills together with the voice, there would be far greater attention as well as reverence on our part.
