# Hebrews 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The shedding of blood is essential for the forgiveness of sins. Just as the same blood that cleanses us from sin also seals our inheritance in the kingdom of glory, it is through the shedding of blood that we are purified and pardoned. Although there are exceptions to all things being purified by blood, the pouring out of blood on the altar is the main part of the sacrifice. Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins, and all sin that is forgiven is remitted through the blood of the atonement. The blood of Christ sets aside all other plans for pardon, and there can be no purification from sin by any other means.
