# Hebrews 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ has entered into the true temple - heaven - of which the earthly tabernacle was the type. He brings before the face of God no offering which has exhausted itself and, as only sufficing for a time, needs renewal; but He himself is in person our offering. Christ appears in the court of heaven for his elect, representing their persons and obtaining every blessing for them. He is our advocate, continuously interceding for us, and appearing in the presence of God on our behalf.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "He brings before the face of God no offering which has exhausted itself and, as only sufficing for a time, needs renewal; but He himself is in person our offering."

3. "He brings before the face of God no offering which has exhausted itself, and, as only sufficing for a time, needs renewal; but He himself is in person, by virtue of the eternal Spirit, that is, the imperishable life of His person, now and forever freed from death, our eternally present offering before God"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He has entered into the true temple - heaven - of which the earthly tabernacle was the type."
2. "The 'true original' figure is heaven itself; the tabernacle was an antitype of that - or was so formed as in some sense to correspond to it."
3. "Christ appears before God himself in our behalf in heaven. He has gone to plead for our salvation; to present the merits of his blood as a permanent reason why we should be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the ratification of the new covenant, Christ himself was the covenant - victim, and a real cleansing power attaches to his blood as the offering of his eternal spirit."
2. "Christ is not entered into a hand-made sanctuary."
3. "Christ is made openly manifest before the face of God. The Levitical priest was compelled to shroud the ark and the shekinah with incense-smoke, that he might not look upon God face to face."

### John Calvin:
1. "For Christ is not entered, etc. This is a confirmation of the former verse. He had spoken of the true sanctuary, even the heavenly; he now adds that Christ entered there. It hence follows that a suitable confirmation is required."
2. "Now to appear, etc. So formerly the Levitical priest stood before God in the name of the people, but typically; for in Christ is found the reality and the full accomplishment of what was typified."
3. "Christ was indeed our advocate when he was on earth; but it was a further concession made to our infirmity that he ascended into heaven to undertake there the office of an advocate."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The heavenly things: for not into a holy place made with hands did Christ enter, like in pattern (answering to the original, â€˜the typical formâ€™) to the true, now to show ( to manifest) himself before (the face of) God for us..."
2. "His passover our offering, and by virtue of â€˜the Eternal Spirit His own Divine natureâ€™ with all the power of an endless life..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Moses was shown a Ï„Ï…Ï€Î¿Ï‚ (model) of the heavenly realities and he made an Î±Î½Ï„Î¹Ï„Ï…Ï€Î¿Î½ on that model, 'answering to the type' (Dods) or model."
2. "In 1 Peter 3:21 Î±Î½Ï„Î¹Ï„Ï…Ï€Î¿Ï‚ has the converse sense, 'the reality of baptism which corresponds to or is the antitype of the deluge' (Dods)."
3. "For this work of Christ as our High Priest and Paraclete in heaven see Hebrews 7:25; Romans 8:34; 1 John 2:1."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ appears in the court of heaven for his elect, by representing their persons; by presenting himself, his blood, sacrifice, and righteousness, before God on their account; by introducing them into the presence of God, and offering up their prayers with the incense of his mediation; by presenting them to himself, and to his Father, and obtaining every blessing for them."
2. "And this he does 'now', since his entrance; not that he did not appear before God for the saints of the Old Testament, for he was the angel of God's presence then, though he did not appear then in the manner he does now, as the Lamb in the midst of the throne, as if it had been slain; but it denotes the continuance and perpetuity of his appearance for his people; he is ever interceding for them."
3. "Christ, as God, was always in his presence, from everlasting; as Mediator, he was with him in the council of peace; while he was here on earth his Father was with him, he was not alone; but now in his human nature he is at his right hand, where he appears before him, as a favourite before his Prince, on the behalf of another, or as an advocate on the behalf of his client."

### John Wesley:
1. "For Christ did not enter into the holy place made with hands â€” He never went into the holy of holies at Jerusalem, the figure of the true tabernacle in heaven." 
2. "But into heaven itself, to appear in the presence of God for us â€” As our glorious high priest and powerful intercessor."
