# Hebrews 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ entered the true sanctuary with his own blood, not needing to repeat his sacrifice like the Levitical priests. His purpose was not to offer himself often, but to present himself before God in the heavenly sanctuary. His offering refers to his entrance and presentation, rather than his sacrifice on the cross. By entering once for all, Christ's eternal priesthood is sustained, as his sacrifice fulfilled the law, satisfied justice, and obtained complete salvation.
