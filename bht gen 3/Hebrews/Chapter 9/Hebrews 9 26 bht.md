# Hebrews 9:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The oblation of Himself made by Christ was a once-for-all offering, bringing His blood to the heavenly Holy of Holies. If sacrifices had greater efficacy in their repetition, Christ would have been sent immediately after the foundation of the world. His sacrifice not only atoned for sins, but also abolished sin itself. The one sacrifice of Christ holds absolute and final value, dealing with sin as a principle, while the Levitical sacrifices were for individual transgressions. Through His appearance, He put away sin completely, removing its stain, guilt, and punishment.
