# Hebrews 9:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Death is an unavoidable fate for all humanity, appointed to occur once. Jesus, the representative man, has similarly been offered once to bear the sins of many. The parallelism between human history and the Son of man highlights the connection between death and Christ's first coming to die for our sins, as well as His second coming to bring salvation. After death, there comes a time of expectant joy or fear before the final judgment. This divine appointment of death precedes the ultimate state of joy or woe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is appointed to men once (and no more) to die, and after that, judgment."
2. "So also the Christ, once (for all) having been offered, to bear the sins of many."
3. "He shall appear a second time without sin, to them that wait for Him, unto salvation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is the representative man; and there is a strict correspondence between the history of man and that of the Son of man."
2. "The two most solemn facts of our being are here connected with the two most gracious truths of our dispensation, our death and judgment answering in parallelism to Christ's first coming to die for us, and His second coming to consummate our salvation."
3. "The intermediate state is a state of joyous, or else agonizing and fearful, expectation of 'judgment'; after the judgment comes the full and final state of joy, or else woe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Death occurs but 'once' in this world. It cannot be repeated if we should desire to have it repeated. Whatever truths or facts then pertain to death; whatever lessons it is calculated to convey, pertain to it as an event which is not to occur again."
2. "Death occurs to all. 'It is appointed unto men' - to the race. It is not an appointment for one, but for all. No one is appointed by name to die; and not an individual is designated as one who shall escape."
3. "As death is to occur to us but once, there is a cheering interest in the reflection that when it is passed it is passed 'forever.' The dying pang, the chill, the cold sweat, are not to be repeated. Death is not to approach us often - he is to be allowed to come to us but once."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since we patiently wait after death for the day of judgment, it being the common lot of nature which it is not right to struggle against; why should there be less patience in waiting for the second coming of Christ?"
2. "For if a long interval of time does not diminish, as to men, the hope of a happy resurrection, how unreasonable would it be to render less honor to Christ?"
3. "Were any one to object and say, that some had died twice, such as Lazarus, and not once; the answer would be this, ‚Äî that the Apostle speaks here of the ordinary lot of men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is appointed (Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫ŒµŒπœÑŒ±). Present middle (or passive) of Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫ŒµŒπŒºŒ±, 'is laid away' for men." 
2. "Once to die (Œ±œÄŒ±Œæ Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ). Once for all to die, as once for all to live here. No reincarnation here." 
3. "After this cometh judgement (ŒºŒµœÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖœÑŒø Œ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπœÇ). Death is not all. Man has to meet Christ as Judge as Jesus himself graphically pictures."

### John Gill:
1. "All things antecedent to death, which lead on to it, and issue in it, are appointed by God, and so is death itself, with all its circumstances."
2. "[Death] is the statute law of heaven in common for men to die and that but once."
3. "There is a particular judgment which is immediately after death; by virtue of which, the souls of men are condemned to their proper state of happiness or woe; and there is an universal judgment, which will be after the resurrection of the dead, and is called eternal judgment, and to come; this is appointed by God, though the time when is unknown to men; yet nothing is more certain, and it will be a righteous one."

### John Wesley:
1. "At the moment of death every man's final state is determined."
2. "But there is not a word in scripture of a particular judgment immediately after death."
3. "After this, the judgment ‚Äî Of the great day."
