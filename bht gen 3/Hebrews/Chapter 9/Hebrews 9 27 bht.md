## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And inasmuch as (seeing that Christ is not only a fit object of comparison with man, but is man) it is appointed to men (all men) once (and no more) to die, and after that, judgment..."
2. "so also the Christ (not Christ, without the article, but the Christ, that man who was God‚Äôs Christ‚Äîthe Christ, it being plain and palpable to all that the Christ belongs to the category, men..."
3. "shall appear (the usual verb of the appearances of Christ after his resurrection) a second time without (separate from) sin...for the purpose of salvation"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is the representative man; and there is a strict correspondence between the history of man and that of the Son of man."
2. "The two most solemn facts of our being are here connected with the two most gracious truths of our dispensation, our death and judgment answering in parallelism to Christ's first coming to die for us, and His second coming to consummate our salvation."
3. "The intermediate state is a state of joyous, or else agonizing and fearful, expectation of 'judgment'; after the judgment comes the full and final state of joy, or else woe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That which is to occur but once in an eternity of existence acquires, from that very fact, if there were no other circumstances, an immense importance."
2. "A man who dies, dies but once. He cannot come back again to make preparation if he has neglected it; to repair the evils which he has caused by a wicked life; or to implore pardon for sins for which he had failed to ask forgiveness."
3. "The more public and formal act of judgment, when the whole world will be assembled at the bar of Christ; Matthew 25:0. The decision of that day will not change or reverse the former; but the trial will be of such a nature as to bring out all the deeds done on earth, and the sentence which will be pronounced will be in view of the universe, and will fix the everlasting doom."

### John Calvin:
1. "Why should there be less patience in waiting for the second coming of Christ?"
2. "If a long interval of time does not diminish the hope of a happy resurrection, how unreasonable would it be to render less honor to Christ?"
3. "He includes none but those who wait for a long time in the dust for the redemption of their bodies."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is appointed (Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫ŒµŒπœÑŒ±). Present middle (or passive) of Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫ŒµŒπŒºŒ±, 'is laid away' for men."
2. "Once to die (Œ±œÄŒ±Œæ Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ). Once for all to die, as once for all to live here. No reincarnation here."
3. "After this cometh judgement (ŒºŒµœÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖœÑŒø Œ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπœÇ). Death is not all. Man has to meet Christ as Judge as Jesus himself graphically pictures (Matthew 25:31-46; John 5:25-29)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not a moral, or what is commonly called a spiritual death, nor an eternal one, but a corporeal one; which does not arise from the constitution of nature, but from the sin of man, and God's decree on account of it."
2. "Men's days can neither be lengthened nor shortened, either by Christ himself, or others: and this statute and appointment of God concerns men, not angels, and reaches to all men, wicked and righteous."
3. "There is a particular judgment which is immediately after death; by virtue of which, the souls of men are condemned to their proper state of happiness or woe; and there is an universal judgment, which will be after the resurrection of the dead, and is called eternal judgment, and to come; this is appointed by God, though the time when is unknown to men; yet nothing is more certain, and it will be a righteous one."

### John Wesley:
1. "At the moment of death, every man's final state is determined."
2. "There is not a word in scripture of a particular judgment immediately after death."
3. "After this, the judgment ‚Äî Of the great day."
