# Hebrews 9:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At His second coming, Christ will not need to die again because He represents all men of every age and has already borne the weight of their sins on the cross. When He returns, it will be to bring final and complete salvation to those who eagerly await Him. He will appear in glory, separate from sin, to bestow everlasting salvation on believers and to judge the wicked. His death was sufficient for all, and through faith in Him, we can find complete salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He did not need to die again and again for each individual, or each successive generation of men, for He represents all men of every age, and therefore needed to die but once for all, so as to exhaust the penalty of death incurred by all."
2. "Our sins were laid on Him. When, therefore, He was lifted up on the cross, He bare up our sins along with Him."
3. "At His second coming He shall have no more to do with sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a propriety that he should die but once for sin. The argument is, there is one probation only, and therefore there was need of but one sacrifice, or of his dying but once."
2. "He who was innocent interposed, and received on himself what was descending to meet us, and consented to be treated 'as he would have deserved if he had been a sinner.' Thus, he bore what was due to us."
3. "Every person on earth is interested in the fact that he will return, for 'every eye shall see him;' Revelation 1:7. All who are now In their graves, and all who now live, and all who will hereafter live, will behold the Redeemer in his glory."

### John Calvin:
1. "The death of Christ is abundantly sufficient for us."
2. "He died for others and not for himself; and therefore he opposes many to one."
3. "Those shall find complete salvation who recumb with quiet minds on the death of Christ; for this looking for or wanting has a reference to the subject discussed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Once for all" as already stated.
2. Blessed assurance of the Second Coming of Christ, but this time "apart from sin."
3. Final and complete salvation for "them that wait for him."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ bore not the sins of all men; for as all men have not faith, all are not justified, pardoned, and saved: what he bore were 'sins'; all kind of sin, every act of sin, and all that belongs to it; its filth, guilt, and punishment, even the iniquity of all his people; which must be a prodigious weight, and than which nothing could be more nauseous." 
2. "The way in which he came to bear them was this; he became a surety for all the elect; his Father imputed to him all their sins, and he voluntarily took them upon himself; where justice found them, and demanded satisfaction of him for them, and he gave it; which is an instance both of his great love, and of his great strength."
3. "This is to be understood of Christ's visible and personal appearance on earth, which will be a glorious one; he will appear in his own glory, and in his Father's glory, and in the glory of the holy angels, and in the glory of his power, to the joy of saints, and to the terror of the wicked; for every eye shall see him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ having once died to bear the sins â€” The punishment due to them."
2. "Will appear the second time â€” When he comes to judgment."
3. "Without sin â€” Not as he did before, bearing on himself the sins of many, but to bestow everlasting salvation."
