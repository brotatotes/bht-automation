## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This GOLDEN censer was only used on the day of atonement (other kinds of censers on other days), and is therefore associated with the holiest place, as being taken into it on that anniversary by the high priest."
2. "The expression 'which had,' does not mean that the golden censer was deposited there, for in that case the high priest would have had to go in and bring it out before burning incense in it; but that the golden censer was one of the articles belonging to, and used for, the yearly service in the holiest place."
3. "The rending of the veil by Christ has brought the antitypes to the altar, candlestick, and showbread of the anterior holy place into the holiest place, heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that Moses does not expressly mention it, does not prove that in fact no such censer was laid up in the most holy place."
2. "All the implements that were employed in the most holy place were made of gold, or overlaid with gold, and it is in the highest degree improbable that the high priest would use any other on so solemn an occasion."
3. "The subsequent history of the ark is unknown. It is probable that it was either destroyed when the city of Jerusalem was taken by Nebuchadnezzar, or that it was carried with other spoils to Babylon."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The golden censer is not mentioned in O. T. as a part of the furniture of the holy of holies."
2. "This might have given rise to the impression that it was in the holy of holies."
3. "The writer follows the rabbinical tradition that the pot of manna and the rod were inside of the ark."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is not certain whether Œ∏œÖŒºŒπŒ±œÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ here means censer or altar of incense... But in Philo and Josephus it means altar of incense for which the LXX has Œ∏œÖœÉŒπŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏œÖŒºŒπŒ±œÑŒøœÇ."
2. "At any rate the altar of incense was used for the Holy of Holies ('its ritual associations,' Dods)."
3. "Not definitely clear about these items in the ark, but on front, except that 1 Kings 8:9 states that it did contain the tables of the covenant."

### John Gill:
1. "The burning coals signify the very great sufferings of Christ, not only the sufferings of his body, which were very painful, but those of his soul, when the wrath and hot displeasure of God was poured out upon him."
2. "And the incense, which was carried in with those coals, typified the intercession of Christ in heaven, which is pure and holy, sweet, fragrant, and perpetual."
3. "The "pot", in which this manna was kept, was typical of the ordinances of the Gospel; in its matter, being made of gold, denoting the preciousness and duration of them; in the size of it, holding an "omer", showing that these contain plenty of good things to satisfaction; in the situation of it before the ark, signifying the presence of Christ with his ordinances."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having the golden censer ‚Äî Used by the high priest only, on the great day of atonement."
2. "And the ark, or chest, of the covenant - So called from the tables of the covenant contained therein."
3. "And the tables of the covenant ‚Äî The two tables of stone, on which the ten commandments were written by the finger of God the most venerable monument of all."
