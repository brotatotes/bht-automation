## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This GOLDEN censer was only used on the day of atonement (other kinds of censers on other days), and is therefore associated with the holiest place, as being taken into it on that anniversary by the high priest." (Commentary)
2. "The expression 'which had,' does not mean that the golden censer was deposited there, for in that case the high priest would have had to go in and bring it out before burning incense in it; but that the golden censer was one of the articles belonging to, and used for, the yearly service in the holiest place." (Commentary)
3. "The rending of the veil by Christ has brought the antitypes to the altar, candlestick, and showbread of the anterior holy place into the holiest place, heaven." (Commentary)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul was a Jew, and was familiar with what pertained to the temple, and gave such a description of it as would be in accordance with what actually existed in his time."

3. "In perpetual remembrance of this miracle, the rod was preserved in the ark."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The golden censer is not mentioned in O. T. as a part of the furniture of the holy of holies."
2. "There is evidently a discrepancy, probably owing to the fact that the writer drew his information from the O. T. by which he might have been led into error."
3. "The writer follows the rabbinical tradition that the pot of manna and the rod were inside of the ark."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The present active participle ŒµœáŒøœÖœÉŒ± (feminine singular) agrees with œÉŒ∫Œ∑ŒΩŒ∑ (the Holy of Holies). It is not certain whether Œ∏œÖŒºŒπŒ±œÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ here means censer or altar of incense."
2. "At any rate the altar of incense was used for the Holy of Holies."
3. "Not definitely clear about these items in the ark, but on front, except that 1 Kings 8:9 states that it did contain the tables of the covenant."

### John Gill:
1. "The burning coals signify the very great sufferings of Christ, not only the sufferings of his body, which were very painful, but those of his soul, when the wrath and hot displeasure of God was poured out upon him."
2. "The incense, which was carried in with those coals, typified the intercession of Christ in heaven, which is pure and holy, sweet, fragrant, and perpetual; and the priest having his hands full of it, expresses the fulness of Christ's intercession for all his elect, and for all things for them, and his fulness of merit to plead, which makes his intercession efficacious and prevalent."
3. "The manna came from heaven, from God, and was a free gift of his, and so Christ: it was round in form, and may be expressive of Christ's perfection and eternity: it was in colour white, which may signify his purity and innocence; it was sweet in taste, and so is Christ, his fruits, his word and ordinances."

2. "And the ark, or chest, of the covenant - So called from the tables of the covenant contained therein."
3. "And the tables of the covenant ‚Äî The two tables of stone, on which the ten commandments were written by the finger of God the most venerable monument of all."
