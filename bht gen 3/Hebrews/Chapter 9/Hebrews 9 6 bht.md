# Hebrews 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The priests went always into the first tabernacle, performing the acts of worship which God had appointed. The ancient system with its two-part division, one of which was inaccessible, served as a reminder of its inferiority. Yet, the high priest, on that one day, would enter the Holy of Holies with the blood to cleanse the people from their sins. Through the fall of this old system, a more familiar access to God has been obtained, prompting us to move beyond the shadows of the Law.
