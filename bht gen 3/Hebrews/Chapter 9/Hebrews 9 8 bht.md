# Hebrews 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first tabernacle, a symbol of the Old Testament economy, cannot perfect the conscience of the people, keeping them from accessing the presence of God. However, redemption by Christ has opened the way into the Holy place, signifying the access to God's presence. The first tabernacle still has a place, but it will be done away with when the veil is removed. This signifies that the access to the holiest of all has not yet been made manifest, but it will be through Christ.

2. "Both gifts and sacrifices are offered, having no power to perfect in conscience him that serveth, i.e. not the priests, but the people, who offered through them."
3. "The offerings cannot perfect him in conscience, i.e. cannot put his moral-religious consciousness, in its inward feeling, into a state of entire and joyful looking for of salvation, so that his conscience should be an onward-waxing consciousness of perfect restoration, of entire clearing up, of total emancipation, of his relation to God."
