# Hebrews 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the New Testament era, known as the time of reformation, the Old Testament gifts and sacrifices were unable to cleanse the conscience or bring inner renewal through love. The Levitical system's failure lay in its inability to deal with the conscience and achieve the ideal of true religion, the cleansing and renewal of the inner man. The tabernacle and its services served as a parable or shadow of the heavenly reality, highlighting the insufficiency of ritual purification. Only through Christ's blood can our souls find peace and justification.

### Marvin Vincent:
