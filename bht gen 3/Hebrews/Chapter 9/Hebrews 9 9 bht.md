2. "He denies that worshippers could be spiritually and inwardly cleansed by the sacrifices of the Law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The which tabernacle is a figure (literally a parable, an arrangement with a lesson) for, i.e in reference to (or lasting till) the time [now] present, or [then] present, for neither is expressed."

### John Wesley:
