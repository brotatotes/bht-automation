# James 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
James, as a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, addresses the Jewish believers scattered among the tribes of Israel. Being a servant implies devotion to God's work alone, rather than self-will or the will of others. James emphasizes the practical nature of his teaching, which requires less frequent mention of Christ's name. He greets the readers with a connection to the joy they are urged to find amidst their existing distresses caused by poverty and oppression. The term Dispersion refers to the Jews residing among different cultures, resulting in a wider outlook on life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "servant (not necessarily, as Huther, an official appellation; but implying, as he also confesses, devotion to God and His work alone, irrespectively of self-will or other men‚Äôs will) of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ"
2. "by God, he means the Father: by Lord, the Son."
3. "the Epistle must be considered as addressed, from the head of the mother church in Jerusalem, to the Jewish believers, residing among the dispersed tribes of Israel"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The pilgrim troops of the law became caravans of the Gospel." 
2. "His teaching being practical, rather than doctrinal, required less frequent mention of Christ's name."
3. "In the original Greek (chairein) for 'greeting,' there is a connection with the 'joy' to which they are exhorted amidst their existing distresses from poverty and consequent oppression."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is remarkable, also, considering the relation which James is supposed to have borne to the Lord Jesus as his 'brother'... That he did not refer to that as constituting a ground of claim to his right to address others; but this is only one instance out of many, in the New Testament, in which it is regarded as a higher honor to be the 'servant of God,' and to belong to his family, than to sustain any relations of blood or kindred."
2. "The 'servant of the Lord Jesus,' is an appellation which is often given to Christians, and particularly to the ministers of religion. They are his servants, not in the sense that they are slaves, but in the sense that they voluntarily obey his will, and labor for him, and not for themselves."
3. "The phrase 'the twelve tribes,' was the common term by which the Jewish people were designated, and was in use long after the ten tribes were carried away... The phrase 'the twelve tribes' became also a sort of technical expression to denote the people of God - the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus Christ. Only here and in ch. 2 1; nowhere in the speeches of James (Acts 14:14, Acts 14:15; Acts 21:20 sq.). Had he used Jesus ' name it might have been supposed to arise from vanity, because he was the Lord 's brother." 
2. "Servant [Œ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ] . Properly, hired servant."
3. "Greeting [œáŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒπŒΩ] . Lit., rejoice. The ordinary Greek salutation, hail! welcome! Also used at parting : joy be with you."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then wrote and exhorted all those whom he could not personally address, because they had been scattered far and wide."
2. "But that he speaks not of the grace of Christ and of faith in him, the reason seems to be this, because he addressed those who had already been rightly taught by others; so that they had need, not so much of doctrine, as of the goads of exhortations."
3. "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, bids, (or sends, or wishes) joy to the twelve tribes who are in their dispersion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are all the servants of Jesus Christ, bound to obey His commands, and to devote ourselves to His service."
2. "The Dispersion, or the Diaspora, was the name given to those Jews or Israelites who resided in foreign lands beyond the boundaries of Palestine."
3. "The usual Greek form of salutation. It is found at the commencement of no other apostolic Epistle, but occurs in the Epistle drawn up by James, addressed to the Gentile churches, at the council of Jerusalem."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "James is not an Ebionite. He accepts the deity of Jesus his brother, difficult as it was for him to do so."
2. "The term [Dispersion] appears in Deuteronomy 28:25 (LXX) and comes from Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÉœÄŒµŒπœÅœâ, to scatter (sow) abroad... The Jews at this period were roughly divided into Palestinian Jews... and Jews of the Dispersion... The Jews of the Diaspora were compelled to compare their religion with the various cults around them and had a wider outlook on life."
3. "Greeting (œáŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒπŒΩ). Absolute infinitive (present active of œáŒ±ŒπœÅœâ) as in Acts 15:23... It is the usual idiom in the thousands of papyri letters known to us, but in no other New Testament letter."

### John Gill:
1. "James, a servant of God... by office, as a preacher of the Gospel... an apostle of Christ." 
2. "...and of the Lord Jesus Christ... the servant of God the Father, but of his Son Jesus Christ, and that in the same sense, referring to his office as an apostle of Christ, and minister of the word."
3. "The apostle here sends greeting; that is, his Christian salutation, wishing them all happiness and prosperity...includes all that grace, mercy, and peace, mentioned in the usual forms of salutation by the other apostles."
