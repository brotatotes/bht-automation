# James 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, addresses this letter to the dispersed Jewish believers, encouraging them to find joy amidst their distresses. The mention of Jesus' name is infrequent, as James focuses more on practical teachings rather than doctrine, but this does not diminish his acceptance of Jesus as the Messiah and Lord. The dispersion of the Israelites, divinely ordained to propagate Christianity and as a means for believers to compare their religion with other cults, provided a wider outlook on life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[James] servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ... implying... devotion to God and His work alone, irrespectively of self-will or other men‚Äôs will."
2. "St. James mentions our Lord only here and ch. ii. 1 in this Epistle, and not at all in his speeches in Acts xv. and xxi."
3. "This Epistle must be considered as addressed... to the Jewish believers, residing among the dispersed tribes of Israel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The dispersion of the Israelites, and their connection with Jerusalem as a center of religion, was a divinely ordered means of propagating Christianity."
2. "His teaching being practical, rather than doctrinal, required less frequent mention of Christ's name."
3. "In the original Greek (chairein) for 'greeting,' there is a connection with the 'joy' to which they are exhorted amidst their existing distresses from poverty and consequent oppression."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is regarded as a higher honor to be the 'servant of God,' and to belong to his family, than to sustain any relations of blood or kindred."
2. "The 'servant of the Lord Jesus,' is an appellation which is often given to Christians, and particularly to the ministers of religion. They are his servants, not in the sense that they are slaves, but in the sense that they voluntarily obey his will, and labor for him, and not for themselves."
3. "The phrase 'the twelve tribes' became also a sort of technical expression to denote the people of God - the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus Christ. Only here and in ch. 2 1; nowhere in the speeches of James (Acts 14:14, Acts 14:15; Acts 21:20 sq.). Had he used Jesus ' name it might have been supposed to arise from vanity, because he was the Lord 's brother." 
2. "Servant [Œ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ] . Properly, hired servant. Compare Philippians 1:1; Jude 1:1."
3. "Greeting [œáŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒπŒΩ] . Lit., rejoice. The ordinary Greek salutation, hail! welcome! Also used at parting : joy be with you."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then wrote and exhorted all those whom he could not personally address, because they had been scattered far and wide."
2. "He addressed those who had already been rightly taught by others; so that they had need, not so much of doctrine, as of the goads of exhortations."
3. "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, bids, (or sends, or wishes) joy to the twelve tribes who are in their dispersion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A certain undefined ministerial office is perhaps implied; but the phrase, 'a servant of Christ,' has become a popular term, belonging not only to all the office-bearers of the Church, but to all Christians."
2. "Some suppose that it is a proof that James was not an apostle, because he calls himself only ‚Äòa servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ;‚Äô but this supposition cannot be maintained, as Paul gives himself the same appellation in the Epistle to the Philippians."
3. "The Dispersion, or the Diaspora, was the name given to those Jews or Israelites who resided in foreign lands beyond the boundaries of Palestine. This Epistle was not written primarily to the Gentile Christians, or to the Jews generally, but to the Christian Jews of the dispersion to those who are elsewhere called Hellenists."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is the Messiah and Lord. James is not an Ebionite. He accepts the deity of Jesus his brother, difficult as it was for him to do so." 
2. "The expression means 'Israel in its fulness and completeness' (Hort), regarded as a unity with no conception of any 'lost' tribes."
3. "The Jews of the Diaspora were compelled to compare their religion with the various cults around them and had a wider outlook on life." 

### John Gill:
1. "James, a servant of God,.... That is, of God the Father; not by creation only, as every man is; nor merely by calling grace, as is every regenerate person; but by office, as a preacher of the Gospel." 
2. "and of the Lord Jesus Christ; the Ethiopic version reads this in connection with the former clause, without the copulative 'and', 'James, the servant of God, our Lord Jesus Christ': and so some consider the copulative as explanative of who is meant by God, even the Lord Jesus Christ."
3. "to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad; by whom are meant believing Jews, who were of the several tribes of Israel, and which were in number 'twelve', according to the number and names of the twelve patriarchs, the sons of Jacob."
