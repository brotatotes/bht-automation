# James 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God does not tempt anyone to sin, nor does He engage in anything evil. Temptation does not come from God, but rather from our own desires and the world around us. Trials and tests serve to strengthen our character, not to lead us astray. We cannot blame God for our own failings. Instead, we must acknowledge that every evil stems from the wickedness within our hearts and take responsibility for our actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God ordains the temptation, overrules the temptation, but does not tempt, is not the spring of the solicitation to sin."
2. "For God is unversed in things evil."
3. "Let none say when he is tempted to evil, From God am I tempted: for God hath no part in evil: but as to the temptation, He tempteth no man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let no one fancy that God lays upon him an inevitable necessity of sinning. God does not send trials on you in order to make you worse, but to make you better." 
2. "Neither do any of our sins tempt God to entice us to worse things, nor does He tempt any of His own accord." 
3. "God is said in Genesis 22:1 to have 'tempted Abraham'; but there the tempting meant is that of trying or proving, not that of seducement."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever there was in trial of any kind to induce us to commit sin... That was only an incidental thing in the trial, and was no part of the divine purpose or design."
2. "Nothing can be presented to [God's] mind as an inducement to do wrong, and as little can he present anything to the mind of man to induce him to sin."
3. "God does not place inducements before us with a view that we should sin, or in order to lead us into sin. None of his decrees, or his arrangements, or his desires, are based on that, but all have some other purpose and end."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not by God, as the direct agent, but by agency proceeding from God."
2. "Is unversed in evil things, as better according both with the usage of the word and with the context."
3. "He himself tempteth no man."

### John Calvin:
1. "This warning is very necessary, for nothing is more common among men than to transfer to another the blame of the evils they commit; and they then especially seem to free themselves when they ascribe it to God himself." 
2. "Scripture asserts that the reprobate are delivered up to depraved lusts; but is it because the Lord depraves or corrupts their hearts? By no means; for their hearts are subjected to depraved lusts because they are already corrupt and vicious."
3. "The meaning is, that man in vain evades, who attempts to cast the blame of his vices on God, because every evil proceeds from no other fountain than from the wicked lust of man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If, instead of enduring the temptation, we yield to it and are overcome by it, we must not lay the blame of our fall from virtue upon God."
2. "In themselves, temptations are not sins; when resisted and overcome, they are promoters of virtue; it is in our voluntary yielding to the temptations, in the consent of the will, that sin arises."
3. "The external tests of character may be from God; but the internal solicitations to evil are from ourselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Temptation does not spring 'from God.'" 
2. "Temptation does not spring 'from God.'" 
3. "And he himself tempteth no man."

### John Gill:
1. "God is holy, and without iniquity, nor does he delight in sin, but hates and abhors it; nor can he commit it, it being contrary to his nature, and the perfections of it." 
2. "God cannot be tempted with evil; he is proof against all such temptations: he cannot be tempted by anything in himself, who is pure and holy, or by any creature or thing without him, to do any sinful action."
3. "He tempted Abraham, to try his faith, love, and obedience to him; he tempted the Israelites in the wilderness, to try them and humble them, and prove what was in their hearts; and he tempted Job, and tried his faith and patience; and so he tempts and tries all his righteous ones, by afflictions, more or less: but he never tempts or solicits them to sin."

### John Wesley:
1. But let no man who is tempted - To sin.
Say, I am tempted of God â€” God thus tempteth no man.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: God does not tempt anyone to do evil, nor does He Himself engage in anything sinful. Temptation does not arise from God, but rather from our own desires and the world around us. When trials come our way, it is not for the purpose of leading us into sin, but rather to build and strengthen our character. We must not shift the blame onto God when we give in to temptation, for it is our own willful yielding that leads to sin. Let us not misunderstand the phrase God tempted Abraham, for it means that God was testing and proving him, not enticing him to sin. So, let us not attribute our vices to God, but recognize that every evil arises from the wickedness within our own hearts.
