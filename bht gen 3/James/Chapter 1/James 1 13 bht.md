# James 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is unversed in things evil, but He does not entice or tempt anyone to sin. Temptation does not spring from God, but rather from human inclination or the allurements of the devil. Although God allows individuals to undergo trials, His purpose is not to lead them into sin, but to test and purify their character. It is important that we do not accuse God or place blame on Him for our own sinful choices, as His intentions are focused on guiding us towards righteousness.

- Attempt 1 BHT: God does not tempt anyone to sin, nor does He have any inclination or desire for mankind to give in to temptation. Rather, He allows individuals to undergo trials and tests to strengthen and purify their character. It is important to understand that temptations do not originate from God, but rather from human inclinations or the enticing efforts of the devil. Therefore, it is futile to accuse God of leading us astray or blame Him for our sins, as His intentions are pure and focused on guiding us towards righteousness.
