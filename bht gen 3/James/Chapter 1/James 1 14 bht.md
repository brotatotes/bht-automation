# James 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Each one is tempted when drawn out and enticed by their own lust. This lust is the effect of sin in themselves, arising from their own temperament and habits. It is like bait that allures and entices, pulling them away from the line of duty. The cause of sin lies within, as even Satan's suggestions cannot harm until they are embraced as our own. We sin because we choose to sin, as no external impulse can be blamed.

- Attempt 4 BHT: Man is tempted by his own lust, a temptation that arises from his sinful nature and is further fueled by his own desires and tendencies. This temptation acts like bait, drawing man away from what is right and enticing him to sin. These desires and temptations are unique to each individual, influenced by their temperament, habits, and predispositions. The blame for succumbing to temptation lies solely with man himself, as even Satan's suggestions can only tempt but not force man to commit evil. Therefore, when man is enticed and drawn away by his own desires, he becomes vulnerable to sin, like a fish lured by bait or a person led astray by a seductive harlot. It is within ourselves that the root of sin lies, and it is our own choices that ultimately lead us to sin.

- Attempt 5 BHT: Each man is tempted by his own lust, drawn away and enticed, as a fish with bait. These lustful desires arise from the original birth-sin in man and are influenced by individual temperament and habit. The cause of sin lies within us, even Satan's suggestions do not harm us before they become our own. Temptation progressively leads us astray, like beasts enticed from safety. The blame for yielding to temptation rests solely on us, for we sin by choice, not constraint.
