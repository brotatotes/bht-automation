# James 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When our will aligns with our lustful desires, sin is conceived and brings forth death. The temptation to sin cannot be attributed to God, as trials originate from Him. Lust, depicted as a harlot, seduces the will, resulting in sin. This sinful action, when completed, begets death. It is crucial to understand that even our thoughts and desires, if left unchecked, can lead to death - both in this life and in eternity.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When our wills align with our sinful desires, it gives birth to sin, which ultimately leads to death. This temptation and resulting sin cannot be attributed to God, as trials are separate from the lure of sin. Lust, depicted as a harlot, seduces the will, and sin becomes the consequence of this unholy union. Sin, therefore, is the offspring of our corrupt passions and the product of our inward depravity. Just as a completed course of sinning brings forth sin, its ultimate outcome is death. It is vital to remember that even our thoughts and desires, if left unchecked, can lead to death - both temporal and eternal.
