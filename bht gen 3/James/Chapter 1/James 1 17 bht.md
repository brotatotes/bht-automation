## BHT:
Every good and perfect gift descends from above, from the Father of lights. God, the Father of those glorious fountains of light, is free from all uncertainty and change, unlike the material heavenly bodies. He is the author and maintainer of the lights, and in Him, there is no trace of variation or shadow of a change. The gifts of God, better than the joys of this present life, are contrasted with the evil that springs from man's lust, leading to righteousness, remission of sins, adoption, regeneration, and eternal life.
