# James 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man's anger and zeal, even in God's behalf, does not produce God's righteousness. Instead, it diverts and blights endeavors, leading only to disgrace. True righteousness is sown in peace, not in wrath. One's personal anger does not necessarily accomplish God's righteousness. The wrath of man brings contention and is not conducive to holiness. It is important to approach God's word and ordinances with a spirit of peace, rather than a wrathful one. The righteousness of God includes all duties pleasing to Him.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Man's anger and zeal, even in the name of God's righteousness, does not produce the righteousness that God desires. Instead, it often leads to hasty and rash speech, disgracing ourselves and the very God we seek to serve. True righteousness is sown in peace, not in wrath. While there is such a thing as righteous indignation, one cannot assume that their own personal anger is automatically promoting God's cause.
