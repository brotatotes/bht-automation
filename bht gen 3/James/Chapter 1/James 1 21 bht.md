## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Putting off all filthiness and abundance of malignity, in mildness receive the implanted word."
2. "The word implanted...is able to save your souls."
3. "The implanted word, working through the spirit, and by the divine Spirit, is a spiritual agency, able to save the soul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Filthiness" is cleansed away by hearing the word.
2. Meekness, I think, includes also a childlike, docile, humble, as well as an uncontentious, spirit.
3. That word which we hear so carelessly, is able (instrumentally) to save us.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sin may be contemplated as a wrong thing; as a violation of law; as evil in its nature and tendency, and therefore to be avoided; or it may be contemplated as disgusting, offensive, loathsome." 
2. "Purity of heart is the best preparation always for seeing the force of truth."
3. "The gospel is here represented under the image of that which is implanted or engrafted from another source; by a figure that would be readily understood, for the art of engrafting is everywhere known."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Filthiness [œÅœÖœÄŒ±œÅŒπŒ±ŒΩ] . Only here in New Testament, but James uses the kindred adjective (ch. 2 2), 'vile raiment.'"
2. "Perisseia is an unclassical word, and occurs in three other New - Testament passages - Romans 5:17; 2 Corinthians 8:2; 2 Corinthians 10:15. In all these it is rendered abundance, both by A. V. and Rev. There seems to be no need of departing from this meaning here, as Rev., overflowing."
3. "Engrafted [ŒµŒºœÜœÖœÑŒøŒΩ] . Only here in New Testament. Better, and more literally, as Rev., implanted. It marks a characteristic of the word of truth (ver. 18). It is implanted; divinely given, in contrast with something acquired by study."

### John Calvin:
1. "He intimates that [the word of life] cannot be rightly received except it be implanted, or strike roots in us... he requires that it should be a living implanting, by which the word becomes as it were united with our heart."
2. "If we desire to be the living plantation of God, we must subdue our proud hearts and be humble, and labor to become like lambs, so as to suffer ourselves to be ruled and guided by our Shepherd."
3. "It is a high eulogy on heavenly truth, that we obtain through it a sure salvation; and this is added, that we may learn to seek and love and magnify the word as a treasure that is incomparable."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lay apart, divest yourself of, all filthiness, pollution...all that malice which is so polluting and abundant in our hearts."
2. "Put away all the defilement and rank growth of malice which like weeds encumber the ground, and prevent the growth of the ingrafted word."
3. "Receive with meekness...a gentle and loving disposition toward our fellow-men...the implanted word that word which by Divine grace is implanted in your hearts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Putting away (Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏ŒµŒºŒµŒΩŒø). Second aorist middle participle of Œ±œÄŒøœÑŒπŒ∏Œ∑Œº, to put off, metaphor of removing clothing as in Romans 13:12; Colossians 3:8; Ephesians 4:22; Ephesians 4:25; 1 Peter 2:1."
2. "Filthiness (œÅœÖœÄŒ±œÅŒπŒ±ŒΩ). Late word (Plutarch) from œÅœÖœÄŒ±œÅŒøœÇ, dirty (James 2:2), here only in N.T. Surely a dirty garment."
3. "The implanted word (œÑŒøŒΩ ŒµŒºœÜœÖœÑŒøŒΩ ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøŒΩ). This old verbal adjective (from ŒµŒºœÜœÖœâ to implant, to grow in), only here in N.T., meaning properly ingrown, inborn, not ŒµŒºœÜœÖœÑŒµœÖœÑŒøŒΩ (engrafted). It is 'the rooted word' (verse James 1:18), sown in the heart as the soil or garden of God (Matthew 13:3-23; Matthew 15:13; 1 Corinthians 3:6)."

### John Gill:
1. "All manner of filthiness, both of flesh and spirit; all pride, vanity, wrath, malice, and evil speaking, under hearing the word: the allusion seems to be to a boiling pot, which casts up scum and filth, which must be taken off."
2. "Receive with meekness the ingrafted word; which becomes so when it is received; when it is put into the heart by the Spirit of God, and is mixed with faith by them that hear it; so that it is, as it were, incorporated into them, and becomes natural to them, which before was not."
3. "The soul is only mentioned, as being the more excellent part of man: this must not be understood of the word, as if it was the author or cause of salvation, but as an instrument; it being a declaration of salvation by Christ, or what shows unto men the way of salvation by him; and is the power of God unto salvation to them, when it is attended with the energy of the Spirit, and the efficacy of divine grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "For however specious or necessary it may appear to worldly wisdom, all wickedness is both vile, hateful, contemptible, and really superfluous." 
2. "Lay this, every known sin, aside, or all your hearing is vain."
3. "The hope of salvation nourishes meekness."
