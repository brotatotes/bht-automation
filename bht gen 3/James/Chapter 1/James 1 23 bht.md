# James 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One's faith is demonstrated by the action they take in response to God's word. If one merely hears the word but does not put it into practice, they are like a person who looks at their reflection in a mirror and then forgets what they look like. The word of God serves as a mirror where we can perceive our moral visage and recognize both our natural vileness and God's glory. It is not enough to passively hear the word; we must actively put it into action and be transformed by it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If any is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, this man is like to a man contemplating the countenance of his birth in a mirror."
2. "The word of God is a mirror in which we may and ought to see our moral visage."
3. "...the easy translation of the remark from the one department to the other, in which 'the word of God is a mirror in which we may and ought to see our moral visage.'"


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The true disciple, say the rabbis, learns in order that he may do, not in order that he may merely know or teach."
2. "As a man may behold his natural face in a mirror, so the hearer may perceive his moral visage in God's Word."
3. "This faithful portraiture of man's soul in Scripture, is the strongest proof of the truth of the latter. In it, too, we see mirrored God's glory, as well as our natural vileness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is not mere careless hearing of the word which James rebukes, but the neglect to carry into practice what is heard." 
2. "One may be an attentive and critical hearer of the word, yet not a doer."
3. "His natural face, the countenance of his birth."

### John Calvin:
1. "Heavenly doctrine is indeed a mirror in which God presents himself to our view; but so that we may be transformed unto his image." 
2. "A doctrine merely heard and not received inwardly into the heart avails nothing, because it soon vanishes away." 
3. "External glance of the eye, not of the vivid and efficacious meditation which penetrates into the heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A hearer of the word, who is not a doer, resembles a man seeing his face in a mirror, without its making any permanent impression upon him."
2. "If any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face: literally, 'the countenance of his birth, that face with which he was born; and therefore here well translated 'his natural face.'"
3. "The ancients had no looking-glasses properly so called; their mirrors were usually made of polished metals. In them objects could be but dimly discerned: 'Now we see through a glass darkly' (1 Corinthians 13:12)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unto a man beholding... to take note of." 
2. "His natural face... the face of his birth." 
3. "In a mirror... The mirrors of the ancients were not of glass, but of polished metal."

### John Gill:
1. "not hearing, but practice, is the main thing; not theory, but action"
2. "if a man is only a preacher, or a hearer, and not a doer"
3. "he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass"

### John Wesley:

- Attempt 1 BHT: If one merely hears the word of God without putting it into action, they are like someone who looks in a mirror and forgets what they look like. The word of God is a mirror that reflects our moral visage, allowing us to see both our natural vileness and God's glory. It is not enough to simply hear and analyze the word; one must also practice and apply it in their life. The mirrors of the ancients were not like our modern glass mirrors, but rather polished metal that provided a dim reflection, reminding us that our understanding may be incomplete and imperfect. Therefore, let us not be mere hearers of the word, but doers of it, allowing it to transform us into the image of God.
