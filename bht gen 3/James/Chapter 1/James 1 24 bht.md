# James 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He looked at himself for a moment and then went on his way, immediately forgetting what he had seen. This forgetfulness is not excusable, as it represents a hasty and careless attitude towards the truth. The image he saw may have revealed his flaws or his beauty, but either way, it made no meaningful impression on him. It is as if he glanced at himself in passing, without truly knowing or remembering his own features. He becomes a mere hearer of the word, acknowledging his shortcomings and admiring the perfection of Christ, yet failing to put it into practice or reflect upon it once the discourse is over.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He contemplated himself, and has departed, and immediately forgot of what appearance he was." 
2. "It is to be observed, that the contemplating answers to the hearing of the word: the going away to the relaxing the attention after hearingâ€”letting the mind go elsewhere, and the interest of the thing heard pass away: and then the forgetfulness in both cases follows."
3. "In the next verse we pass to one who looks and does not depart."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Forgetfulness is no excuse."
2. "No sooner has he contemplated his image than he is gone his way."
3. "The repetition expresses hastiness joined with levity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. He beholdeth [ÎºÎ±Ï„ÎµÎ½Î¿Î·ÏƒÎµÎ½] . The aorist tense, throwing the sentence into a lively, narrative form : he beheld himself and forgot. Compare ver. 11.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "For he contemplated himself, and has gone his way, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was."
2. "A man has seldom any true or accurate notion of his own features: from beholding himself in a glass or mirror, he retains no distinct recollection of what he has seen."
3. "No distinct impression is made on him; he cannot recall his own features."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He glanced at himself and off he has gone and straightway forgot what sort of a man he was."

### John Gill:
1. "He takes a slight glance of himself, and departs." 
2. "He forgets either his spots, blemishes, and imperfections; or his comeliness and beauty."
3. "A bare hearer of the word, who is not concerned to practise what he hears, while he is hearing, he observes some things amiss in himself, and some excellencies in Christ; but, when the discourse is over, he goes his way, and thinks no more of either."

### John Wesley:
1. He beheld himself, and went away â€” To other business.
And forgot â€” But such forgetting does not excuse.
