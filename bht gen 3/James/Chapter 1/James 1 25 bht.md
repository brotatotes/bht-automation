### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The perfect law of liberty: corresponding to the glass in the metaphor, the same as the word of truth or the implanted word, namely, the Gospel of Christ. By this, then, is not meant the natural law, nor the moral law as such, but the Gospel in so far as it becomes a law of life and morals."
2. "But the Gospel is a law of liberty: it not only delivers man from condemnation, but, by implanting within him a new disposition, it causes him of his own free will and choice to obey the moral law; it not only imparts to him the power of obedience, but the will to obey."
3. "The righteous shall be rewarded for their doing: to those on the right hand, the King will say, 'Well done.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel proclaims this liberty to captive souls; and is the word of truth, which makes them free, or is the means of freeing them from the slavery of sin, from the captivity of Satan, and from the bondage of the law; and is what gives souls freedom and boldness at the throne of grace; and is that which leads them into the liberty of grace here, and gives them a view and hope of the glorious liberty of the children of God hereafter."
2. "Such a looking [into the glass or doctrine] is designed, as is attended with effect; such an one as transforms into the same image that is beheld, from glory to glory; and happy is the man that so looks into it."
3. "This man shall be blessed in his deed; or 'doing', and while he is doing; not that he is blessed for what he does, but 'in' what he does; he having, in hearing the word, and looking into it, and in submitting to every ordinance of the Gospel, the presence of God, the discoveries of his love, communion with Christ, and communication of grace from him by the Spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "But he that looketh diligently...fixing his eyes, and searching all to the bottom."
