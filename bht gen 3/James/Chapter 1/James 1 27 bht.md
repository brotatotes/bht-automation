# James 1:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pure and undefiled religion, the right spirit of religion, demands personal contact with the world's sorrow: to visit the afflicted, and to visit them in their affliction. God is so called to imply that if we would be like our Father, it is not by fasting, for He does none of these things, but in being merciful as our Father is merciful. Religion in its rise interests us about ourselves in its progress, about our fellow creatures: in its highest stage, about the honor of God.
