## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "If any of you is deficient in wisdom...let him ask from God who giveth...to all men simply and upbraideth not."
3. "The real meaning here is just as in Ecclus. xx. 15, 'He giveth little, and upbraideth much,' and in Ecclus. xli. 22, 'After thou hast given, upbraid not,' viz. upbraiding with any kind of reproaches, as God might well do, so unworthy are we to approach Him with any request."

3. "God hears every true prayer and grants either the thing asked, or else something better than it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are in great danger of going wrong when we are afflicted; of complaining and murmuring; of evincing a spirit of rebellion, and of losing the benefits which we might have obtained if we had submitted to the trial in a proper manner."
2. "It is one of the privileges of Christians, that they may not only go to God and ask him for that general wisdom which is needful for them in life, but that whenever a particular emergency arises, a case of perplexity and difficulty in regard to duty, they may bring that particular thing before his throne, with the assurance that he will guide them."

### John Calvin:
1. "If this doctrine is higher than what your minds can reach to, ask of the Lord to illuminate you by his Spirit; for as this consolation alone is sufficient to mitigate all the bitterness of evils, that what is grievous to the flesh is salutary to us; so we must necessarily be overcome with impatience, except we be sustained by this kind of comfort."
