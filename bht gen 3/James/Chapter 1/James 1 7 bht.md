# James 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Real faith is more than mere surmise. While God provides for our needs, the waverer won't receive anything granted specifically in answer to prayer. Putting confidence in God is crucial, as He sees our heart and won't answer petitions from those who lack belief, trust, and reliance on Him. Expecting favor without genuine faith is a delusion. The term Lord here refers to God, not Christ, emphasizing the importance of faith in receiving both the Lord Jesus Christ Himself and other grace from Him.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Real faith is not just a mere thought or assumption; it goes beyond that. While God does provide for our general needs, like food and clothing, the waverer, without a steadfast faith, cannot expect to receive anything specifically granted in answer to prayer, let alone wisdom. It is important to put our confidence in God and have a true belief in His existence, perfections, and promises. God sees the heart, and if He discerns a lack of trust and reliance, it is not reasonable for Him to grant our requests. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that we will receive any favor without genuine faith. The Lord mentioned in this verse refers to God [Jehovah], not Christ. Faith is the grace that allows us to receive the Lord Jesus Christ Himself and all other grace from Him. Without faith, like the wavering man described, we cannot receive anything.
