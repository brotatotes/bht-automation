## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is a man with two minds, unstable in all his ways."
2. "The common way, to take 'a double-minded man' as a new subject, has this against it, that it makes the very unusual word 'doubled-souled,' found here and in ch. iv. 8 for the first time in Greek literature, to be a mere usual epithet and word of passage."
3. "Such is the best way of taking this sentence, making it all predicate and all to apply to that man as its subject."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The word for 'double-minded' is found here and in James 1:7- :, for the first time in Greek literature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A double minded man... means, properly, one who has two souls; then one who is wavering or inconstant."
2. "The hesitancy which manifested on that one subject would extend to all; and we might expect to find such a man irresolute and undetermined in all things."
3. "If we find a man who takes hold of the promises of God with firmness... we shall find one who is firm in his principles, steady in his integrity, settled in his determinations, and steadfast in his plans of life - a man whose character we shall feel that we understand, and in whom we can confide."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Let not that man think, etc., 'a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.'"

3. "Unstable [Î±ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±ÏƒÏ„Î±Ï„Î¿Ï‚]. Only here in New Testament. The kindred ajkatastasia, confusion, is found ch. 3 16, and elsewhere."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then says that the unbelieving, who have tortuous recesses, are unstable; because they are never firm or fixed, but at one time they swell with the confidence of the flesh, at another they sink into the depth of despair."
2. "The double-minded man...means here no doubt the man who hesitates between faith and unbelief, because faith is the subject of the passage."
3. "When [double-minded] is used again, in James 4:8, it means a hesitation between God and the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He,' that is, the doubter, 'is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."
2. "Double-mindedness is here used not in the sense of duplicity, but of dubiousness and indecision a man whose affections are divided between God and the world."

3. "Surely to James such 'doubt' is no mark of intellectuality." (12 words)

### John Gill:
1. "A man of two souls, or of a double heart, that speaks and asks with an heart, and an heart... halts between two opinions, and is at an uncertainty what to do or say..."
