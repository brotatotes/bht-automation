# James 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ by measuring individual Christians based on their fortune and external qualities, and by preferring some over others according to this standard. The glory of Christ resting on the poor believer should make them be regarded as highly by their brethren as their richer brother. The equality of all Christians as brethren is the groundwork of this admonition. Hold not the faith of our common Lord, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons, but rather let the equality of Christians be the foundation for their actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fault itself, as here intended, is easily explained by the context, where an example is taken of one kind of it. Theile says well, that it is the fault of measuring individual Christians not by their Christian graces, but by their fortune, and external qualities,‚Äîand of preferring some to others according to this standard."
2. "Hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The equality of all Christians as 'brethren,' forms the groundwork of the admonition."
2. "James grounds Christian practice on Christian faith."
3. "The glory of Christ resting on the poor believer should make him be regarded as highly by 'brethren' as his richer brother; nay, more so, if the poor believer has more of Christ's spirit than the rich brother."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Faith is the distinguishing thing in the Christian religion, for it is this by which man is justified, and hence, it comes to be put for religion itself." 
2. "The meaning here is, 'do not hold such views of the religion of Christ, as to lead you to manifest partiality to others on account of their difference of rank or outward circumstances.'"
3. "The design here seems to be to show that the religion of such a Lord should be in no way dishonored."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Have [ŒµœáŒµœÑŒµ] . Rev., hold, not in the sense of hold fast, cleave to, but of possessing, occupying, and practicing, as a matter of habit."
2. "With respect of persons [ŒµŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÉœâœÄŒøŒªŒ∑ŒºœàŒπŒ±ŒπœÇ] . From proswpon, the countenance, and lambanw, to receive."
3. "The Lord of glory."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he does not simply disapprove of honor being paid to the rich, but that this should not be done in a way so as to despise or reproach the poor." 
2. "He sins who honors the rich alone and despises the poor, and treats him with contempt."
3. "The respect of persons is inconsistent with the faith of Christ, so that they cannot be united together, and rightly so."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hold not (ŒºŒ∑ ŒµœáŒµœÑŒµ). Present active imperative of Œµœáœâ with negative ŒºŒ∑, exhortation to stop holding or not to have the habit of holding in the fashion condemned." 
2. "The faith of our Lord Jesus Christ (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒπœÉœÑŒπŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒøœÖ Œ∑ŒºœâŒΩ ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ). Clearly objective genitive, not subjective (faith of), but 'faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,' like ŒµœáŒµœÑŒµ œÄŒπœÉœÑŒπŒΩ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ (Mark 11:22), 'have faith in God.'" 
3. "James thus terms 'our Lord Jesus Christ' the Shekinah Glory of God. See Hebrews 9:5 for 'the cherubim of Glory.' Other New Testament passages where Jesus is pictured as the Glory are Romans 9:4; 2 Corinthians 4:6; Ephesians 1:17; Hebrews 1:3. Cf. 2 Corinthians 8:9; Philippians 2:5-11."

### John Gill:
1. "since the saints are all brethren, they are children of the same Father, belong to the same family, and are all one in Christ Jesus, whether high or low, rich, or poor"
2. "faith, whether as a doctrine or as a grace, is alike precious, and common to all"
3. "the poor as well as the rich are espoused by him, as their Lord and husband; and are redeemed by him, and are equally under his government and protection, and members of his body"
