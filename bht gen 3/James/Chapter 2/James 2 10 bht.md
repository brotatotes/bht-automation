Breaking one part of the law makes us guilty of the entire law. God does not accept reservations or selective obedience. We must not choose parts of the law to keep based on our whims while neglecting others. Perfect obedience, not partial, is what God requires.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: If we stumble in even one aspect of the law, we are found guilty of breaking the entire law. The law is not a pick-and-choose selection of commandments that we can selectively obey to suit our preferences. Just as a garment is torn if even a small part is ripped, or a musical harmony is disrupted with one discordant note, so too does breaking one part of the law render us lawbreakers in the eyes of God. We must strive for perfect obedience, not partial obedience, and not exempt ourselves from certain commandments that we may find inconvenient or displeasing.

We cannot choose which commandments to follow and which to neglect based on our own preferences. God requires perfect obedience, not partial obedience.

All of us, in our imperfection, are transgressors of the law, deserving its penalty.
