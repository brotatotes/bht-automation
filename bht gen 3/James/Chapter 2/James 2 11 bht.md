# James 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who made the whole law, God Himself, declared, Commit not adultery, said also, Commit not murder. If we violate His will in even one thing, we violate it all. Adultery and murder serve as glaring examples of violations against our neighbors. Transgressing one article of the law is seen as destroying the righteousness of God. Therefore, it is crucial to obey all the laws of God without exception, as any violation makes us transgressors of the law.

- Attempt 1 BHT: God is the One who made the whole law, so if we violate His will in even one thing, we are violating it all. Committing adultery and murder are highlighted as examples of glaring violations of our duty towards our neighbors, showing that going beyond the line and crossing into transgression is not limited to physical actions. The unity of the law lies in the Lawgiver Himself, and transgressing one article of the law is seen as destroying the righteousness of God. Therefore, it is essential to obey all the laws of God without exception, as any violation makes us transgressors of the law.
