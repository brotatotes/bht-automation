# James 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. The judgment that is coming shall be unmerciful to those who have not shown mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment, knowing that it cannot condemn them. The mercy of God towards believers, producing mercy on their part, allows them to triumph over the judgment that all deserve. Only mercy can triumph over justice with God and men. So let us show mercy to our fellow men, in expectation of receiving mercy from God.
