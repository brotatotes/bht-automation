- Attempt 1 BHT: Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. The judgment of God, which condemns all, is overwhelmed and overcome by the blessed effect of mercy. It is an abstract saying, purposely leaving mercy unlimited as a universal truth. Mercy triumphs over judgment and rejoices against it, standing by the throne of God, clothed in divine glory. Only mercy can triumph over justice with God and men. Therefore, let us show mercy to others, for if we do not, there will be judgment without mercy. But when we show mercy, mercy itself triumphs, intercedes, breaks chains, and rescues us from the dread and terror of judgment. It is through God's mercy alone that we find deliverance from judgment and can rejoice confidently in the day of judgment, knowing that His mercy prevails over judgment.
