# James 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a fellow Christian is found destitute of daily food, lacking sufficient clothing, it is our duty to help them. The case of a Christian brother or sister brings out our obligation to assist them, emphasizing the importance of love as the instrument by which our faith works. Just as sending away a poor man with empty words is a mockery, having faith without works is useless and cannot save. Therefore, let us not trifle with God by neglecting to provide practical help to our brothers and sisters in need.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if a brother or a sister be naked and destitute of daily food..." 
2. "The case of a Christian brother or sister is supposed, to bring out more strongly the obligation to help, as a duty."
3. "Extreme destitution, and nakedness in the literal, or almost literal sense, might well go together."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But if," &c.: the "But" taking up the argument against such a one as "said he had faith, and yet had not works," which are its fruits.
2. "A brother...a fellow Christian, to whom we are specially bound to give help, independent of our general obligation to help all our fellow creatures."

### John Calvin:
1. "If any one, on the contrary, boasted that he was satisfied with faith without works, he compares this shadowy faith to the saying of one who bids a famished man to be filled without supplying him with the food of which he is destitute."
2. "As, then, he who sends away a poor man with words, and offers him no help, treats him with mockery, so they who devise for themselves faith without works, and without any of the duties of religion, trifle with God."
3. "This is adduced as an illustration: as the saying of a man to the naked, 'Be ye clothed,' when he does nothing, effects no good, is wholly useless, so is that faith that produces no works; it being as it were dead, it cannot save."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To prove the uselessness of a barren faith, the apostle illustrates the subject by showing the uselessness of a barren charity, which every one will at once admit." 
2. "Love is the indispensable attendant on a living faith, the instrument by which it works." 
3. "A Christian brother or sister, a fellow-believer, bringing forward more strongly our duty to assist them, and our culpability if we refuse such assistance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It does not here mean absolutely naked, but without sufficient clothing as in Matthew 25:36; John 21:7; Acts 19:16."
2. "Present passive participle of ŒªŒµŒπœÄœâ and ablative case œÑœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÇ like ŒªŒµŒπœÄŒµœÑŒ± œÉŒøœÜŒπŒ±œÇ (James 1:5)."
3. "The old adjective ŒµœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒøœÇ (Œø ŒµœÄ Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±ŒΩ œâŒΩ, that which is for a day) occurs here only in the N.T., though ŒµœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒπŒ± (daily routine) is found in Luke 1:5; Luke 1:8."
