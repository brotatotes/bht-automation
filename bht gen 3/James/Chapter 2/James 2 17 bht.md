# James 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith without works is dead in itself. This means that if faith does not produce good works, it is as good as dead. Faith and works are closely intertwined in the Apostle's estimation, with works being the evidence of living faith. Without works, faith has no life and cannot rightly be called faith. It is akin to a body without a soul, a lifeless carcass. Works are the fruit that faith produces, and without them, faith is empty and of no benefit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "So also faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself."
2. "The quasi-identification of the faith with the man, and ascription of the works to it as a possession, show in what relative places the two stand in the Apostle's estimate."
3. "It is dead, not merely to this extent, but absolutely, in itself: has no living root whereby it energizes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If the works which living faith produces have no existence, it is a proof that faith itself (literally, 'in respect to itself') has no existence; that is, that what one boasts of as faith, is dead." 
2. "'Faith' is said to be 'dead in itself,' because when it has works it is alive, and it is discerned to be so, not in respect to its works, but in respect to itself."
3. "Even so presumed faith, if it have not works, is dead, being by itself 'alone,' that is, severed from works of charity; just as the body would be 'dead' if alone, that is, severed from the spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Being alone [καθ εαυτην] . Wrong. Rev., correctly, in itself. The phrase belongs to dead. It is dead, not merely in reference to something else, but absolutely.


### John Calvin:
1. "He says that faith is dead, being by itself, that is, when destitute of good works."
2. "We hence conclude that it is indeed no faith, for when dead, it does not properly retain the name."
3. "The Sophists plead this expression and say, that some sort of faith is found by itself; but this frivolous caviling is easily refuted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even so; as charity without works is dead, so faith, if it hath not works, if it be merely a theoretical assent to the truths of revelation, is dead." 
2. "The works then are those of a living faith, those to which faith gives birth."
3. "But faith has no winter; if it has not works, it has no life in it, and ought not to be called faith, for dead faith is no faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If it keep on not having works."
2. "In and of itself, inwardly and outwardly dead."
3. "It is a dead faith."

### John Gill:
1. "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. It is like a lifeless carcass, a body without a soul."

### John Wesley:
1. "Faith which hath not works is a mere dead, empty notion."
2. "Of no more profit to him that hath it, than the bidding the naked be clothed is to him."
