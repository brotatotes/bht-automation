# James 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a Christian assembly, or even a general gathering, believers come together as a united people, similar to a synagogue assembly. As James 2:2 describes, there is a contrast between a man with gold rings and splendid garments, indicating wealth and status, and a poor man in vile raiment, indicating poverty. This highlights the error of comparing the Church to the temple and the ministry to the priesthood. Rather, true Christian fellowship transcends outward appearances, calling us to reject favoritism and embrace equality within the body of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the word may well be understood of a Christian assembly, or as merely an assembly in general." 
2. "a man with gold rings...in a splendid garment" 
3. "and there have come in also a poor man in a vile garment"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christian churches were built like the synagogues, the holy table in the east end of the former, as the ark was in the latter; the desk and pulpit were the chief articles of furniture in both alike."
2. "This shows the error of comparing the Church to the temple, and the ministry to the priesthood; the temple is represented by the whole body of worshippers; the church building was formed on the model of the synagogue."
3. "The 'synagogue' implies a mere assembly or congregation not necessarily united by any common tie. 'Church,' a people bound together by mutual ties and laws, though often it may happen that the members are not assembled."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'synagogue' (œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥Œ∑ÃÄŒΩ sunagoÃÑgeÃÑn) would properly refer to the whole congregation, considered as 'assembled together,' without respect to the question whether all were truly pious or not."
2. "The word 'church' (ŒµÃìŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπÃÅŒ± ekkleÃÑsia) would refer to the assembly convened for worship as called out, referring to the fact that they were called out from the world, and convened as worshippers of God."
3. "A man with a gold ring - Indicative of rank or property."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Assembly [œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥Œ∑ŒΩ] . The word synagogue is a transcript of this."
2. "Not a man wearing a single gold ring...but a gold-ringed man, having his hands conspicuously loaded with rings and jewels."
3. "Lit., bright or shining clothes. Rev., fine clothing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word employed in the Greek is ‚Äòsynagogue,‚Äô Some understand it of the Jewish synagogue, from which believers had not yet separated themselves; but against this opinion is the pronoun ‚Äòyour,‚Äô nor would Christians in a synagogue not their own be permitted to give any preference of place to those who entered."
2. "The gorgeous dresses of the Orientals may be here alluded to. In that age of luxury the rich prided themselves on the extravagance of their dress."
3. "Into their place for religious assembly two men entered, the one gorgeously arrayed with jewelled fingers and a great display of riches; the other a poor man in shabby apparel, soiled with his daily manual occupations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here the first is the probable meaning as it clearly is in Hebrews 10:25 (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµœÄŒπœÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥Œ∑ŒΩ ŒµŒ±œÖœÑœâŒΩ), where the longer compound occurs."
2. "It may seem a bit odd for a Christian church (ŒµŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπŒ±) to be termed œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥Œ∑, but James is writing to Jewish Christians and this is another incidental argument for the early date."
3. "A man with a gold ring (Œ±ŒΩŒ∑œÅ œáœÅœÖœÉŒøŒ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒπŒøœÇ). 'A gold-fingered man,' 'wearing a gold ring.'"

### John Gill:
1. "a man with a gold ring; on his finger, which shows him to be a man of dignity and wealth"
2. "in goodly apparel; gay clothing, bright shining garments, glistering with gold and silver, very rich and costly, as well as whole, neat, and clean"
3. "and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; mean and despicable, filthy and ragged"

### John Wesley:
1. With gold rings ‚Äî Which were not then so common as now.

- Attempt 1 BHT: A Christian assembly, much like the synagogue, is a gathering of believers bound together by mutual ties and laws. In James 2:2, we see the contrast between a man with gold rings and splendid garments, symbolizing wealth and status, and a poor man in vile raiment, representing poverty and lesser social standing. These differences illustrate the error of comparing the Church to the temple and the ministry to the priesthood. Rather, the Church is a people united by a common faith, not solely based on external appearances or possessions. This passage challenges us to avoid favoritism based on outward circumstances and instead embrace the unity and equality found in true Christian fellowship.
