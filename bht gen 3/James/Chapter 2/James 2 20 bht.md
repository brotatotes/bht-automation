# James 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who deceive themselves with an empty and unreal faith, resting on a delusive hope, are like barren and idle land. Their faith, devoid of works, is dead and unavailing, unable to save them. The true nature of faith is exposed when it fails to produce good works, for faith without works is not faith at all, but rather faithlessness. Let us not be like vain and empty vessels, boasting in our faith while lacking the fruit of righteousness.
