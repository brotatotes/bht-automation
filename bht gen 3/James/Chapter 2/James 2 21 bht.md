# James 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham, our father, was justified not just by faith, but also by the works he performed when he brought Isaac to the altar. This act of obedience, arising from his deep belief in God, proves the genuineness of his faith. James, like Paul, acknowledges that it was Abraham's faith that was counted as righteousness before God. While Paul emphasizes pre-circumcision faith as the basis of justification, James highlights the connection between faith and works. There is no contradiction; rather, James provides further understanding on the relationship between faith and works.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "In James 2:23, James, like Paul, recognizes the Scripture truth, that it was his faith that was counted to Abraham for righteousness in his justification before God." 
3. "When he had offered... that is, brought as an offering at the altar; not implying that he actually offered him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He does teach that where there are no good works, or where there is not a holy life, there is no true religion; that that faith which is not productive of good works is of no value..."
2. "The evidence to which he appeals in regard to faith, is good works and a holy life; and where that exists it shows that the faith is genuine."

2. "By works gives the general ground; offered, etc., the specific work." 
3. "The word ajnenegkav is, lit., brought up to; and means, not actually to offer up in sacrifice (though Isaac was morally sacrificed in Abraham 's will), but to bring to the altar as an offering."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought to seek out a right interpretation according to the general drift of the whole passage."
2. "James does not speak here of the cause of justification, or of the manner how men obtain righteousness...but that his object was only to show that good works are always connected with faith."
3. "Doubtless James did not mean to teach us here the ground on which our hope of salvation ought to rest; and it is this alone that Paul dwells upon."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The example of Abraham would readily occur to every Jew, on account of the importance of that patriarch in their national history."
2. "Paul asserts that Abraham was justified by the unseen principle of faith; he simply believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness, James affirms that the faith by which Abraham was justified was a faith which manifested itself by works."
3. "This great act of obedience was certainly a work of faith, arising from Abrahamâ€™s practical belief in God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But Paul is talking about the faith of Abraham before his circumcision (James 4:10) as the basis of his being set right with God, which faith is symbolized in the circumcision."
2. "There is no contradiction at all between James and Paul. Neither is answering the other."
3. "James makes plain his meaning also."

### John Gill:
1. "Not as the causes of his justification, but as effects of it, showing the truth of his faith, and the reality of his justification: he had both faith and works, and the former were known by the latter."
2. "Now if this was the case of Abraham...he is, and must be a vain man, that talks of faith without works; and his faith must be a dead one."
3. "This was not the only act of obedience, or good work, which he performed; but this being a very eminent one, the apostle instances in it, as a very considerable evidence of his faith in God, and love to him; and which showed him to be a justified person."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was justified, therefore, in St. Paul's sense, (that is, accounted righteous,) by faith, antecedent to his works."
2. "He was justified in St. James's sense, (that is, made righteous,) by works, consequent to his faith."
3. "So that St. James's justification by works is the fruit of St Paul's justification by faith."
