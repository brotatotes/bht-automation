### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "So James quotes Genesis 15:6 as proving his point in verse James 2:21 that Abraham had works with his faith, the very same passage that Paul quotes in Romans 4:3 to show that Abraham's faith preceded his circumcision and was the basis of his justification." 
2. "And he was called the friend of God (Œ∫Œ± œÜŒπŒªŒøœÇ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ ŒµŒ∫ŒªŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑). First aorist passive indicative of Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒ∑Œø. Not a part of the Scripture quoted."
