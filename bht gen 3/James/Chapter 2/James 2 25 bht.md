# James 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rahab, the saved harlot, was justified by her works, which manifested her genuine faith through receiving and thrusting forth the messengers in haste and fear. She serves as an example of how faith is not just a verbal profession but is expressed and proven through works. Rahab's inclusion alongside Abraham highlights the significance of her faith and shows that justifying faith can be found in people from every class and background. Her story reminds us that faith without works is incomplete and lacks the full realization of God's grace.

2. "The nature of the works alleged is such as to prove that James uses them only as evidences of faith, as contrasted with a mere verbal profession: not works of charity and piety, but works the value of which consisted solely in their being proofs of faith: they were faith expressed in act, synonymous with faith itself."
3. "Justifying faith has been manifested in those of every class."
