# James 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In making a clear distinction between the rich and the poor, you have expressed doubt about your faith. Your partiality and preference for the rich demonstrate evil thoughts and a divided mind. Such distinctions based on appearances and material possessions contradict the true nature of faith, which is not swayed by outward differences. Instead, true judgment should be based on character and moral worth, rather than external factors. Your faith should abolish these unjust distinctions and demonstrate impartiality in all aspects of life.

### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do you not show that you are partial?"
2. "They did it not from benevolence; not from a desire to do justice to all according to their moral character; but from that improper feeling which leads us to show honor to men on account of their external appearance, rather than their real worth."
3. "The sense is, that we have no right to form a decisive judgment of men on their first appearance, as we do when we treat one with respect and the other not; and that when we make up our opinion in regard to them, it should be by some other means of judging than the question whether they can wear gold rings, and dress well, or not."

3. "Their evil processes of thought lead to these unjust discriminations."

2. "For to hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect to persons is a contradiction in terms."
