# James 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has chosen the poor as rich in faith, making them heirs of His promised kingdom. Their poverty, in the world's eyes, does not diminish their true riches, which lie in their faith. The poor, as a class, contribute more believers than the rich. Believers, no matter how poor they may be, possess true riches in their faith. Instead of looking down on the poor, we should honor and acknowledge them, for they are chosen and blessed by God.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: God has chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the promised kingdom. Being poor in the world's eyes does not diminish their true riches, which come from their faith and their position as children of God. It is not that God chose all the poor, but specifically poor people who have faith. Their poverty reflects Christ's own poverty, which is the source of believers' riches. Despite their lack of worldly goods, believers are truly rich because of their faith. So instead of looking down on the poor, we should honor and consider them blessed.
