# James 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is improper to dishonor the poor, those whom God honors, and to favor the rich who oppress and drag you to court. The rich, whom you show respect, are the very ones who treat you unjustly. You have despised the poor and given preference to those who are enemies of both you and Christ. Do not forget that the rich often oppress and drag you to court. This is not to say that all rich men are the same, but rather that you should not dishonor the poor in favor of the rich.
