# James 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By dishonoring the poor in comparison with the rich, one is contravening the standard of honor set by God, and in turn, helping to blaspheme the name of Christ. The rich heathen and rich Christians, by their inconsistency, directly cause Christ's name to be blasphemed. This is a disgraceful act, for the name of Christ is a beautiful and honorable name invoked in baptism. It is crucial that Christians do not engage in such behavior, as it leads to the dishonor and blasphemy of Christ's name among both Jews and Gentiles.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who dishonor the poor in favor of the rich are contravening the standard of honor which God sets up. By doing so, they are indirectly blaspheming the name of Christ and causing it to be spoken against. It is the rich heathens, and even rich Christians, who engage in such behavior and bring disgrace upon the honorable name of Christ. This blasphemy against Christ's name is emphasized, for it is a beautiful name that was invoked in our baptism. It is a name that should be respected and revered, not defamed. Christians should not associate themselves more closely with the wealthy and powerful than with their poorer brethren, for by doing so they are contributing to the dishonor and blasphemy of Christ's name.
