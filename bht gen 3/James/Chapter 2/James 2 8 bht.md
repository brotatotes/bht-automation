## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is called a 'royal law,' or kingly law, on account of its excellence or nobleness; not because it is ordained by God as a king, but because it has some such prominence and importance among other laws as a king has among other men; that is, it is majestic, noble, worthy of veneration."
2. "You are to regard all persons as your 'neighbors,' and are to treat them according to their real worth; you are not to be influenced in judging of them, or in your treatment of them, by their apparel, or their complexion, or the circumstances of their birth, but by the fact that they are fellow-beings."
3. "This is another reason why they should not show partiality in their treatment of others, for if, in the true sense, they regarded all others as 'neighbors,' they would treat no one with neglect or contempt."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fulfill the royal law. The phrase occurs only here and Romans 2:27. Telein, fulfill, is stronger than the more common word threin, observe or keep, which appears in ver. 10."
2. "It is the royal law; the king of all laws. The phrase royal law is of Roman origin (lex regia). In the kingly period of Roman history it did not signify a law promulgated by the absolute authority of the king, but a law passed by a popular assembly under the presidency of the king."
3. "The pleasure of the emperor, according to Justinian, has the vigor and effect of law, since the Roman people, by the royal law, have transferred to their prince the full extent of their own power and sovereignty."

### John Calvin:
1. "If you pretend that there is a sort of love in what you do, this may be easily disproved; for God bids us to love our neighbors, and not to show respect of persons."
2. "He, then, who says that a very few, according to his own fancy, ought to be honored, and others passed by, does not keep the law of God, but yields to the depraved desires of his own heart."
3. "It is said, indeed, to be a royal law, as it is the royal way, or road; that is, plain, straight, and level, which, by implication, is set in opposition to sinuous by-paths and windings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law which is the king of all laws, which includes in itself all other commandments."
2. "Love to our neighbor is not so much a single command as the principle of all true obedience; it is the chief of all laws."
3. "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well. For then it would follow that if you did so, you would not have this respect of persons."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
