# James 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we show favoritism or discriminate against others, it is a sin because we are breaking God's command to love our neighbors without partiality. This sin encompasses the entire law, not just a single commandment. When we have respect of persons, we commit sin and are convicted as transgressors by the law. This is a serious offense, as the law reproves and convinces us of our error. The sin of partiality is condemned throughout Scripture, and we should strive to treat all people with love and equality.
