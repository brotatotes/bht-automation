# James 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The warning given here is against the hasty desire to assume the role of a teacher, as not everyone is truly qualified for such responsibility. While being a teacher is a noble position, it carries great danger of failure. Those who take on this role will face greater condemnation if they abuse it, compared to those who are mere hearers. Careful discernment should be exercised in selecting worthy and competent teachers, rather than allowing ambition to drive the desire for the position.
