## BHT:
Life and death are in the power of the tongue, making it morally incongruous for blessing and cursing to come from the same mouth.

Such conduct deserves severe reprobation, and it is our responsibility to ensure that blessings, not curses, flow from our mouths. This inconsistency, whether in religious councils or among individuals, is unworthy of those who seek to honor God.
