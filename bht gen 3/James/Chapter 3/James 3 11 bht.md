# James 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The imagery of a fountain is used in this verse to emphasize the contrast between the sweet and the bitter.

This illustration, familiar to the readers in Palestine, serves as a reminder that a cursing tongue is contrary to the order established by God and that a double tongue cannot bring forth blessings and cursing.
