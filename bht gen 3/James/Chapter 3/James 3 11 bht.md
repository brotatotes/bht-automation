# James 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse compares the dichotomy of a fountain sending forth both sweet and bitter water to the contrast between blessing and cursing coming from the same mouth. Just as it is unnatural for a fountain to produce both kinds of water simultaneously, it is likewise unnatural for a person to speak both words of blessing and words of cursing. This imagery of a fountain serves as a reminder of various instances in Scripture where God transformed bitter waters into sweet, symbolizing the power of grace to change the heart. The readers of the epistle would be familiar with these biblical accounts and understand the significance of this analogy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Illustration from nature, that such conduct is unnatural."
2. "Doth a fountain out of the same chink send forth the sweet and the bitter?"
3. "The contrast is in the contrary nature of the two."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "fountain‚Äîan image of the heart: as the aperture (so the Greek for 'place' is literally) of the fountain is an image of man's mouth."
2. "Grace can make the same mouth that 'sent forth the bitter' once, send forth the sweet for the time to come."
3. "as the wood (typical of Christ's cross) changed Marah's bitter water into sweet."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Doth a fountain send forth at the same place... such as there is in the earth, or in rocks from which a fountain gushes."
2. "Fresh water and salt... Such things do not occur in the works of nature, and they should not be found in man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Palestine was the only country where an Eastern could have been familiar with the language of the Psalmist: 'He sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the mountains.'"
2. "The spring is the bright, open source, the eye of the landscape."
3. "The readers of the epistle would recall the bitter waters of Marah and the unwholesome spring at Jericho."

### John Calvin:
1. "A cursing tongue is something monstrous, contrary to all nature, and subverts the order everywhere established by God."
2. "God hath so arranged things which are contrary, that inanimate things ought to deter us from a chaotic mixture, sure as is found in a double tongue."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Doth a fountain send forth at the same place: literally, ‚Äòat the same hole or fissure‚Äô from the same spring."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fountain (Œ∑ œÄŒ∑Œ≥Œ∑). Old word for spring (John 4:14)."
2. "Send forth (Œ≤œÅœÖŒµ). Present active indicative of Œ≤œÅœÖœâ, old verb, to bubble up, to gush forth, here only in N.T. The use of ŒºŒ∑œÑ shows that a negative answer is expected in this rhetorical question."
3. "The sweet and the bitter (œÑŒø Œ≥ŒªœÖŒ∫œÖ Œ∫Œ± œÑŒø œÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒøŒΩ). Cognate accusatives with Œ≤œÅœÖŒµ. Separate articles to distinguish sharply the two things. The neuter singular articular adjective is a common way of presenting a quality."

### John Gill:
1. "Or hole; for at divers places, and at different times, as Pliny observes, it may send forth sweet [water] and bitter."
2. "There is a lake with the Trogloditae, a people in Ethiopia, which becomes thrice a day bitter, and then as often sweet; but then it does not yield sweet water and bitter at the same time."
3. "This simile is used to show how unnatural it is that blessing and cursing should proceed out of the same mouth."
