# James 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as a fig tree cannot bear olives, and a vine cannot produce figs, so too, the mouth cannot emit both cursing and blessing. The nature of the tree determines its fruit, just as the nature of the tongue determines the words it speaks. It is absurd to think that a spring can yield both salt water and fresh water, just as it is absurd to expect a person to both bless and curse with their tongue. Therefore, let us guard our words and ensure that they align with the goodness and blessing that we desire to impart to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No tree 'can' bring forth fruit inconsistent with its nature, as for example, the fig tree, olive berries: so if a man speaks bitterly, and afterwards speaks good words, the latter must be so only seemingly, and in hypocrisy, they cannot be real." (Commentary on James 3:12)
2. "The mouth that emits cursing cannot really emit also blessing." (Commentary on James 3:12)
3. "Neither can a salt (water spring) yield fresh." (Commentary on James 3:12)

1. "no tree can bring forth fruits inconsistent with its nature."
2. "we must not expect different fruits from the same tree figs and olives from the fig tree, or figs and grapes from the vine."
3. "That cursing and blessing should proceed from the same mouth is as great an incongruity as that salt and fresh water should flow from the same spring."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Can? (Î¼Î· Î´Ï…Î½Î±Ï„Î±Î¹;). Negative answer expected." 
2. "Fig-tree (ÏƒÏ…ÎºÎ·). Old and common word (Matthew 21:19)." 
3. "Salt water (Î±Î»Ï…ÎºÎ¿Î½). Old adjective from Î±Î»Ï‚ (Î±Î»Î±Ï‚ salt), here only in N.T."
