# James 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Kindly, generous emulation is not condemned, but that which is 'bitter.' To boast of your wisdom is virtually a lying against the truth, while your lives belie your glorying. The bad sense is defined and emphasized by the epithet bitter. By your conduct, do not belie the truth. Envy at the happiness of others is a root of bitterness in the heart. Strife in the mind, or an intention to strive and quarrel with others, is very sinful. For a man to assert himself to be a wise and knowing man, and yet cherishes bitterness, he lies against the truth.
