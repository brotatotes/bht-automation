# James 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wisdom being referenced here is a wisdom that does not come from above but is earthly, sensual, and devilish. It is not from God, the giver of all true wisdom, but from the devil himself. This wisdom is characterized by its earthly limitations and devil-like nature. It is not heavenly; it only pertains to the affairs of this world and lacks any connection to the unseen realm. It is a wisdom that is acquired through the strength of one's natural senses and is suitable only for earthly minds. Therefore, it cannot be considered true wisdom.
