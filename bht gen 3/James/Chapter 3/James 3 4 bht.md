# James 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as ships, though so great and driven by fierce winds, can be turned around by a very small rudder, our tongues, though small, have great power in determining the direction of our lives. The desire of the one steering the ship, or the governor, dictates the course it takes. Like ships, our lives can be influenced and directed by the decisions we make with our tongues. So, let us be mindful of the power of our words and use them wisely to navigate the storms of life.
