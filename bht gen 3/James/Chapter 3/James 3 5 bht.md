# James 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as a small fire can kindle a great forest, the tongue is a little member that boasts great things. It is a world of iniquity, defiling the whole body. Our words have immense power, able to set a neighborhood or village ablaze. Like a bit to a horse or a helm to a ship, ruling our tongues means governing our entire selves. Our speech is a potent instrument for both good and evil, holding great influence and impact.
