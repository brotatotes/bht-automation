# James 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tongue, though a small member, boasts great influence and has the power to bring about acts of mischief and complete wickedness. It may seem insignificant, but it can defile the whole body and set the entire creation on fire. We must not underestimate the power of small things, as even a little fire can kindle a great forest. The tongue, like a forest on fire, holds great importance despite its small size, as it has the ability to bring about both destruction and good.
