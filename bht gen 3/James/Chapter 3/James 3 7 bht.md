# James 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man, by his natural disposition and characteristic power, has the ability to tame and elevate even the nature of inferior animals. Just as man, with gentle firmness and skillful arts, is able to hold sway over the beasts that roam the fields and tread the mountains, so too can he subdue every kind of beast and bird. Through wit, industry, and various means, all kinds of beasts and birds are tamed by mankind. Therefore, if we desire to live properly, we must restrain our tongues, as no part of man does more harm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "even now man, by gentle firmness, may tame the inferior animal, and even elevate its nature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Small is the power which nature has given to man; but, by various acts of his superior understanding, he has subdued the tribes of the sea, the earth, and the air."
2. "A portion of the leathered race, as the hen, the goose, the duck, is thoroughly domesticated. The pigeon, the martin, the hawk, the eagle, may be; and perhaps there are none of that race which might not be made subject to the will of man."
3. "It may be affirmed with confidence that there is no animal which might not, by proper skill and perseverance, be rendered tame, or made obedient to the will of man."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "For he says that there is no animal so savage or fierce, which is not tamed by the skill of man, ‚Äî that fishes, which in a manner inhabit another world, ‚Äî that birds, which are so quick and roving ‚Äî and that serpents, which are so inimical to mankind, are sometimes tamed. Since then the tongue cannot be restrained, there must be some secret fire of hell hidden in it."
2. "He refers to present and to past time: the present regards power and capacity, and the past, usage or experience. He hence justly concludes that the tongue is full of deadly poison."
3. "Though all these things most suitably refer in the first place to the subject of this passage ‚Äî that they claim an unreasonable command over others, who labor under a worse vice; yet a universal doctrine may be understood as taught here, ‚Äî that if we desire to form our life aright, we must especially strive to restrain the tongue, for no part of man does more harm."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For every kind: literally, every nature or disposition."
2. "They may all be subdued."
3. "Of mankind: literally, 'by the nature of men,' answering to the nature of the inferior animals mentioned above; hence 'by human nature.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Kind (œÜœÖœÉŒπœÇ). Old word from œÜœÖœâ, order of nature [...] here of all animals and man, in 2 Peter 1:4 of God and redeemed men."
2. "Of beasts (Œ∏Œ∑œÅŒπœâŒΩ). Old word diminutive from Œ∏Œ∑œÅ and so 'little beasts' originally, then wild animals in general, or quadrupeds as here."
3. "Is tamed (Œ¥Œ±ŒºŒ±Œ∂ŒµœÑŒ±). Present passive indicative of Œ¥Œ±ŒºŒ±Œ∂œâ, old verb kin to Latin dominus and English tame, in N.T. only in this passage and Mark 5:4."

### John Gill:
1. "For every kind of beasts, and of birds....is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind, or 'by human nature'"
2. "by the wit and industry of man; by the various ways, means, and methods devised by man."

### John Wesley:
1. Every kind ‚Äî The expression perhaps is not to be taken strictly.
Reptiles ‚Äî That is, creeping things.
