# James 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man, through gentle firmness and his nature, has the ability to tame every kind of beast. Despite man's small inherent power, he has subdued the beasts by his superior understanding. Skill and perseverance can render any animal tame and obedient to man's will. Just as man has dominion over the beasts, it is crucial to restrain our tongues, for they possess the potential to inflict great harm. Tongues are likened to a hidden fire of hell that must be controlled in order to live a righteous life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "every nature" (that is, natural disposition and characteristic power).
2. "quadrupeds of every disposition; as distinguished from the three other classes of creation, 'birds, creeping things...and things in the sea.'"
3. "man, by gentle firmness, may tame the inferior animal, and even elevate its nature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Small is the power which nature has given to man; but, by various acts of his superior understanding, he has subdued the tribes of the sea, the earth, and the air."
2. "A portion of the leathered race, as the hen, the goose, the duck, is thoroughly domesticated. The pigeon, the martin, the hawk, the eagle, may be; and perhaps there are none of that race which might not be made subject to the will of man."
3. "It may be affirmed with confidence that there is no animal which might not, by proper skill and perseverance, be rendered tame, or made obedient to the will of man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Kind [φυσις] . Wrong. Jas. is not speaking of the relation between individual men and individual beasts, but of the relation between the nature of man and that of beasts, which may be different in different beasts." 
2. "Beasts [θηριων] . Quadrupeds. Not beasts generally, nor wild beasts only."
3. "Every nature of beasts is tamed by the nature of man."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he says that there is no animal so savage or fierce, which is not tamed by the skill of man, — that fishes, which in a manner inhabit another world, — that birds, which are so quick and roving — and that serpents, which are so inimical to mankind, are sometimes tamed." 
2. "Since then the tongue cannot be restrained, there must be some secret fire of hell hidden in it."
3. "Though all these things most suitably refer in the first place to the subject of this passage — that they claim an unreasonable command over others, who labor under a worse vice; yet a universal doctrine may be understood as taught here, — that if we desire to form our life aright, we must especially strive to restrain the tongue, for no part of man does more harm."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For every kind: literally, every nature or disposition."
2. "is tamed better, 'is subdued,' as we can hardly say that all the inferior animals are tamed, many of them being incapable of being so; but they may all be subdued."
3. "of mankind: literally, 'by the nature of men,' answering to the nature of the inferior animals mentioned above; hence 'by human nature.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Kind (φυσις). Old word from φυω, order of nature (Romans 1:26), here of all animals and man, in 2 Peter 1:4 of God and redeemed men."
2. "Of beasts (θηριων). Old word diminutive from θηρ and so 'little beasts' originally, then wild animals in general (Mark 1:13), or quadrupeds as here."
3. "Is tamed (δαμαζετα). Present passive indicative of δαμαζω, old verb kin to Latin dominus and English tame, in N.T. only in this passage and Mark 5:4. The present tense gives the general picture of the continuous process through the ages of man's lordship over the animals as stated in Genesis 1:28."

### John Gill:
1. "For every kind of beasts, and of birds.... is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind." 
2. "by the wit and industry of man; by the various ways, means, and methods devised by man."
3. "elephants, lions and tigers among beasts, and the eagle among birds, and crocodiles, asps, and other serpents, and fishes of the sea, have been tamed."

### John Wesley:
1. Every kind — The expression perhaps is not to be taken strictly.
Reptiles — That is, creeping things.
