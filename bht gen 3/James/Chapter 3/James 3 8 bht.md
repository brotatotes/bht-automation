# James 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tongue is an unruly mischief, full of death-bringing poison, that no one can tame. Bursting forth to assail and ruin others, it is restless and incapable of restraint.

Only with the help of the Holy Spirit and the grace of God can one begin to govern and lay an embargo on the tongue, for no man can do so by his own power alone.
