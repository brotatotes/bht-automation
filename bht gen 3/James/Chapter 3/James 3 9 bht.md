# James 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We should recognize and honor the divine nature within ourselves and others, as we are created in the image of God. Using our tongues to bless God is the highest use of speech. However, it is absurd to praise God while cursing those who bear His image. We must remember that by blessing others, we uphold the inherent dignity and nobility that comes from being made in the likeness of God.
