# James 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wars and fightings arise among people due to their selfish desires, pride, envy, and covetousness. These conflicts stem from the internal lusts that reside within individuals. Although the cause of quarrels may appear to be external circumstances, the true origin lies within one's own sinful pleasures and the desires for things they do not possess. This internal battle then manifests itself in conflicts between individuals, nations, and even within oneself. Such contentions arise from the evil passions and lustful desires that cannot be satisfied without causing harm to others. Therefore, to promote peace and unity, individuals must mortify these lusts and abstain from wrongdoing.

3. "Most of the wars which have occurred in the world can be traced to what the apostle here calls lusts. The desire of booty, the love of conquest, the ambition for extended rule, the gratification of revenge, these and similar causes have led to all the wars that have desolated the earth."

3. "And such has been the cause of all the wars which have devastated this earth; these spring from the evil passions of men. â€˜Nothing,â€™ observes Plato, â€˜but the body and its lusts and appetites kindle sedition, quarrels, and wars in this world.â€™"

### John Gill:
1. "From whence come wars and fightings among you?.... Which are to be understood, not of public and national wars, such as might be between the Jews and other nations at this time...nor do these design theological debates and disputes, or contentions about religious principles; but rather lawsuits, commenced before Heathen magistrates, by the rich, to the oppression of the poor;...or at least at the expense of their own peace, and that of others."
2. "nor were Christians in general as yet increased, and become such large bodies, or were whole nations become Christians, and much less at war one against another, which has been the case since; and which, when it is, generally speaking arises from a lust after an increase of power; from the pride and ambitious views of men, and their envy at the happiness of other princes and states."
3. "in the believer, or converted man, however, there is as it were two armies; a law in the members, warring against the law of the mind; the flesh against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and from this inward war arise external ones; or at least from the corruption of nature, which militates against all that is good."

### John Wesley:
1. "From whence come wars and fightings â€” Quarrels and wars among you, quite opposite to this peace? Is it not from your pleasures - Your desires of earthly pleasures."
2. "Which war â€” Against your souls."
3. "In your members â€” Here is the first seat of the war. Hence proceeds the war of man with man, king with king, nation with nation."
