# James 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who are we, mere mortals, to judge our neighbors when there is only one Lawgiver and Judge? In His sovereignty, God alone has the power to save and destroy. It is audacious and ignorant of us to assume the role of judge over others and strip God of His rightful authority. As fallible beings, we have no right to make laws or pass judgment, especially in matters of faith. Let us remember that God is the source of all authority and justice, and it is His prerogative to be the ultimate Lawgiver and Judge.
