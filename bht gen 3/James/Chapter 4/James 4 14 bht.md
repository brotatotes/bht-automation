# James 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What is your life? It is a fleeting vapor, appearing for a short time and then vanishing into thin air. We cannot predict the future or secure even a moment of continuance in this transient existence. Our audacious plans, built on the frail foundation of our uncertain and evanescent lives, are like smoke that dissipates without a trace. We must recognize the brevity of our days, checking our boldness and submitting to the reality that we do not hold our own destiny in our hands.

- Attempt 1 BHT: What nature is your life? How evanescent it is. Like a vapor, it appears for a little time, and then vanishes away. We have no power to determine what will happen in the future, yet we make plans as if we can. But our plans are built on a frail and uncertain foundation, for our lives are transitory and unpredictable. We are like a mere smoke, a vapor that rises from the ground at dawn and disappears before noon. We must remember the shortness of our lives and not extend our resolves too far, for we cannot secure even a moment of continuance in this world. Our audacity is easily checked when we realize that we do not have control over our own existence.
