# James 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Instead of arrogantly claiming control over our plans, we should humbly acknowledge that our lives and actions are dependent on the will of the Lord. We must recognize that success is not guaranteed by our own efforts, but by God's favor. Our plans should always be made with reference to His will, as there is nothing within our control that guarantees success without His guidance. Instead of boasting about our future actions, we should adopt the mindset of saying, If the Lord wills, and we shall live, we will do this.
