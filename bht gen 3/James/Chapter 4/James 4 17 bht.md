# James 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To know what is good and not do it is sin. It is not simply about neglecting one's duties, but actively choosing evil over good when the right path is clear. Having knowledge of what is right but not putting it into practice is a great and presumptuous sin. Feelings and knowledge are useless if not embodied in actions. This sin of omission is just as serious as committing an actual sin. Therefore, it is important to not only know what is right, but to actively do good deeds.
