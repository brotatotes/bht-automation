# James 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By loving the world, we break our marriage covenant with God and show hostility towards Him. We become adulterers and adulteresses, corrupted by the vanities of this world.

We cannot love and serve both God and mammon. Therefore, friendship with the world is enmity against God.
