# James 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The friendship of the world breeds envy, while the Spirit produces different fruit. Envy arises from our unfulfilled desires, leading us to fight with one another. The scriptural declarations are not made in vain; they serve a purpose of teaching and edifying us. The Spirit of God does not encourage worldly affections but enriches us with new gifts. The Spirit of love within believers is opposed to envy and unloving tempers. Therefore, we should focus on the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, and peace, instead of being consumed by worldly desires and envy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No word of Scripture can be so."
2. "The friendship of the world tends to breed envy; the Spirit produces very different fruit."
3. "Ye lust, and because ye have not what ye lust after, ye envy your neighbor who has, and so the spirit of envy leads you on to 'fight.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The difficulty in the case arises from the fact that no such passage as the one here quoted is found in so many words in the Old Testament, nor any of which it can fairly be regarded as a quotation." 
2. "The abundant facts which existed showing its development and operation in contentions, and wars, and a worldly spirit, proved that it was deeply embedded in the human soul."
3. "We are pained that others are more prosperous than we are; we desire to possess what others have, though we have no right to it; and this leads to the various guilty methods which are pursued to lessen their enjoyment of it, or to obtain it ourselves, or to show that they do not possess as much as they are commonly supposed to."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Do ye think [Œ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒµŒπœÑŒµ] . See on ch. James 1:26. 
The scripture [Œ∑ Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ∑] . See on Mark 12:10. Properly, a passage of scripture. 
In vain [Œ∫ŒµŒΩœâœÇ] . Only here in New Testament.


### John Calvin:
1. "The Spirit of God proves himself to be bountiful by the affluence of his blessings. There is then nothing more repugnant to his nature than envy."
2. "James denies that the Spirit of God rules where depraved lusts prevail, which excite to mutual contention; because it is peculiarly the office of the Spirit to enrich men more and more continually with new gifts."
3. "The humble are those who are made so by grace; but God promises to give them more grace, to perfect that which had begun."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do you think that the scriptural declarations are made in vain?" 
2. "The Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy." 
3. "Does the Spirit that dwells in us lust to envy? Does He encourage such worldly affections? Are the fruits of the Spirit envy, and strife, and worldliness, and not rather love, joy, peace?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In vain (Œ∫ŒµŒΩœâœÇ). Old adverb (Aristotle) from Œ∫ŒµŒΩœâœÇ (James 2:20), here alone in N.T. 'Emptily,' not meaning what it says."
2. "Made to dwell (Œ∫Œ±œÑœâŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉŒµŒΩ). First aorist active of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒøŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ∂œâ, old verb, to give a dwelling to, only here in N.T."
3. "But even so, with God presented as a jealous lover, does œÑŒø œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ± refer to the Holy Spirit as the subject of ŒµœÄŒπœÄŒøŒ∏Œµ or to man's spirit as the object of ŒµœÄŒπœÄŒøŒ∏Œµ? Probably the former and ŒµœÄŒπœÄŒøŒ∏Œµ then means to yearn after in the good sense as in Philippians 1:8."

### John Gill:
1. "Whatever is written there is to answer some end, as for learning, edification, and comfort, for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness." 
2. "The depraved spirit of man, ...instigates to envy the happiness of others."
3. "The Holy Spirit... is so far from envying, or putting others upon envying any benefit enjoyed by men, that he increases them, adds to them, and enlarges them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The spirit of love that dwelleth in all believers lusteth against envy."
2. "The spirit of love is directly opposite to all those unloving tempers which necessarily flow from the friendship of the world."
3. "The scripture saith in vain ‚Äî Without good ground."
