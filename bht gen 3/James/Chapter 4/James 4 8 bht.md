## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Draw nigh to Godâ€”So 'cleave unto Him,' Deuteronomy 30:20, namely, by prayerfully... 'resisting Satan'... who would oppose our access to God." 
2. "Cleanse... handsâ€”the outward instruments of action. None but the clean-handed can ascend into the hill of the Lord... 'purify... hearts'... the inward source of all impurity."
3. "Double-mindedâ€”divided between God and the world. The 'double-minded' is at fault in heart; the sinner in his hands likewise."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If we wish the favor of God, we must come to him; nor can we hope for his mercy, unless we approach him and ask him for it."
2. "To obtain the favor of God, it is necessary to put away our sins; to approach him with a desire to be pure and holy."
3. "If the heart is wrong, nothing can be right. If, while we seek an external reformation, we still give indulgence to the secret corruptions of the heart, it is clear that we can have no true religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Purify. One of the three instances in the New Testament in which the word is not used of ceremonial purification."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Draw nigh to God: not to be limited to prayer, but to be understood of our intercourse with God generally."
2. "Cleanse your hands, ye sinners...The hands are specially mentioned as being the instruments of wickedness."
3. "Ye double-minded: having, as it were, two souls the one professing to be attached to God, and the other really attached to the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Draw nigh to God... as the priests in the sanctuary drew nigh to God, as we should now."
2. "Cleanse your hands... if we always had clean (from sin) hands and hearts?"
3. "Ye sinners... a reproach meant to startle and sting."

### John Gill:
1. "They draw nigh to him when they come to the throne of his grace, for grace and mercy to help them; when they draw near to him in prayer with true hearts, and lift them up with their hands to God; when in the exercise of faith and hope they enter within the vail, and come up even to his seat..." 
2. "...he draws nigh to them by granting them his gracious presence, by communicating his love to them, by applying the blessings of his grace, by helping them in times of need and distress, and by protecting them from their enemies..."
3. "Cleansing of their hands and hearts denotes the purity of outward conversation, and of the inward affections; and supposes impurity both of flesh and spirit, that the body and all its members, the soul and all its powers and faculties, are unclean; and yet not that men have a power to cleanse themselves..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then draw nigh to God in prayer, and he will draw nigh unto you." 
2. "Cleanse your hands - Cease from doing evil." 
3. "And purify your hearts â€” From all spiritual adultery. Be no more double minded, vainly endeavoring to serve both God and mammon."
