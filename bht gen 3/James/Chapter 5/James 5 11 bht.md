# James 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We count them happy who endure trials, just as Job did. We shouldn't only focus on Job's sufferings, but also consider the end and the mercy that the Lord showed him. The Lord is very compassionate and full of tender mercy, showing His pity by not overwhelming the patient endurer with more than they can bear, and His mercy by bringing a happy conclusion to their trials. So let us take encouragement from Job's example and have faith that God will also show us mercy and bring us through our own sufferings to a blessed end.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Behold, we count them happy which endure - The word rendered 'we count them happy' (μακαρίζομεν makarizomen,) occurs only here and in Luke 1:48, where it is rendered 'shall call me blessed.' The word μακάριος makarios (blessed, or happy,) however, occurs often."
2. "Ye have heard of the patience of Job - As one of the most illustrious instances of patient sufferers. See Job 1:21."

1. "The end of the Lord [το τελος κυριου] . A peculiar expression. The happy conclusion to which God brought Job's trials."
2. "Very pitiful and of tender mercy [πολυσπλαγχνος και οικτιρμων] . The former adjective only here in New Testament; the latter here and Luke 6:36."
3. "The distinction between this and oijktirmwn, merciful, seems to be that the former denotes the general quality of compassion, while the latter emphasizes the sympathy called out by special cases, being the feeling which is moved to pain at another's suffering."

1. "Whosoever, then, will imitate his patience, will no doubt find God’s hand, which at length delivered him, to be the same."

3. "Hope directs us only to the end; God will then shew himself very merciful, however rigid and severe he may seem to be while afflicting us."

3. "that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy; as to Job, so to all his people; his paternal relation to them engages his pity towards them; nor does he willingly afflict them; and when he does, he sympathizes with them; he is afflicted with them, and in his pity redeems them; his heart moves towards them, and he earnestly remembers them, and works deliverance for them in his own time and way; and therefore it becomes them to be patient."

### John Wesley:
1. "We count them happy that endured — That suffered patiently. The more they once suffered, the greater is their present happiness."
2. "Ye have seen the end of the Lord — The end which the Lord gave him."
