# James 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone is sick among the congregation, they should call for the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. This act is not a mere human medium of cure, but holds a sacramental character. The prayers of the elders, performed in the name of the Lord, are powerful and effective, and are comparable to the entire church offering prayers for the sick. Anointing with oil, a curative agent and symbol of divine grace, is a fitting sign when performing miraculous cures.
