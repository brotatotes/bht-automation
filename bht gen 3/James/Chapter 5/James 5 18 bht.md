# James 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power of prayer is evident in the connection between the prayer and its accomplishment. In the case of Elijah, he prayed for rain, and after three and a half years of drought, heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth fruit. This example shows that though not explicitly mentioned, the power of prayer is a matter of inference. Through this miracle, it is reasonable to believe that God will answer our prayers and bestow the blessings we need.
