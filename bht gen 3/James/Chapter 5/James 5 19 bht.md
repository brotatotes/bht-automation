If any among you is led astray from the truth, it is essential to understand that the one who can convert them has the opportunity to save a soul from death. This salvation, however, is not immediate, but rather the ultimate outcome of reclaiming a sinner who has erred from the truth. The convert plays a crucial role in reintroducing the one who has strayed to the state of forgiveness and redemption. As believers, we should watch over one another, praying and striving to bring back those who have fallen into error or sinful practices.
