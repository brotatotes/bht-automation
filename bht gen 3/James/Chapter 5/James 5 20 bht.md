3. "He effects this by making the convert partaker in the Christian covenant for the remission of all sins."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "It is not easy to determine which is the true sense. Expositors have been about equally divided respecting the meaning."
3. "When we come to die, as we shall soon, it will give us more pleasure to be able to recollect that we have been the means of saying one soul from death, than to have enjoyed all the pleasures which sense can furnish, or to have gained all the honor and wealth which the world can give."

### John Calvin:
