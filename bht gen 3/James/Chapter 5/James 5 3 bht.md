# James 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rust and canker that eat away at gold and silver without care for precision are reminders of the consuming effects of wealth left unused and unshared. As you hoard treasures for the future, the rust becomes a witness against you, gnawing at your conscience. These treasures are not true riches, but a gathering of wrath, awaiting destruction. This rust will consume you like fire, tormenting your mind and conscience indefinitely. Just as silver tarnishes and gold corrodes, so too will your flesh be consumed, reminding you of the consequences of hoarding wealth instead of using it for good.
