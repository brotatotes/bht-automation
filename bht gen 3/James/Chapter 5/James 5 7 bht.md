# James 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be patient therefore, as the husbandman patiently waits for the precious fruit of the earth, enduring through hope and longing over his precious crop. The early and latter rains, necessary preliminaries for the farmer, are not the object of his hope; instead, it is the harvest for which those rains are the necessary preliminary. The farmer steadily sows his crops, gradually, without becoming impatient, eagerly anticipating the growth and maturation. From October to March, without prolonged fair weather, the farmer waits, trusting in the unfolding of God's will.
