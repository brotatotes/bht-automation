# James 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stop groaning against one another and lift up your heads. It happens that those who bear injuries from enemies with equanimity, cannot easily bear offenses from their brethren. Grumbling and murmuring is virtually judging, making us liable to be judged. The Judge stands before the doors, ready for judgment. Let no one ask for vengeance, lest it be brought on their own heads. The near approach of the great Judge should suspend our judgments and avoid murmuring and petulance in suffering.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For it happens that those who bear often with equanimity the greatest contumelies and injuries from enemies and wicked men, yet cannot easily bear much less offenses when given by their brethren."
2. "Murmur not, brethren, against one another, that ye be not judged..."
3. "Behold, the Judge standeth before the door..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Murmur not"; "grumble not." The Greek is literally, "groan": a half-suppressed murmur of impatience and harsh judgment, not uttered aloud or freely. 
2. To "murmur against one another" is virtually to judge, and so to become liable to be judged. 
3. The phrase means "near at hand" (Genesis 4:7), which in the oldest interpretations [Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem] is explained, "thy sin is reserved unto the judgment of the world to come."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The exact idea here is, not that of grudging in the sense of dissatisfaction with what others possess, or of being envious; it is that of being fretful and impatient - or, to use a common word which more exactly expresses the sense that of grumbling."
2. "There are some persons who are always grumbling. They have a sour, dissatisfied, discontented temper; they see no excellence in other persons; they are displeased that others are more prospered, honored, and beloved than they are themselves; they are always complaining of what others do, not because they are injured, but because others seem to them to be weak and foolish."
3. "Behold, the judge standeth before the door - The Lord Jesus, who is soon to come to judge the world. See James 5:8. He is, as it were, even now approaching the door - so near that he can hear all that you say."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Grudge not [ŒºŒ∑ œÉœÑŒµŒΩŒ±Œ∂ŒµœÑŒµ] . Better, as Rev., murmur not. The verb means to sigh or groan. 
Standeth before the doors. In the act of entering.


### John Calvin:
1. "Be not querulous one against another; lest ye be condemned."
2. "He means an accusing groan, when one expostulates with the Lord against another."
3. "Let no one, then, ask for vengeance on others, except he wishes to bring it on his own head."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It requires great grace to avoid all murmuring and petulance in suffering; especially it is a difficult attainment calmly to endure great pain; but God giveth more grace."
2. "Their murmuring against their brethren led them to find fault with them, and thus to accuse them falsely; and this exposed them to the righteous judgment of God, who is the Avenger of all those who are wrongly condemned."
3. "The near approach of the great unerring Judge should cause us to suspend our judgments. This phrase is evidently equivalent to 'The coming of the Lord draweth nigh,' and therefore by the Judge we are to understand Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stop groaning against one another ... lift up your heads." 
2. "Negative purpose clause with ŒπŒΩŒ± ŒºŒ∑ and the first aorist passive subjunctive of Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩœâ." 
3. "Jesus the Judge is pictured as ready to enter for the judgment."

### John Gill:
1. "Grudge not one against another, brethren,.... On account of any happiness, temporal or spiritual, which another enjoys; do not inwardly repine at it; or secretly sigh and groan in an envious manner at it."
2. "Lest ye be condemned; hereafter, at the bar of Christ, by the Judge of the whole earth, who is privy to the secret murmurings and grumblings, and the envious sighs and groans of men."
3. "Behold the judge standeth before the door; there is another that judgeth, who is the Lord, and he is at hand; he is just at the door; a little while and he will come, and not tarry; which may refer not to Christ's coming to destroy Jerusalem, but to his second coming to judgment, which will be quickly."

### John Wesley:
1. Murmur not one against another ‚Äî Have patience also with each other.
The judge standeth before the door ‚Äî Hearing every word, marking every thought.
