## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The enquiry concerning that meaning must therefore be conducted on historical, not on mere grammatical grounds."
2. "The usual Scripture meaning of Logos is speech, or word."
3. "Had St. John intended to say, ‚ÄòGod was the Word,‚Äô‚Äîwhat meaning could his assertion possibly have conveyed? None other than a contradiction to his last assertion, by which he had distinguished God from the Word."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the beginning‚Äîof all time and created existence, for this Word gave it being (John 1:3; John 1:10); therefore, 'before the world was' (John 17:5; John 17:24); or, from all eternity." 
2. "He who is to God what man's word is to himself, the manifestation or expression of himself to those without him." 
3. "Each of these brief but pregnant statements is the complement of the other, correcting any misapprehensions which the others might occasion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In both places it clearly means before creation, before the world was made, when as yet there was nothing."
2. "Whatever is meant by the term 'Word,' it is clear that it had an existence before 'creation.' It is not, then, a 'creature' or created being, and must be, therefore, uncreated and eternal."
3. "There is no more unequivocal declaration in the Bible than this, and there could be no stronger proof that the sacred writer meant to affirm that the Son of God was equal with the Father."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the beginning was [ŒµŒΩ Œ±œÅœáŒ∑ Œ∑ŒΩ]. The Logos was not merely existent, however, in the beginning, but was also the efficient principle, the beginning of the beginning. The ajrch (beginning), in itself and in its operation dark, chaotic, was, in its idea and its principle, comprised in one single luminous word, which was the Logos."
2. "The Word [Œø ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ] : Logos. This expression is the keynote and theme of the entire gospel."

1. "In the beginning was the Speech...to inform us that he is the eternal God."
2. "He is the lively image of His purpose...to say that He reveals himself to us by his Speech."
3. "The Speech was with God...to refute the error of Sabellius; for it shows that the Son is distinct from the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the beginning was the Word. This sublime opening of the Gospel carries our thoughts at once to the no less sublime opening of the Book of Genesis, whose first words the Evangelist certainly had present to his mind."
2. "There is One by whom the Eternal and Invisible God reveals Himself: the Revealer is a Person: the Revealer is Himself God."
3. "The Word is possessed of divine essence; in that being in which He ‚Äòwas,‚Äô He so possesses the divine attributes that He is God. There is difference of personality, but unity of nature."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either God exists and is the Creator of the universe as scientists like Eddington and Jeans assume or matter is eternal or it has come out of nothing."
2. "The term ŒõŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ is applied to Christ only in John 1:1; John 1:14; Revelation 19:13; 1 John 1:1 'concerning the Word of life' (an incidental argument for identity of authorship)."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the beginning ‚Äî When all things began to be made by the Word: in the beginning of heaven and earth, and this whole frame of created beings, the Word existed, without any beginning."
2. "And the Word was with God - Therefore distinct from God the Father. The word rendered with, denotes a perpetual tendency as it were of the Son to the Father, in unity of essence."
