## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The world is the created world, into which He came (ver. 9), which was made by Him (ver. 3), which nevertheless knew, recognized Him not."
2. "He was in the world (and therefore the world should have known Him), and the world was made by Him (much more then should it have known Him), and the world knew Him not."
3. "The three members of the sentence form a climax."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Observe its compact simplicity, its sonorousness..." (Commentary)
2. "The most vivid commentary on this entire verse will be got by tracing (in His matchless history) Him of whom it speaks walking amidst all the elements of nature, the diseases of men and death itself, the secrets of the human heart..." (Commentary)
3. "And this is He of whom it is added, 'the world knew Him not!'" (Commentary)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was in the world - This refers, probably, not to his pre-existence, but to the fact that he became incarnate; that he dwelt among human beings."
2. "And the world was made by him - This is a repetition of what is said in John 1:3. Not only 'men,' but all material things, were made by him."
3. "The world knew him not - The word 'knew' is sometimes used in the sense of 'approving' or 'loving'. The world did not love or approve him, but rejected him and put him to death."

### John Calvin:
1. "He accuses men of ingratitude, because of their own accord, as it were, they were so blinded, that the cause of the light which they enjoyed was unknown to them." 
2. "What can be more unreasonable than to draw water from a running stream, and never to think of the fountain from which that stream flows?"
3. "The whole may be summed up by saying, that never was Christ in such a manner absent from the world, but that men, aroused by his rays, ought to have raised their eyes towards him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, and the world knew him not."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Imperfect tense of continuous existence in the universe before the Incarnation as in verses John 1:1; John 1:2."
2. ""Through him." Same statement here of "the world" (Î¿ ÎºÎ¿ÏƒÎ¼Î¿Ï‚) as that made in verse John 1:3 of Ï€Î±Î½Ï„Î±."
3. "Not only did the world fail to know the Pre-incarnate Logos, but it failed to recognize him when he became Incarnate (John 1:26)."

### John Gill:
1. "He was in the world, when first made, and since, by his essence, by which he fills the whole world; and by his power, upholding and preserving it; and by his providence, ordering and managing all the affairs of it, and influencing and governing all things in it." 
2. "He was frequently visible in the world, in a human form, before his incarnation, as in Eden's garden to our first parents, to Abraham, Jacob, Manoah, and his wife, and others."
3. "The inhabitants of the world knew him not as their Creator: nor did they acknowledge the mercies they received from him; nor did they worship, serve, and obey him, or love and fear him."

### John Wesley:
1. He was in the world â€” Even from the creation.
