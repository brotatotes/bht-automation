# John 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, the Creator, entered the world He made, yet the world did not recognize Him. The language used here is astonishingly compact and sonorous, with the repetition of the world in each clause, leaving the reader to ponder the mystery of Christ's own creation not acknowledging Him. The commentators emphasize the ingratitude and blindness of humanity, who failed to recognize Jesus as their Creator and the source of their blessings. Despite being the light and life of the world, Jesus went unrecognized by the very ones He came to save.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The world is the created world, into which He came (ver. 9), which was made by Him (ver. 3), which nevertheless (i e. as here represented by man, the only creature who 'knows') knew, recognized Him not."
2. "He was in the world (and therefore the world should have known Him), and the world was made by Him (much more then should it have known Him), and the world knew Him not."
3. "The three members of the sentence form a climax;â€”He was in the world (and therefore the world should have known Him), and the world was made by Him (much more then should it have known Him), and the world knew Him not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The language here is nearly as wonderful as the thought. Observe its compact simplicity, its sonorousnessâ€”"the world" resounding in each of its three membersâ€”and the enigmatic form in which it is couched, startling the reader and setting his ingenuity a-working to solve the stupendous enigma of Christ ignored in His own world."
2. "By His Incarnation, He became an inhabitant of it, and bound up with it. Yet it 'was made by Him' (John 1:3-5)."
3. "Taking the first two clauses as one statement, we try to apprehend it by thinking of the infant Christ conceived in the womb and born in the arms of His own creature, and of the Man Christ Jesus breathing His own air, treading His own ground, supported by substances to which He Himself gave being, and the Creator of the very men whom He came to save."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was in the world...dwelt among human beings."
2. "Not only 'men,' but all material things, were made by him."
3. "The world did not love or approve him, but rejected him and put him to death."

### John Calvin:
1. "He accuses men of ingratitude, because of their own accord, as it were, they were so blinded, that the cause of the light which they enjoyed was unknown to them."
2. "What can be more unreasonable than to draw water from a running stream, and never to think of the fountain from which that stream flows?"
3. "The whole may be summed up by saying, that never was Christ in such a manner absent from the world, but that men, aroused by his rays, ought to have raised their eyes towards him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The world knew him not."
2. "The thought of the Person the world, though brought into being through Him, recognised not His presence."
3. "Alike before His manifestation in the flesh and after it, the Word was â€˜in the world.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was in the world... continuous existence in the universe before the Incarnation." 
2. "Knew him not... failed to recognize him, his world that he had created."
3. "It failed to recognize him when he became Incarnate."

### John Gill:
1. "He was in the world as the light and life of it, giving natural life and light to creatures in it, and filling it, and them, with various blessings of goodness."
2. "The inhabitants of the world knew him not as their Creator: nor did they acknowledge the mercies they received from him; nor did they worship, serve, and obey him, or love and fear him."
3. "There was, at first, a general knowledge of Christ throughout the world among all the sons of Adam, after the first promise of him, and which, for a while, continued; but this, in process of time, being neglected and slighted, it was forgot, and utterly lost, as to the greater part of mankind."

### John Wesley:
1. He was in the world â€” Even from the creation.
