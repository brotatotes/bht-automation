# John 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He came to His own people, the Jews, but they did not receive Him. The term His own things refers to JudÃ¦a as His possession and the Jews as His chosen people. It is a tragic display of their wickedness and blind faithlessness that they rejected Him, nationally and as God's witnesses. Israel, like the disobedient husbandmen, slew the Heir and rejected the Son of God who came to them as their rightful inheritance. Their rejection of Him illustrates the desperate and sinful state of humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His own things here cannot well mean the world, or his own people mankind in general: it would be difficult to point out any Scripture usage to justify such a meaning."
2. "But abundance of passages bear out the meaning which makes the former His own inheritance or possession, i.e. JudÃ¦a; and the latter, the Jews."
3. "And thus came forms a nearer step in the approach to the declaration in ver. 14. He came to His own."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His own (people)"; for now the word is masculine. It means the Jews, as the 'peculiar people.'"
2. "Both they and their land, with all that this included, were 'HIS OWN,' not so much as part of 'the world which was made by Him,' but as 'THE HEIR' of the inheritance."
3. "received him notâ€”nationally, as God's chosen witnesses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He came unto his own land, and his own people received him not." 
2. "They were his people, because God had chosen them to be his above all other nations; had given to them his laws; and had signally protected and favored them."
3. "They rejected him and put him to death, agreeably to the prophecy, Isaiah 53:3-4."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here is displayed the absolutely desperate wickedness and malice of men; here is displayed their execrable impiety."
2. "The Son of God had solicited an abode for himself in one nation; when he appeared there, he was rejected; and this shows clearly the awfully wicked blindness of men."
3. "Christ therefore was first offered to them as his own household, and as belonging to his empire by a peculiar right."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He came unto his own home, and his own accepted him not."
2. "Instead of 'He was in,' we find 'He came unto;' for 'the world,' we have â€˜His own home;' for 'knew,' we have 'accepted.' Every change seems to point to a more intimate relationship, a clearer manifestation, and a rejection that is still more without excuse."
3. "In the whole history of Israel had been illustrated unfaithfulness to the truth; and the tender pathos of this verse recalls the words in which Jesus speaks of the rejection of Himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unto his own things," the very idiom used in John 19:27 when the Beloved Disciple took the mother of Jesus "to his own home."
2. "Jesus later said that a prophet is not without honour save in his own country."
3. "Israel slew the Heir (Hebrews 1:2) when he came, like the wicked husbandmen (Luke 20:14)."

### John Gill:
1. "His coming to them is to be understood not of his incarnation; though when he came in the flesh, as he came of them, so he came to them, particularly being sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and was rejected by them as the Messiah; yet his incarnation is afterwards spoken of in John 1:14 as a new and distinct thing from this; and to understand it of some coming of his before his incarnation, best suits with the context, and the design of the evangelist."
2. "They did not believe in him, nor obey his voice; they rebelled against him, and tempted him often... and they shall wander among the people."
3. "When the word of God comes, who is his messenger, we shall honor him...because he will heal them, and deliver them from their destructions; and because of these signs we shall believe him, and honor him."

### John Wesley:
1. He came â€” In the fulness of time, to his own - Country, city, temple: And his own - People, received him not.
