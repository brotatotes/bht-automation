# John 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As many individuals, who were previously disobedient and gainsaying, were given the power and authority to become children of God by accepting and receiving Jesus. By receiving Him, believers experience a union with Him and receive the privilege of becoming sons of God. This privilege of adoption surpasses all other blessings, such as justification and the remission of sins. Through faith, believers are regenerated and become children of God, and the Spirit of God is sent into their hearts, verifying their new identity.

### Philip Schaff:

3. "This is a privilege that excels all others, even justification and remission of sins; and is an everlasting one."
