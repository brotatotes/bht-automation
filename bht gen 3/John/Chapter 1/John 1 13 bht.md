# John 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who become children of God by faith have an exclusive divine birth, separate from any claim of superior human descent or human generation. This divine birth is not a mere title or privilege, but a nature that awakens within the soul the vital capacities, perceptions, and emotions of a child of God. The new birth is the beginning of spiritual life, and no human effort can bring about this transformation. It is solely the work of God, who begets believers and grants them the right to become children of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "St. John here negatives any such claim, and asserts the exclusive divine birth of all who become children of God by faith."
2. "It is to be noticed that the conjunctions here are not merely disjunctive ones, which would necessitate the ranging the clauses as co-ordinate and parallel, but exclusive ones, which rise in climax from one clause to another."
3. "Not of blood, nor yet of the will of the flesh, nor yet of the will of man, but of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Which were born‚Äîa sonship therefore not of mere title and privilege, but of nature, the soul being made conscious of the vital capacities, perceptions, and emotions of a child of God, before unknown."
2. "not of blood, &c.‚Äînot of superior human descent, not of human generation at all, not of man in any manner of way. By this elaborate threefold denial of the human source of this sonship, immense force is given to what follows,"
3. "but of God‚ÄîRight royal gift, and He who confers must be absolutely divine. For who would not worship Him who can bring him into the family, and evoke within him the very life, of the sons of God?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The term 'to be born' is often used to denote this change. [...] The natural birth introduces us to life. The new birth is the beginning of spiritual life." 
2. "None of the ways by which we become entitled to the privileges of 'children' among people can give us a title to be called the sons of God."
3. "This work is the work of God, and 'no man' can do it for us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These believers have received the right to become 'children of God' by virtue of a true spiritual filiation, being begotten of God."
2. "The contrast to such a sonship is the very claim which is so strongly made by the Jews in chap. 8, and the validity of which our Lord altogether denies."
3. "By others besides Jews like presumptuous claims have been made, others have rested in the 'divinity' of their race."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By spiritual generation (of God, ŒµŒ∫ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ), not by physical (ŒµŒæ Œ±ŒπŒºŒ±œÑœâŒΩ, plural as common in classics and O.T., though why it is not clear unless blood of both father and mother; ŒµŒ∫ Œ∏ŒµŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒøœÇ, from sexual desire; ŒµŒ∫ Œ∏ŒµŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ, from the will of the male)." 
2. "But b of the old Latin reads qui natus est and makes it refer to Christ and so expressly teach the Virgin Birth of Jesus."
3. "The Virgin Birth is doubtless implied in verse John 1:14, but it is not stated in verse John 1:13."

### John Gill:
1. "All that they can do is to pray for them, give advice, and bring them under the means of grace; but all is ineffectual without a divine energy."
2. "Regeneration is ascribed to another will and power, even to the will and power of God."
3. "None are born again of any such will: but of God."

### John Wesley:

2. "Not by descent from Abraham, nor by the will of the flesh."
3. "But of God - By his Spirit."
