### John Calvin:
1. "He intended to show to what a mean and despicable condition the Son of God, on our account, descended from the height of his heavenly glory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He who was in the beginning, who was with God, who was God, â€˜became flesh;â€™ did not merely take to Him a human body, did not merely become an individual man, but assumed human nature in its entireness... identified Himself with the race, entered into such a condition that He could have perfect communion and fellowship with us, and we with Him." 
2. "The Word remains, with all His essential properties; there is added a new mode of being, the assumption of a new nature, denoted by â€˜flesh.â€™" 
3. "The glory of the Incarnate Word there are two elements, as His one Person unites two natures: in part the glory is unique (in kind and not only in degree), belonging to the God-man and not to the perfect Man; in part it is communicable to men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "John clearly means to say that 'the manifested glory of the Word was as it were the glory of the Eternal Father shared with His only Son'" (Bernard).

### John Gill:
1. "and "flesh" here signifies, not a part of the body, nor the whole body only, but the whole human nature, consisting of a true body, and a reasonable soul; and is so called, to denote the frailty of it, being encompassed with infirmities, though not sinful"
2. "The human nature of Christ was of God's pitching, and not man's; and though it looked mean without, the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in it, as well as a fulness of grace and truth"
3. "he dwelt among men, and appeared to have a fulness of each of these: for this clause is not to be joined with the glory of the only begotten, as if this was a branch of that; but regards him as incarnate, and in his office, as Mediator; who, as such, was full of "grace"; the Spirit, and the gifts of the Spirit; of all the blessings of grace, of justifying, pardoning, adopting, sanctifying, and persevering grace; of all the promises of grace; of all light, life, strength, comfort, peace, and joy: and also of truth, of all Gospel truths"

### John Wesley:
1. "Flesh sometimes signifies corrupt nature; sometimes the body; sometimes, as here, the whole man."

3. "He [Jesus] was himself most benevolent and upright; made those ample discoveries of pardon to sinners, which the Mosaic dispensation could not do: and really exhibited the most substantial blessings, whereas that was but a shadow of good things to come."
