## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The testimony of John, so important as being the fulfilment of the very object for which he was sent from God, is in this prologue ranged, so to speak, parallel with the assertions and testimony of the Evangelist himself."
2. "This was he of whom I spake, &c. This view seems to be borne out. by his own statement, ver. 33, and by the order of the narrative in Matt. iii. 11, 12, 13."
3. "The question raised by some, whether it is probable that the Baptist had, or expressed such views of the pre-existence of Christ, is not one for us to deal with, in the face of so direct a testimony as is given to the fact, here and in ch. iii, 27 ff."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "My Successor is my Superior, for He was my Predecessor."
2. "This enigmatic play upon the different senses of the words 'before' and 'after' was doubtless employed by the Baptist to arrest attention, and rivet the thought."
3. "The Evangelist introduces it just to clinch his own statements."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that cometh after me - He of whom I am the forerunner, or whose way I am come to prepare. See the notes at Matthew 3:3." 
2. "Is preferred before me - Is superior to me... He was worthy of more honor than I am."
3. "He was before me - This can refer to nothing but his pre-existence, and can be explained only on the supposition that he existed before John, or, as the evangelist had before shown, from the beginning."

### John Calvin:
1. "By using the verb testifieth (ŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒµ·øñ) in the present tense, he denotes a continued act, and certainly this doctrine must be continually in force, as if the voice of John were continually resounding in the ears of men."
2. "The first sentence is intended to convey the statement, that he was sent for the sake of Christ, and therefore that it would have been unreasonable that he should be exalted, while Christ was lying low."
3. "Thus, all who are superior to others, either in the gifts of God or in any degree of honor, must remain in their own rank, so as to be placed below Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The loud cry of the faithful witness has come down through all the years; we seem to hear its echoes still."
2. "Jesus came 'after' or 'behind' John, as coming later in His manifestation to the world."
3. "The herald came first, to prepare the way for the King; when the King arrives, the herald retires from view."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Historical examples of John's witness to Christ."
2. "A parenthesis of most of verse John 1:14."
3. "Œ†œÅœâœÑŒøœÇ ŒºŒøœÖ (superlative with ablative) occurs here when only two are compared as is common in the vernacular Koine."

### John Gill:
1. "it was such a cry as debased the creature, and exalted Christ."
2. "he that cometh after me; for Christ came into the world after John"
3. "which cannot be meant of honour and dignity; for this is expressed before; and it would be proving one thing by the same: nor of his birth, as man; for John in that sense was before him, being born before him; besides, being born before another, is no proof of superior worth; others were born before John, whom he yet excelled: but of his eternal existence, as the word, and Son of God, who was before John, or any of the prophets; before Abraham, and Noah, and Adam, or any creature whatever"

### John Wesley:
1. "John had said this before our Lord's baptism, although he then knew him not in person: he knew him first at his baptism, and afterward cried, 'This is he of whom I said.'" 
2. "He is preferred before me ‚Äî in his office: for he was before me - in his nature."
