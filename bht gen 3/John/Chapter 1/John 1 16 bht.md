2. "These are undoubtedly not the words of John the Baptist, but of the evangelist John, the writer of this gospel."
3. "In all these places our Saviour is represented as the fulness of God - as 'abounding' in mercy, as exhibiting the divine attributes, and as possessing in himself all that is necessary to fill his people with truth, and grace, and love."

### John Calvin:
1. "He declares in general, that out of Christ we ought not to seek any thing good, though this sentence consists of several clauses."
2. "We shall find angels and men to be dry, heaven to be empty, the earth to be unproductive, and, in short, all things to be of no value, if we wish to be partakers of the gifts of God in any other way than through Christ."
3. "For my own part, I agree with the opinion of those who say that we are watered with the graces which were poured out on Christ; for what we receive from Christ he does not bestow upon us as being God, but the Father communicated to him what would flow to us as through a channel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of his fulness (ŒµŒ∫ œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒªŒ∑œÅœâŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ). The only instance of œÄŒªŒ∑œÅœâŒºŒ± in John's writings, though five times of Christ in Paul's Epistles... and so used here by John of the Incarnate Logos."
2. "We all (Œ∑ŒºŒµŒπœÇ œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ). John is facing the same Gnostic depreciation of Christ of which Paul writes in Colossians. So here John appeals to all his own contemporaries as participants with him in the fulness of the Logos."
3. "Grace for grace (œáŒ±œÅŒπŒΩ Œ±ŒΩœÑ œáŒ±œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ). The point is in Œ±ŒΩœÑ, a preposition disappearing in the Koine and here only in John... Here the picture is 'grace' taking the place of 'grace' like the manna fresh each morning, new grace for the new day and the new service."

### John Gill:
1. "and 'of it', the evangelist says, 'have all we received'; not all mankind, though they all receive natural light and life from him; nor merely all the prophets of the Old Testament, though they had their gifts and grace from him, who then was, as now, the head of the church; nor only all the apostles of Christ, though these may be principally intended; but all believers, who, though they have not all the same measure of grace, nor the same gifts, yet all have received something."
2. "Faith is the hand which receives Christ, and grace from him; and the act of receiving, being expressed in the past tense, seems to regard first conversion, when faith is first wrought, and along with it abundance of grace is received; for a believer has nothing but what is given him, and what he has, is in a way of receiving; so that there is no room for boasting, but great reason for thankfulness, and much encouragement to apply to Christ for more grace, which is the thing received."
3. "the saints receive grace from the fulness of Christ, according, or answerable to the grace that is in him; or according to the measure of the gift of Christ, and in proportion to the place, station, and office they bear in the church. Some think the phrase only designs the freeness of grace, and the free and liberal manner in which it is distributed, and received; along with which, I also think, the abundance of it, at first conversion, with all after supplies, is intended; and that grace for grace, is the same with grace upon grace, heaps of grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is indeed preferred before thee: so we have experienced."
2. "We all - That believe: have received - All that we enjoy out of his fulness."
3. "Grace upon grace - One blessing upon another, immeasurable grace and love."
