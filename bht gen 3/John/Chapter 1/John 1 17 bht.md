# John 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law was given, but the fullness of grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. The law serves as a finite enactment, highlighting the consciousness of sin and the need for redemption, but it is merely a shadow of the reality found in Christ. Contrary to the law, the Gospel communicates actual power and blessings from above. Grace and truth, embodied in Jesus, declare God's love and favor, providing salvation through His free grace. While the law was given by Moses, the grace of Christ brings lasting grace and truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We received from His fulness continual additions of grace, because that fulness is not, like the law, a positive enactment, finite and circumscribed, of which it could be said that it was given, but the bringing in of grace and truth, which came (came in, came to pass) by Jesus Christ."
2. "The fulness of Christ is set against the narrowness of positive enactment in the law."
3. "No philosopher places his words so accurately, and observes their minute differences, as John, especially in this chapter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Law elicits the consciousness of sin and the need of redemption it only typifies the reality."
2. "The Gospel, on the contrary, actually communicates reality and power from above."
3. "Hence Paul terms the Old Testament 'shadow,' while he calls the New Testament 'substance'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The law was given [...] The gospel succeeded that and took its place, and thus showed the greatness of the gospel economy, as well as its grace and truth."
2. "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ [...] A system of religion full of favors, and the 'true' system, was revealed by him."
3. "We may learn from these verses: That all our mercies come from Jesus Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "It would otherwise have been a great hindrance, that they expected to receive from the Law what we can only obtain through Christ."
2. "The Evangelist means, that in the Law there was nothing more than a shadowy image of spiritual blessings, but that they are actually found in Christ; whence it follows, that if you separate the Law from Christ, there remains nothing in it but empty figures."
3. "The Evangelist maintains that nothing permanently valuable is found in it until we come to Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now, however, there has â€˜comeâ€™ a fulness of grace and truth, within which we stand, and which we are to appropriate more and more, vast, illimitable, as is that God who is love."
2. "The Name which embraces historical Christianity in its whole extent as the religion both of Jew and Gentile, the religion of man."
3. "'was given' of what was incidental in origin and temporary induration; 'came' of what, though revealed in time, was an eternal reality."

### John Gill:
1. "The moral law was given to Adam, in innocence, which having been broken, and almost lost out of the minds, and memories of men, was given by Moses, in a new edition of it in writing."
2. "The ceremonial law pointed out the pollution of human nature, the guilt and punishment of sin; was a type and shadow of deliverance by Christ, but could not give the grace it shadowed, and therefore is opposed both to grace and truth."
3. "By grace and truth, is meant the Gospel, in opposition to the law; which is called grace, because it is a declaration of the love, and grace, of God to men; it ascribes salvation, in all the parts of it, to the free grace and favour of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law, saith he, was given by Moses: grace was by Jesus Christ."
2. "The law of Moses was not his own. The grace of Christ was."
3. "His grace was opposite to the wrath, his truth to the shadowy ceremonies of the law."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The fullness of grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, contrasting the narrowness and temporary nature of the law. The law served as a mere enactment, finite and circumscribed, highlighting the consciousness of sin and the need for redemption, but not actually offering reality. In contrast, the Gospel communicates true power from above, bringing about Christianity itself. By separating the Law from Christ, one is left with empty figures instead of the actual blessings found in Him. The law, with its shadowy ceremonies, cannot offer the grace and truth that are found in the Gospel. Grace and truth, embodied in Jesus Christ, are the declaration of God's love and favor to humanity, ascribing salvation to His free grace. In essence, the law was given by Moses, but the grace of Christ was what truly brought grace and truth to mankind.
