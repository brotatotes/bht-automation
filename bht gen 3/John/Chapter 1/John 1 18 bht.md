## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "there is but One who can declare God, the only-begotten Son, who is no mere man, but abides in the bosom of the Father."
2. "The expression signifies, as Chrysostom observes, Kindred and oneness of essence:â€”and is derived from the fond and intimate union of children and parents."
3. "The present, which is, as in ch. iti. 18, is used to signify essential truth, without any particular regard to time."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No one has seen God by immediate gaze, or direct intuition."
2. "A remarkable expression, used only here, presupposing the Son's conscious existence distinct from the Father."
3. "'He and He only hath declared Him,' because He only can."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus had a knowledge of God which might be expressed to our apprehension by saying that he saw him."
2. "He knew him intimately and completely, and was therefore fitted to make a fuller manifestation of him."
3. "Jesus had a knowledge of God such as one friend has of another - knowledge of his character, designs, and nature which no other one possesses."

### John Calvin:
1. "No remark appears to be more common than this, that each of us receives, according to the measure of his faith, what God offers to us; but there are few who think that we must bring the vessel of faith and of the knowledge of God with which we draw." 
2. "In like manner, the Evangelist describes, in this passage, something new and uncommon, when he says that the only-begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, has made known to us what was formerly concealed."
3. "When he says that the Son was in the bosom of the Father, the metaphor is borrowed from men, who are said to receive into their bosom those to whom they communicate all their secrets."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No one hath seen God at any time... The words describe God in His nature as God; He dwelleth in light that is inaccessible. The soul longs to see Him, but this cannot be. Is then its longing vain, its cry unheard? The Evangelist answers, No. One has â€˜declaredâ€™ Him, has, as the Word, unfolded and explained Him."
2. "He is â€˜only begotten,â€™ Son among all other sons in His own peculiar sense, who is fully able to represent the Father, to whom all the perfections of the Father flow."
3. "He of whom the Evangelist speaks is more than â€˜only begotten,â€™ more than â€˜God.â€™ He is â€˜in the bosom of the Father.â€™ In Him God is revealed as a Father; without Him He can be revealed only as God. The words thus include more than â€˜with Godâ€™ in John 1:1, more than the Divine self communion, the communion of God with God. The fatherly element, the element of love, is here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God no one has ever seen."
2. "The Logos is plainly called Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï‚ in verse John 1:1. The Incarnation is stated in verse John 1:14, where he is also termed Î¼Î¿Î½Î¿Î³ÎµÎ½Î·Ï‚. He was that before the Incarnation. So he is 'God only begotten,' 'the Eternal Generation of the Son' of Origen's phrase."
3. "The mystic sense here is that the Son is qualified to reveal the Father as Logos (both the Father in Idea and Expression) by reason of the continual fellowship with the Father."

### John Gill:
1. "God is seen in the works of creation and providence, in the promises, and in his ordinances; but above all, in Christ the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person." 
2. "He has made, and delivered a fuller revelation of these things, than ever was yet; and to which no other revelation in the present state of things will be added."
3. "He is come, and has declared him."

### John Wesley:
1. "No man hath seen God â€” With bodily eyes: yet believers see him with the eye of faith."
2. "Who is in the bosom of the Father â€” The expression denotes the highest unity, and the most intimate knowledge."
