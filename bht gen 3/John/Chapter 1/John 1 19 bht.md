## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "It is an interesting enquiry, what this usage denotes as to the author or date of our Gospel."
3. "The question is asked with reference to the popular doubts respecting him; in an unbelieving and inquisitorial spirit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 19. recordâ€”testimony.

	heads of the nation, the members of the Sanhedrim. In this
	peculiar sense our Evangelist seems always to use the term.


### Albert Barnes:

2. "John's fame was great... the nation seemed to suppose, from the character of his preaching, that he was the Messiah."
3. "It is not improbable that they wished that he might be the long-expected Christ, and were prepared to regard him as such."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says, therefore, that John openly confessed for what purpose he was sent by God."
2. "At first, therefore, they did not act from malice, but, on the contrary, actuated by the desire of redemption, they wish to know if John be the Christ."
3. "It is evident, therefore, that a report about John was widely spread and aroused the minds of all; and this was arranged by the wonderful Providence of God, that this testimony might be more strikingly complete."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And of this kind confirmatory of the preceding statements is the witness."
2. "The leaders and representatives of the nation in this rejection of Jesus are those whom John usually designates as â€˜the Jews.â€™"
3. "The question, â€˜Who art thou?â€™ has reference to the supposed personal claims of the Baptist."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Just as the author assumes the birth narratives of Matthew and Luke, so he assumes the Synoptic accounts of the baptism of Jesus by John, but adds various details of great interest and value between the baptism and the Galilean ministry." 
2. "John, writing in Ephesus near the close of the first century long after the destruction of Jerusalem, constantly uses the phrase 'the Jews' as descriptive of the people as distinct from the Gentile world and from the followers of Christ."
3. "The committee from the Sanhedrin put the question sharply up to John to define his claims concerning the Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "A message from so august an assembly, at so great a distance, and by the hands of persons of such character and figure, was doing John a great deal of honour, and serves to make his testimony of Christ the more public and remarkable."
2. "It also shows what a noise John's ministry and baptism made among the Jews, that it even reached Jerusalem, and the great council of the nation."
3. "The question they put by their messengers might not be, as some have thought, to ensnare John, nor out of disrespect to Jesus, who, as yet, was not made manifest; but might be in good earnest, having, from many circumstances, reason to think there might be something in the people's opinion of him."

### John Wesley:
1. The Jews â€” Probably the great council sent.
