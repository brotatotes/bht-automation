## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All things...This parallelism of itself refutes the Socinian interpretation of 'all things,' 'all Christian graces and virtues, ‚Äòthe whole moral world.‚Äô But the history of the term 'Logos' forbids such an explanation entirely."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 2. The same, &amp;c.‚ÄîSee what
	property of the Word the stress is laid upon‚ÄîHis eternal
