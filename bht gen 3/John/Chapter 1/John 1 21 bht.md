## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole appearance of John remindes them of Elias... his announcement that the Kingdom of God was at hand, naturally led them to the prophecy Mal. iv. 5." 
2. "The right explanation of this answer seems to be the usual one,â€”that the deputation asked the question in a mistaken and superstitions sense, meaning Elias bodily come down from heaven, who was expected to forerun and anoint the Messias."
3. "From the prophecy of Moses, Deut. xviii. 15, 18, the Jews expected some particular prophet to arise, distinct from the Messiah... whose coming was, like that of Elias, intimately connected with that of the Messiah Himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Eliasâ€”in His own proper person." 
2. "That prophetâ€”announced in Deuteronomy 18:15, &c., about whom they seem not to have been agreed whether he were the same with the Messiah or no."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this sense John denied that he was Elijah; but he did not deny that he was the Elias or Elijah which the prophet intended."
2. "he so clearly stated to them his true character that they might understand that he was really the one predicted as Elijah."
3. "It is possible that the Jews supposed that not only 'Elijah' would reappear before the coming of the Messiah, but also 'Jeremiah'."

### John Calvin:
1. "But the question is founded on a false opinion which they had long held; for, holding the opinion that the soul of a man departs out of one body into another, when the Prophet Malachi announced that Elijah would be sent, they imagined that the same Elijah, who lived under the reign of king Ahab, (1 Kings 17:1,) was to come."
2. "Rather do they by this term point out the office of John, and ask if God had appointed him to be a prophet. When he replies, I am not, he does not for the sake of modesty tell a lie, but honestly and sincerely detaches himself from the company of the prophets."
3. "The distinction lies in this, that the voice crying, that a way may be prepared for the Lord, is not a prophet, but merely a subordinate minister, so to speak; and his doctrine is only a sort of preparation for listening to another Teacher."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The answer seems less natural, for our Lord, when He spoke of the Baptist, described him as â€˜Elijah which was for to comeâ€™ (Matthew 11:14)."
2. "It is possible that even the Baptist himself did not Know that he was â€˜Elijahâ€™ in this latter sense, and hence could reply without hesitation that he is not that prophet."
3. "But the main point with the Baptist is to show that, strictly speaking, he is simply the herald of that era. He is only to prepare the way for Him in whom it both begins and is completed (comp. Matthew 11:11-13)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Why then does John here flatly deny it? Because the expectation was that Elijah would return in person. This John denies. Jesus only asserts that John was Elijah in spirit." 
2. "Even the Baptist later became puzzled in prison whether Jesus himself was the true Messiah or just one of the forerunners." 
3. "Short and blunt denial."

### John Gill:
1. "...he was not Elijah the prophet that lived in Ahab's time, and was called the Tishbite; for John's answer is to the intention of their question, and their own meaning in it..." (source)
2. "...he does not say that John should come in the body, but in the power and spirit of Elias..." (source)
3. "he was not like one of the prophets of the Old Testament; he was a prophet, and more than a prophet, as Christ says, Matthew 11:9 yet not such a prophet as they were..." (source)

### John Wesley:
1. Art thou Elijah? â€” He was not that Elijah (the Tishbite) of whom they spoke.
Art thou the prophet â€” Of whom Moses speaks, Deuteronomy 18:15.
