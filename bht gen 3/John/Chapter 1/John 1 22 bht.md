# John 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He is no one‚Äîa voice merely, whose testimony to Christ is everything. The question, Who art thou? is asked to the formalist ever in the church, who cares only about the external appearance of someone who appears. The Baptist, having disowned the suppositions made about him, is now urged to state who he truly is. They desire a positive account of his identity, so that their labor in seeking him might not be in vain and that they can represent him accurately to those who sent them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is no one‚Äîa voice merely: it is the work of God, the testimony to Christ, which is everything."
2. "So the formalist ever in the church asks concerning anyone who appears, Who is he?"
3. "The witness for Christ only exalts, only cares for Christ's work."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Baptist has disowned the three suppositions that have been made."
2. "He is not ‚Äòthe Christ,‚Äô not ‚ÄòElijah,‚Äô not ‚Äòthe prophet.‚Äô"
3. "The deputation now appeal directly to himself to state who he is."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Who art thou? (Œ§ŒπœÇ ŒµŒπ;). Same question as at first (verse John 1:19), but briefer."
2. "That we give answer (ŒπŒΩŒ± Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπŒΩ Œ¥œâŒºŒµŒΩ). Final use of ŒπŒΩŒ± with second aorist active subjunctive of Œ¥ŒπŒ¥œâŒº with Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπŒΩ from Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒ±, above, old substantive as in Luke 2:47."
3. "What sayest thou of thyself? (Œ§ ŒªŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπœÇ œÄŒµœÅ œÉŒµŒ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ;). This time they opened wide the door without giving any hint at all."

### John Gill:
1. "Since, as yet, he had only answered in negatives, who he was not, that he was not the Christ, nor Elias, nor that prophet; they desire he would give them a positive account who he was." 
2. "That their labour might not be in vain; that they might not come so far for nothing, without knowing who he was."
3. "That from his own mouth, and not from the opinion and conjectures of others, they might represent him in a true light to those who had deputed them on this errand."
