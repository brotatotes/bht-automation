# John 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews questioned John's right to baptize, not understanding that he was the forerunner of the Messiah and that baptism symbolized cleansing. Their confusion stemmed from their failure to interpret John's claim as significant enough to warrant the ordinance of baptism, and their limited understanding of the purpose of baptism itself. They were hesitant to embrace a change in their customs and did not grasp the authority and role that John held in preparing the way for the coming of the Messiah.
