# John 1:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John was baptizing in Bethany beyond Jordan, a place distinguished from the Bethany of Lazarus. The reading Bethabara instead of Bethany is not supported by the best and most ancient manuscripts. John's choice of this location was strategic; it was one of the passages where the Israelites crossed over into Galilee, allowing him to preach to a large number of people. The continued veneration of this place by believers shows its significance, as they desire to be baptized in the same vital stream even today.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a Bethany about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, but there is said also to have been another in the tribe of Reuben, on the east side of the river Jordan, and in this place, probably, John was baptizing."
2. "The word 'Bethabara' means 'house or place of a ford.' The reading 'Bethabara,' instead of 'Bethany,' seems to have arisen from the conjecture of Origen, who found in his day no such place as 'Bethany,' but saw a town called 'Bethabara,' where John was said to have baptized, and therefore took the liberty of changing the former reading."
3. "Beyond Jordan - On the east side of the Jordan River."

2. "There were many who flocked to John‚Äôs baptism, and this was his ordinary place for baptizing."
3. "The situation of Bethabara, as laid down by those who have described the country, agrees best with the words of the Evangelist."

2. "Not 'in Bethabara' as Origen suggested instead of 'in Bethany' of all the known Greek manuscripts under the mistaken notion that the only Bethany was that near Jerusalem."
3. "Was baptizing (Œ∑ŒΩ Œ≤Œ±œÄœÑŒπŒ∂œâŒΩ). Periphrastic imperfect, common idiom in John."

### John Gill:
1. "Bethabara signifies 'the house of passage', and is thought to be the place where the Israelites passed over Jordan, to go into the land of Canaan... which is, as it were, the passage, or entrance, into the Gospel church state."
2. "It might be at one of these passages, by which they went over into Galilee, that John pitched upon to continue preaching and baptizing at; partly because of the number of people that went over, to whom he had the opportunity of preaching; and partly, for the sake of baptizing those who became proper subjects of that ordinance through his ministry."
3. "Here, says Jerom, 'to this day many of the brethren, that is, of the number of believers, desiring there to be born again, are baptized in the vital stream;' such veneration had they for the place where John first baptized."

### John Wesley:
