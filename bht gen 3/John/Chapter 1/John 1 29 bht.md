## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The question to be answered is, In calling Jesus by so definite a name as the Lamb of God, to what did John refer? And this question is intimately connected with that of the meaning of the following words, which taketh away the sin of the world."
2. "The common sense account of this part of the matter is:‚ÄîJohn wished to point out Jesus as the Messiah: he designates Him as the lamb of God; he therefore referred to some definite lamb,‚Äîrevealed by God, sent by God, pleasing to God, or in some meaning especially, of God."
3. "The whole of that latter section of Isaiah, as before remarked on ver. 23, is Messianic, and was so understood by the Jews...So that here, and here only, we have the connexion of which we are in search,‚Äîbetween the lamb, and the bearing or taking away of sin,‚Äîexpressly stated, so that it could be formally referred to in a testimony like the present."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the Lamb of God‚Äîthe one God-ordained, God-gifted sacrificial offering." 
2. "Applied to sin, it means to be chargeable with the guilt of it and to bear it away." 
3. "Wherever there shall live a sinner throughout the wide world, sinking under that burden too heavy for him to bear, he shall find in this 'Lamb of God,' a shoulder equal to the weight."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A 'lamb,' among the Jews, was killed and eaten at the Passover... The Messiah was predicted as a lamb led to the slaughter, to show his patience in his sufferings, and readiness to die for man."
2. "Jesus was called 'the Lamb'... he was a sacrifice for sin... he was what was represented by the Passover, turning away the anger of God, and saving sinners by his blood from vengeance and eternal death."
3. "He takes away sin by 'bearing' in his own body the sufferings which God appointed to show his sense of the evil of sin, thus magnifying the law, and rendering it consistent for him to pardon."

### John Calvin:
1. "The principal office of Christ is briefly but clearly stated; that he takes away the sins of the world by the sacrifice of his death, and reconciles men to God."
2. "He [John the Baptist] corrects this fault in passing, by reminding them of the object to which all the sacrifices were directed. [Christ] is the Lamb of God; by which he means that all the sacrifices...had no power whatever to atone for sins, but that they were only figures, the truth of which was manifested in Christ himself."
3. "Nor do I dislike the remark of Chrysostom, that the verb in the present tense ‚Äî ·ΩÅ Œ±·º¥œÅœâŒΩ, who taketh away, denotes a continued act; for the satisfaction which Christ once made is always in full vigor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then He stood unknown, unrecognised, amidst the throng; now He is expressly pointed out by His forerunner."

3. "It is the world‚Äôs Passover, both the sacrifice and the feast, that John sees to be at hand."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Behold the Lamb of God (ŒπŒ¥Œµ Œø Œ±ŒºŒΩŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ). Exclamation ŒπŒ¥Œµ like ŒπŒ¥ŒøœÖ, not verb, and so nominative Œ±ŒºŒΩŒøœÇ." 
2. "But was it not possible for John, the Forerunner of the Messiah, to have a prophetic insight concerning the Messiah as the Paschal Lamb, already in John 1:53, even if the rabbis did not see it there?"
3. "He is the Lamb of God for the world, not just for Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." 
2. "This must be a great relief to minds afflicted with the continual ebullitions of sin, which is taken away by the Lamb of God, as fast as it rises." 
3. "For taking it upon himself, he bore it in his own body on the tree, and carried it away, as the scape goat did under the law; and so likewise a taking it quite away: Christ has removed it as far as the east is from the west, out of sight, so as never to be seen any more."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold the Lamb ‚Äî Innocent; to be offered up; prophesied of by Isaiah, Isaiah 53:7, typified by the paschal lamb, and by the daily sacrifice..."
