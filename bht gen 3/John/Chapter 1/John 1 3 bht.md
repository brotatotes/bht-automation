# John 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All things, absolutely everything, without Him was not any thing, came into being through the Word. This is a denial of the eternity and non-creation of matter, which was held by the whole thinking world outside of Judaism and Christianity. The main conception of creation in St. John's writings is expressed by the first notice which he makes of it: All things came into being through the Word. Creation, as a becoming, answers to the Incarnation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "madeâ€”brought into being." 
3. "This is a denial of the eternity and non-creation of matter, which was held by the whole thinking world outside of Judaism and Christianity."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The 'Word,' or the Son of God, is therefore appropriately called 'God.'"
3. "All things were made by Christ...there was not a single thing, however minute or unimportant, which was not made by him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The main conception of creation which is present in the writings of St. John is expressed by the first notice which he makes of it: All things came into being through the Word."
2. "The use of the term ejgeneto, came into being, as distinguished from ejktisqh, were created, suggests the thought that creation is to be regarded (according to our apprehension) as a manifestation of a divine law of love."
3. "Thus creation (all things came into being through Him) answers to the Incarnation (the Word became flesh). All the unfolding and infolding of finite being to the last issue lies in the fulfillment of His will who is love."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having affirmed that the Speech is God, and having asserted his eternal essence, he now proves his Divinity from his works."
2. "And this is the practical knowledge, to which we ought to be chiefly accustomed; for the mere name of God attributed to Christ will affect us little, if our faith do not feel it to be such by experience."
3. "There are some, indeed, even among philosophers, who make God to be the Master-builder of the world in such a manner as to ascribe to him intelligence in framing this work. So far they are in the right, for they agree with Scripture; but as they immediately fly off into frivolous speculations, there is no reason why we should eagerly desire to have their testimonies."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Logos is John's explanation of the creation of the universe."
2. "Creation is thus presented as a becoming (Î³Î¹Î½Î¿Î¼Î±) in contrast with being (ÎµÎ¹Î¼)."
3. "John adds the negative statement for completion, another note of his style as in John 1:20; 1 John 1:5."

### John Gill:
1. "Which is to be understood, not of the new creation; for this would be a restraining 'all' things to a 'few' persons only; nor is it any where said, that all things are new made, but made."
2. "Regeneration is denied to be of man, and is always ascribed to God; nor would Christ's being the author of the new creation, be any contradiction to his being the author of the old creation, which is intended here."
3. "And without him was not any thing made that was made: in which may be observed the conjunct operation of the word, or Son, with the Father, and Spirit, in creation; and the extent of his concern in it to every thing that is made."

### John Wesley:
