## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The occurrence related by John happened at the baptism of Jesus, which is therefore here pre-supposed as known, Although this has been questioned, I cannot see how it can be reasonably doubted. We cannot surely suppose that such a sign was twice shewn." 
2. "The account here given confirms the view which I have there maintained, that the appearance was confined to our Lord and the Baptist: he was to receive the sign, and then to testify to the others, who were not themselves yet the bearers, but the recipients of testimony."
3. "It was seen, in a kind of spiritual vision, by John alone."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Bare record - Gave testimony.
I saw the Spirit ... - See the notes at Matthew 3:16-17.


### John Calvin:
1. "But as the dove was a certain and infallible sign of the presence of the Spirit, it is called the Spirit, by a figure of speech in which one name is substituted for another."
2. "A question now arises, why didthe Spirit at that time appear in the form of a dove? We must always hold that there is a correspondence between the sign and the reality."
3. "For we know that he remained in concealment, during thirty years, like a private individual, because the time for his manifestation was not yet come; but when he intended to make himself known to the world, he began with his baptism."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I have beheld the Spirit descending. The effect of what the Baptist had seen had remained, and still remains, with him in all its power: 'I have beheld.'"
2. "And it abode upon him. John had not merely seen the Spirit descend with dove-like motion upon Jesus; he had also seen that it 'abode' upon Him, the symbol of an abiding and permanent possession."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Another specimen of John's witness to the Messiah."
2. "The realization of the promise of the sign (verse John 1:33) by which he should recognize the Messiah."
3. "This sight of the Spirit descending as a dove upon Jesus at his baptism became permanent proof to him."

### John Gill:
1. "I saw the Spirit... descending from heaven like a dove." 
2. "It abode upon him... John had a full sight of it."
3. "Bearing a certain and distinct testimony to it."
