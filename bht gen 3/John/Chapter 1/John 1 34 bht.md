## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The perfect tense in this verse is stronger than the present,‚ÄîI have seen (on the perf. see above ver. 32) and have borne witness‚Äîit is a reference to his testimony at the time, as a thing on record in their memories, and as still continuing."
2. "The Personal Word, Who became flesh in our Lord, and was subjected to all the laws of human development in infancy, childhood, youth,‚Äîevermore in an especial degree under the leading of the Holy Spirit, by whose agency the Incarnation had taken place,‚Äîwas the Recipient of this fulness of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost."
3. "The abiding of the Spirit without measure on Him indicated beyond doubt that He was the Word become flesh‚Äîfor no mere human intelligence could be thus receptive of the Holy Spirit of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means that what he declares is not doubtful." 
2. "God was pleased to make him fully and thoroughly acquainted." 
3. "He testified that Christ wasthe Son of God, because he who gives the Holy Spirit must be the Christ." 

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The link of connection between the transcendent conclusion of the Baptist and the fact upon which it rests is probably to be found in the thought that He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit, who therefore has the power to impart the gifts and influence of the Spirit of God, must be Divine." 
2. "It has been sometimes maintained that ‚ÄòSon of God‚Äô must be understood as a mere designation of ‚Äòthe Messiah.‚Äô For this opinion we believe that no evidence can be found, either in Scripture or in early Jewish writings."
3. "The omissions are very remarkable. We say nothing of the Evangelist‚Äôs silence as to the circumstances of our Lord‚Äôs birth and early years; this belongs to the general plan of the Gospel, which here agrees with that of Mark."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I have seen (ŒµœâœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±). Present perfect active of ŒøœÅŒ±œâ."
2. "This is the Son of God (Œø œÖŒπŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ). The Baptist saw the Spirit come on Jesus at his baptism and undoubtedly heard the Father's voice hail him as 'My Beloved Son'."
3. "The phrase means more than just Messiah and expresses the peculiar relation of the Son to the Father like that of the Logos with God in John 1:1."

### John Gill:
1. "And I saw... The Spirit descending from heaven as a dove..."
2. "...and remaining some time on him..."
3. "...that this is the Son of God..."

### John Wesley:

And testified ‚Äî From that time.
