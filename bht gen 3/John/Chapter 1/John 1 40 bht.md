## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Considering (1) that the Evangelist never names himself in his Gospel."
2. "And such has been the general opinion."
3. "We are justified in inferring that it was the Evangelist himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His great sensitiveness is touchingly shown in his representation of this first contact with the Lord; the circumstances are present to him in the minutest details; he still remembers the Very hour." 
2. "He reports no particulars of those discourses of the Lord by which he was bound to Him for the whole of His life; he allows everything personal to retire."
3. "Peter's brother‚Äîand the elder of the two."

### John Calvin:
1. "The circumstance of Andrew immediately bringing his brother expresses the nature of faith, which does not conceal or quench the light, but rather spreads it in every direction."
2. "Woe to our indolence, therefore, if we do not, after having been fully enlightened, endeavor to make others partakers of the same grace."
3. "We ought also to observe the purpose of God, which determined that Peter, who was to be far more eminent, was brought to the knowledge of Christ by the agency and ministry of Andrew; that none of us, however excellent, may refuse to be taught by an inferior."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Andrew belonged to Bethsaida (John 1:44), and is again referred to in John 6:8, John 12:22. That he is now spoken of as the brother of Peter is an interesting indication of the importance attached by the Evangelist to the latter."
2. "Simon Peter, who has not yet been mentioned, is introduced to us here as if he were well known to the reader - an illustration of the writer's tendency to anticipate what is hereafter to be fully explained."
3. "We have an equally striking instance in the mention of Mary in chap. John 11:2."

2. "The more formal call of Andrew and Simon, James and John, comes later." 
3. "That heard John speak (œÑœâŒΩ Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÖœÉŒ±ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒ± ŒôœâŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖ). 'That heard from John,' a classical idiom."

### John Gill:
1. "One of the two which heard John [speak],... and followed him." 
2. "Andrew, Simon Peter's brother."
