Jesus had previously spent time in Judea after His baptism, making this subsequent call at the Sea of Galilee. The following day, Jesus finds Philip and directly challenges him, saying Follow me. The immediacy of Philip's response to the power of God's word reflects the effectiveness of the Gospel.
