# John 1:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nathanael, meaning the gift of God, is mentioned only in two places, possibly the same person as Bartholomew. Jesus being the eternal Word who became flesh suggests a supernatural conception. Philip unites himself with believers by using the same phrase about Jesus. Describing Jesus as the son of Joseph from Nazareth reflects common perception. This confession acknowledges Jesus as the fulfillment of the law and the prophets. Despite humble beginnings, we should recognize divine glory in the early Church, as teaching's purpose is to lead others to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nathanael (meaning, 'the gift of God,' corresponding to Theodore or Theodosius in Greek) is mentioned only in these two places." 
2. "It has been supposed that Nathanael and Bartholomew were the same person (see note on Matt. x. 3). This is however mere conjecture."
3. "By combining the two declarations of John, that in Jesus the Eternal Word of God became flesh (ver. 14), and that ‚Äòthat which is born of the flesh is flesh‚Äô (ch. iii. 6), we cannot escape the inference, that a supernatural working of God in the conception of the Ban Christ Jesus is implied."

3. "We see, then, that the chief design of doctrine is, that those who hear us should come to Christ in some way or other."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
2. "He does not speak of Jesus simply as the Messiah, but as the fulfillment of the law and the prophets."
