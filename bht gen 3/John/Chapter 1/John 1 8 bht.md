- Attempt 1 BHT: John the Baptist was a beacon of light, shining brightly in his testimony, yet he humbly clarified that he was not the Light himself. He served as a contrast, setting the stage for the true Light that was to come. His light, though significant, paled in comparison to the glory of the Dayspring from on high.

John's role was to herald the impending arrival of the Messiah, a role he fulfilled with great insight and joy, even though his own light would diminish before the brilliance of the coming Light.
