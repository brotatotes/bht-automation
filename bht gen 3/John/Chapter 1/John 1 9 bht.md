## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word true in this connexion imports original, â€˜archetypal,â€™ and is used of the true genuine sources and patterns of those things which we find here below only in fragmentary imitations and derivations."
2. "The former construction can only be defended by a Rabbinical usage, by which 'all that cometh into the world' means â€˜all men.â€™ But it is very questionable whether St. John ever speaks thus."
3. "We are driven then to the only legitimate rendering, which is to take was coming as equivalent to an imperfect, came:â€”this usage being frequent in the N.T.:â€”i.e. at the time when John bore this witness, the true light which lighteth every man, cameâ€”was in process of manifesting Himself,â€”into the world."

### John Calvin:

2. "He might have reasoned more ingeniously, that Christ, as the eternal light, has a splendor which is natural, and not brought from any other quarter; but instead of doing so, he sends us back to the experience which we all possess."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The true light (Ï„Î¿ Ï†Ï‰Ï‚ Ï„Î¿ Î±Î»Î·Î¸Î¹Î½Î¿Î½). 'The light the genuine,' not a false light of wreckers of ships, but the dependable light that guides to the harbor of safety."
2. "This true light had been on hand all the time in the darkness (Î·Î½ imperfect, linear action) before John came."
3. "But it may only mean that all the real light that men receive comes from Christ, not necessarily that each one receives a special revelation."

2. "And this light, if man did not hinder, would shine more and more to the perfect day."
3. "Shine more and more to the perfect day."
