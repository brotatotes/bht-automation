# John 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The false shepherds, like hirelings who serve merely for gain, lack the emotional connection and ownership that true shepherds have towards the sheep. Instead of prioritizing the well-being of the flock, they prioritize their own safety, abandoning the sheep to the ravages of wild beasts. In contrast, faithful under-shepherds share in the concern of their Master and are willing to defend the flock, even at the expense of their own lives. All pastors have the duty to protect the doctrine they proclaim, even in the face of persecution.

I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Here are three quotes from the original commentary:
1. "The hireling and not being a shepherd" - The commentary emphasizes the distinction between a hireling and a true shepherd. 
2. "The mere 'hireling' does not feel so" - This quote illustrates the lack of emotional connection and ownership that a hireling has towards the sheep. 
3. "The cowardly hireling cares naught for the sheep, but only for his own skin" - This quote portrays the hireling as someone who prioritizes their own safety over the well-being of the sheep.

### John Gill:
1. "But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd... who seek only their gain, from their quarter, and mind their own things, and not the things of Jesus Christ." 
2. "Such an one 'seeth the wolf coming'; by whom may be meant, either Satan... or any false prophet, or teacher, who are ravenous wolves."
3. "And fleeht; not being willing to bear any reproach or persecution, for the sake of Christ."


### John Wesley:
1. "He is a hireling, who would not work, were it not for the hire; to whom this is the great (if not only) motive of working."
2. "If a man who works only for hire is such a wretch, a mere thief and a robber, what is he who continually takes the hire, and yet does not work at all?"
3. "He seizeth some, and scattereth the rest; the two ways of hurting the flock of Christ."
