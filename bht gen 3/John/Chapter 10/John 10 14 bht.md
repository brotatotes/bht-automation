# John 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as the Good Shepherd, possesses an intimate, all-encompassing knowledge of his sheep. This knowledge is not superficial but corresponds to the Father's knowledge of him, bound together by holy and inseparable love. It is an active and penetrating knowledge that infuses believers with his power and life. They, in turn, passively receive his life and light, resulting in an assimilation of their souls to him and obedience to his commands. This reciprocal knowledge creates a profound bond of love and loyalty between Jesus and his sheep.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The knowledge of His sheep here spoken of is more than the mere knowing by name; it is a knowledge corresponding to the Fatherâ€™s knowledge of Him;â€”i. e. entire, perfect, all-comprehensive."
2. "Their knowledge of Him corresponds to His of the Father,â€”i. e. is intimate, direct, and personal."
3. "Both being bound together by holy and inseparable Love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Redeemer's knowledge of us is the active element, penetrating us with His power and life; that of believers is the passive principle, the reception of His life and light." 
2. "In this reception, however, an assimilation of the soul to the sublime object of its knowledge and love takes place; and thus an activity, though a derived one, is unfolded, which shows itself in obedience to His commands."
3. "From this mutual knowledge Jesus rises to another and loftier reciprocity of knowledge."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Know my sheep - Know my people, or my church. The word 'know' here is used in the sense of affectionate regard or love. It implies such a knowledge of their wants, their dangers, and their characters, as to result in a deep interest in their welfare."
2. "Jesus knows the hearts, the dangers, and the wants of his people, and his kindness as their shepherd prompts him to defend and aid them."
3. "They have seen their sins, and dangers: and wants; they have felt their need of a Saviour; they have come to him, and they have found him and his doctrines to be such as they need, and they have loved him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Am known of mine [Î³Î¹Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎºÎ¿Î¼Î±Î¹ Ï…Ï€Î¿ Ï„Ï‰Î½ ÎµÎ¼Ï‰Î½] . The best texts read, ginwskousi me ta ejma, mine own know me. So Rev.


### John Calvin:
1. "In the former clause, he again holds out his love towards us; for knowledge proceeds from love, and is accompanied by care."
2. "It means also that he utterly disregards all who do not obey the Gospel, as he repeats in the second clause."
3. "He confirms what he had formerly said, that - on the other hand - he is known by the sheep."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Effective repetition."
2. "Jesus as the Good Shepherd knows his sheep by name... they have experimental knowledge."
3. "Here... lies the secret of their love and loyalty."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ has an universal, special, distinct, and exact knowledge of all his sheep..."
2. "Christ's own approve of him, as their shepherd and their Saviour, and desire no other..."
3. "They love him above all, in the sincerity of their souls, and with a love as strong as death..."

### John Wesley:
1. I know my sheep â€” With a tender regard and special care: and am known of mine - With a holy confidence and affection.
