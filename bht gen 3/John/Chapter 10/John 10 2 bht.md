# John 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the winter feast, a true shepherd, recognized by God, enters in by the door leading the sheep. This is in stark contrast to the conduct of the Pharisees and signifies Christ's role as the protector of his flock. He is not referring solely to himself, but to all ministers of the gospel who enter in the same manner, showing that they come to care for and feed the sheep, not to kill and destroy. This characteristic of shepherding holds true for any under shepherd who has his mission and authority derived from Christ.
