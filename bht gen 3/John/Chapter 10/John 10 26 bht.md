# John 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The difficulty of these words is a considerable warrant for their genuineness, referring to the whole allegory and the conflict with the Jewish authorities. They were not Jesus' sheep, but rather veritable wolves in sheep's clothing â€“ children of the devil in spirit and conduct. Their lack of character caused them to refuse to believe. This emphasizes the special gift of faith and the voluntary rejection of it. It is not surprising that many do not obey the Gospel, as those whom the Spirit of God does not subdue to faith are wild and fierce beasts.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The difficulty of the words in this verse is considerable warrant for their genuineness and they refer more to the whole allegory rather than an explicit saying. The reference to the allegory implies that the conflict with the Jewish authorities is being addressed again. They were not of Jesus' sheep, but rather the children of the devil in spirit and conduct, veritable wolves in sheep's clothing. Because they lacked the character, the disposition of His sheep, they refused to believe. We must observe Christ's design here, that the gift of believing is a special gift and those who reject it do so through their voluntary malice. It is not surprising that many do not obey the Gospel, as those whom the Spirit of God does not subdue to the obedience of faith are wild and fierce beasts.
