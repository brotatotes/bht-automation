# John 10:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If those who claim to follow God's ways do not bear His character, then there is no reason to believe their words. However, if they do bear His character, even if they hate and disbelieve Jesus, they should recognize the unquestionable testimony of His works. The self-evidencing truth, majesty, and grace in Christ's words, along with His miracles, were meant to lead people to a higher faith in the unity of Himself and the Father. Thus, He urges them to have faith in His testimony rather than solely in His person.
