These well-trained sheep will not follow the stranger, the alien who is not their shepherd. They will flee from the thief, as if from a wolf or the plague. It is a reminder to us all to be discerning and to flee from those who preach false doctrine. We should not approve of their teachings or find any delight or benefit in them, for they do not speak the voice of truth that the sheep know and recognize.
