# John 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word used in this context is better understood as an allegory or parabolic allegory. The aim is to demonstrate that the idea of man and God being one was not foreign to the Old Testament, but rather depicted through symbols and shadows of the true God-Man. Regrettably, the Pharisees, due to their pride, spiritual blindness, and biases against Christ, were unable to fully grasp the deeper significance of Jesus' words. They failed to comprehend the allegorical nature of His teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word here rendered in the A.V. 'parable' is not exactly what is commonly socalled: not properly a parable: but rather a parabolic allegory. The parable requires narrative to set it forth; and St. John relates no such. The right word here would be allegory." 
2. "The argument is from the greater to the less. If in any sense they could be called gods,‚Äîhow much more properly He, whom&c. They were only officially so called, only called gods‚Äîbut He, the only One, sealed and hallowed by the Father, and sent into the world... is essentially God, inasmuch as He is the Son of God."
3. "The deeper aim of this argument is, to shew them that the idea of man and God being one, was not alien from their Old Testament spirit, but set forth there in types and shadows of Him, the real God-Man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. This parable - See the notes at Matthew 13:3.
They understood not ... - They did not understand the meaning or design of the illustration.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Parable [œÄŒ±œÅŒøŒπŒºŒπŒ±ŒΩ] . The word occurs but once outside of John's writings (2 Peter 2:22)."
2. "The usual word for parable is parabolh, which is once rendered proverb in the A. V. (Luke 4:23, changed to parable by Rev.)."
3. "For the distinction see on Matthew 13:3."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is the reason why, proudly vaunting of their wisdom, they rejected the light of Christ; for in a matter not very obscure they are exceedingly dull of apprehension."
2. "They did not understand what things they were which he spoke to them."
3. "They did not understand what he said."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word here used is not that which occurs so frequently in the other gospels in the sense of parable."
2. "The derivation of the word suggests that the primary meaning was a saying beside or out of the common way which had not the direct plain bearing of an ordinary saying, but either was intended to have many applications (as a proverb), or was in some degree circuitous in the method by which it effected its purpose, enigmatic or difficult."
3. "It seems certain that had any one of them related the comparison of this chapter he would have employed the more familiar name."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As a proverb in N.T. in 2 Peter 2:22, as a symbolic or figurative saying in John 16:25; John 16:29, as an allegory in John 10:6."
2. "Nowhere else in the N.T."
3. "Here clearly œÄŒ±œÅŒøŒπŒºŒπŒ± means an allegory which is one form of the parable."

### John Gill:
1. "But they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them; the things spoken by him being delivered in a parabolical way, though in lively figures, and in terms plain and easy to be understood..." (43 words)
2. "...what through the blindness of their minds, and the hardness of their hearts, and their prejudices in favour of themselves, and against Christ, they did not understand what were meant by them..." (37 words)
3. "...the blindness of their minds, and the hardness of their hearts, and their prejudices in favour of themselves, and against Christ..." (21 words)

### John Wesley:
1. They ‚Äî The Pharisees, to whom our Lord more immediately spake, as appears from the close of the foregoing chapter.
