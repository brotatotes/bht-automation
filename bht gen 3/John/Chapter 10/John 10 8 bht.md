# John 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many false teachers came before Christ, perverters of the people from the way of life, who pointed to Him but claimed the prerogatives not of Messiah but of robbers. Their deceit did not sway the true followers of Christ, who listened to the voice of their Shepherd and were preserved from the seduction of the wolves in sheep's clothing. Though the majority may be corrupt, the elect of God clung to the heaven-sent prophets and were kept by Him from these deceivers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What pretended teachers then came before Christ? [...] all his followers are here spoken of inclusively in the language of the allegory, as coming in by and with him."
2. "His was the first attempt to lead human nature, before Christ came; before the series of dispensations of grace began, in which pasture and life is offered to man by Him."
3. "however the sheep may for a while listen to these false shepherds, they do not hear them, so as to follow them. Those who do, belong not to the true flock."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All that ever came before meâ€”the false prophets; not as claiming the prerogatives of Messiah, but as perverters of the people from the way of life, all pointing to Him." 
2. "The instinct of their divinely taught hearts preserving them from seducers, and attaching them to the heaven-sent prophets."
3. "The Spirit of Christ was in them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When the Saviour says that 'all' were thieves, he speaks in a popular sense, using the word 'all' as it is often used in the New Testament, to denote the great mass or the majority."
2. "They insinuated themselves slyly as a thief, and they oppressed and spared not, like a robber."
3. "Though the great mass of teachers may be corrupt, yet the true friends of God will mourn in secret places, and refuse to 'listen to the instruction that causeth to err.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "For it ought to be observed, that a contrast is here made between the words of Christ and those things which are opposed to them. But so far are we from discovering any contradiction between the Law and the doctrine of the Gospel, that the Law is nothing else than a preparation for the Gospel."
2. "But this is not at variance with Christâ€™s statement, for, so far as they go astray, they cease, in some respects, to be sheep. What Christ means is simply this, that all the elect of God, though they were tempted to go astray in innumerable ways, were kept in obedience to the pure faith, so that they were not exposed as a prey to Satan, or to his ministers."
3. "This passage ought to strike us with the deepest shame; first, because we are so ill accustomed to the voice of our Shepherd, that there are hardly any who do not listen to it with indifference; and, next, because we are so slow and indolent to follow him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the similitude of the door, Jesus had declared that it was through Him alone that the flocks could come out of the Jewish fold into the pastures into which they had longed to enter."
2. "The prophecies had fixed the thoughts of all true Israelites on â€˜Him that cometh,â€™ and had shown them that until His coming their hopes could not be fulfilled."
3. "But those who trusted in God and waited patiently for Him were kept by Him from these deceivers: â€˜the sheep did not hear them.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These are the thieves and robbers, not the prophets and sincere teachers of old."
2. "They keep on coming, these wolves in sheep's clothing, who grow rich by fooling the credulous sheep."
3. "Fortunate sheep who knew the Shepherd's voice."

### John Gill:
1. "All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers [...] of those prophets who came, and were not sent of God, and so did not come in by the door."
2. "particularly of the three shepherds cut off in one month, [...] the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, especially the former; who were wolves in sheep's clothing."
3. "the elect of God, [...] did not attend to the false prophets, and false teachers, and idol shepherds; did not receive their doctrines, nor follow their practices."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever are come â€” Independently of me, assuming any part of my character, pretending, like your elders and rabbis, to a power over the consciences of men."
2. "all those prophets and expounders of God's word, that enter not by the door of the sheepfold, but run before I have sent them by my Spirit."
3. "Our Lord seems in particular to speak of those that had undertaken this office since he began his ministry, are thieves - Stealing temporal profit to themselves, and robbers - Plundering and murdering the sheep."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Many false teachers came before Christ, claiming to lead human nature and perverting people from the way of life. However, the true followers of Christ could discern their deceit and did not listen to them. These thieves and robbers, who grew rich by fooling the sheep, were not the sincere prophets and teachers of old. The fortunate sheep were those who listened to the voice of the Shepherd, Jesus, and were protected from these deceivers. It is a shame that we are often indifferent to the voice of our Shepherd and slow to follow Him. We should learn from the example of the sheep, who did not hear and follow the false prophets, but instead clung to the heaven-sent prophets and were guided by the Spirit of Christ.
