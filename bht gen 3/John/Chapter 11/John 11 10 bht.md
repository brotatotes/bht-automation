# John 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Walking without the light of Jesus, the divine purpose that illumines our path of duty, causes stumbling because there is no light within us. Just as the light of the body is the eye, we require inward light to guide us. When we blind our eyes, darkness surrounds us both physically and spiritually. The consequence of spiritual darkness is depicted by Jesus, revealing the distinction between Christianity and Neo-Platonism. Trusting in God's light enables us to walk securely, fearless of any obstacles that may come our way.
