# John 11:12 Commentary Help Text

The disciples, interpreting Jesus' reference to sleep as a physical indicator of a favorable crisis and eventual recovery, questioned the need for their Lord to travel to Judea. They believed that if Lazarus was asleep, he would be safe and would recover from whatever ailment he was suffering. Sleep in sickness was seen as a positive sign, suggesting that the illness had subsided, and there would no longer be a necessity for Jesus to expose himself to danger in Judea. They hoped that this understanding would divert Jesus from the potential peril that awaited him.
