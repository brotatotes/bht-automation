# John 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but Jesus had a higher meaning when He used the symbol of 'sleep' for death. The disciples had misunderstood this metaphor, thinking that Lazarus was simply resting in a literal and natural sense. However, the phrase our friend Lazarus implies that Christ's affection went beyond being loved by Lazarus, but was also reciprocated. The use of our friend as His title for Lazarus is truly illustrious.
