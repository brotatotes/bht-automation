### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus expresses His joy not over the sad event itself, but over the fact that He was not there, which would prove beneficial to the faith of His disciples. He wants them to believe in Him, and while the resurrection of Lazarus after being dead for four days would be a remarkable miracle, His absence during his sickness is an opportunity to confirm their faith even more. Jesus' gladness is not in the death of His friend, but in the safe experience it provides for His disciples. This emphasizes the divine decorum that in the presence of the Prince of Life, no one is ever said to have died. Jesus' personal connection to Lazarus is not broken by death, but through the raising of Lazarus, the disciples may witness the power of God and come to believe more profoundly.
