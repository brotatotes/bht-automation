3. "Ever ready to take the dark view, but deeply attached to his Lord."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let us also go, that we may die with himâ€”lovely spirit, though tinged with some sadness."
2. "He perceives clearly how this journey to Judea will end, as respects his Master, and not only sees in it peril to themselves, as they all did, but feels as if he could not and cared not to survive his Master's sacrifice to the fury of His enemies."
3. "It was that kind of affection which, living only in the light of its Object, cannot contemplate, or has no heart for life, without it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thomas, which is called Didymus - These names express the same thing. One is Hebrew and the other Greek. The name means a twin."
2. "Let us go and die, for what have we to hope for if Jesus returns into Judea? Lately they attempted to stone him, and now they will put him to death, and we also, like Lazarus, shall be dead."
3. "He is about to throw himself into danger. The Jews lately sought his life, and will again. They will put him to death. But let us not forsake him. Let us attend him and die with him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Didymus [Î´Î¹Î´Ï…Î¼Î¿Ï‚] . Not a surname of Thomas, but the Greek equivalent of the Aramaic name, twin."
2. "Fellow - disciples [ÏƒÏ…Î¼Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Ï„Î±Î¹Ï‚] . Only here in the New Testament."
3. "He will die for the love which he has, but he will not affect the faith which he has not" (Westcott).

### John Calvin:
1. "Thomas is now prepared to follow, but it is without confidence; or, at least, he does not fortify himself by the promise of Christ, so as to follow hint with cheerfulness and composure."
2. "Let us go, that we may die with him. This is the language of despair, for they ought to have entertained no fears about their own life."
3. "But this, as I have said, proceeds from inconsiderate zeal; for he ought rather to have taken courage from faith in the promise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This is the exhortation of Thomas to his fellow-disciples; and it would seem that they shared his feelings, for the word â€˜fellow-disciplesâ€™... binds all the disciples into one." 
2. "The language is undoubtedly that of fervent love to Jesus, but it is also the language of despair and vanished hope... death; not the Messianic kingdom, not life."
3. "Thomas should be the one to give expression to it... sight is what he wants: when he sees not he gives himself up to despondency."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Didymus (Î”Î¹Î´Ï…Î¼Î¿Ï‚). The word means twin. Clearly Thomas had a twin brother or sister." 
2. "His fellow disciples (Ï„Î¿Î¹Ï‚ ÏƒÏ…Î½Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Ï„Î±Î¹Ï‚). Dative case and article use like 'his.' Only use of ÏƒÏ…Î½Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Ï„ÎµÏ‚ in the N.T., rare word (in Plato)." 
3. "That we may die with him (Î¹Î½Î± Î±Ï€Î¿Î¸Î±Î½Ï‰Î¼ÎµÎ½ Î¼ÎµÏ„' Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï…). Purpose clause with Î¹Î½Î± and the second aorist active subjunctive of Î±Ï€Î¿Î¸Î½Î·ÏƒÎºÏ‰. Die with Jesus, Thomas means. Lazarus is already dead and they will kill Jesus (verse John 11:8). Pessimistic courage surely."

### John Gill:
1. "Let us also go, that we may die with him."
2. "they should have but little comfort when he was taken from them"
3. "they all forsook him and fled, and provided for their own safety, and left him to die alone"

### John Wesley:
1. "Thomas in Hebrew, as Didymus in Greek, signifies a twin."
2. "With him â€” With Jesus, whom he supposed the Jews would kill."
3. "It seems to be the language of despair."
