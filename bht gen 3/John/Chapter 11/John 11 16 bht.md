2. "This is in exact accord with the character of Thomas, as shewn in ch. xiv. 5; xx. 25;â€”ever ready to take the dark view, but deeply attached to his Lord."
3. "The remark means, Let us also go (with our Master), that we may die with him (not, with Lazarus, as Grot.)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "He perceives clearly how this journey to Judea will end, as respects his Master, and not only sees in it peril to themselves... but feels as if he could not and cared not to survive his Master's sacrifice..."
3. "It was that kind of affection which, living only in the light of its Object, cannot contemplate, or has no heart for life, without it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thomas, which is called Didymus - These names express the same thing. One is Hebrew and the other Greek. The name means a twin."
2. "Let us go and die, for what have we to hope for if Jesus returns into Judea? Lately they attempted to stone him, and now they will put him to death, and we also, like Lazarus, shall be dead."
3. "He is about to throw himself into danger. The Jews lately sought his life, and will again. They will put him to death. But let us not forsake him. Let us attend him and die with him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Didymus [Î´Î¹Î´Ï…Î¼Î¿Ï‚] . Not a surname of Thomas, but the Greek equivalent of the Aramaic name, twin."
2. "Fellow - disciples [ÏƒÏ…Î¼Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Ï„Î±Î¹Ï‚] . Only here in the New Testament."
3. "We may die. 'He will die for the love which he has, but he will not affect the faith which he has not' (Westcott)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thomas is now prepared to follow, but it is without confidence; or, at least, he does not fortify himself by the promise of Christ, so as to follow him with cheerfulness and composure."
2. "Let us go, that we may die with him. This is the language of despair, for they ought to have entertained no fears about their own life."
3. "Thomas does not refuse to die with Christ But this, as I have said, proceeds from inconsiderate zeal; for he ought rather to have taken courage from faith in the promise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let us also go, that we may die with him." 
2. "This is the end of all, death; not the Messianic kingdom, not life."
3. "Thomas... in whom unbelief and faith, hope and tendency to despair, were strangely blended."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Didymus (Î”Î¹Î´Ï…Î¼Î¿Ï‚). The word means twin."
2. "His fellow disciples (Ï„Î¿Î¹Ï‚ ÏƒÏ…Î½Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Ï„Î±Î¹Ï‚). Dative case and article use like 'his.' Only use of ÏƒÏ…Î½Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Ï„ÎµÏ‚ in the N.T., rare word (in Plato)."
3. "That we may die with him (Î¹Î½Î± Î±Ï€Î¿Î¸Î±Î½Ï‰Î¼ÎµÎ½ Î¼ÎµÏ„' Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï…). Purpose clause with Î¹Î½Î± and the second aorist active subjunctive of Î±Ï€Î¿Î¸Î½Î·ÏƒÎºÏ‰. Die with Jesus, Thomas means. Lazarus is already dead and they will kill Jesus (verse John 11:8). Pessimistic courage surely."

### John Gill:
1. "Let us also go, that we may die with him."
2. "He, and the rest of the disciples, imagined that Christ, by returning to Judea, would be in great danger of losing his life."
3. "Signifying, that they should have but little comfort when he was taken from them."

3. "It seems to be the language of despair."
