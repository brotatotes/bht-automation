# John 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Bethany was a small village situated about two miles from Jerusalem. This proximity between the two places allowed for easy visits of sympathy, which is important to note since Bethany was the location of the miracles performed by Jesus. It is worth mentioning that St. John wrote using past tense when describing the locations, suggesting that he may have regarded Jerusalem as a laid waste city at the time of writing. The closeness of Bethany to Jerusalem also meant that Jesus was stepping into the immediate presence of His enemies when visiting the village.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The geographical notice is given, to account for the occurrence detailed in the next verse."
2. "Meyer remarks, that the use of the past tense, was nigh, does not necessarily imply that the places no longer existed when the Apostle wrote."
3. "But seeing that St. John alone uses this form of designation (compare ch. xviii. 1; xix. 41), and that he probably wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem, it is more natural (as Meyer himself confesses) to explain the past tense by his regarding Jerusalem and its neighbourhood as laid waste at the time when he published his Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Bethany was nigh Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongsâ€”rather less than two miles; mentioned to explain the visits of sympathy noticed in the following words, which the proximity of the two places facilitated."
2. 
3.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The village is small, and appears never to have been large, but it is pleasantly situated near the southeastern base of the mount, and has many fine trees about and above it."
2. "By the dim light of a taper we also descended very cautiously, by 25 slippery steps, to the reputed sepulchre of Lazarus, or El Azariyeh, as both tomb and village are now called."
3. "It is a wretched cavern, every way unsatisfactory, and almost disgusting."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Fifteen furlongs. About two miles.


### John Calvin:
1. "For, though the desire of performing an office of kindness was their inducement to go, yet they were assembled there, by a secret decree of God, for another purpose." 
2. "It is a convincing proof of the base ingratitude of the nation, that this striking demonstration of Divine power...instantly vanishes from the eyes of men." 
3. "Men who, with excessive eagerness, continually gape for miracles, are altogether dull and stupid in the consideration of them."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "They had pronounced Him a blasphemer, and they were determined to bring Him to the blasphemerâ€™s death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
