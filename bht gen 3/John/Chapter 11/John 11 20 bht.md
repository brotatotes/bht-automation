2. "The common posture of grief among the Jews was that of sitting."
3. "Often this grief was so excessive as to fix the person in astonishment, and render him immovable, or prevent his being affected by any external objects."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. That Jesus was coming [οτι ο ιησους ερχεται] . Literally, is coming. The exact words of the message : Jesus is coming. 
Went and met [υπηντησεν] . The verb means to go to meet.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That Jesus was coming (οτ Ιησους ερχετα). Present middle indicative retained in indirect discourse after the secondary tense ηκουσεν (first aorist active)."
2. "Went and met him (υπηντησεν αυτω). First aorist (ingressive) active indicative of υπανταω, old compound verb, to go to meet (Matthew 8:28) with the associative instrumental case αυτω."
3. "But Mary still sat in the house (Μαριαμ δε εν τω οικω εκαθεζετο). Imperfect middle of καθεζομα, old verb to sit down, graphic picture of Mary, 'while Mary was sitting in the house.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming,...went and met him." 
2. "either through her great affection to him, and eager desire of seeing him; or to consult his safety, and let him know what number of Jews were in their house."
3. "But Mary sat [still] in the house; not out of disrespect to Jesus, or through want of affection to him, or through any indifference and sloth, but because she knew not that Jesus was coming."

### John Wesley:
1. Mary sat in the house — Probably not hearing what was said.
