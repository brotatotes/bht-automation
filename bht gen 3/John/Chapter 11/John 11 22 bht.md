### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Erwtaw is to ask on equal terms, and hence is always used by Christ of His own asking from the Father, in the consciousness of His equal dignity."
3. "Hence Martha, as Trench observes, 'plainly reveals her poor, unworthy conception of His person, that she recognizes in Him no more than a prophet, when she ascribes that asking [Î±Î¹Ï„ÎµÎ¹ÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹] to Him which He never ascribes to Himself' (" Synonyms ")."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The presence of the great Friend and Helper seems to give a sudden quickening to Martha's faith."

1. "Even now I know."
2. "As many things as thou dost ask of God."
3. "God will give."

### John Gill:
1. "But I know that even now, at this distance of time, though her brother had been in the grave four days."
2. "She was persuaded that he had great interest with God, and that whatever he desired of him was granted to him."
3. "Though she does not mention the resurrection of her brother, yet it seems to be what she had in view."

### John Wesley:
1. Whatsoever thou wilt ask, God will give it thee â€” So that she already believed he could raise him from the dead.
