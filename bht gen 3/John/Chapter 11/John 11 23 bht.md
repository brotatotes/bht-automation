# John 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These words of Jesus contain no immediate promise of Lazarus' restoration, but rather serve to lead Martha to the faith she needs. Jesus purposely speaks in general terms, testing her faith and allowing for the possibility of grasping the truth. The kindness of Christ is evident in forgiving Martha's faults and promising her more than she had asked for. Jesus knows exactly what she means, yet he remains intentionally ambiguous, leaving her uncertain of whether the meaning is an immediate resurrection or the general resurrection.
