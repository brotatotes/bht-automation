## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Her calling her sister is characteristic of one who (as in Luke x. 40) had not been much habituated herself to listen to his instructions."
2. "Secretly] 'Lest the Jews who were present should know it, and should perhaps give information against Him to those who were conspiring against His life.'"
3. "But is it not somewhat too plainly asserted, to mean only calling by inference? Surely, we must regard Martha‚Äôs words as proving it to have been a fact."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 28-32. The Master is come and
	calleth for thee‚ÄîThe narrative does not give us this
	interesting detail, but Martha's words do.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "She went her way - Jesus probably directed her to go, though the evangelist has not recorded it, for she said to Mary, The Master calleth for thee."
2. "Secretly - Privately. So that the others did not hear her. This was done, perhaps, to avoid confusion, or because it was probable that if they knew Jesus was coming they would have made opposition. Perhaps she doubted whether Jesus desired it to be known that he had come."
3. "The Master is come - This appears to have been the appellation by which he was known to the family. It means, literally, teacher, and was a title which he claimed for himself. 'One is your Master, even Christ' Matthew 23:8, Matthew 23:10."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Master [Œø Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ±œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÇ]...opens a glimpse into the private intercourse of the Lord and the disciples: so they spoke of Him."
2. "Is come [œÄŒ±œÅŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ]...is present."
3. "The Master...so they spoke of Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word Master shows in what estimation Christ was held among those pious women."
2. "It was a great matter that they were entirely devoted to him as his disciples."
3. "Mary‚Äôs sudden departure, to come and meet him, was a proof that she regarded him with no ordinary reverence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We cannot doubt that Mary until now had been in ignorance of the coming of Jesus." 
2. "That which He was about to do He would have faith, not unbelief, to see."
3. "Therefore Mary must be called 'secretly.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Called Mary... Out of the house and away from the crowd." 
2. "Secretly... To tell her the glad news." 
3. "The Master... So they loved to call him as he was... Is here... Calleth thee. This rouses Mary."

### John Gill:
