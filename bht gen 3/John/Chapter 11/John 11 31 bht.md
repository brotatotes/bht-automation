# John 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Mary went out to the tomb, the custom of the East required her friends to accompany her, leading to witnesses who were not prejudiced in favor of Jesus but were there by chance. The assumption was that Mary went to weep, and her loud weeping demonstrated her greater passion compared to her sister Martha. This deep grief observed at the tomb was a prevalent practice among the Jews, who observed the first days of mourning with solemnity and many grief ceremonies.
