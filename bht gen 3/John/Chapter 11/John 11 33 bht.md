## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the word rendered by the A.V. 'groaned' can bear but one meaning,â€”the expression of indignation and rebuke, not of sorrow."

3. "I would understand the words as expressing the temporary check given to the flow of His tears,â€”the effort used to utter the following question."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What a vivid and beautiful outcoming of His 'real' humanity!"
2. "The word here rendered 'groaned' does not mean 'sighed' or 'grieved,' but rather 'powerfully checked his emotion.'"
3. "Referring probably to this visible difficulty of repressing His emotions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He groaned in the spirit... denotes violent agitation - not from anger, but from grief." 
2. "He saw the sorrow of others, and he was also moved with sympathy and love."
3. "The word here... does not mean that utterance was given to the internal emotion, but that it was deep and agitating, though internal."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The interpretation which explains tw pneumati as the sphere of feeling is to be preferred." (Commentary)

### John Calvin:
1. "When he is about to raise Lazarus, before granting deliverance or aid, by the groaning of his spirit, by a strong feeling of grief, and by tears, he shows that he is as much affected by our distresses as if he had endured them in his own person."
2. "The feelings of men are sinful and perverse on two accounts; first, because they are hurried along by impetuous motion, and are not regulated by the true rule of modesty; and, secondly, because they do not always arise from a lawful cause, or, at least, are not directed to a lawful end."
3. "Christ took upon him human affections, but without disorder; for he who obeys the passions of the flesh is not obedient to God. Christ was indeed troubled and vehemently agitated; but, at the same time, he kept himself in subjection to the will of the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is little doubt that the first word describing the emotion of Jesus denotes rather anger than sorrow. Such is its regular meaning; and, though New Testament usage partly gives a different turn to the word, yet in every passage it implies a severity of tone and feeling that is very different from grief."
2. "It is more difficult to answer the question, At what was Jesus angry?... as to the words â€˜in His spirit,â€™ without entering into any discussion of a difficult subject, we may say that, as â€˜the spiritâ€™ denotes the highest (and so to speak) innermost part of manâ€™s nature, the language shows that our Lordâ€™s nature was stirred to its very depth."
3. "This reference to the spirit assists us in understanding the words that follow â€˜and troubled Himself:â€™ the indignation and horror of the spirit threw the whole â€˜selfâ€™ into disturbance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mary's weeping was genuine, that of the Jews was partly perfunctory and professional and probably actual 'wailing' as the verb ÎºÎ»Î±Î¹Ï‰ can mean." 
2. "He groaned in the spirit...to snort with anger like a horse." 
3. "The presence of these Jews, the grief of Mary, Christ's own concern, the problem of the raising of Lazarus--all greatly agitated the spirit of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "He groaned in the spirit; in his human soul; and which shows, that he had a real human soul, subject to passions, though sinless ones."
2. "The word signifies an inward motion of the mind, through indignation and anger; and it may be partly at the weakness of Mary's faith, and at her immoderate sorrow; and partly at the hypocrisy of the Jews."
3. "Or else this inward groaning was through grief, sympathizing with Mary, and her friends, his human soul being touched with a fellow feeling of their griefs and sorrows."

### John Wesley:
1. "He groaned â€” So he restrained his tears. So he stopped them soon after, John 11:38."
2. "He troubled himself â€” An expression amazingly elegant, and full of the highest propriety."
3. "This tender trouble which he now voluntarily sustained, was full of the highest order and reason."
