## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The comparison of ch. v. 25, 28, which are analogically applicable, makes it clear that they who have heard, shall live, is the physical, as well as the spiritual order of things."
2. "To cry out, shout aloud, was not His wont; see Matt. xii. 19."
3. "This cry signified that greater one, which all shall hear, ch. v. 28."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He shall not cry," said the prophet, nor, in His ministry, did He. What a sublime contrast is this "loud cry" to the magical "whisperings" and "mutterings" of which we read in Isaiah 8:19; Isaiah 29:4 (as GROTIUS remarks)!" (Commentary)
2. "It is second only to the grandeur of that voice which shall raise all the dead." (Commentary)
3. "His last utterance was a 'loud cry'." (Commentary)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus spake openly and audibly, and asserted thus his power."
2. "The power of raising the dead is the highest of which we can conceive. [...] He that could do this must be omniscient as well as omnipotent; and if Jesus did it by his own power, it proves that he was divine."
3. "This is a striking illustration of the general resurrection. [...] demonstrates the certainty that he will do it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Come forth [Œ¥ŒµœÖœÅŒø ŒµŒæœâ] . Literally, hither forth.


### John Calvin:
1. "By not touching with the hand, but only crying with the voice, his Divine power is more fully demonstrated."
2. "He holds out to our view the secret and astonishing efficacy of his word."
3. "In raising Lazarus, he exhibited a visible token of his spiritual grace, which we experience every day by the perception of faith, when he shows that his voice gives life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He cried with a loud voice ... the loud voice was not for the benefit of Lazarus, but for the sake of the crowd standing around." 
2. "Lazarus, come forth ... Lazarus heard and obeyed the summons." 
3. "The loud voice was not for the benefit of Lazarus, but for the sake of the crowd standing around that they might see that Lazarus came forth simultaneously with the command of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "He cried with a loud voice; not on account of the dead, but for the sake of those around him, that all might hear and observe."

3. "He calls him by his name, not only as being his friend, and known by him, but to distinguish him from any other corpse that might lie interred in the same cave."
