## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word rendered grave-clothes is explained to mean a sort of band, of rush or tow, used to swathe infants, and to bind up the dead."
2. "Basil speaks of the bound man coming forth from the sepulchre, as a miracle in a miracle: and ancient pictures represent Lazarus gliding forth from the tomb, not stepping; which apparently is right."
3. "The napkin, or handkerchief, appears to have tied up his chin. let him go, probably, to his home."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus will no more do this Himself than roll away the stone."
2. "THE LIFE-GIVING ACT ALONE HE RESERVES TO HIMSELF."
3. "So in the quickening of the dead to spiritual life, human instrumentality is employed first to prepare the way, and then to turn it to account."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that was dead - The same man, body and soul."
2. "It would be clearly impossible for a person thus treated to move his arms or legs if restored to existence."
3. "The effect of this miracle is said to have been that many believed on him. It may be remarked in regard to it that there could not be a more striking proof of the divine mission and power of Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Jesus enters at once as the consolation of bereaved love, and the eternal solution of the problem of life and death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He that was dead came forth (ŒµŒæŒ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ Œø œÑŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒ∑Œ∫œâœÇ). Literally, 'Came out the dead man,' (effective aorist active indicative and perfect active articular participle of Œ∏ŒΩŒ∑œÉŒ∫œâ). Just as he was and at once."

Perfect passive participle of Œ¥Œµœâ with the accusative loosely retained according to the common Greek idiom (Robertson, Grammar, p. 486), but literally 'as to the feet and hands' (opposite order from the English). Probably the legs were bound separately."
