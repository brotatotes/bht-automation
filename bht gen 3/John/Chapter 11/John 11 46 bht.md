# John 11:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon hearing about the resurrection of Lazarus, some of those who believed in Jesus brought the news to the Pharisees, who were already hostile towards Him. This act of hostility was intended to put them on schemes to destroy Jesus. Although the resurrection of Lazarus should have softened their hearts, it hardened them, filling them with malice and envy towards Christ. This serves as a reminder that miracles and the Gospel can either lead to life or death, and those who reject sound doctrine will remain unpersuaded even if one rose from the dead.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Some of those who believed in Jesus went and reported to the religious leaders about the resurrection of Lazarus, which was a crisis for the Sanhedrin. The information was brought to the Pharisees, who had already declared against Jesus. This act of hostility was not done with friendly motives, but rather to put them on schemes to destroy Him. It is astonishing that even the resurrection of Lazarus did not soften their hearts, but rather hardened them and filled them with malice and envy towards Christ. Miracles, like the doctrines of the Gospel, can be the savour of death unto death or the savour of life unto life. As some reject sound doctrine through obstinate ingratitude, they will not be persuaded even if one rose from the dead.
