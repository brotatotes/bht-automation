# John 11:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief priests, the fierce adversaries of Christ, were aware of the reality of His miracles and the undeniable impact they had on the people. Stricken with fear, they gathered to discuss their next move, acknowledging the signs and wonders performed by Jesus. However, their blindness prevented them from recognizing the urgency to believe in Him. While Jesus was actively teaching and working miracles, they remained idle, failing to grasp the imminent consequences of their actions. Their question, What do we? revealed not only their reproachful selves but also their ignorance of the truth.
