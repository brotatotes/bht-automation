## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not merely of himself, but under the influence of the Spirit, who caused him to utter words, of the full meaning of which he had no conception."
2. "A true priest is ipso facto a prophet."
3. "This confirms the above view of the words that year, here again repeated."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus should die for that nation‚ÄîHe meant nothing more than that the way to prevent the apprehended ruin of the nation was to make a sacrifice of the Disturber of their peace." 
2. "But in giving utterance to this suggestion of political expediency, he was so guided as to give forth a divine prediction of deep significance."
3. "God so ordered it that it should come from the lips of the high priest for that memorable year, the recognized head of God's visible people, whose ancient office, symbolized by the Urim and Thummim, was to decide in the last resort, all vital questions as the oracle of the divine will."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though he uttered what proved to be a true prophecy, yet it was accomplished in a way which he did not intend."
2. "It is not certain or probable that the high priest ever was endowed with the gift of prophecy; but he sustained a high office, the authority of his name was great, and it was thence remarkable that he uttered a declaration which the result showed to be true, though not in the sense that he intended."
3. "His death, so far from saving them in the sense in which the high priest understood it, was the very occasion of their destruction."

### John Calvin:
1. "But God turned his tongue to a different purpose, so that, under ambiguous words, he likewise uttered a prediction."
2. "In the same manner, God intended to bless his people by the mouth of Balaam, on whom he had bestowed the spirit of prophecy."
3. "The cause and pledge of this unity was the death of Christ, by which he drew all things to himself; but we are daily gathered by the Gospel into the fold of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not wholly of himself, John means. There was more in what Caiaphas said than he understood." 
2. "But certainly unconscious prophecy on his part and purely accidental. Caiaphas meant only what was mean and selfish." 
3. "Imperfect active of ŒºŒµŒªŒªœâ in indirect discourse instead of the usual present retained after a secondary tense (ŒµœÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒµœÖœÉŒµŒΩ) as sometimes occurs."

### John Gill:
1. "But Jesus the true Messiah must die; this was determined in the counsel of God, agreed to by Christ in the covenant of grace, foretold by the prophets from the beginning of the world, typified by sacrifices and other things, under the former dispensation, predicted by Christ himself, and accordingly came to pass; and upon the above accounts was necessary, as well as for the salvation of his people, who otherwise must have perished; and yet was free and voluntary in him, and a strong expression, and a demonstrative proof of his love to them." 
2. "And not only this prophecy declared, that Jesus should die, but that he should die for that nation, for the nation of the Jews; not for every individual in it, for all of them were not saved by him; some received him not; they rejected him as the Messiah, Saviour, and Redeemer, and died in their sins; but for all the elect of God among them, the sheep of the house of Israel, to whom he was sent, and whom he came to seek and save."
3. "And moreover, this prophecy suggests, that Jesus was to die, not merely as a martyr, to confirm with his blood the doctrine he preached, nor only as an example of courage, meekness, patience, and love, but for, or in the room and stead of his people, as their surety; giving his life a ransom and himself a sacrifice to the justice of God, for them; thereby fulfilling the law and satisfying it, and appeasing the wrath of God on their account."
