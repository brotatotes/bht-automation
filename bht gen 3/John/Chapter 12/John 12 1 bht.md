# John 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived in Bethany, a place of danger after the great miracle and the rage of the Sanhedrin. He came to visit Lazarus, who had been dead but was now raised by Jesus. It was on this day, probably the Jewish Sabbath, that Jesus prepared Himself for the ultimate sacrifice, knowing that the time and place for His betrayal by Judas would come at the appointed hour. Thus, there is a perfect agreement in the account of His anointing at Bethany, where He willingly exposed Himself to danger in order to fulfill God's plan.
