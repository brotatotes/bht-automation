# John 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief priests, having consulted and intending to put Lazarus out of the way, saw him as an object of attention in connection with Jesus. They viewed killing Lazarus as a means to prevent him from being a living testimony to Jesus' power. This wickedness, fueled by satanic influence, shows that unbelief stops at no crime. However, we should consistently meditate on God's works, even in the face of opposition, to counteract Satan's attempts to bury or obscure them.
