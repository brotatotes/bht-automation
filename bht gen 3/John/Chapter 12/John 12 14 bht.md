2. "The Jews themselves are constrained to expound the prediction of Zechariah 9:9, which was at that time fulfilled, as referring to the Messiah; but, at the same time, they ridiculed us for being led astray by the shadow of an ass."
3. "When he describes Christ as riding on an ass, the meaning is, that his kingdom will have nothing in common with the pomp, splendor, wealth, and power of the world; and it was proper that this should be made known by an outward manifestation, that all might be fully assured that it is spiritual."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Through the disciples, of course, as in Mark 11:2-6 (Matthew 21:2-3; Matthew 21:6; Luke 19:30)."

3. "Rightly understood Matthew has Jesus riding only the colt like the rest."
