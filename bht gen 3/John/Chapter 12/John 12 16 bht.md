## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Important, as shewing that this, and probably other prophetic citations under similar circumstances, were the effect of the light poured into the minds of the Apostles by the Holy Spirit after the Ascension."
2. "They had done these things unto him] viz. the going out to meet Him, strewing clothes and branches in the way, and shouting 'Hosanna' before Him: also perhaps, the setting Him on the ass, implied in the concise narrative."
3. "Notice the thrice-repeated these things each time signifying 'this which was written by the prophet,' 'the above citation.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Spirit, descending on them from the glorified Saviour at Pentecost, opened their eyes suddenly to the true sense of the Old Testament." 
2. "Brought vividly to their recollection this and other Messianic predictions."
3. "They, and all the actors in these scenes, had been unconsciously fulfilling those predictions."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostles are the servants of God to fulfill the prophecy, but they do not understand what they are doing."
2. "We are blind, unless the word of God go before our steps, and it is not even enough that the word of God shine on us, if the Spirit do not also enlighten our eyes."
3. "Taught by this example, let us learn to form our judgment of everything that relates to Christ, not by our own carnal feelings, but by the Scripture."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was the events themselves now occurring that were dark to them. They were not seen in their true light as a magnifying, as a prefigurative glorifying, of a suffering Messiah."
2. "The ignorance of the disciples was corrected by experience. What they did not understand now, they understood when the resurrection and ascension had taken place."
3. "The light of that glorification shed light alike upon the sufferings and the partial glorifications of Jesus that had gone before."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Another comment by John concerning the failure of the disciples to know what was happening." 
2. "It was easier to understand then and they had the Holy Spirit to help them." 
3. "The use of ŒµœÄ' Œ±œÖœÑœâ for 'of him' rather than œÄŒµœÅ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ is unusual, but occurs in Revelation 10:11; Revelation 22:16."

### John Gill:
1. "They did not then know the sense of that prophecy, nor that the things which were now doing were a fulfilling of it."
2. "Their minds were greatly illuminated, and they had a very distinct knowledge of the Scriptures of the Old Testament; and saw clearly how they severally had their accomplishment in Christ."
3. "Then remembered they that these things were written of him; in the prophecies of the Old Testament."

### John Wesley:
1. "The design of God's providential dispensations is seldom understood at first."
2. "We ought therefore to believe, though we understand not, and to give ourselves up to the Divine disposal."
3. "The great work of faith is, to embrace those things which we knew not now, but shall know hereafter."
