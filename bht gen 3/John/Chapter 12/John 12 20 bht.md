## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These Greeks were not Grecian Jews,‚Äîwho would not have been so called."
2. "But Gentiles, ‚Äòproselytes of the gate,‚Äô who were in the habit of coming up to the feast."
3. "See ch. vii. 35, and note: also Acts viii. 27."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jews, but Greek proselytes to the Jewish faith, who were wont to attend the annual festivals, particularly this primary one, the Passover."
2. "These men from the west represent, at the end of Christ's life, what the wise men from the east represented at its beginning."
3. "Those come to the cross of the King, even as these to His manger."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The same name was commonly used by the Jews to denote all the pagan nations, because most of those whom they knew spoke the Greek language." 
2. "There are three opinions in regard to these persons: That they were Jews who spoke the Greek language, and dwelt in some of the Greek cities. That they were proselytes from the Greeks. That they were still Gentiles and idolaters, who came to bring offerings to Yahweh to be deposited in the temple."
3. "Hence, the outer court of the temple was called the court of the Gentiles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Greeks (%Ellhnev). Gentiles, not Hellenists. See on Acts 6:1. Jesus comes into contact with the Gentile world at His birth (the Magi) and at the close of His ministry.


### John Calvin:
1. "But though they were the descendants of Jews, yet as they resided at a great distance beyond the sea, we need not wonder that the Evangelist introduces them as strangers and unacquainted with the occurrences which took place at that time in Jerusalem and in places adjacent."
2. "For though religion and the fear of God were not confined to the temple, yet in no other place were they permitted to offer sacrifices to God, nor had they anywhere else the Ark of the Testimony, which was the token of the presence of God."
3. "And if those men undertook so long a journey at great expense, with great inconvenience, and not without personal risk, that they might not treat with indifference the external profession of their piety, what apology can we now offer, if we do not testify, in our own houses, that we worship the true God?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The persons spoken of are Greeks (not Greek-speaking Jews), therefore Gentile by birth, probably proselytes, certainly (as appears by 'from among' not 'among') sharers in the faith and purposes of the other pilgrims at the feast."
2. "They are part of those referred to in chap. John 7:35 and John 10:16."
3. "Still more, they are the earnest and first-fruits of that 'world' which the Pharisees have just spoken of as 'going after' Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Certain Greeks (HŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒµœÇ œÑŒπŒΩŒµœÇ). Real Greeks, not Greek-speaking Jews (Hellenists, Acts 6:1), but Greeks like those in Antioch (Acts 11:20, correct text œÄœÅŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖœÇ HŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒ±œÇ) to whom Barnabas was sent."
2. "To worship at the feast (ŒπŒΩŒ± œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒ∑œÉœâœÉŒπŒΩ ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ ŒµŒøœÅœÑŒ∑). Purpose clause with ŒπŒΩŒ± and the first aorist active subjunctive of œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒµœâ, old and common verb to kiss the hand in reverence, to bow the knee in reverence and worship."
3. "They found the pilgrims and the city ringing with talk about Jesus. They may even have witnessed the triumphal entry."

### John Gill:
1. "These were not Graecizing Jews, or Jews that dwelt in Greece, and spoke the Greek language; but these were... Gentiles."
2. "They were... either mere Gentiles, and yet devout and religious men, who were allowed to offer sacrifice, and to worship... or they were proselytes..."
3. "These were among those, that went forth to meet Jesus, and that attended him to Jerusalem... who were come up out of the country to this feast; and these came along with them to worship at it..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Certain Greeks... a prelude of the Gentile Church."
2. "That these were circumcised does not appear."
3. "But they came up on purpose to worship the God of Israel."
