# John 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The grain of wheat perishes and is not apparent in the new plant; the divine Will has determined the law of the springing up of the wheat-corn and the glorification of the Son of Man through death. This paradox of life coming through death is illustrated by the corn of wheat, a symbol familiar to Greeks in their mystic rituals. Jesus shows the Christian ideal of sacrifice, where life springs forth from death, which contrasts with the philosophy of Greece.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The grain of wheat perishes, and is not apparent (as the seeds of dicotyledonous plants are) in the new plant." 
2. "The divine Will, which has fixed the law of the springing up of the wheat-corn, has also determined the law of the glorification of the Son of Man, and the one in analogy with the other: i.e. both through Death." 
3. "The symbolism here lies at the root of that in ch. vi., where Christ is the BREAD of life. it abideth by itself alone, with its life uncommunicated, lived only within its own limits, and not passing on."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." 
2. "The necessity of His death is here brightly expressed, and its proper operation and fruitâ€”life springing forth out of deathâ€”imaged forth by a beautiful and deeply significant law of the vegetable kingdom."
3. "For a double reason, no doubt, this was utteredâ€”to explain what he had said of His death, as the hour of His own glorification, and to sustain His own Spirit under the agitation which was mysteriously coming over it in the view of that death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All the beauty and richness of the harvest results from the fact that the grain had died."
2. "By this he still keeps before them the truth that he was to be glorified, but he delicately and beautifully introduces the idea still that he must die."
3. "No one thing could be more evidently fitted for another than this provision made in the grain itself for the future wants of the tender germ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The selection of the corn of wheat as an illustration acquires a peculiar interest from the fact of its being addressed to Greeks, familiar with the Eleusinian mysteries celebrated in their own country."
2. "An ear of corn, plucked in solemn silence, was exhibited to the initiated as the object of mystical contemplation, as the symbol of the God, prematurely killed, but, like the ear enclosing the seed - corn, bearing within himself the germ of a second life."
3. "These features of the mysteries set forth, and with the same symbol as that employed by Christ here, the crude pagan conception of life rising out of death."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ compares his death to sowing, which appears to tend to the destruction of the wheat, but yet is the cause of far more abundant increase."
2. "That dreadful appearance of disgrace and cursing, which appears in the death of Christ, not only obscures his glory, but removes it altogether from our view."
3. "When the godly are distressed by various afflictions... let them unceasingly consider that this is a sowing which, in due time, will yield fruit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth itself alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.".
2. "Absolute death, destruction of the principle of life, is not implied. The seed does not actually die: its old covering dies that the germ of life within may spring up in higher forms of beauty, and with many grains instead of one."
3. "Such is the law of nature, and to this great law Jesus as â€˜Son of manâ€™ must conform: He does not simply lay down a rule for others; as representative of our humanity the rule must first find its application in Himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus shows here the paradox that life comes through death."
2. "Grains of wheat have been found in Egyptian tombs three or four thousand years old, but they are now dead. They bore no fruit."
3. "The Christian ideal of sacrifice, 'and this was foreign to the philosophy of Greece'."

### John Gill:
- "but if it die; if it wastes, consumes, and rots, as it does, being cast into the earth, in the time before mentioned:
it bringeth forth much fruit;" (quote 1)
- "And Christ here compares himself to a single corn of wheat, because he was of little account among men, and but little or nothing was expected by them from him; and chiefly because he was alone in the salvation of his people." (quote 2)
- "Christ must have been without them in heaven; wherefore he chose rather to die for them, that they might be forever with him, than be alone in the human nature." (quote 3)

### John Wesley:
1. "Unless a grain of wheat die." 
2. "The late resurrection of Lazarus gave our Lord a natural occasion of speaking on this subject."
3. "and which therefore was an exceeding proper similitude, peculiarly adapted to the purpose for which he uses it."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The grain of wheat perishes and is not apparent in the new plant. Just as the divine Will has determined the law of the springing up of the wheat-corn, it has also determined the law of the glorification of the Son of Man through death. The necessity of His death is expressed here, as well as the image of life springing forth from death. This paradox that life comes through death is beautifully illustrated by the selection of the corn of wheat as an illustration, which would have been of particular interest to the Greeks familiar with the Eleusinian mysteries. The grain of wheat serves as a symbol of the God, prematurely killed but bearing within himself the germ of a second life. Through this analogy, Jesus shows that the Christian ideal of sacrifice is foreign to Greek philosophy.

- Attempt 5 BHT: The grain of wheat perishes, but the divine Will has determined the law of the Son of Man's glorification through death. The paradox that life comes through death is vividly expressed, with the corn of wheat symbolizing the process of sacrifice and the emergence of new life. This analogy is particularly meaningful to the Greeks, who would have recognized the correlation with their own mysteries of life rising out of death. Christ's death is not just an act for others, but a necessary application to Himself as representative of humanity.
