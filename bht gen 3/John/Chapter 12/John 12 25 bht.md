## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word soul (or, life, but here better, soul) is not really in a double sense: as the wheat-corn retains its identity, though it die, so the soul: so that the two senses are, in their depth, but one." 
2. "Notice, that the soul involves the life in both cases, and must not be taken in the present acceptation of that term."
3. "But the saying here proclaims more plainly its true extent,‚Äîby its immediate connexion with ver, 24 and by the words, unto life eternal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."
2. "Did our Lord mean to exclude Himself from the operation of the great principle here expressed‚Äîself-renunciation, the law of self-preservation; and its converse, self-preservation, the law of self-destruction?"
3. "As He became Man to exemplify this fundamental law of the Kingdom of God in its most sublime form, so the very utterance of it on this occasion served to sustain His own Spirit in the double prospect to which He had just alluded."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Shall keep [œÜœÖŒªŒ±ŒæŒµŒπ]. See on 1 Peter 1:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who, despising life, advances courageously to death, is said to hate life."
2. "For the true limit of loving life, is, when we continue in it as long as it pleases God, and when we are prepared to leave it as soon as he shall order us."

3. "By simply living for himself and without thought of others, he 'loses' that very thing which he desires to preserve and make happy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Clearly ŒºŒπœÉŒµœâ means 'hate' when the issue is between Christ and the dearest things of life as happens when the choice is between martyrdom and apostasy." 
2. "In that case one keeps his soul for eternal life by losing his life (œàœÖœáŒ∑, each time) here."
3. "That is the way to 'guard' (œÜœÖŒªŒ±ŒæŒµ) life by being true to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Whoever is so in love with this present temporal life...rather than to expose it to any danger, chooses to deny the faith of Christ, and desert his cause and interest; as such an one shall not long enjoy this life, so he shall come short of an eternal one."
2. "Whoever seems careless about it, and not to consult the safety of it, but is unconcerned about it; yea, as if he was throwing it away...he shall keep it unto life eternal."
3. "They must suffer and die, as well as he, though not on the same account, and for the self-same reasons; and that their sufferings and death in his cause, and for his Gospel, would turn to their advantage."

### John Wesley:

- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse speaks of the importance of self-renunciation and the choice between preserving one's soul or losing it. The soul here refers to the self, not in a selfish sense, but in the sense of preserving one's true identity in relation to God. By loving one's life too much and living solely for oneself, one ironically loses the very thing they seek to protect. On the other hand, by hating one's life in comparison to the will of God, one keeps their soul for eternal life. This principle was exemplified by Jesus himself, who embraced self-renunciation even unto death. Thus, the key to guarding and preserving one's life lies in staying true to Christ and his teachings.
