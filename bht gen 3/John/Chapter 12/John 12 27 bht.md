## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The horror of death and the ardour of obedience were in conflict."
2. "The prayer is a veritable prayer; and answers to the prophetic Messianic prayers in the Psalms."
3. "'the going into, and exhausting this hour, this cup, is the very appointed way of my glorification.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The death of the cross was, and could not but be, appalling to His spirit. But to shrink from absolute subjection to the Father, was worse still."
2. "In asking Himself, 'What shall I say?' He seems as if thinking aloud, feeling His way between two dread alternatives, looking both of them sternly in the face, measuring, weighing them, in order that the choice actually made might be seen, and even by himself the more vividly felt, to be a profound, deliberate, spontaneous election."
3. "What He recoils from is not subjection to His Father's will: but to show how tremendous a self-sacrifice that obedience involved, He first asks the Father to save Him from it, and then signifies how perfectly He knows that He is there for the very purpose of enduring it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "On the decision of that moment - the fixed and unwavering purpose of the Son of God depended manâ€™s salvation. If Jesus had forsaken his purpose then, all would have been lost."

3. "The shrinking from suffering belongs to the human personality of our Lord; but the prayer, save me from this hour, is not for deliverance from suffering, but for victory in the approaching trial."

### John Calvin:
1. "The death which he underwent must therefore have been full of horror, because he could not render satisfaction for us, without feeling, in his own experience, the dreadful judgment of God; and hence we come to know more fully the enormity of sin, for which the Heavenly Father exacted so dreadful a punishment from his only-begotten Son."
2. "And yet we ought to believe, that it was not in pretense, but in reality, that he feared; though he differed from other men in this respect, that he had all his feelings regulated in obedience to the righteousness of God."
3. "But it may be thought, that it is unbecoming in the Son of God rashly to utter a wish which he must immediately retract, in order to obey his Father. I readily admit, that this is the folly of the cross, which gives offense to proud men; but the more the Lord of glory humbled himself, so much the more illustrious is the manifestation of his vast love to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because this is the moment of highest exaltation in the contemplation of the universal triumph symbolized in the coming of the Greeks, it is also that when all the intensity of suffering by which the triumph is procured is most present to the mind of Jesus."
2. "And what shall I say? Not, What feelings shall I cherish at this hour, What mood of mind becomes the circumstances in which I am placed? but, How shall I find utterance for the emotions that now fill my heart?"
3. "The object of the hour of suffering is to bring triumph. We must not miss the emphasis on the word 'Father;' it is not simply Godâ€™s but the Fatherâ€™s glory that he desires."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:

2. "...the devil, and the furious and violent attack he knew he would make upon him..." 
3. "Shall I say, father, save me from this hour?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Now is my soul troubled â€” He had various foretastes of his passion."
2. "And what shall I say? â€” Not what shall I choose? For his heart was fixed in choosing the will of his Father: but he laboured for utterance."
3. "The two following clauses, Save me from this hour - For this cause I came - Into the world; for the sake of this hour (of suffering) seem to have glanced through his mind in one moment. But human language could not so express it."
