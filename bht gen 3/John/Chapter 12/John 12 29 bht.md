# John 12:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some heard words but did not apprehend their meaning, while others heard only a sound, like thunder or an angel's voice. The varying understanding of the voice seems to be tied to each person's inner relation to Christ. The crowd standing by only perceived a sound or an articulate but unintelligible voice, whereas Jesus understood His Father's voice. It is remarkable how the same message can be received so differently, with some hearing it clearly while others remain ignorant of its significance.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Some heard words, but did not apprehend their meaning."
2. "Others [heard] a sound, but no words."
3. "I should rather believe this difference to have been proportioned to each man‚Äôs inner relation to Christ, than fortuitous."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "some hearing only a sound, others an articulate, but to them unintelligible voice."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "It was the opinion of many of the Jews that God did not speak to men except by the ministry of angels."

### John Calvin:
1. "Some are so deaf, that they hear as a confused sound what God had distinctly pronounced."
2. "But many are as little affected by the doctrine, as if it only proceeded from a mortal man, and others consider the word of God to be confused and barbarous, as if it were nothing else than thunder."
3. "The greater part of men, while they hear God, do not hear him though he speak plainly and distinctly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That a real voice had been heard is obvious from the fact that the words are actually given by the Evangelist." 
2. "John‚Äôs object in stating this appears to be his desire to bring still more clearly out the mysterious nature of the voice."
3. "Jesus understood it. The Evangelist did so too. But ‚Äòthe multitude‚Äô felt only that God was there."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That it had thundered (Œ≤œÅŒøŒΩœÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ≥ŒµŒ≥ŒøŒΩŒµŒΩŒ±). Perfect active infinitive of Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒ± in indirect discourse after ŒµŒªŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩ and the accusative of general reference (Œ≤œÅŒøŒΩœÑŒ∑ŒΩ, thunder, as in Mark 3:17), 'that thunder came to pass.'"
2. "So the crowd 'standing by' (ŒµœÉœÑœâœÇ, second perfect active participle of ŒπœÉœÑŒ∑Œº), but Jesus understood his Father's voice."
3. "An angel hath spoken to him (ŒëŒ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ Œ±œÖœÑœâ ŒªŒµŒªŒ±ŒªŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ). Perfect active indicative of ŒªŒ±ŒªŒµœâ. So, when Jesus spoke to Saul on the way to Damascus, those with Saul heard the voice, but did not understand (Acts 9:7; Acts 22:9)."

### John Gill:
1. "Some took this for thunder, and others for the voice of an angel out of the thunder."
2. "Perceived it was an articulate voice, which expressed certain distinct words."
3. "The Jews had a mighty notion of the discourse and conversation of angels with men."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the most glorious revelations there may remain something obscure, to exercise our faith."
2. "Thunder did frequently attend a voice from heaven. Perhaps it did so now."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Some heard words, but did not apprehend their meaning. Others heard only a sound, but no words. It seemed that this difference in perception was not a matter of chance, but rather an indication of each individual‚Äôs inner connection to Christ. To some, it seemed like thunder, while others believed that an angel was speaking to Him. The crowd standing by could only hear a sound or an articulate, but unintelligible voice. Jesus, on the other hand, understood His Father's voice. It is intriguing how the same message could be received so differently by people, some hearing it clearly while others remained deaf to its meaning.
