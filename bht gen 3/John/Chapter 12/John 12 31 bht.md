## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the judgment of this world is not, as Chrysostom, Augustine, and others think, 'the deliverance of this world from the devil;'‚Äînor, 'decision concerning this world,' who is to possess it (Bengel):‚Äîbut judgment, properly so called, the work of the Spirit who was to come, on the world, of which it is said that 'the whole world lieth in wickedness (the wicked one)'"
2. "the prince of this world...the 'god of this world'"
3. "But after the death of Christ the casting out began, and its firstfruits were, the coming in of the Gentiles into the Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Now is the judgment of this world‚Äîthe world that 'crucified the Lord of glory,' considered as a vast and complicated kingdom of Satan, breathing his spirit, doing his work, and involved in his doom, which Christ's death by its hands irrevocably sealed." 
2. "How differently is that fast-approaching 'hour' regarded in the kingdoms of darkness and of light! 'The hour of relief; from the dread Troubler of our peace‚Äîhow near it is! Yet a little moment, and the day is ours!' So it was calculated and felt in the one region."
3. "'Now shall the prince of this world be cast out,' is a somewhat different view of the same event. We know who was right. Though yet under a veil, He sees the triumphs of the Cross in unclouded and transporting light."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now is the judgment of this world - Greek: 'crisis.' This expression, doubtless, has reference to his approaching death, and whatever he means by judgment here relates to something that was to be accomplished by that death."
2. "The death of Jesus was the determining cause, the grand crisis, the concentration of all that God had ever done, or ever will do, to break down the kingdom of Satan, and set up his power over man."
3. "His kingdom shall be destroyed; his empire shall come to an end. [...] then would be the crisis, the grand conflict in which he would be vanquished, and from that time his kingdom begin to decline, until it would finally cease, and then be free altogether from his dominion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The prince of this world." 
2. "Shall be cast out."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now is the judgment of this world. The Lord now, as if he had already succeeded in the contest, boasts of having obtained a victory not only over fear, but over death."
2. "the world must be restored to a proper order...the full restoration of the world."
3. "When Satan has been cast out, therefore, the world is brought back from its revolt, and placed under obedience to the government of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‚Äònow‚Äô is the ‚Äònow‚Äô of John 12:27, the ‚Äòhour‚Äô of John 12:23; and the primary thought to be taken into it is that of the suffering and death in the midst of which Jesus stood, and which in the purpose of God, and to the eye of faith, were so different from what they were to the eye of sense."
2. "‚ÄòThis world‚Äô culminates in its prince. The title meets us again in John 16:11, and, although with omission of the ‚Äòthis,‚Äô in chap. John 14:30. By it can only be understood Satan, whom, indeed, the Jews knew as the ‚Äòprince of the world‚Äô excluding Israel."
3. "But he ‚Äòshall be cast out,‚Äô that is, out of the world which he has ruled, so that ideally he shall have no more power in it. The expression ‚Äòcast out‚Äô is very remarkable when compared with its use in other parts of this Gospel (John 6:37, John 9:34-35). It is excommunication from a holy community, or scene, or synagogue, or world, which is, and is to be, God‚Äôs alone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The judgement (Œ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπœÇ). No article, 'A judgement.' The next few days will test this world."
2. "The prince of this world (Œø Œ±œÅœáœâŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖœÑŒøœÖ). This phrase here, descriptive of Satan as in possession of the evil world, occurs again in John 14:30; John 16:11."
3. "Shall be cast out (ŒµŒ∫Œ≤ŒªŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑œÉŒµœÑŒ± ŒµŒæœâ). Future passive of ŒµŒ∫Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒªœâ. Note ŒµŒæœâ, clean out. The Book of Revelation also proclaims final victory over Satan."

### John Gill:
1. "Now is the judgment of this world...in process of time wrath will come upon them, upon their nation, city, and temple, to the uttermost." 
2. "Now shall the prince of this world be cast out...he should be cast out of the empire of the world he had assumed, and out of the temples of the Gentiles, and out of the hearts of God's elect among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now ‚Äî This moment. And from this moment Christ thirsted more than ever, till his baptism was accomplished."
2. "Is the judgment of this world ‚Äî That is, now is the judgment given concerning it, whose it shall be."
3. "Now shall the prince of this world ‚Äî Satan, who had gained possession of it by sin and death, be cast out - That is, judged, condemned, cast out of his possession, and out of the bounds of Christ's kingdom."
