### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Signifying (ÏƒÎ·Î¼Î±Î¹Î½Ï‰Î½). Present active participle of ÏƒÎµÎ¼Î±Î¹Î½Ï‰, old verb to give a sign (ÏƒÎ·Î¼ÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½) as in Acts 25:27, and the whole phrase repeated in John 18:32 and nearly so in John 21:19."
2. "The indirect question here and in John 18:32 has the imperfect ÎµÎ¼ÎµÎ»Î»ÎµÎ½ with present infinitive rather than the usual present Î¼ÎµÎ»Î»Îµ retained while in John 21:19 the future indicative Î´Î¿Î¾Î±ÏƒÎµ occurs according to rule."
3. "The point in Ï€Î¿Î¹Ï‰ (qualitative relative in the instrumental case with Î¸Î±Î½Î±Ï„Ï‰) is the Cross (lifted up) as the kind of death before Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "These are the words of the evangelist, interpreting the design of Christ in the above words, thereby signifying what death he should die."
2. "The phrase of being lifted up from the earth, not only signified his death, but the kind, or manner of it, that it should be by crucifixion."
3. "A person crucified being stretched forth upon a cross, and that erected, was lifted up between earth and heaven."
