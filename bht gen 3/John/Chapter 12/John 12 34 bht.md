# John 12:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd, rooted in the belief that the Messiah would not die but reign eternally, misinterprets Jesus' statement about being lifted up as the Son of Man. Their misunderstanding stems from their limited understanding of the Scriptures and failure to see that Jesus is identifying Himself as the Christ, even though His reference to being lifted up implies a violent death. Their rejection and ignorance blind them to the truth, making it ironic that Jesus is rejected in the very role He often claimed for Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In such passages as Ps. lxxxix. 36, and perhaps cx. 4; Dan. vii. 13, 14. the law must be taken in its wider sense, as including the whole of the Old Testament." (Commentary)
2. "The actual words, the Son of man must be lifted up, had not been on this occasion used by Jesus; but in His discourse with Nicodemus, ch, iii. 14, and perhaps in other parts of His teaching which have not been recorded." (Commentary)
3. "They thought some other Son of Man, not the Messiah, was meant; because this lifting up (which they saw implied taking away) was inapplicable to their idea of the Messiah, usually known as the Son of Man." (Commentary)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We have heard out of the lawâ€”the scriptures of the Old Testament...that Christâ€”the Christ 'endureth for ever.'" 
2. "How can that consist with this 'uplifting?'"
3. "They saw very well both that He was holding Himself up as the Christ and a Christ to die a violent death..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That Christ - That the Messiah. Abideth for ever - Will remain forever, or will live forever."
2. "The doctrine of many of them certainly was that the Messiah would not die; that he would reign as a prince forever over the people."
3. "Who is this Son of man? - 'The Son of man we understand to be the Messiah spoken of by Daniel, who is to reign forever. To him, therefore, you cannot refer when you say that he must be lifted up, or must die.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Walk in conformity with the fact that you have the Light among you."
2. "Lest darkness overtake you not."
3. "On overtake see on taketh, Mark 9:18; and perceived, Acts 4:13."

### John Calvin:
1. "Their malice blinds them, so that they perceive nothing amidst the clearest light."
2. "The origin of their error was, that they judged of the splendor of Messiah's kingdom according to their carnal views."
3. "This shows how haughty their ignorance was; for it is as if they had said, 'Go now, and boast that thou art the Christ, since thine own confession proves that thou hast nothing to do with the Messiah.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The â€˜multitude,â€™ who are Jews not Greeks, have rightly understood the words of Jesus in John 12:32 to mean a lifting on high by death."
2. "The words are not an honest inquiry who this Son of man can be, and how he can be the Christ. They are really a rejection of the claims of Jesus."
3. "â€˜Son of manâ€™ had been the favourite designation by Jesus of Himself. How appropriate is it that, when finally rejected, He should be rejected in that character!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Out of the law... That is, 'out of the Scriptures.'"
2. "The Christ abideth forever... Perhaps from Psalms 89:4; Psalms 110:4; Isaiah 9:7; Ezekiel 37:25; Daniel 7:14."
3. "The crowd understand Jesus to be 'the Son of man' and take the phrase to be equivalent to 'the Christ.'"

### John Gill:
1. "we have heard out of the law; not the five books of Moses, but the Prophets, and Hagiographa; even all the books of the Old Testament are called the law."
2. "from whence it appears, that these passages were understood of the Messiah by the ancient Jews"
3. "The Jews have entertained a notion that Messiah the son of David shall not die, and they lay down this as a rule, that if anyone sets up for a Messiah, and does not prosper, but is slain, it is a plain case he is not the Messiah."

### John Wesley:
1. "He first dies, and then abideth for ever."
2. "How can these things be reconciled? Very easily."
3. "Is he the Christ? Psalm 110:4."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The crowd in John 12:34 is puzzled by Jesus' statement about being lifted up as the Son of Man. They interpret it as meaning that the Messiah, who they believe will reign forever, cannot die. Their misunderstanding arises from their limited view of the Old Testament Scriptures, in which the law refers to the whole of the Old Testament and contains prophecies that the Messiah would endure forever. The crowd fails to recognize that Jesus is indeed identifying Himself as the Christ, but a Christ who must die a violent death. Their ignorance and rejection of Jesus in His role as the Son of Man ultimately blinds them to the truth, highlighting the irony that Jesus, who frequently referred to Himself as the Son of Man, would be rejected in that very character.

Their rejection blinds them to the truth and serves as an ironic fulfillment of Jesus' self-identification as the Son of Man.
