# John 12:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews' unbelief fulfilled God's purposes, rather than setting them aside. The saying of Isaiah was not merely a fulfillment for the sake of it, but had a specific design. The few who believed in the Gospel report experienced the powerful grace of God, while others did not receive this revelation and continued in unbelief. This echoes the pattern of previous generations of Israel, who also rejected the message of the prophets.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "John does not mean that the prediction laid a necessity on the Jews; for Isaiah uttered nothing but what the Lord revealed to him from the secret treasures of his purpose."

The saying of Isaiah was not simply fulfilled for the sake of fulfillment, but rather to accomplish God's design. The few who believed the report of the Gospel regarding the Messiah experienced the powerful and efficacious grace of God. This grace was not universally bestowed, as not all received the revelation of the arm of the Lord, the power displayed by Christ's miracles and the work of redemption. Israel, like their fathers before them, continued in their unbelief and thus fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah.
