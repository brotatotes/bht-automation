# John 12:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reason why some people were unable to believe is because their eyes were blinded by God so that they could not see the truth. This divine act of blinding their eyes does not undermine their free will, but rather it is a result of their own willful choice to reject the truth. God knew beforehand that they would reject the truth, and thus fulfilled the prediction of Isaiah. It was morally impossible for them to believe because of the hardness of their hearts and their obstinate resistance to the truth. Even the miracles and teachings of Jesus could not persuade them to believe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
