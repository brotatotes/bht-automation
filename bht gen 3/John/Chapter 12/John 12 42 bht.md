- Attempt 1 BHT: Even among the rulers of the sects, such as Nicodemus and Joseph, there were those who believed in Jesus. However, they did not openly confess their faith for fear of being put out of the synagogue. These individuals preferred the praise of men over the praise of God, making excuses and displaying cowardice in their convictions. Their lack of boldness serves as a stark reminder for those today who hesitate to step out for Christ when under conviction.

This dynamic illustrates the universal struggle between godliness and ungodliness, where faith seeks refuge in a hostile world. It is a lesson for all who, fearing the hatred of men, conceal or dissemble their faith, for there is no excuse for this cowardice.
