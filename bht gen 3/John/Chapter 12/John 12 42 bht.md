# John 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief rulers in Jerusalem who believed in Jesus were afraid of the Pharisees and did not openly confess their faith because they did not want to be excommunicated from the synagogue. Their imperfect faith and preference for the praise of men over God's praise were similar to the cowardly excuses made by people today who refuse to step out for Christ. However, amidst the corrupt society of that time, it was truly remarkable that some remained untainted and held onto their faith.
