## BHT:
Many chose the admiration of others over God's approval, which displayed their lack of genuine faith. Their preference for human praise rather than the glory of God was displeasing to Him. This decision highlighted their speculative conviction of Jesus, rather than an active, self-denying belief. However, valuing the applause of men over God's judgment is foolish and even repugnant. They were unwilling to confess Christ, fearing the loss of their positions and the contempt of others, ultimately forsaking God's praise.
