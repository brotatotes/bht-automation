# John 12:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who reject Jesus and his teachings will face the consequences on the last day. The words they have rejected will become evidence and accusation against them, with no way to escape the judgment they bring. Jesus himself will bear witness and evaluate their conduct, revealing their attitude towards God's message. Rejecting Jesus will lead to condemnation, as the word they have rejected serves as both judge and declaration of guilt. Their acceptance or rejection of the Gospel here determines their judgment in the future.
