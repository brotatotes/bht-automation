### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In this passage, Mary spends a significant amount of money, three hundred pence, on anointing Jesus' feet. This sum would be worth about fifty dollars in today's money, or twice that based on purchasing power. The other disciples, particularly Judas, protest this seemingly extravagant act as a waste of money that could have been given to the poor. However, John specifically highlights Judas as the one who voices this concern. The commentators suggest that Judas uses the guise of caring for the poor to hide his true motives. They also emphasize that Mary's action does not warrant any excuse or apology, despite the large sum of money involved. Judas's discontent stems from the fact that the money was not handled by him, alluding to his own motives for greed. In recording these words, the Evangelist exposes the hypocrisy behind Judas's protest.
