# John 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The bag mentioned here, originally used for wind instrument reeds or as a money-chest, potentially served the purpose of carrying off or purloining. Remarkably, Judas, known for his avarice and dishonesty, was not only chosen as one of the Twelve but also trusted to handle their finances. The true character of Judas remained hidden from even the closest disciples of Jesus. Judas, having the bag, took away what was placed in it, not out of concern for the poor, but as a thief. This selection of Judas as a steward was akin to giving him the means to ruin himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word rendered bag originally signified a box in which to keep the reeds, or tongues, of wind instruments"
2. "Thus, generally, any kind of pouch, or money-chest."
3. "It seems hardly possible, with St. John's use of the same word in the original in ch. xx. 15 before us, altogether to deny that the sense of carrying off, i.e. purloining, may be here intended."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How worthy of notice is this arrangement, by which an avaricious and dishonest person was not only taken into the number of the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of their little property!"
2. "The purposes which this served are obvious enough."
3. "The remotest hint was never given to the eleven of His true character, nor did the disciples most favored with the intimacy of Jesus ever suspect him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word was also used for a coffin." 
2. "This meaning is rather imparted by the context than residing in the verb itself." 
3. "Render, therefore, as Rev., took away."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are taught by this instance what a frightful beast the desire of possessing is; the loss which Judas thinks that he has sustained, by the loss of an opportunity for stealing, excites him to such rage that he does not hesitate to betray Christ."
2. "He had but one reason, indeed, for betraying Christ; and that was, to regain in some way the prey which had been snatched from his hands; for it was the indignation excited in him, by the gain which he had lost, that drove him to the design of betraying Christ."
3. "It is wonderful that Christ should have chosen, as a steward, a person of this description, whom he knew to be a thief. For what else was it than to put into his hands a rope for strangling himself?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and, having the bag, bare away what was put therein."
2. "It is perhaps more than a coincidence that it is here chosen by John when he would speak of the small store of money possessed by Jesus (the True temple) and His disciples, money derived from the voluntary offerings of the few who had recognised His glory and consecrated their substance to the supply of His wants."
3. "It seems all but impossible that the word can have the neutral meaning here: partly because, after the mention of the .dishonesty of Judas, the statement that he carried that which was cast into the common chest would be a strange anti-climax; and partly because it would be difficult to see why John should write such a sentence as this, ‚Äòand, having the bag, carried what was put therein.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not because he cared for the poor (ŒøœÖœá ŒøœÑ œÄŒµœÅ œÑœâŒΩ œÄœÑœâœáœâŒΩ ŒµŒºŒµŒªŒµŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑœâ)." 
2. "But because he was a thief (Œ±ŒªŒªŒµ ŒøœÑ Œ∫ŒªŒµœÄœÑŒ∑œÇ Œ∑ŒΩ)." 
3. "And having the bag took away what was put therein (Œ∫Œ± œÑŒø Œ≥ŒªœâœÉœÉŒøŒ∫ŒøŒºŒøŒΩ ŒµœáœâŒΩ œÑŒ± Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒªŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒ± ŒµŒ≤Œ±œÉœÑŒ±Œ∂ŒµŒΩ)."

### John Gill:
1. "He had no affection for them, and was unconcerned about them, and took no care of them to feed and clothe them; he was no ways solicitous for their support, refreshment, and more comfortable living."
2. "He had the purse, into which was put whatsoever was ministered to Christ, for the common supply of him and his disciples, and for the relief of the poor."
3. "Judas had the care of, the keys of which were in his hands, and whatever were to be put into it, he bore, or carried thither."
