# John 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love to Christ transfigures humble services and endears the Savior when He endorses self-sacrificing love as the standard for judging character and deeds. Works of utility should not be set against self-sacrificing love, and sincerity is to be suspected in those who do so. Amidst conflicting duties, the duty at hand should be preferred, even if it seems less important. Jesus affirms the importance of giving to the poor, but also emphasizes the relativity of duties. Mary's act of love should be honored and respected.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  8.] See note on Mark, vv. 7, 8.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "Those persons, therefore, are apes, and not imitators, who are desirous to serve Christ by costly and splendid display."
2. "For as to his presence with us by the grace and power of his Spirit, his dwelling in us, and also feeding us with his flesh and blood, this has nothing to do with bodily observances."
