- Attempt 1 BHT: Knowing and understanding the duty of humility is one thing, but actually putting it into practice is much more difficult. Jesus reminds his disciples that they will be blessed if they not only know, but also do these things. This connection between knowledge and action is crucial, for true knowledge of Christ should lead to conformity with him. It is not enough to simply recognize and understand the teachings of Christ; one must actively apply them in their daily lives. Those who know and do the will of their Master will experience true happiness and communion with him, receiving the ultimate reward of entering into his joy. On the other hand, those who know, but do not act upon their knowledge, will experience unhappiness. Therefore, it is through the combination of knowledge and action that true blessedness is attained.
