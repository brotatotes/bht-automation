## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I rather believe that the saying sets forth the dignity of that office from which Judas was about to fall: q.d. â€˜not only was he in close intercourse with Me (ver, 18), but invested with an ambassadorship for Me, and in Me, for the Father; and yet he will lift up his heel against Me.â€™" (Commentary)
2. "And the consideration of this dignity in all its privileges, as contrasted with the sad announcement just to be made, leads on to the troubling of our Lordâ€™s spirit in the next verse." (Commentary)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Despite the dishonor done to Him by Judas, and similar treatment awaiting themselves, they were to be cheered by the assurance that their office, even as His own, was divine."
2. "The connection here seems to be that despite the dishonor done to Him by Judas, and similar treatment awaiting themselves, they were to be cheered by the assurance that their office, even as His own, was divine."
3. "The traitor indicatedâ€”He leaves the supper room."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They who received them received him, and they who received him received God."
2. "Judas, who was about to betray him, was also about to betray the cause of religion in the world, and to betray God and his cause."
3. "A man cannot do dishonor to one of the institutions of religion without injuring all; he cannot dishonor its ministers or the Saviour without dishonoring God."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is too good evidence that we are very ready to be wounded by bad examples; for, in consequence of this, the revolt of one man inflicts a deadly wound on two hundred others, while the steadiness of ten or twenty pious men hardly edifies a single individual."
2. "The reason is, we ought to contemplate God, the Author of the ministry, in whom, certainly, we find nothing which we have a right to despise; and next, we ought to contemplate Christ, who, having been appointed by the Father to be the only Teacher, speaks by his apostles."
3. "Whoever, then, does not deign to receive the ministers of the Gospel, rejects Christ in them, and rejects God in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me." 
2. "Men will thus divide themselves into two classes which will take up towards the apostles doing the work of Jesus the same position as that which the eleven on the one hand, and Judas on the other, had now taken up towards Jesus Himself."
3. "Therefore He humbles Himself anew. Laying aside His glory He takes up His cross, not that He may justify disciples who are already His, who are â€˜clean,â€™ but that He may bring them ever and again to Himself the source of all true spiritual nourishment, and may wash away any fresh stains of defilement which they have contracted in their work in the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Whomsoever I send (Î±Î½ Ï„Î¹Î½Î± Ï€ÎµÎ¼ÏˆÏ‰). More precisely, 'If I send any one'..." (quote 1)
2. "This use of Îµ Ï„Î¹Ï‚ or ÎµÎ±Î½ Ï„Î¹Ï‚ (if any one) is very much like the indefinite relative Î¿ÏƒÏ„Î¹Ï‚ and Î¿Ï‚ Î±Î½ (or ÎµÎ±Î½), but the idiom is different." (quote 2)
3. "In Mark 8:34 we have both Îµ Ï„Î¹Ï‚ Î¸ÎµÎ»Îµ and Î¿Ï‚ ÎµÎ±Î½ while in John 14:13 we find Î¿Ï„ Î±Î½ and ÎµÎ±Î½ Ï„..." (quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "He that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me; I have sent you in my name to preach the Gospel; you are my ambassadors, and you will be honourably received by many; and which I shall regard and take notice of, and esteem, as though they had received me."
2. "Even as my Father has sent me into this world, as a Saviour and Redeemer, a prophet, priest, and King; and as many as have received me, are looked upon by my Father, as having received him."
3. "Christ, as Mediator, represented his Father that sent him; and the ministers of Christ represent him; so that what is done to them, either in a way of reception or rejection, he takes as done to himself."

### John Wesley:
1. And I put my own honour upon you, my ambassadors. Matthew 10:40.
