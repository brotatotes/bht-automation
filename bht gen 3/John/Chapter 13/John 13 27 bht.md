### John Calvin:
1. "For as the saints make gradual progress, and in proportion to the new gifts by which they are continually enlarged, they are said to be filled with the Holy Spirit; so, in proportion as wicked men provoke the anger of God against themselves by their ingratitude, The Lord deprives them of his Spirit, of all light of reason, and, indeed, of all human feeling, and delivers them unreservedly to Satan."

2. "Judas may now be addressed as â€˜doing â€˜what he was to do. It was too late to expect any change. Mercy, grace, offered to the last, have been to the last rejected."
3. "Let him therefore not stay, as in all probability he would have wished to partake of the feast; let him be even more active than he is inclined to be; Jesus not only desires to be alone with His true disciples, but He is eager to take that last step which is now at hand; He is â€˜straitenedâ€™ until His â€˜baptism is accomplishedâ€™ (Luke 12:50)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
