# John 13:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the disciples wondered why Judas would go out at night to buy provisions for the feast, some supposed he might have been purchasing supplies for the poor to help them obtain their Paschal lamb. However, this speculation was based on their ignorance. The disciples expected to partake in the Paschal Supper with Jesus, indicating that the feast had not yet begun. While we cannot be certain, it is possible that Judas was fulfilling the duty of providing aid to the poor in accordance with the law during the Passover.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first supposition agrees with ver.1 â€” that it was 'before the feast of the passover.'"
2. "Had it been the night of the passover, the next day being hallowed as a sabbath, nothing could have been bought."
3. "The gift to the poor might be, to help them to procure their paschal lamb."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Had it been on the previous evening, no one would have thought of Judas going out at night to buy provisions for the feast, when there was the whole of the next day for it..." 
2. "The meal of which they had been partaking was the preliminary meal, at the close of which the Passover was celebrated; just as, subsequently, the Eucharist was celebrated at the close of the Agape, or love - feast."
3. "To the poor. Perhaps to help them procure their Paschal lamb."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is plain enough from other passages how great was Christ's poverty."
2. "Out of the little that he had, he gave something to the poor."
3. "The Apostles would not have conjectured that he had spoken about the poor, if it had not been their usual custom to relieve the poor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On the â€˜bagâ€™ here spoken of, see on John 12:6. The first supposition made, that Judas might have gone out to purchase things needed â€˜for the feast, â€™ is a proof that the feast itself had not begun, or was only beginning." 
2. "It is important to observe the word â€˜feast.â€™ It is that of John 13:1, and it shows that the disciples expected to partake of the Paschal Supper with Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "Another alternative in their speculation on the point."

### John Gill:
1. "Because Judas had the bag: which was for the common supply of Christ and his disciples, and for the relief of the poor." 
2. "That Jesus had said unto him, buy those things that we have need of against the feast; the feast of the passover, which was to be two days after; and shows, that this was not the passover which Christ now ate with his disciples." 
3. "Or that he should give something to the poor; for whom Christ cared, and had a hearty concern, and for whom Judas had very little, notwithstanding his high pretensions."
