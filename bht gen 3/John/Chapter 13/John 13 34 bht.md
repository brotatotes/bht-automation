# John 13:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This new commandment to love one another is not completely new in its nature, as it is of the same kind of love prescribed in the Old Testament. However, it is new in its form as the commandment of the new covenant. The newness lies in the fact that Christ's love for His people, demonstrated in giving His life as a ransom, became a model for their love towards one another. It is a call to imitate His love and to let His love be the measure of our love for one another.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "It is not, however, something transcending the great moral law, which is 'the old commandment,' but that law in a new and peculiar form."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is called new, not because there was no command before which required people to love their fellow-man, for one great precept of the law was that they should love their neighbor as themselves...but it was new because it had never before been made that by which any class or body of people had been known and distinguished."
2. "Here they were to feel that they were on a level, that they had common wants, were redeemed by the same sacred blood, and were going to the same heaven."
3. "This was a new expression of love; and it showed the strength of attachment which we ought to have for Christians, and how ready we should be to endure hardships, to encounter dangers, and to practice self-denial, to benefit those for whom the Son of God laid down his life."

3. "He holds out his own example, not because we can reach it, for we are at a vast distance behind him, but that we may, at least, aim at the same end."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The new commandment is love, such love as Jesus had Himself exhibited, and as had been His â€˜gloryâ€™ (John 13:31); and this love to one another they would need, that in an evil world they might be to one another sources of strength and comfort."
2. "By â€˜commandmentâ€™ is meant not a definite precept, but rather a sphere of life in which the disciples are to walk...Hence the first half of the verse is complete in itself; and the second half points out the ground upon which this love was to rest, and the means by which it was to be obtained."
3. "It was the very purpose of the love of Jesus that He might form a community all whose members, born again into His love, might love one another, â€˜Even as I loved you, that ye also may love one another.â€™ Out of Him is selfishness; in Him, and in Him alone, we love."

3. "The measure of our love for another is set by Christ's love for us."

### John Gill:
1. "Love one another: as brethren in the same family, children of the same Father, and fellow disciples with each other; by keeping and agreeing together, praying one for another, bearing one another's burdens, forbearing and forgiving one another, admonishing each other, and building up one another in faith and holiness."
2. "As Christ has loved his people freely, notwithstanding all their unworthiness and ungratefulness, so should they love one another, though there may be many things in them observable, which are disagreeable."
3. "As Christ loves all his children without any distinction, so should they love one another, whether poor or rich, weaker or stronger, lesser or greater believers; and as Christ loves them not in word only, but in deed and in truth, so should they love one another with a pure heart fervently, and by love serve one another."

1. "A new commandment â€” Not new in itself; but new in the school of Christ."
2. "For he had never before taught it them expressly."
3. "Likewise new, as to the degree of it, as I have loved you."

- Attempt 1 BHT: This verse introduces a new commandment to love one another, but it is not entirely new in the sense that it had never been commanded before. Rather, it is new in its simplicity and unicity, embodying the essential principle of the whole law. This new commandment of love is based on Christ's love for us, which was altogether new in the way He gave His life as a ransom. It is a love that goes beyond the boundaries of the old commandment to love our neighbor as ourselves. Jesus sets Himself as the model and standard for our love towards one another, and He desires us to imitate His love. In a world that is often hostile to our faith, this love for one another is meant to be a source of strength and comfort. It is not just a command, but a sphere of life in which we are to walk, united as a community born again into His love. As we aim for the same end of love, may we love one another as brethren in the same family, children of the same Father, and fellow disciples. Just as Christ loves us without distinction, in word and in deed, so should we love one another, regardless of our differences, with a pure heart fervently.
