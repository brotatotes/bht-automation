- Attempt 5 BHT: The purpose of displaying brotherly love is not for empty praise or worldly attention, but for the attraction and conversion of others to Christ. Despite the world's hatred towards believers, they themselves are included in the call to love one another, as brotherly love serves as a true sign of being children of God. It is through this love that all men, both inside and outside the circle of believers, will know that we are disciples of Christ. However, it is disheartening to see the lack of such love even within the Christian community. This love is not just a mere feeling, but a continuous and intentional choice to love and keep on loving. As disciples of Jesus, our mutual love should point to the truth that the Father sent Him. On the contrary, if we harbor hatred towards one another, it is clear evidence that we are not truly learners of Jesus. Therefore, let our love for one another not be a superficial display, but a deep, genuine, and tender affection that surpasses denominational boundaries and reflects the spirit and character of Christ Himself.
