## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He emphasizes the I and thou, but so as to set forth Himself as the Master, Peter as the disciple, not wholly cognizant of His will and purpose, and therefore more properly found in subjection to it."
2. "What I do...this washing itself, as a lesson of humility and love, its symbolical meaning, the great Act of Love, the laying aside My glory, and becoming in the form of a servant, that the washing of the Holy Spirit may cleanse men."
3. "Taking up again the numbers used in the last note, (1) was known very soon, but (2) and (3) not till after the Spirit was given."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such condescension does
	need explanation; it is fitted to astonish."
2. "afterwards, meaning presently; though viewed
	as a general maxim, applicable to all dark sayings in God's Word, and
	dark doings in God's providence, these words are full of consolation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was a symbolical action, inculcating a lesson of humility, and intended to teach it to them in such a manner that it would be impossible for them ever to forget it."
2. "He often afflicts us; he disappoints us; he frustrates our plans. Why it is we do not know now, but we yet shall learn that it was for our good, and designed to teach us some important lesson of humility and piety."
3. "We ought also, in view of this, to submit ourselves to him; to hush every murmur, and to believe that he does all things well. It is one evidence of piety when we are willing to receive affliction at the hand of God, the reason of which we cannot see, content with the belief that we may see it hereafter; or, even if we never do, still having so much confidence in God as to believe that what He does is right."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Knowest - shalt know. The A. V. ignores the distinction between the two words."

3. "Hereafter, literally, after these things."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought simply to obey Christ, even though we should not perceive the reason why he wishes this or that thing to be done."
2. "That man, therefore, is too haughty, who refuses to obey the command of God, because he does not know the reason of it."
3. "We should not take it ill to be ignorant of those things which God wishes to be hidden from us for a time; for this kind of ignorance is more learned than any other kind of knowledge, when we permit God to be wise above us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt learn hereafter."
2. "It is in the trying circumstances of the future...that Peter shall 'learn,' shall 'perceive,' the full meaning of what he at present feels to be so incomprehensible."
3. "He will not fully know what it is to have had his own feet washed by Jesus, until he shall have felt the need of constantly turning to Him in faith; and until, in the love ever renewed in the exercise of that faith, he too shall have washed the feet of others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus repeats the pronouns used by Peter in similar contrast."
2. "Just now Œ±œÅœÑ means (John 9:19; John 9:25)."
3. ""Thou shalt learn after these things," even if slowly."
