### John Calvin:
1. "The true wisdom of faith, therefore, is to approve and embrace with reverence whatever proceeds from God, as done with propriety and in good order; nor is there any other way, indeed, in which his name can be sanctified by us."
2. "If I wash thee not. This reply of Christ does not yet explain the reason why he resolved to wash the feet of his disciples; only by a comparison drawn from the soul to the body, he shows that, in washing the feet of his disciples, he does nothing that is unusual or inconsistent with his rank."
3. "As Christ is Lord and Master, Peter thinks it inconsistent that Christ should wash his feet. But the evil is that, in refusing such a service, he rejects the principal part of his own salvation."

2. "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."
3. "Unless Peter enters into the spirit of that self-sacrificing work of love which Jesus performs, makes that spirit his own spirit, sees the beauty and owns the glory of the Masterâ€™s becoming the servant for His peopleâ€™s sake, and becomes in like manner ready to sacrifice himself if he may thereby help the humblest member of the flock of Christ, then he is going his own way, not the way of Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter's sudden humility should settle the issue, he felt."
