### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "This necessity proved, at length, to be a sufficient instructor to tame him."

2. "The thought of the hands and the head as the uncovered parts of the body naturally occurs to him; and his reasoning is that, if the washing of one part will give him a deeper interest in the Master whom he loved, much more will this be effected by the washing of more parts than one." 
3. "To everything he will submit, so that it bring him nearer to Jesus and His reward."
