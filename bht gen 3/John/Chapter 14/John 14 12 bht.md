# John 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the ministry empowered by the Holy Spirit, the apostles could perform greater works than Jesus did in His earthly ministry. These works were not just remarkable miracles, but the wider scope of the apostolic ministry under the dispensation of the Spirit. It was under this new dispensation that a single believer or preacher, by bringing the Spirit into the heart, could do what Jesus Himself could not during His time on earth. This expansion was made possible by Jesus' departure and the sending of the Holy Spirit as the Paraclete.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is a general promise that greater works than he performed should be done by his followers, without specifying that all his followers would be instrumental in doing them."
2. "The most probable meaning of the passage is the following: The word 'greater' cannot refer to the miracles themselves, for the works of the apostles did not exceed those of Jesus in power. But, though not greater in themselves considered, yet they were greater in their effects."
3. "The word 'works' here probably denotes not merely miracles, but all things that the apostles did that made an impression on mankind, including their travels, their labors, their doctrine, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Greater works. Not more remarkable miracles, but referring to the wider work of the apostolic ministry under the dispensation of the Spirit."
2. "That which was done by St. Peter at Pentecost, by St. Paul all over the world, that which is effected by an ordinary preacher, a single believer, by bringing the Spirit into the heart, could not be done by Jesus during His sojourn in this world."
3. "Jesus' personal ministry in the flesh must be a local ministry. Only under the dispensation of the Spirit could it be universal."

### John Calvin:
1. "On this subject it is unnecessary to go to others for examples; for, when God has loaded us with every kind of blessings, if He pause for fourteen days, we fancy that he is no longer alive."
2. "First, we must understand what Christ means; namely, that the power by which he proves himself to be the Son of God, is so far from being confined to his bodily presence, that it must be clearly demonstrated by many and striking proofs, when he is absent."
3. "It is because, when he has entered into the possession of his kingdom, he will more fully demonstrate his power from heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were to be put into His position, to take His place, to be sustained in all inward strength and outward manifestation as He had been."
2. "Therefore what He had been and had done would be still more gloriously unfolded in them than it had been as yet in Him."
3. "They are the organs not of a humbled only but of an ascended Lord; and through what He is at the right hand of the Father they shall do 'greater works' than He did in the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall he do also (Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÇ œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÉŒµ). Emphatic pronoun ŒµŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÇ, 'that one also.'"
2. "Greater works than these (ŒºŒµŒπŒ∂ŒøŒΩŒ± œÑŒøœÖœÑœâŒΩ). Comparative adjective neuter plural from ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±œÇ with ablative case œÑŒøœÖœÑœâŒΩ. Not necessarily greater miracles and not greater spiritual works in quality, but greater in quantity."
3. "'Because I go' (ŒøœÑ ŒµŒ≥œâ œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒøœÅŒΩŒ±). Reason for this expansion made possible by the Holy Spirit as Paraclete (John 16:7)."

### John Gill:
1. "The conversion of a sinner is a greater work than any of the miracles of raising the dead, c. for this includes in it all miracles."
2. "Here we may see a sinner, dead in trespasses and sins, quickened; one born blind made to see; one who was deaf to the threatenings of the law, and to the charming voice of the Gospel, made to hear, so as to live; and one that had the spreading leprosy of sin all over him, cleansed from it by the blood of the Lamb."
3. "The conversion of a sinner, which is a miracle in grace, is not only an instance of the power of God, and of the greatness of it, but of the exceeding greatness of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The converting one sinner is a greater work than all these."
2. "Greater works than these shall he do."
3. "Because I go to my Father ‚Äì To send you the Holy Ghost."
