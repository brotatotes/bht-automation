# John 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The way of prayer is the way of loving obedience, in which the Spirit is ever found, and which is only trodden by His help. As the Father is honoured in the Son, so must the Son be honoured in you. The proper temple for the indwelling Spirit of Jesus is a heart filled with that love to Him which lives actively for Him. The Spirit is here promised as One who would supply Christ's own place in His absence. Keep my commandments as an expression of your love for Him.
