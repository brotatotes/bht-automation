# John 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, dwells in those receptive to God's truth while the worldly, driven by their own desires, cannot receive the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, a person and not just an influence, grants true knowledge, faith, hope, and love, making all virtues true. Believers have the privilege of deepening their understanding through the Spirit, who teaches and guides them into all truth. This is a remarkable act of mercy from God, as the Spirit is incomprehensible and remains unknown without dwelling within believers.

2. "He is a person, not a mere influence."
3. "The sinful world is helpless... It lacks spiritual insight and spiritual knowledge."

### John Gill:
1. "Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive... who leads men into the truths of the Gospel, confirms them in them, and gives boldness and freedom to own, and confess them before men."
2. "The world, and the men of it, can neither see him with their bodily eyes, because he is a 'spirit'; nor know him with their understandings, because he is the 'Spirit of truth', which they are ignorant of, for want of a spiritual discerning."
3. "But ye know him... as a spirit of illumination, regeneration, and conversion... as a Comforter, when I am gone from you; and as a spirit of truth to guide you into all truth, to stand by you, and assist you in preaching it, and to enable you to bear a faithful and glorious testimony for it."

### John Wesley:

3. "He shall be in you â€” As a constant guest. Your bodies and souls shall be temples of the Holy Ghost dwelling in you."
