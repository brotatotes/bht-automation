# John 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because Christ is the principle of Life, his disciples shall also have life, not just a physical existence, but a life filled with the Spirit, here and hereafter. The presence of the Spirit makes Christ's presence more blissful and effective than his bodily presence was before. His death and resurrection were mere shadows compared to his divine, unextinguishable life. By abiding in him, we are connected to this life and suffer for his name's sake. As his disciples, we behold him by faith, and because he lives, we too shall live eternally.
