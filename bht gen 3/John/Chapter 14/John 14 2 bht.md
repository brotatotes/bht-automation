## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The house spoken of is Heaven: Ps. xxxiii. 13, 14; Isa. lxiii. 15. In it are many (in numberâ€”it may be also in degree of dignity, but no such meaning is here conveyed) abiding-places; room enough for them all." 
2. "If they could not follow Him thither, He would not have concealed this from them. This latter assurance is one calculated to beget entire trust and confidence; He would not in any matter hold out vain hopes to them."
3. "This preparing a place for us is that of which we sing,â€” â€˜When Thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, Thon didst open the Kingdom of heaven to all believers.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "House [Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¹Î±]. The dwelling-place. Used primarily of the edifice... Of the family or all the persons inhabiting the house... Of property... Here meaning heaven." 
2. "Mansions [Î¼Î¿Î½Î±Î¹]. Only here and ver. 23... Thence, a staying or abiding-place; an abode. The word mansion has a similar etymology and follows the same course of development... Mansio is thus, first, a staying, and then a dwelling-place." 
3. "The image is derived from those vast oriental palaces, in which there is an abode not only for the sovereign and the heir to the throne, but also for all the sons of the king, however numerous they may be."

### John Calvin:

2. "Christ did not ascend to heaven in a private capacity, to dwell there alone, but rather that it might be the common inheritance of all the godly, and that in this way the Head might be united to his members."
3. "This place is said to be prepared for the day of the resurrection; for by nature mankind are banished from the kingdom of God, but the Son, who is the only heir of heaven, took possession of it in their name, that through him we may be permitted to enter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The universe, in short, is presented to us by our Lord as one 'house' over which the Father rules, having 'many' apartments, some on this side, others on the other side, the grave."
2. "When, therefore, Jesus 'goes away,' it is not to a strange land, it is only to another chamber of the one house of the Father: and thus 'many' is not to be understood in the sense of variety, of different degrees of happiness and glory provided for different persons."
3. "The main thought is that wherever Jesus is, wherever we are, we are all in the Father's house: surely such separation is no real separation."
