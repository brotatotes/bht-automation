## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "We never read of Iscariot that he entered in any way into his Master's words, or ever put a question even of rash curiosity."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He distinguishes the godly Judas, not by his own surname, but by the negation of the other's; marking at the same time the traitor as present again after his negotiation with the adversaries, but as having no sympathy with such a question." 
2. "How is it [Ï„Î¹ Î³ÎµÎ³ Î¿Î½ÎµÎ½] . Literally, what has come to pass. Implying that Judas thought that some change had taken place in Jesus ' plans." 
3. "He had assumed that Jesus would, as the Messiah, reveal Himself publicly."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not without reason that he asks why Christ does not cause his light to be imparted to more than a few persons; since he is the Sun of Righteousness, by whom the whole world ought to be enlightened; and, therefore, it is unreasonable that he should enlighten but a few, and not shed his light everywhere without distinction."
2. "Christâ€™s reply does not solve the whole question; for it makes no mention of the first cause, why Christ â€˜manifested himself to a few,â€™ conceals himself from the greater part of men; for certainly he finds all men at first alike, that is, entirely alienated from him."
3. "By these words, Christ shows in what manner the Gospel is properly obeyed. It is, when our services and outward actions proceed from the love of Christ; for in vain do the arms, and the feet, and the whole body toil, if the love of God does not reign in the heart, to govern the outward members."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His error consists in not seeing that the spiritual can only be apprehended by the spiritual."
2. "Filled with the thought of the external kingdom, he cannot understand why the glorious revelation of Christ to be made to himself and his fellow-disciples should not be male to all."
3. "so that all may believe and be blessed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not Iscariot...but John is anxious to make it clear that this Judas...was not the infamous traitor." 
2. "He is also called Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus...and the brother (or son) of James."
3. "Judas caught at the word...as perhaps a Messianic theophany visible to all the world as at the judgment...He seems to suspect a change of plan on the part of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "What is the meaning of it? How can it be? Or what is the reason of it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?" 
2. "He wonders that he should talk of the manifestation of himself, only to some."
3. "The question is put by him with admiration and astonishment; and as not being able to give, or think of any other reason of such a procedure, but the amazing grace of Christ, his free favour and sovereign will and pleasure."
