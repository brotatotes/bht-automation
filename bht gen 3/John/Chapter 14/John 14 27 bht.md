# John 14:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus distinguishes His peace, true peace, from the empty peace offered by the world. This peace is His bequest, a parting word of richest import. It is not an empty formula but the shalom of the orient, the peace that only Christ can give. It is a true, solid, and substantial peace that carries His people through all the difficulties of life. Let us be satisfied with this peace, not giving a loose reign to the flesh, but relying on the constant, even tranquillity it provides.
