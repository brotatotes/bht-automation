## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The going of Jesus to the Father is an advancement."
2. "The inferiority here is not to be understood as meaning, according to His human nature; for the words point to an inferiority which would be laid aside, on His going to the Father."
3. "That there is a sense in which the Father is greater than even the glorified Son, is beyond doubt, but as on the one hand that concession is no concession to Arianism, because it is not in the essential being of the Son, but in His Mediatorial office, that this His inferiority consists."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father, for my Father is greater than I‚ÄîThese words, which Arians and Socinians perpetually quote as triumphant evidence against the proper Divinity of Christ, really yield no intelligible sense on their principles."
2. "Does not this strange speech from Christ's lips, then, presuppose such teaching on His part as would make it extremely difficult for them to think He could gain anything by departing to the Father, and make it necessary for Him to say expressly that there was a sense in which He could do so?"
3. "Thus, this startling explanation seems plainly intended to correct such misapprehensions as might arise from the emphatic and reiterated teaching of His proper equality with the Father‚Äîas if so Exalted a Person were incapable of any accession by transition from this dismal scene to a cloudless heaven and the very bosom of the Father‚Äîand by assuring them that this was not the case, to make them forget their own sorrow in His approaching joy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If you had the highest views of my character and work; if you would lay aside your Jewish prejudices, and put entire, implicit confidence in what I say."
2. "You would rejoice in the completion of the plan which requires me to return to heaven, that greater blessings may descend on you by the influences of the Holy Spirit."
3. "In the plan of salvation the Father is represented as giving the Son, the Holy Spirit, and the various blessings of the gospel. As the Appointer, the Giver, the Originator, he may be represented as in office superior to the Son and the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I said. Omit, and read, ye would have rejoiced because I go unto the Father.


### John Calvin:
1. "If they had loved him spiritually, there was nothing which they would have had more deeply at heart, than his return to the Father."
2. "Christ does not now speak either of his human nature, or of his eternal Divinity, but, accommodating himself to our weakness, places himself between God and us."
3. "Let us therefore learn to behold Christ humbled in the flesh, so that he may conduct us to the fountain of a blessed immortality."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‚Äògoing away‚Äô of Jesus is really a ‚Äògoing unto the Father,‚Äô a re-establishment in all the glory of the Father‚Äôs immediate presence."
2. "The Son, while of the same nature as the Father, is subordinate to Him, inferior economically, as Mediator."
3. "The departure of Jesus to His Father was an arrangement fraught with far higher blessings, both to His believing people and to the world, than His remaining among them would have been."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If ye loved me (Œµ Œ∑Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ±œÑŒµ ŒºŒµ). Second-class condition with the imperfect active of Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ±œâ referring to present time, implying that the disciples are not loving Jesus as they should."
2. "Ye would have rejoiced (ŒµœáŒ±œÅŒ∑œÑŒµ Œ±ŒΩ). Second aorist passive indicative of œáŒ±ŒπœÅœâ with Œ±ŒΩ, conclusion of second-class condition referring to past time, 'Ye would already have rejoiced before this' at Christ's going to the Father (verse John 14:12)."
3. "Greater than I (ŒºŒµŒπŒ∂œâŒΩ ŒºŒøœÖ). Ablative case ŒºŒøœÖ after the comparative ŒºŒµŒπŒ∂œâŒΩ (from positive ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±œÇ). The filial relation makes this necessary. Not a distinction in nature or essence (cf. John 10:30), but in rank in the Trinity. No Arianism or Unitarianism here. The very explanation here is proof of the deity of the Son (Dods)."

### John Gill:
1. "Had he only said to them that he should go away, without giving any hint of his coming again, they might well have been uneasy; what made the friends of the Apostle Paul so sorrowful at his departure, was most of all, because he had signified to them they should see his face no more; but Christ assured his disciples that in a little time they should see him again, to their unspeakable joy and comfort."
2. "but this was not a pure expression of love to him, it showed too much a regard to themselves, than to the object loved; whereas had they considered things aright, since it was to his greater advantage to remove, they should rather have discovered a willingness to it, and have rejoiced at it; this would have shown pure love and unbiased affection to him"
3. "the Son is equal to the Father, having the self-same essence, perfections, and glory: nor with respect to personality, the Son is equally a divine person, as the Father is, though the one is usually called the first, the other the second person; yet this priority is not of nature, which is the same in both; nor of time, for the one did not exist before the other; nor of causality, for the Father is not the cause of the Son's existence; nor of dignity, for the one has not any excellency which is wanting in the other; but of order and manner of operation"

### John Wesley:
1. God the Father is greater than I ‚Äî As he was man. As God, neither is greater nor less than the other.
