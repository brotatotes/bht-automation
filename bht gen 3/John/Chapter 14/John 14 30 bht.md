### John Gill:
1. "The reason why Christ chooses to use this circumlocution, rather than to say Satan or the devil cometh, is partly to point out what a powerful adversary he had, and was about to engage with, and partly to observe to his disciples, what they must expect from the world, even hatred and persecution."
2. "Christ had no sin in him, which can be said of none but him... though he had sin upon him, he had none in him; hence, though he the Messiah was 'cut off,' according to Daniel 9:26, 'but not for himself'; which by the Septuagint is rendered Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∫œÅŒπŒºŒ± ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ ŒµŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑœâ, 'but there is no judgment' or 'condemnation in him,' i.e. no cause of condemnation."
3. "So that the devil had no power over him, no rightful power, nor any but what he had by permission, nor indeed did he prevail over him; for though according to the first prophecy of the Messiah, Satan bruised the heel of Christ; yet Christ bruised his head, destroyed him and his works, spoiled him, and his principalities and powers."
