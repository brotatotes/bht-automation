# John 14:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus proclaims Himself as the way - the path we must walk in union with Him. He is the truth - through Him, we gain eternal life and knowledge of God. He is the life - only by being united with Him do we come to the living Father. These statements are profound, overwhelming even, but if Christ is truly the Incarnate Son of God, they are undeniably true. He is the only way to God, and any deviation from Him leads only to astray and emptiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is THE WAY; not merely the Forerunner...but the way, in and on which we must go, having an inner union with and in Him."
2. "Christ IS THE TRUTH, in Whom only...that Knowledge of Him is gained, which is eternal life."
3. "the life...of all His in Whom only they who live can come to the living Father."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By this is meant, doubtless, that they and all others were to have access to God only by obeying the instructions, imitating the example, and depending on the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "The life, the purity, and the teaching of Jesus Christ was the most complete and perfect representation of the things of the eternal world that has been or can be presented to man."
3. "No man can obtain any of these things except by the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Therefore, with loving condescension the figure is taken up, and they are assured that He is Himself, if we may so speak, this distance to be traversed."
2. "He embodies what men ought to know and believe of God; what they should do as children of God, and what they should be."
3. "I am the way which thou shouldst pursue; the truth which thou shouldst believe; the life which thou shouldst hope for."

### John Calvin:
1. "The way, the truth, and the life. He lays down three degrees, as if he had said, that he is the beginning, and the middle, and the end; and hence it follows that we ought to begin with him, to continue in him, and to end in him."
2. "As Christ is the way, the weak and ignorant have no reason to complain that they are forsaken by him; and as he is the truth and the life, he has in himself also what is fitted to satisfy the most perfect."
3. "If any man turn aside from Christ, he will do nothing but go astray; if any man do not rest on him, he will feed elsewhere on nothing but wind and vanity; if any man, not satisfied with him alone, wishes to go farther, he will find death instead of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father but through me." (John 14:6) 
2. "Jesus adds these two designations of Himself to the first, because they express the contents, the substance, of that in which the â€˜wayâ€™ consists." 
3. "In the present â€˜wayâ€™ we have present â€˜truthâ€™ and present â€˜life;â€™ and each fresh appropriation of the truth deepens that communion by which the life is conditioned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either of these statements is profound enough to stagger any one, but here all three together overwhelm Thomas."
2. "He is the way to God and the only way."
3. "If he is really the Incarnate Son of God, they are necessarily true."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is not merely the way, as he goes before his people as an example; or merely as a prophet, pointing out unto them by his doctrine the way of salvation; but he is the way of salvation itself by his obedience and sacrifice; nor is there any other."
2. "He is the way to all the blessings of the covenant of grace; and he is the right way into a Gospel church state here; no one comes rightly into a church of Christ but by faith in him; and he is the way to heaven."
3. "Christ is the only way of access unto the Father; there is no coming to God as an absolute God, not upon the foot of the covenant of works, nor without a Mediator; and the only Mediator between God and man is Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. To the question concerning the way, he answers, I am the way. To the question concerning knowledge, he answers, I am the truth. To the question whither, I am the life. The first is treated of in this verse; the second, John 14:7-17; the third, 14:18, etc.
