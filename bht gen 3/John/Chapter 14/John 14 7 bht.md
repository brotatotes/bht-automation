# John 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the moment of His glorification, Jesus begins to reveal the Father in a way that the disciples had not grasped before. Through successive revelations, they are beginning to understand the profound connection between knowing Christ and knowing the Father. Their previous knowledge of God was incomplete; they had not fully acknowledged the vivid image of the Father exhibited in Jesus. As they gain a deeper knowledge of the Son, the veil obscuring their understanding of the true knowledge of God lifts, allowing them to possess the highest knowledge of all.

1.

2. "Each stage of â€˜knowingâ€™ is but the beginning of a new stage of â€˜learning to knowâ€™ more; â€˜forgetting the things that are behind,â€™ we start ever afresh towards a knowledge of â€˜the Father,â€™ always increasing but never consummated."
3. "This knowledge, this sight, the disciples have â€˜from henceforth.â€™ The point of time is not Pentecost anticipated. It dates from the great â€˜Nowâ€™ of chap. John 13:31, and the explanation is to be found in the peculiar circumstances in which the disciples have been placed since then."
