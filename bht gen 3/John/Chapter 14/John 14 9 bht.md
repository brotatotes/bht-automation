### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In John 14:9, Jesus declares that he is the only true representation of the Father to mankind and that seeing him is not just perceiving his physical presence, but truly knowing him. He questions Philip by saying, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not learned to know me? The knowledge of Jesus is equivalent to knowing the Father, as Jesus asserts, he that hath seen me hath seen the Father. By requesting to see the Father, Philip reveals his lack of understanding. Similarly, those who seek to find God through anything other than Christ alone, fail to grasp the true essence of the Gospel and hinder their spiritual growth.

- Attempt 5 BHT: The Son is the only Exponent of the Father to men, and knowing Him involves more than just seeing His bodily presence. It is a deep, intimate knowledge that comes from being in His presence for a long time. So, when Jesus tells Philip, who has been with Him for so long, that anyone who has seen Him has seen the Father, He is not speaking of their personal relationship as Father and Son, but of the revelation of God as Father through the Son. It is a rebuke to Philip's limited understanding and a reminder that to know Christ is to know the Father.
