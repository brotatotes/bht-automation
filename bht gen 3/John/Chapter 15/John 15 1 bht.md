## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Vine and branches stand in a much nearer connexion than the Shepherd and the sheep, or the lord of the vineyard and the vines; and answer to the Head and members in Eph. v. 23, 30; Col. ii. 19, linked together by a common organization, and informed by one and the same life."
2. "The TRUE vine] not only, ‚Äòthe vine by which prophecy is fulfilled:‚Äô not only, ‚Äòthe vine in which the organism and qualities of the vine are most nobly realized,‚Äô but, as in ch. i. 9, the true, i.e. the original, or archetypal: that which served for the pattern of all such afterwards."
3. "the husbandman] Not only the tiller of the land, but the vine-planter and dresser; He who has originated the relation between the vine and branches by planting the Vine in this earth (the nature of man), and who looks for and ensures the bringing forth of fruit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The spiritual oneness of Christ and His people, and His relation to them as the Source of all their spiritual life and fruitfulness, are here beautifully set forth by a figure familiar to Jewish ears."
2. "I am the true vine‚Äîof whom the vine of nature is but a shadow."
3. "My Father is the husbandman‚Äîthe great Proprietor of the vineyard, the Lord of the spiritual kingdom. (It is surely unnecessary to point out the claim to supreme divinity involved in this)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The point of the comparison or the meaning of the figure is this: A vine yields proper juice and nourishment to all the branches, whether these are large or small. All the nourishment of each branch and tendril passes through the main stalk, or the vine, that springs from the earth. So Jesus is the source of all real strength and grace to his disciples."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "True, genuine, answering to the perfect ideal."
2. "The vine was a symbol of the ancient church."
3. "The office of the vine-dresser is a subordinate one, while gewrgov may indicate the proprietor."

### John Calvin:
1. "I am the true Vine. The general meaning of this comparison is, that we are, by nature, barren and dry, except in so far as we have been engrafted into Christ, and draw from him a power which is new, and which does not proceed from ourselves."
2. "There is scarcely any one who is ashamed to acknowledge that everything good which he possesses comes from God; but, after making this acknowledgment, they imagine that universal grace has been given to them, as if it had been implanted in them by nature."
3. "He removes the unfruitful branches, that they may be thrown into the fire and burned. [...] So then, the Father is the first Author of all blessings, who plants us with his hand; but the commencement of life is in Christ, since we begin to take root in him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus, therefore, is here the ‚Äòtrue vine,‚Äô because He is the true Israel of God."
2. "In Him all His people are summed up. He is not merely the stem: He is ‚Äòthe vine,‚Äô including in Himself all its parts."
3. "That Theocracy had been no more than a shadow of the true; now the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô was come, and God Himself had planted it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The vine the genuine." 
2. "Jesus uses various metaphors to illustrate himself and his work."
3. "Jesus is the genuine Messianic vine."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the 'true' vine; not that he is really and literally so, without a figure; but he is, as the Syriac renders it, ◊†◊§◊™◊ê ◊ì◊©◊®◊®◊ê, 'the vine of truth'." 
2. "Christ is the noble vine, the most excellent of vines, wholly a right seed, in opposition to, and distinction from, the wild and unfruitful, or degenerate plant of a strange vine."
3. "He was the husbandman to him; he planted the vine of his human nature, and filled it with all the graces of the Spirit; he supported it, upheld it, and made it strong for himself."
