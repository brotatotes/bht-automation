## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Further proof of His love, in his choosing His, when they had not chosen Him."
2. "The fruit is not the Church, to be founded by the Apostles, and endure;â€”this is evident, for here the fruit is spoken of with reference to themselves, and their ripening into the full stature of Christ."
3. "The bringing forth of fruit and the obtaining answer to prayer, being co-ordinate with each other; but the bearing fruit to Godâ€™s glory is of these the greater, being the result and aim of the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye have not chosen me, but I . . . youâ€”a wholesale memento after the lofty things He had just said about their mutual indwelling, and the unreservedness of the friendship they had been admitted to."
2. "you, that ye should go and bring forth fruitâ€”that is, give yourselves to it."
3. "and that your fruit should remainâ€”showing itself to be an imperishable and ever growing principle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not that by nature they were more inclined than others to seek God, or that they had any native goodness to recommend them to him, but it was because he graciously inclined them by his Holy Spirit to seek him... whatever Christians, then, possess, they owe to God, and by the most tender and sacred ties they are bound to be his followers."
2. "It is not to be idle, or useless, or simply to seek enjoyment. It is to do good, and to spread as far as possible the rich temporal and spiritual blessings which the gospel is fitted to confer on mankind."
3. "The Christian, and especially the Christian minister, is devoted to the Saviour for life. He is to toil without intermission, and without being weary of his work, until God shall call him home."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It was not ye that chose me."
2. "Ordain is from the Latin ordinare, and means to set in order."
3. "He has appointed them that they should bring forth fruit, and that they should obtain such answers to their prayer as would make them fruitful."

### John Calvin:
1. "The greater our obligations to the Lord, the more earnest ought we to be in performing the duties which he demands from us; otherwise it will be impossible for us to avoid the charge of base ingratitude."
2. "Hence it appears that there is nothing which ought more powerfully to kindle in us the desire of a holy and religious life, than when we acknowledge that we owe everything to God, and that we have nothing that is our own."
3. "This promise of Christ, therefore, arouses us to call upon God; for whoever acknowledges that the success of his work depends on God alone, will offer his labor to him with fear and trembling."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He had 'chosen' them a choice having here nothing to do with eternal predestination, but only with choosing them out of the world after they were in it."
2. "They were to 'go away;' that is, they had a departure to make as well as He. This can be nothing else but their going out into the world to take His place, to produce fruit to the glory of the Father, and to return with that fruit to their Father's house."
3. "The fulness included in the words is dependent in each case on the amount of need to be supplied. Jesus chooses out His disciples for work first, for correspondingly higher privilege afterwards; and those who faithfully bear fruit are here assured that in this sphere of fruit-bearing with all its difficulties, and temptations, and trials, they shall want nothing to impart courage, boldness, hope, to make them overcome the world, as He Himself overcame it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus recognizes his own responsibility in the choice after a night of prayer."
2. "Note three present active subjunctives with Î¹Î½Î± (purpose clause) to emphasize continuance, not a mere spurt, but permanent growth and fruit-bearing."
3. "He may give... for the same purpose and promise."

### John Gill:
1. "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you... His choice of them was entirely free, did not arise from any character, motive, or condition in them."
2. "This may be understood both of election to salvation, and of choice to the office of apostleship...he first chose and called them to be his disciples and apostles."
3. "That whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you... they might assure themselves of it; for be it what it would they should ask of his Father, making mention of his name and righteousness, it should be given them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye â€” My apostles, have not chosen me, but I have chosen you." 
2. "I have chosen and appointed you for this end, that ye may go and convert sinners." 
3. "The consequence of your going and bearing fruit will be, that all your prayers will be heard."
