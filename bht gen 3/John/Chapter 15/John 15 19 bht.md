# John 15:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The world's hatred towards Christians is a testament that they have been chosen by God and are not a part of the world anymore. Unlike the self-centered love of the world that only extends to those who are similar, Christians, being distinct from the world, become objects of its hatred. Their presence exposes the world's sinful works. This animosity is an indication that Christians are no longer aligned with the values and principles of the world, as they have been transformed through a new birth.
