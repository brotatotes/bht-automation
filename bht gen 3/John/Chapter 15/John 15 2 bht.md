## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Vine contains fruitful and unfruitful branches."
2. "Every such unfruitful branch the Father pulls off and casts away."
3. "Every one that beareth fruit He prunes, by cleansing it of its worthless parts, and shortening its rank growth, that it may ripen and enlarge its fruit better."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The disciples of Christ may be spiritually fruitful or the reverse, according as they are vitally and spiritually connected with Christ, or but externally and mechanically attached to Him."
2. "The fruitless He 'taketh away'; the fruitful He 'purgeth' (cleanseth, pruneth)‚Äîstripping it, as the husbandman does, of what is rank, 'that it may bring forth more fruit'."
3. "A process often painful, but no less needful and beneficial than in the natural husbandry."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus here says that he sustains the same relation to his disciples that a parent stalk does to the branches; but this does not denote any physical or incomprehensible union."
2. "He takes away that which hindered their usefulness; teaches them; quickens them; revives them; makes them more pure in motive and in life."
3. "So God often takes away the property of his people, their children, or other idols. He removes the objects which bind their affections, and which render them inactive."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Branch [Œ∫ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±] . Occurring only in this chapter. Both this and kladov, branch (see on Matthew 24:32; Mark 11:8) are derived from klaw, to break. The word emphasizes the ideas of tenderness and flexibility."
2. "Purgeth [Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±ŒπœÅŒµŒπ] . Cleanseth, Rev."

### John Calvin:
3. "Christ intends by these words to awaken anxious inquiry, by declaring that all the branches which shall be unfruitful will be cut off from the vine."
4. "Believers need incessant culture that they may be prevented from degenerating; and that they produce nothing good, unless God continually apply his hand."
5. "He shows what ought to be the progress of believers in the course of true religion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Any branch of the vine that is found, and as soon as it is found, to be not fruit-bearing is cut off."
2. "The object of the Father is the inward, spiritual, cleansing of His children, in contrast with the outward purifications of Israel."
3. "The attaining of this perfection is, however, a gradual process, and hence the words 'that it may bear more fruit'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fruitless (not bearing fruit, ŒºŒ∑ œÜŒµœÅŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄŒøŒΩ) the vine-dresser 'takes away' (Œ±ŒπœÅŒµ) or prunes away. Probably (Bernard) Jesus here refers to Judas."
2. "Cleanseth (Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±ŒπœÅŒµ). Present active indicative of old verb Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±ŒπœÅœâ (clean) as in verse John 15:3, only use in N.T., common in the inscriptions for ceremonial cleansing."
3. "That it may bear more fruit (ŒπŒΩŒ± Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄŒøŒΩ œÄŒªŒµŒπŒøŒΩŒ± œÜŒµœÅŒ∑). Purpose clause with ŒπŒΩŒ± and present active subjunctive of œÜŒµœÅœâ, 'that it may keep on bearing more fruit' (more and more). A good test for modern Christians and church members."

### John Gill:
1. "There are two sorts of branches in Christ the vine; the one sort are such who have only an historical faith in him, believe but for a time, and are removed..."
2. "These branches are unfruitful ones; what fruit they seemed to have, withers away, and proves not to be genuine fruit..."
3. "These are the other sort of branches, who are truly and savingly in Christ; such as are rooted in him; to whom he is the green fir tree, from whom all their fruit is found..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every one that beareth fruit, he purifieth...So purity and fruitfulness help each other."
2. "For this is one of the noblest rewards God can bestow on former acts of obedience, to make us yet more holy."
3. "Fit for farther and more eminent service."
