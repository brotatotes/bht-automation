# John 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In rejecting Christ, one also rejects the Father, as Christ is the sole embodiment of God to His creation. The weight of sin becomes evident in this rejection, brought about by the revelation that Christ's presence has provided. Dishonoring Christ is tantamount to dishonoring God Himself. Hatred towards Christ implies a corresponding hatred towards the Father, for the two are inseparable. However, followers of Christ can find solace and endure the world's animosity, as it serves as affirmation of their steadfast devotion to God.
