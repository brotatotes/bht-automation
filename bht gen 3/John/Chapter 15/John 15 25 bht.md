# John 15:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews' gratuitous and deep-seated hatred towards Jesus, the promised Messiah, fulfilled God's purpose. Their pride in the law that condemned them blinded them to truth, making them deserving of condemnation. They followed in their fathers' footsteps, who hated David without reason. This sin of hating without cause is considered heinous and equated to grave transgressions. It serves as a reminder that to hate without cause is a serious offense, patiently endured for God's purpose.
