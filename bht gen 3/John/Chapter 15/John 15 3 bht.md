## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word of Christ dwelling in them by Faith... is the purifying principle." 
2. "But the word clean here is not to be taken as equivalent to cleansed, or pruned, in the sense of ver. 2. The ad-verb now or already limits it to their present capacities and standing."
3. "There was more pruning at hand... and this future handling of the husbandman is indicated by the command, 'Abide in me.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Already in a purified, fruitful condition, in consequence of the long action upon them of that searching 'word'." 
2. "By reason of the word I have spoken to you."
3. "As a refiner's fire."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now ye are clean - Still keeping up the figure Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅŒøŒπÃÅ katharoi. It does not mean that they were perfect, but that they had been under a process of purifying by his instructions all the time he had been with them."
2. "He had removed their erroneous notions of the Messiah; he had gradually reclaimed them from their fond and foolish views respecting earthly honors; he had taught them to be willing to forsake all things; and he had so trained and disciplined them..."
3. "By means of the teachings of Jesus while he had been with them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Clean [Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±ŒπœÅŒµŒπ] . Etymologically akin to kaqairei, purgeth. The Rev. indicates this by rendering kaqairei, cleanseth.


### John Calvin:
1. "He points out the means of pruning, namely, doctrine; and there can be no doubt that he speaks of outward preaching, for he expressly mentions the word, which they had heard from his mouth."
2. "Not that the word proceeding from the mouth of a man has so great efficacy, but, so far as Christ works in the heart by the Spirit, the word itself is the instrument of cleansing."
3. "Yet Christ does not mean that the apostles are pure from all sin, but he holds out to them their experience, that they may learn from it that the continuance of grace is absolutely necessary."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Already are ye clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you."
2. "They were pruned, they were 'clean;' and that 'already,' because they had already received the word which they were now, in their turn, to communicate."
3. "Not personal piety but Christian action is still in view, and still the 'cleanness' which they possess does not exclude the future and continuous cleansing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Already ye are clean (Œ∑Œ¥Œ∑ œÖŒºŒµŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅŒø ŒµœÉœÑŒµ). Potentially cleansed (Westcott) as in John 13:10 which see and John 17:19. 


### John Gill:
1. "Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you." (John 15:3)
2. "Christ could say of them all, that they were clean: which may be understood of their regeneration and sanctification, in which their hearts were sprinkled with clean water; were washed with the washing of regeneration; had their hearts purified by faith in the blood of Christ, and had pure principles of grace formed in their souls."
3. "Of all which the Gospel of Christ was the instrumental means: or of their justification by the righteousness of Christ, by which they were justified from all sin; and were all fair, and without spot; which was through the Gospel of Christ revealing his righteousness to them, or through the sentence of justification he, by his Spirit, passed upon their consciences."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye are clean ‚Äî All of you, to whom I now speak, are purged from the guilt and power of sin..."
