## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Take care that ye abide in Me and I in you: both these being necessary to the bringing forth fruit." 
2. "The branch cannot sever itself from the vine: but, such a case supposed, every one will see the inevitable consequence."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Abide in me - Remain united to me by a living faith. Live a life of dependence on me, and obey my doctrines, imitate my example, and constantly exercise faith in me."
2. "If the branch should be cut off an instant, it would die and be fruitless. As long as it is in the vine, 'from the nature of the case,' the parent stock imparts its juices, and furnishes a constant circulation of sap adapted to the growth and fruitfulness of the branch."
3. "While we are united to him by a living faith, from the nature of the case, strength flows from him to us, and we receive help as we need. Piety then, manifested in good works, in love, and self-denial, is as natural, as easy, as unconstrained, and as lovely as the vine covered with fruitful branches is at once useful and enticing."

3. "Abide in me, says he; for I am ready to abide in you And again, He who abideth in me beareth much fruit. By these words he declares that all who have a living root in him are fruit-bearing branches."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me." 
2. "Thus cleansed, one thing more is required, that they maintain their position, that they continue in the vine."
