# John 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Apart from Jesus, we have no power to bear fruit, to do anything spiritually or acceptably. Without Him, we can do nothing. As a branch separated from the vine withers and dies, so we are nothing without our union with Jesus. Our fruitfulness is solely attributed to Him and His grace, not our own efforts or power. We must abide in Him, seek strength and grace from Him alone, for apart from Jesus, we can do nothing.
