# John 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without Jesus, we are powerless and incapable of producing any good fruit. Our union with Him is the sole cause of fruitfulness, as being separate from Him means we can do nothing spiritually or acceptably. Scripture reveals that before we are united with Jesus, we are dry and useless. Therefore, all credit for our fruitfulness should be attributed to Him, as we are entirely reliant on His grace and strength to bear any good fruit in our lives.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Without me [œáœâœÅŒπœÇ ŒµŒºŒøœÖ] . Properly, apart from me. So Rev. Compare John 1:3; Ephesians 2:12.


### John Calvin:
1. "Without me you can do nothing." 
Explanation: This is the conclusion and application of the whole parable. So long as we are separate from him, we bear no fruit that is good and acceptable to God, for we are unable to do anything good.
2. "The doctrine invented by the Papists is, that we can do nothing without Christ, but that, aided by him, we have something of ourselves in addition to his grace. But Christ, on the other hand, declares that we can do nothing of ourselves."
Explanation: Christ not only extols the aid of his co-operating grace, but deprives us entirely of all power but what he imparts to us.
3. "Christ does not explain what the branch has naturally, before it become united to the vine, but rather means that we begin to become branches at the time when we are united to him."
Explanation: Scripture shows that, before we are in him, we are dry and useless wood.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; because apart from me ye can do nothing."
2. "The transition from John 15:4 to John 15:5 appears to be similar to that from chap. John 5:19-23 to chap. John 5:24, a transition from the principle to its application to men."
3. "The words ‚Äòye can do nothing‚Äô refer to the efforts of one already a believer. The state of faith is presupposed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Apart from me (œáœâœÅŒπœÇ ŒµŒºŒøœÖ). See Ephesians 2:12 for œáœâœÅŒπœÇ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ. There is nothing for a broken off branch to do but wither and die."
2. "Jesus repeats and applies the metaphor of verse John 15:1."
3. "For the cosmic relation of Christ see John 1:3 (œáœâœÅŒπœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ)."

1. "Which expresses their sameness of nature with Christ; their strict and close union to him; and the communication of life and grace, holiness and fruitfulness, of support and strength, and of perseverance in grace and holiness to the end from him."
2. "Nothing is to be done 'without Christ'; without his Spirit, grace, strength, and presence; or as 'separate from' him."
3. "All the fruitfulness of a believer is to be ascribed to Christ, and his grace, and not to the free will and power of man."

### John Wesley:
1. "I am the vine, ye are the branches."
