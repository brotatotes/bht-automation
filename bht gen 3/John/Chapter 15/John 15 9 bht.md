# John 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To continue in the love of Christ is to remain in the possession and enjoyment of His love, which includes both the disciple's love for Christ and Christ's love for the disciple. It is the Christ-principle of love that encompasses both. Just as Christ abides in the Father's love, we are called to abide in His love, valuing and treasuring it. Our love for Christ is a result of His love for us, grounded in the Father's love for the world. Let us therefore cling to this love, never forfeiting this invaluable blessing.
