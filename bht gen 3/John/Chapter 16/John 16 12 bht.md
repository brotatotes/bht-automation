While Jesus had given them an outline of the main doctrines, the Spirit would provide a fresh understanding and power to their hearts, revealing old truths in new and expanded ways. The disciples needed to grow in their faith in order to bear the weightier truths that would be revealed to them.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The disciples were not yet ready to hear everything that Jesus had to say to them. There were many truths and insights that they were not prepared to receive at that time. The progressive nature of revelation meant that these teachings would be gradually unfolded to them by the Holy Spirit after Jesus' Ascension. Jesus assured them that the Spirit would reveal things to come, giving them a glimpse into the future of the Kingdom of God. The untaught cannot fully grasp the depth of teaching, and the disciples needed to grow and mature in their faith to bear these weightier truths. Although Jesus had given them an outline and presented the great doctrines, there were still many details and applications that the Spirit would teach them in due time. The many things were not necessarily new teachings, but rather old truths made new and expanded upon in ways that would bring a fresh understanding and power to their hearts. The treasure in Jesus' words would never be exhausted; it contained what they were to know even though it passeth knowledge. So, while Jesus had revealed much to them, there were still many more things to be revealed to them through the Spirit.
