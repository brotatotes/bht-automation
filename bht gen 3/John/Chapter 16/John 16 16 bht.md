## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The 'beholding' implies the long, constant, usual sight of Him which they then had in the flesh: the 'seeing' the glimpses obtained by occasional appearances and visions, and the dimmer and more interrupted spiritual sight gained by faith."
2. "The promise of seeing Him after a little while, began to be fulfilled at the Resurrection;‚Äîthen received its main fulfilment at the day of Pentecost;‚Äîand shall have its final completion at the great return of the Lord hereafter."
3. "Remember again, that in all these prophecies we have a perspective of continually-unfolding fulfilments presented to us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father - the joy of the world at their not seeing Him seems to show that His removal from them by death was what He meant..."
2. "Their joy at again seeing Him points to their transport at His reappearance amongst them on His Resurrection, when they could no longer doubt His identity."
3. "At the same time the sorrow of the widowed Church in the absence of her Lord in the heavens, and her transport at His personal return, are certainly here expressed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A little while - His death would occur in a short time."
2. "Ye shall not see me - That is, he would be concealed from their view in the tomb."
3. "And again a little while - After three days he would rise again and appear to their view."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye shall behold me no more." 
2. "The vision of wondering contemplation, in which they observed little by little the outward manifestation of the Lord, was changed and transfigured into sight, in which they seized at once, intuitively, all that Christ was."
3. "His glorified presence showed Him in His true nature."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must, therefore, guard against becoming weary of reading what Christ, not without cause, repeats so frequently."
2. "Yet some explain this second clause differently: You will see me when I shall have risen from the dead, but only for a short time; for I shall very soon be received into heaven."
3. "Thus the grace of the Spirit is a mirror, in which Christ wishes to be seen by us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The time closing the first ‚Äòlittle while‚Äô is the death of Christ, when ‚Äònot beholding‚Äô begins; the time closing the second ‚Äòlittle while‚Äô dates from the resurrection, when the ‚Äòseeing‚Äô begins and continues forever."
2. "After the death of their Lord the disciples shall be in the position of the world (chap. John 13:13); under the saddening influence of that event their faith shall wane, and all the joy experienced in His presence shall disappear."
3. "But He whom they had thought lost forever shall enter at His resurrection on a glorified existence, from which He shall send to them that Advocate in whom and through whom He shall be always with them, and they with Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A little while (ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅŒøŒΩ). The brief period now till Christ's death..." 
2. "Again a little while (œÄŒ±ŒªŒπŒΩ ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅŒøŒΩ). The period between the death and the resurrection of Jesus..."
3. "Ye shall see me (ŒøœàŒµœÉŒ∏Œµ ŒºŒµ). Future middle of ŒøœÄœÑŒøŒºŒ±, the verb used in John 1:51; John 16:22 as here of spiritual realities..."

### John Gill:
1. "And in a very little time after this, having put up a prayer for them, recorded in the next chapter, he went into the garden, where he was met by Judas with his band of men, who laid hold on him, bound him, and led him first to Annas, then to Caiaphas, and from him to Pilate, when all the disciples forsook him and fled, and saw him no more in this mortal state, except Peter and John." 
2. "He took his trial, was soon condemned, and crucified, and laid in the dark tomb, and silent grave, where, for a while, he was out of sight." 
3. "And again, a little while and ye shall see me; referring either to his rising again the third day from his death, as was prophesied of, Hosea 6:2; and was typified by Jonah's lying three days and three nights in the whale's belly, when he appeared to, and was seen by his disciples, to their great joy."

### John Wesley:
1. "A little while and ye shall not see me ‚Äî When I am buried: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me - When I am risen."
2. "I die and rise again, in order to ascend to my Father."
3. "Because I go to my Father."

- Attempt 1 BHT: After Jesus spoke to his disciples about a little while, they were confused about what he meant. The first-tier commentaries help shed light on this by explaining that the beholding refers to the constant sight of Jesus while he was with them in the flesh, while the seeing refers to occasional appearances, visions, and the dimmer sight gained by faith. The promise of seeing Jesus after a little while began to be fulfilled at the Resurrection, had its main fulfillment at the day of Pentecost, and will have its final completion at the Lord's return. The second-tier commentaries add that the first little while refers to Jesus' death, when their not beholding him started, and the second little while corresponds to his resurrection, when their seeing him began and continues forever. In the end, Jesus' goal was to show his disciples his true nature through his glorified presence, which was possible due to his death, resurrection, and ascension to the Father.
