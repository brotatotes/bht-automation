# John 16:17 Commentary Help Text

The disciples were perplexed and confused by the apparent contradiction in Jesus' words regarding his departure to the Father. Their struggle to comprehend the connection between this little while and his previous statement about going to the Father led them to mistakenly add a clause in some copies of the text. Despite Jesus' clear explanations of his impending death, the disciples remained ignorant and failed to grasp the true meaning, resorting to discussing among themselves rather than seeking clarification from Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The disciples are perplexed by this little while, as connected with what our Lord had before asserted ver. 10, 'I go to my Father.'"
2. "That seemed to them a long and hopeless withdrawal: how was it then to be reconciled with what he now said of a short absence?"
3. "This connexion not being observed, has led to the insertion by the copyists of the clause because I go to the Father in ver. 16."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "But they talk to one another, not to Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "It may be, some of them might better understand the meaning of Christ than others, or they might all be ignorant of it."
2. "They knew not what he meant by it, though he had so often and so clearly spoken of his death unto them."
