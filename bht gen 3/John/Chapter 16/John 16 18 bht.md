### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He saith [ŒªŒ±ŒªŒµŒπ]. Emphasizing the purport of the saying."
2. "A little while [œÑŒø ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅŒøŒΩ]. In vv. 16, 17, without the article. Here the article the or this little while defines the special point of their difficulty; this 'little while' of which He speaks."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  We know not what he saith (ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒøŒπŒ¥Œ±ŒºŒµŒΩ œÑ ŒªŒ±ŒªŒµ). The questions to Jesus cease and the disciples frankly confess to each other their own ignorance.
