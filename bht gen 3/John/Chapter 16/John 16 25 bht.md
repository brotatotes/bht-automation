## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is true of the whole discourse‚Äîand of the discourses of the Lord in general, as they must then have seemed to them, before the Holy Spirit furnished the key to their meaning."
2. "Olshansen finely remarks, that all human language is a parable, or dark saying, only able to hint at, not to express fully, the things of God; and that the Lord contrasts the use of this weak and insufficient medium, with the inward teaching of the Holy Spirit."
3. "This speaking plainly however, he continues, is described here by the Lord in its ideal perfection (as it will hereafter be): and is only approximated to on earth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 25. in proverbs‚Äîin obscure
	language, opposed to "showing plainly"‚Äîthat is, by the
	Spirit's teaching.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "In a manner that appears obscure, enigmatical, and difficult to be understood."
2. "The plainest declarations to them on the subject would appear to be involved in mystery."
3. "The teachings of the Holy Spirit were the teachings of Christ himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He had spoken under figures, as the vine, and the woman in travail."
2. "The best texts read ajpaggelw, the original force of which is to bring tidings from [Œ±œÄŒø] something or someone."
3. "Plainly [œÄŒ±œÅœÅŒ∑œÉŒπŒ±]."

### John Calvin:
1. "The fact, however, clearly shows that Christ did not employ terms purposely obscure, but addressed his disciples in a simple and even homely style but such was their ignorance that they hung on his lips with astonishment."
2. "For, though their understandings are not completely darkened, like those of unbelievers, still they are covered, as it were, with clouds. Thus God permits us to be stupefied for a time, in order to humble us by a conviction of our own poverty."
3. "The Holy Spirit, certainly, did not teach the apostles anything else than what they had heard from the mouth of Christ himself, but, by enlightening their hearts, he drove away their darkness, so that they heard Christ speak, as it were, in a new and different manner, and thus they easily understood his meaning."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast, therefore, between ‚Äòin proverbs‚Äô and ‚Äòplainly‚Äô is to be sought in the difference between outward teaching of every kind and that internal teaching which comes from the illuminating influence of the Spirit of God, and which is the best, the only true, teaching." 
2. "The Spirit shall be given after Jesus goes away, and the disciples shall see in their own free and independent insight what as yet they received only upon the authority of their Master."
3. "The contrast suggested is not between figurative and direct speech, or between enigmatical and clear sayings. Jesus had used few figures, and He had taught with the utmost simplicity and plainness of language."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In proverbs." 
2. "Shall tell."
3. "Plainly."

### John Gill:
1. "These all seemed as proverbs, parables, and dark sayings, which they did not clearly understand."
2. "I shall show plainly of the Father; by pouring forth his Spirit upon them, who should not only take of his things, but of his Father's also, and show them unto them clearly and plainly."
3. "They should have a clear understanding of them, as they were capable of; of the perfections of his nature, his distinct personality, his being the Father of Christ, and of all the elect in him."
