1. "I came out from the Father (ŒµŒæŒ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒøŒΩ ŒµŒ∫ œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒøœÇ). Definite act (aorist), the Incarnation, with repetition of ŒµŒ∫ (out of), while in verse John 16:27 we have œÄŒ±œÅŒ± œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒøœÇ ŒµŒæŒ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒøŒΩ) with no practical distinction between ŒµŒ∫ and œÄŒ±œÅŒ± in resultant idea."

2. "And am come into the world; where he was before, as the Creator and upholder of it, by his immensity and powerful presence; this designs his coming and manifestation in the flesh."
3. "Again, I leave the world; not that he relinquished the sustaining and government of it, as God, nor the care of his people in it, as Mediator, for whom he retains the same love as ever."
