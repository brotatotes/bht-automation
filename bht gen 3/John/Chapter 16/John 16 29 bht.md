## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb‚Äîhardly more so than before; the time for perfect plainness was yet to come; but having caught a glimpse of His meaning (it was nothing more), they eagerly express their satisfaction." 
2. "How touchingly does this show both the simplicity of their hearts and the infantile character of their faith!"
3. "Glad to make anything of His words."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now speakest thou plainly - What he had said that perplexed them was that which is contained in John 16:16." 
2. "This he had now explained by saying John 16:28, 'Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.'"
3. "In this there was no ambiguity, and they expressed themselves satisfied with this explanation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Speakest - speakest [ŒªŒ±ŒªŒµŒπœÇ - ŒªŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπœÇ] The first, of the form; the second, of the purport. See on ver. 18.


### John Calvin:
1. "he who has only tasted a little of the doctrine of the Gospel is more inflamed, and feels much greater energy in that small measure of faith, than if he had been acquainted with all the writings of Plato."
2. "the roads which the Spirit of God produces in the hearts of the godly are sufficient proofs that God worketh in a secret manner beyond their capacity."
3. "They conclude, from certain signs, that Christ came out from God, and they glory in it, as if nothing more were needed. Yet still they were far from that knowledge, so long as they did not understand what Christ would be to them in future."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  No proverb (œÄŒ±œÅŒøŒπŒºŒπŒ±ŒΩ ŒøœÖŒ¥ŒµŒºŒπŒ±ŒΩ). No wayside saying, no dark saying. See John 10:6; John 16:25. 


### John Gill:
1. "Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb."
2. "What he had said before, were to them like proverbial, or parabolical expressions, not easy to be understood; they were like enigmas, riddles, and dark sayings, the meaning of which they could not apprehend."
3. "But now they observe, with admiration, that what he delivered was plain, and intelligible; which was not so much owing to Christ's different way of speaking now, from what it was before, as to their former dulness of hearing, and now having some further degree of light given unto them."
