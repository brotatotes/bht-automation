# John 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your grief has completely consumed your heart, causing you to neglect understanding the purpose of my departure. However, there is some consolation in this rebuke, as Jesus also excuses their negligence due to their overwhelming sorrow. They are paralyzed by their sorrow, unable to see a way forward without Jesus. Their sorrow has taken hold of their minds and thoughts, preventing them from even asking where Jesus is going. If only they had a proper understanding of his destination, it could have lessened their sorrow and brought peace to their minds, allowing them to accept his departure more easily.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Grief has filled, entirely occupied, your heart, to the exclusion of any regard of my object in leaving you."
2. "These are the same disciples who afterwards, when their risen Lord had ascended to heaven,â€”without any pang at parting with Him, returned with great joy to Jerusalem."
3. "There is beneath this mild rebuke a tacit consolation. For while He blames them in that they neglected enquiring whither He was going, He virtually excuses this their negligence, in that it arose from their being overwhelmed with sorrow."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 6, 7. But because I have said these
	things . . . sorrow hath filled your heartâ€”Sorrow had too much
	paralyzed them, and He would rouse their energies.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sorrow hath filled." This word is not used of Jesus in the Gospels, in John only in this chapter.
2. "They do not see their way to go on without Jesus." 


### John Gill:
1. "Sorrow for his absence so possessed their minds, seized on all the powers and faculties of their souls, and engrossed all their thoughts." 
2. "It never entered into the heart of any of them, to inquire about the place he was going to, or the state he should enter upon."
3. "Which had they had any right notions of, would have greatly contributed to have abated their sorrow, quieted their minds, made them easy under, and reconciled them unto, his departure from them."
