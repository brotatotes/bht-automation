### Albert Barnes:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are not to understand by the word â€˜convictâ€™ either simply â€˜reproveâ€™ or â€˜convince.â€™ It is much more than both, and implies that answer of conscience to the reproving convincing voice, by which a man condemns himself."
2. "The promise now given to the disciples is not that they shall convert the world, but that it shall be silenced, self - condemned, overwhelmed with shame and confusion of face."
