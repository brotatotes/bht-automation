# John 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The great opening of sin to the world is to show them that its root and essence is unbelief in Christ as the Son of God. The first step towards recovery is to lay hold of the only safety provided, which is faith. This unbelief is not just a lack of historical faith, but a lack of personal and living recognition of Jesus as Lord. The Spirit, in fastening this truth upon the conscience, intensifies the sense of all other sins. Without the conviction by the Paraclete, there is a pride of intellectual superiority in refusing to believe in Jesus.
