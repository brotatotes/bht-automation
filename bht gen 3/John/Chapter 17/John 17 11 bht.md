## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Holy, as applied to God, peculiarly expresses that penetration of all His attributes by LOVE, which He only who here uttered it sees through in its length, breadth, and height."
2. "The Name of God is that which was to be in the Angel of the Covenant... the Father hath given to Christ, and it is the being kept in this, the truth and confession of this, for which He here prays."
3. "The oneness here is not merely harmony of will or of love... but oneness by the indwelling of the Spirit of Christ, the gift of the Covenant, and ultimately... oneness of nature."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though My struggles are at an end, theirs are not; though I have gotten beyond the scene of strife, I cannot sever Myself in spirit from them, left behind and only just entering on their great conflict."
2. "Father... 'Holy' is here prefixed, because His appeal was to that perfection of the Father's nature, to 'keep' or preserve them from being tainted by the unholy atmosphere of 'the world' they were still in."
3. "Keep through thine own name... in the exercise of that gracious and holy character for which He was known."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Keep - Preserve, defend, sustain them in trials, and save them from apostasy."
2. "Keep in the knowledge of thyself. Preserve them in obedience to thee and to thy cause."
3. "That they may be united. As we are."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Holy [Œ±Œ≥ŒπŒµ] . See on saints, Acts 26:10; also on 1 Peter 1:15. Compare 1 John 2:20, and righteous Father [Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒµ] , ver. 25. This epithet, now first applied to the Father, contemplates God, the holy One, as the agent of that which Christ desires for His disciples - holiness of heart and life; being kept from this evil world." 
2. "I come [ŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒ±Œπ] . I am coming. Spoken of His departure to the Father." 
3. "Those whom [ŒøœÖœÇ] . The correct reading is w=, referring to name. Thy name which Thou hast given me. So in ver. 12. Compare Philippians 2:9, Philippians 2:10; Revelation 2:17; Revelation 19:12; Revelation 22:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "It yields no small consolation to us when we learn that the Son of God becomes so much the more earnest about the salvation of his people when he leaves them as to his bodily presence."
2. "For Christ, having been appointed by the Father to be their guardian for a time, and having now discharged the duties of that office, gives them back again, as it were, into the hands of the Father, that henceforth they may enjoy his protection and may be upheld by his power."
3. "Then will our unity be truly happy, when it shall bear the image of God the Father and of Christ, as the wax takes the form of the seal which is impressed upon it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His labours and sorrows are over, but they [the disciples] are left behind in the struggle which He is leaving. The very greatness of His joy in the thought of His own glorious return to His Father rouses His tenderest sympathy for those who have so much to do and to suffer before they can share His joy."
2. "'Holy' does not express mere freedom from sin; He who is holy is entirely separated from all that is carnal and outward in this present world, so that pure spirituality and heavenliness alone rule in Him. As, therefore, a state similar to this is that to which God would raise His people, the epithet 'Holy' brings this thought prominently into view, and strengthens the argument of the prayer."
3. "Then follows the purpose, that they [the disciples] may be one 'even as' are the Father and the Son. It is the Divine unity of love that is referred to, all wills bowing in the same direction, all affections burning with the same flame, all aims directed to the same end one blessed harmony of love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ will no longer be visibly present to the world, but he will be with the believers through the Holy Spirit."
2. "Oneness of will and spirit, not one person, for which Christ does not pray."
3. "Jesus offers the unity in the Trinity as the model for believers. The witness of the disciples will fail without harmony."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was not so intent on his own glory, as to neglect the good of his people, and to be unconcerned for them." 
2. "The persons prayed for are those that were given to Christ in election, and in the covenant, to be kept by him, and therefore he is the more solicitous for their preservation."
3. "His request is that his Father would keep them from the evil of the world; from sinking under temptations and afflictions; faithful to him and to his Gospel, and in unity among themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. "Keep them through thy name ‚Äî Thy power, mercy, wisdom, that they may be one - with us and with each other; one body, separate from the world." 
2. "One body, separate from the world: as we are - By resemblance to us, though not equality."
