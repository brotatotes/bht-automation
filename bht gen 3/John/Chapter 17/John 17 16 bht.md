# John 17:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are sanctified and set apart from the world, just like Jesus, without needing to physically separate themselves. Their consecration to God takes place in the truth. The repetition of the assertion that believers are not of the world emphasizes the stark contrast between them and the world that hates them. This hatred is not because of any wrongdoing by believers, but rather because the world hates God and Christ. Jesus appeals to the Father to protect his followers, who are exposed to the evils of the world.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Believers are already set apart from the world, just like Jesus himself, and this separation doesn't require physical removal from the world but rather consecration to God. Sanctification occurs in the truth, which is the element in which this consecration happens. John 17:16 emphasizes that believers are not of the world, echoing the words in John 15:18 and John 15:19. The repetition of this verse serves to highlight the complete contrast between believers and the world. The world hates them not because of any fault of their own, but because the world hates God and Christ. Therefore, Jesus appeals to his Father to take special notice of and protect his followers, who are constantly exposed to the world's evil.
