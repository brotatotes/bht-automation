# John 17:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sanctify them and consecrate them in the truth, which is God's revealed truth, His word. The truth is the medium or element of sanctification, a statement of immense importance. This sanctification is a process that progresses gradually throughout one's life. The Gospel, the word from the God of truth, is what sanctifies and brings about this consecration. By seeing things as they truly are, we see God's infinite loveliness and purity, which leads us to be separated from the world and dedicated to Him.
