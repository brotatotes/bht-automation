# John 17:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus sanctified himself for the sake of his disciples, setting himself apart entirely to the work of redemption. The disciples, in turn, were called to follow his example and be sanctified in truth, in accordance with God's word and will. The act of Christ helps us, but does not replace personal consecration on the part of the believer. Through his sanctification, the Spirit of God cleanses us and makes us partakers of his holiness. Jesus presented us to the Father in his own person, that we may be renewed to true holiness by his Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is clear against all Socinian inferences from this verse, that all that part of the sanctification of the Son of God implied in ch. x. 36 is here excluded..."
2. "Of this, His Death was the crowning act, and was also the one to which the expression for their sakes most directly applies; but the whole is included."
3. "Sanctified in truth: what truth, is evident from ver. 17, viz. Godâ€™s word and will, which is Truth, and the Truth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The only difference between the application of the same term to Christ and the disciples is, as applied to Christ, that it means only to 'consecrate'; whereas, in application to the disciples, it means to consecrate with the additional idea of previous sanctification, since nothing but what is holy can be presented as an offering."
2. "The whole self-sacrificing work of the disciples appears here as a mere result of the offering of Christ."
3. "Though the article is wanting in the original here, we are not to translate, as in the Margin, 'truly sanctified'; for the reference seems plainly to be 'the truth' mentioned in [John 17:17]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'sanctify' does not refer here to personal sanctification, for he had no sin, but to setting himself apart entirely to the work of redemption."
2. "Ministers will understand their work best when they most faithfully study the example of their great model, the Son of God."
3. "By this only can men be made holy; and it was because the Saviour so sanctified himself, or set himself to this work so unreservedly as to shed his own blood, that any soul can be made pure and fit for the kingdom of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He consecrated himself to the Father, that his holiness might come to us."
2. "The Spirit of God cleanses us by the holiness of Christ and makes us partakers of it."
3. "He has, so to speak, presented us to his Father in his own person, that we may be renewed to true holiness by his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was for the very purpose of bringing them to a consecration like His own that His whole work of love and sacrifice had been freely undertaken."
2. "The following words express, with special reference to the disciples, the end which Jesus had been desirous to attain. It is that their consecration might be the exact counterpart of His."
3. "The consecration spoken of is, alike in the case of Jesus and of His disciples, not a process but an act completed at once."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I sanctify myself... to his holy ministry to which the Father 'sanctified' him." 
2. "That they themselves also may be sanctified in truth." 
3. "The act of Christ helps us, but by no means takes the place of personal consecration on the part of the believer."

### John Gill:
1. "He never was a sinner, and so stood in no need of sanctification."
2. "He was made like unto us, yet without sin; he looked like a sinner, but was not one."
3. "He sacrificed himself voluntarily; and this he is said to do at that present time, because the time was very near that he was to be offered up, and his present prayer and intercession were a part of his priestly office."

### John Wesley:
1. I sanctify myself â€” I devote myself as a victim, to be sacrificed.
