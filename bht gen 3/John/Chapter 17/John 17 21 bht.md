3. "Rather is it,â€” 'that this their testimony, being borne by them all, and in all ages, may continue to convince the world, so that many in the world may believe,'&c."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The unity spoken of, then, is not merely that of Christians among themselves, whether outward or inward. It is unity in the Father and the Son, effected by that â€˜wordâ€™ regarding the Son in the Father and the Father in the Son which has been appropriated in faith, and which produces a result corresponding to itself." 
2. "It is what is known by divines as the â€˜mystical union;â€™ yet in it believers maintain their own personality and freedom, for such is the force of â€˜they themselves.â€™"
3. "Her spirituality is mainly before us here, that life which her members live, not conformed to the world, not coming down to the level of the world, with the vain idea that thus they shall bring the world nearer them, but ever rising as far as possible above the world, dwelling in the Father and in the Son, a city of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "As thou art in me â€” This also is to be understood in a way of similitude, and not of sameness or equality."
