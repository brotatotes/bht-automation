# John 17:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The glory of Christ, as the only-begotten Son full of grace and truth, becomes the glory of believers through their unity in Him. This unity is not just a similarity to the unity between the Son and the Father, but an actual subsistence, with Christ abiding in them and the Father in Christ. It is a glory of an accepted state, a holy character, and every grace. Christians are called to seek the same self-sacrificing love that Christ demonstrated, rather than worldly honor or position, in order to reflect the image of God and share in His glory.

1. "And the glory (ÎºÎ±Î³Ï‰ Ï„Î·Î½ Î´Î¿Î¾Î±Î½). Literally, 'And I the glory,' with emphasis on 'I.' It is the glory of the Incarnate Word (Bernard), cf. John 1:14; John 2:11, not the glory of the Eternal Word mentioned in John 17:24."

3. "This is one considerable branch of the glory of Christ, as Mediator, to be full of grace and truth; this was given him by the Father, and is what he communicates to his; even the Spirit, and all sorts of grace, and every supply of it; and which greatly contributes to the union of the saints among themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. The glory which thou hast given me, I have given them â€” The glory of the only begotten shines in all the sons of God. How great is the majesty of Christians.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The glory mentioned in the verse refers to the glory of Christ as the only-begotten Son, full of grace and truth, which has now become the glory of all believers through their unity in Him. It is the glory of an accepted state, a holy character, and every grace. This glory is not the glory of the Eternal Word, but rather the glory of the Incarnate Word, which Christ desires to give to His followers. The unity that Christ prays for in this verse repeats the unity mentioned earlier, as believers are to be one just as Christ and the Father are one. This unity is not in nature or existence, but in feeling, principle, and purpose. It is the model Christians should follow, seeking the same object as the Father and the Son have sought throughout creation and redemption. The glory mentioned here is not worldly honor or station, but the ability to love and sacrifice ourselves for the good of the world. Ultimately, the happiness of believers lies in having the image of God restored in them, by being shaped according to the likeness of Christ and having the glory of God impressed upon them. The glory Christ gives to His followers includes the Gospel and all the grace and truth that comes with it, contributing to the unity of the saints. Truly, the majesty of Christians is seen in the glory they share with Christ.
