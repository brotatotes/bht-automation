## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The knowledge spoken of is no mere head or heart knowledge,‚Äîthe mere information of the mind, or excitation of the feelings,‚Äîbut that living reality of knowledge and personal realization."
2. "The beginning of life is the result of the participation of God: and participation of God is the knowing God and enjoying His goodness."
3. "The knowledge of God and a creature could not be eternal life, and the juxtaposition of the two would be inconceivable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This life eternal, then, is not mere conscious and unending existence, but a life of acquaintance with God in Christ."
2. "Thee, the only true God‚Äîthe sole personal living God in glorious contrast equally with heathen polytheism, philosophic naturalism, and mystic pantheism."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The knowledge of God and of his Son Jesus Christ is itself a source of unspeakable and eternal joy."
2. "'To know God as he is' is to know and regard him as a lawgiver, a sovereign, a parent, a friend. It is to yield the whole soul to him, and strive to obey his law."
3. "To know Jesus Christ is to have a practical impression of him as he is - that is, to suffer his character and work to make their due impression on the heart and life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This is striking, that eternal life consists in knowledge, or rather the pursuit of knowledge, since the present tense marks a continuance, a progressive perception of God in Christ." 
2. "For this I say is death, and the sole death, When a man's loss comes from his gain, Darkness from light, from knowledge ignorance, And lack of love from love made manifest."
3. "The relation of perception of God to character."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Those, then, who receive 'eternal life' enter into a condition in which they learn to know the Father and the Son as They really are, learn to know Them in Their love and saving mercy, and are thus enabled to 'glorify' Them."
2. "The 'eternal life' is thus also a present thing, stretching indeed into the endless future, but begun now."
3. "Herein, therefore, lies the truth, that the one God whom Israel so vainly boasted that it knew could only be 'known' in connection with, and by means of the knowledge of, Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Should know (Œ≥ŒπŒΩœâœÉŒ∫œâœÉŒπŒΩ). Present active subjunctive with ŒπŒΩŒ± (subject clause), 'should keep on knowing.'" 
2. "Even Jesus Christ (ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖŒΩ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøŒΩ). See John 1:17 for the only other place in John's Gospel where the words occur together." 
3. "The knowledge of 'the only true God' is through Jesus Christ (John 14:6-9)."

### John Gill:
1. "The knowledge of God here spoken of, is not the knowledge of him by the light of nature, and works of creation... nor is eternal life known hereby, nor connected with it... nor can it either show, or give to persons eternal life."
2. "But this is to be understood of an evangelic knowledge of God... a practical and experimental one; a knowledge of approbation and appropriation; a fiducial one, whereby a soul believes in Christ, and trusts in his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice for salvation."
3. "The Father is called the only true God, in opposition to the many false gods of the Heathens, but not to the exclusion of the Son or Spirit... and besides, eternal life is made to depend as much upon the knowledge of him, as of the Father."

### John Wesley:
1. "By loving, holy faith, thee the only true God - The only cause and end of all things."
2. "Not excluding the Son and the Holy Ghost, no more than the Father is excluded from being Lord."
3. "But the false gods of the heathens; and Jesus Christ - As their prophet, priest, and king: this is life eternal - It is both the way to, and the essence of, everlasting happiness."
