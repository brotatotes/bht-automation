# John 17:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the world existed, the Son of God had glory with the Father. This perfect reciprocity of services between the Son and the Father is expressed in this quote, as the Son prays to be received back into that glory. It is a decisive proof of the unity of Christ's three estates: eternal pre-existence in glory, humiliation in the flesh, and glorification in the Resurrection Body. By praying for full restoration to the pre-incarnate glory and fellowship, Jesus affirms his actual and conscious existence at the Father's side.
