He before whose aspect the whole band had been terrified and cast to the ground now suffers himself to be taken, bound, and led away. To apprehend and bind ONE, all gave their help... He made them feel... They see that no further resistance is to be offered. A passive victim is before them; and they seize and bind Him. Let us remember that the body of the Son of God was bound, that our souls might be loosed from the cords of sin and Satan.
