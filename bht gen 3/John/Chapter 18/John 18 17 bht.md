# John 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's initial denial of Jesus was impulsive and driven by shame and fear. Standing among the High Priest's servants, he denied any knowledge of Jesus, while another disciple, John, went unnoticed. The maid recognized John as a follower of Jesus, so she suspected Peter's affiliation as well. Peter's blatant denial mirrored the maid's expectation of a negative answer. This first denial, in a series of three, occurred on the porch, and Peter's demeanor and timidity only confirmed his connection to Jesus.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Peter's first denial of knowing Jesus in John 18:17 seems to have been made rashly, out of a feeling of shame and fear of consequence. As he stood among the servants of the High Priest, trying to inconspicuously bear out his denial, he was recognized by a maid who had already identified John as a disciple of Jesus. Though she expected a negative answer and assumed that Peter also belonged to Jesus, Peter denied his association with Jesus point blank. This was the first of three denials, and it happened on the porch, perhaps as Peter contemplated escaping. In this moment, it becomes clear that Peter's demeanor and his timidity were unmistakable signs of his connection to Jesus, leading to his recognition.
