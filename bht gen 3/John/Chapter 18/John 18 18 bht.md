# John 18:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Unconcerned about his Master's suffering, Peter joins the crowd around the fire. In this act, his faithlessness grows stronger, putting himself in a position that led to his first denial. Perhaps the sight of Peter associating with the enemies of Jesus while warming himself by the fire of charcoal symbolizes Divine judgment. Peter's stupidity is evident as he thoughtlessly seeks comfort among a wicked crowd. The coldness of the night and Peter's inward coldness push him towards this bad company, leading to a second denial.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His wishing to 'see the end,' of issue of these proceedings, was what led him into the palace, for he evidently feared the worst."
2. "But once in, the serpent coil is drawn closer; it is a cold night, and why should not he take advantage of the fire as well as others?"
3. "In the talk of the crowd about the all-engrossing topic, he may pick up something which he would like to hear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is discouraging to see how the A. V. habitually ignores the imperfect tense, and thus detracts from the liveliness of the narrative." 
2. "Matthew does not mention the fire. Mark has to fwv, strictly, the light of the fire. Luke says they had kindled a fire [œÄœÖœÅ]." 
3. "Rev., correctly, were warming. So, ver. 25, was standing and was warming, for stood and warmed."

### John Calvin:
1. "This shows how great was Peter‚Äôs stupidity, when, without the least concern, he warmed himself along with a multitude of wicked men, after having denied his Master."
2. "Though it is possible that he may have been restrained by fear lest, in going out of the high priest‚Äôs house, he should fall into another danger of the same kind."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "In this night of cold he sees Peter associating himself with the enemies of Jesus, perhaps consulting his own comfort while his Master suffers, at all events putting himself in a position where the faithlessness that had already led to his first denial must gain strength."
2. "Whether this idea is brought out also by the 'fire of charcoal' is more difficult to say. It seems not unlikely that it is, for the word is not used by the other Evangelists; 'coals of charcoal' are in the Old Testament one of the symbols of Divine judgment."
3. "Apart from this, however, there is enough to show that John 18:18 is not simply historical. The peculiar spirit of the Evangelist appears in it, and we have thus the less occasion for surprise if we meet in the narrative other traces of the same spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A fire of coals...a heap of burning coals." 
2. "It was cold...there was coldness." 
3. "Peter, unabashed by his lie, joined himself to the group and stood in the light of the fire."

### John Gill:
1. "The passover was always in the spring of the year, when nights are commonly cold, as they are generally observed to be at the vernal equinox."
2. "He was cold both inwardly and outwardly; and being so, he gets into bad company; and it may be with a view that he might not be suspected, but be taken for one of their own sort, as one who had the same ill opinion of Jesus they had."
3. "By the light of the fire he is again discovered and challenged, which makes way for a second denial."
