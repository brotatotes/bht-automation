3. "This latter supposition has the force of an assertion, that it was well."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "He means nothing else than that each of us should be more ready to bear a second injury than to take revenge for the first; so that there is nothing to prevent a Christian man from expostulating, when he has been unjustly treated, provided that his mind be free from rancour, and his hand from revenge."
