# John 18:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was brought before Annas for a preliminary examination, not to be confused with the solemn gathering mentioned in the other Gospels. This meeting, with some of the ablest interpreters, served as a non-official proceeding before Caiaphas' Council convened. Despite the different rooms, Jesus was likely taken to the same building where both Annas and Caiaphas met with Him. After this encounter, Jesus, who had been bound upon His arrest, was seemingly unbound during the examination.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I cannot acquiesce in the pluperfect rendering of this word sent, to bring about which the opening particle, So, has apparently been omitted by the copyists."
2. "Then," says Chrysostom, "not being able even thus to make progress in their decision, they send Him bound to Caiaphas."
3. "The Evangelist had no need to relate the hearing before Caiaphas, for he has related ch. xi. 47 ff.: and we have ere this been familiarized with the habit of our Evangelist not to narrate any further the outward process, where he has already by anticipation substantially given us its result."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We take this interview, then, with some of the ablest interpreters, to be a preliminary and non-official one with Annas, at an hour of the night when Caiaphas' Council could not convene." 
2. "But the building in which both met with Jesus appears to have been the same, the room only being different, and the court, of course, in that case, one."
3. "This interview...ought not to be confounded with that solemn one recorded by the other Evangelists, when all were assembled and witnesses called."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Compare John 18:13 with Matthew 26:57.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best texts insert oun, therefore. The rendering of the aorist by the pluperfect here is inadmissible..."
2. "and is a device to bring this examination of Jesus into harmony with that described in Matthew 26:56-68..."
3. "and to escape the apparent inconsistency between the mention of the high - priest [Ï‡Î±Î¹Î±Ï€Î·Î±Ïƒ] as conducting this examination and the statement of ver. 13..."

### John Calvin:
1. "This sentence must be read by way of parenthesis; for, having said that Christ was taken to the house of Annas, and having continued his narrative, as if the assembly of the priests had been held there, the Evangelist now reminds the reader that Christ was taken from the house of Annas to the high priestâ€™s house."
2. "But as the tense of the Greek verb á¼€Ï€á½³ÏƒÏ„ÎµÎ¹Î»Îµ has led many people into a mistake, I have preferred translating it by the pluperfect tense, Had sent."
3. "I have chosen to render it in this way, Annas Had Sent, rather than, Annas Sent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The difficulty connected with these words will be best explained when we have completed the consideration of the three following verses."
2. "Annas is so introduced to our notice as to lead us directly back to the â€˜Annasâ€™ of John 18:13."
3. "It is enough to observe that in the original Annas is so introduced to our notice as to lead us directly back to the â€˜Annasâ€™ of John 18:13."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The preliminary examination by Annas was over."
2. "Jesus was bound on his arrest and apparently unbound during the preliminary examination by Annas."

### John Gill:
1. "Now Annas had sent him bound.... sent him away in this manner." 
2. "his son-in-law, as the more proper person to be examined before." 
3. "This was done before Peter's first denial of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. Now Annas had sent him to Caiaphas â€” As is implied John 18:13.
Bound â€” Being still bound, John 18:12.

- Attempt 5 BHT: Jesus underwent a preliminary examination by Annas, a meeting with esteemed interpreters that was separate from the gathering recorded in other Gospels. It is likely that this encounter took place in the same building, albeit different rooms, wherein both Annas and Caiaphas questioned Jesus. During this examination, Jesus, who was initially bound upon His arrest, appeared to be unbound. The attempt to reconcile the examination described in Matthew and the mention of the high priest conducting the inquiry in verse 13 led to the use of the pluperfect rendering, though its validity in certain texts remains under scrutiny.
