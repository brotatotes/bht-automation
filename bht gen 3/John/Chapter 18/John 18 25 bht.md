## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself."
2. "Art thou not also one of his disciples?"
3. "He denied it, and said, I am not."

### John Calvin:
1. "How shocking the stupidity of Peter, who, after having denied his Master, not only has no feeling of repentance, but hardens himself by the very indulgence he takes in sinning!"
2. "Such is the manner in which Satan hurries along wretched men, after having degraded them."
3. "There is nothing better for us, therefore, than to be early on our guard, that he who is tempted by Satan, while he is yet uncorrupted, may not allow himself the smallest indulgence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The remarkable taking up again in these words of the fact already mentioned in John 18:18 cannot fail to arrest attention."
2. "Peter is no longer only near the door; he is within the court. He is no longer only in the cold; he is warming himself at the charcoal fire. He is no longer only with John; he is along with the servants and officers of the Jews."
3. "The second denial, as in Matthew 26:72, was in boldness and recklessness an advance upon the first."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Two periphrastic imperfects precisely as in verse John 18:18, vivid renewal of the picture drawn there."
2. "The question and answer are almost identical with verse John 18:17 and 'put in a form which almost suggested that Peter should say 'No'' (Bernard), a favourite device of the devil in making temptation attractive."
3. "John alone gives the examination of Jesus by Annas (John 18:19-24) which he places between the first and the second denials by Peter."

### John Gill:
1. "The company and conversation of wicked men should be abstained from; no good is got thereby; continuance among such is very dangerous; men are too often more concerned for their bodies than their souls; Satan baits his temptations for the fleshly and sensitive part; and that which is thought to be for good, is the occasion of hurt."
2. "They might observe his countenance to fall, when the maid put the question to him; there might be something in his dress, and especially in his speech, which increased the suspicion."
3. "This denial of his being a disciple of Christ, as before, did not arise from a sense of his unworthiness to be one; nor from diffidence and distrust of a right to such a character; but from the fear of men; and being ashamed of Christ, he denies that which was his great mercy, privilege, and glory."
