- Attempt 5 BHT: The servant's emphatic question, Did I not see thee with my own eyes? highlighted Peter's blatant denial of his association with Jesus. Hoping to divert attention by joining in the fireside conversation, Peter only made his Galilean origin more noticeable, leading to this unsettling confrontation. The servant's sharp inquiry, not merely about Peter being a disciple, but whether he had seen him with Jesus, intensified the impact. It was in this early morning hour that Peter's repeated denials, witnessed by someone connected to the man Peter had previously harmed, culminated in his third and most resolute denial.
