# John 18:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, in their effort to avoid defilement, refused to enter the Pr√¶torium where Jesus was held while they prepared to eat the Passover. Yet, their strict observance of external rituals and concerns about purity overshadowed the true significance of their actions. Their focus on avoiding physical pollutants, such as Gentiles or unleavened houses, revealed a misplaced emphasis on outward appearances rather than genuine moral righteousness. In their attempt to retain the shadow of the Passover, they ultimately rejected the true Paschal Lamb, Jesus Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews would not enter the Pr√¶torium that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover."
2. "Possibly the law concerning Levitical defilements and purifications had in that age been made more stringent or otherwise modified."
3. "The whole depends on this: can the words, eat the Passover, mean anything else besides eating the paschal lamb in the strict sense?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled‚Äîby contact with ceremonially unclean Gentiles."
2. "but that they might eat the passover‚ÄîIf this refer to the principal part of the festival, the eating of the lamb, the question is, how our Lord and His disciples came to eat it the night before."
3. "These are questions which have occasioned immense research and learned treatises. But as the usages of the Jews appear to have somewhat varied at different times, and our present knowledge of them is not sufficient to clear up all difficulties, they are among the not very important questions which probably will never be entirely solved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They considered the touch of a Gentile to be a defilement, and on this occasion, at least, seemed to regard it as a pollution to enter the house of a Gentile."
2. "Probably there is not anywhere to be found among men another such instance of petty regard to the mere ceremonies of the law and attempting to keep from pollution, at the same time that their hearts were filled with malice, and they were meditating the most enormous of all crimes."
3. "It shows us how much more concerned men will be at the violation of the mere forms and ceremonies of religion than at real crime, and how they endeavor to keep their consciences at ease amid their deeds of wickedness by the observance of some of the outward ceremonies of religion by mere sanctimoniousness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hall of judgment [œÄœÅŒ±ŒπœÑœâœÅŒπŒøŒΩ] . A Latin word, proetorium, transcribed. Originally, the general's tent. In the Roman provinces it was the name for the official residence of the Roman governor, as here." 
2. "If the night proceedings were merely preliminary to a formal trial, they would have no validity; if formal, they were, inso facto, illegal. In either case was the law observed in reference to the second council."
3. "The defilement in the present case was apprehended from entering a house from which all leaven had not been removed."

### John Calvin:
1. "But these hypocrites, though they are so full of malice, ambition, fraud, cruelty, and avarice, that they ahnost infect heaven and earth with their abominable smell, are only afraid of external pollutions."
2. "So then it is an intolerable mockery, that they expect to please God, provided that they do not contract defilement by touching some unclean thing, though they have disregarded true purity."
3. "In short, they observe the shadow of the passover with a false and pretended reverence, and yet not only do they violate the true passover by sacrilegious hands, but endeavor, as far as lies in their power, to bury it in eternal oblivion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were scrupulous because they desired to eat without an hour‚Äôs delay."
2. "They had lost time already; the night was flying fast; the morning light would soon appear; it would be too late then: no interruption that can be escaped must be allowed."
3. "Instead of welcoming the true Paschal Lamb, these Jews rejected Him. What thought more in the manner of our Evangelist than to let us see that, seeking to retain the shadow, and sacrificing the substance for its sake, they lost not only the substance but the shadow too."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There were two violations of Jewish legal procedure (holding the trial for a capital case at night, passing condemnation on the same day of the trial)."
2. "For Jewish scruples about entering the house of a Gentile."
3. "This interpretation keeps John in harmony with the Synoptics."

### John Gill:
1. "They did not think it lawful to rent out a house in Judea to an Heathen... which they were the more observant of, that they might eat the passover."
2. "It is easy to observe the consciences of these men, who were always wont to strain at a gnat and swallow a camel."
3. "No wonder that God should be weary of their sacrifices and ceremonious performances when, trusting to these, they had no regard to moral precepts."

### John Wesley:
1. They went not into the palace themselves, lest they should be defiled ‚Äî By going into a house which was not purged from leaven, Deuteronomy 16:4. Matthew 27:2; Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Jews refused to enter the Pr√¶torium where Jesus was being held because they did not want to defile themselves before eating the Passover. This act may have been due to a stricter interpretation of the levitical defilement laws or their desire to maintain purity for the paschal lamb. Even though there are differing opinions on whether Jesus and His disciples ate the passover lamb on the actual day or the night before, what is clear is that the Jews prioritized rigid adherence to ceremonial cleanliness over justice. By avoiding contact with the Gentiles and not entering the Roman governor's residence, they thought they could maintain their religious purity. However, they failed to recognize that their meticulous focus on external rituals masked their true intentions and the rejection of the true Paschal Lamb, Jesus.
