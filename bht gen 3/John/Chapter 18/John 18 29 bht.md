- Attempt 1 BHT: Pilate, well aware of the circumstances surrounding Jesus' arrest, demanded a formal accusation from the Sanhedrim. He dissimulated his own knowledge on the subject and went out to them, asking them to state their charge against Jesus. Pilate's abrupt introduction reveals his familiarity, and his name can be derived from either a javelin or a cap, the latter being a badge of manumitted slaves. Though implying formal accusation, Pilate's query does not imply ignorance. Pilate's inquiry demonstrates his commitment to fairness and justice as he seeks to try the prisoner before him.

His goal is to have the matter stated, the cause opened, and evidence given so the accused can answer for himself and Pilate, as a judge, can make an informed judgment. This approach aligns with Roman laws and reflects a demeanor of equity, justice, and impartiality.
