## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Lanterns and torches were part of the utensils of military on a night march."
2. "The latter of these appear to be strictly torches,‚Äîsome blazing substance held in the hand;‚Äîand the former, lights, fed with oil."
3. "The fact of its being full moon did not make the lights unnecessary, as, in searching for a prisoner, they might have to enter dark places."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that was called Judas, one of the Twelve [...] in the sacred circle while in no sense of it."
2. "Now he that betrayed Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is He, hold Him fast."
3. "Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss‚Äîimprinting upon the foulest act the mark of tenderest affection? What wounded feeling does this express! Of this Jesus showed Himself on various occasions keenly susceptible‚Äîas all generous and beautiful natures do."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John passes over the agony of Jesus in the garden, probably because it was so fully described by the other evangelists."
2. "This was the time of the full moon, but it might have been cloudy, and their taking lights with them shows their determination to find him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The band, or cohort, was from the Roman garrison in the tower of Antonia."
2. "The temple police. The Synoptists speak of the body which arrested Jesus as oclov, a multitude or rabble; but both Matthew and Mark mention the band [œÉœÄŒµŒπœÅŒ±] later in the narrative."
3. "Though it was full moon, it was feared that Jesus might hide and escape."

### John Calvin:
1. "That Judas came accompanied by soldiers and by so large a retinue, is a sign of a bad conscience, which always trembles without any cause."
2. "It is certain that the band of soldiers was borrowed from the governor, who also sent a captain at the head of a thousand soldiers."
3. "John makes separate mention of the Pharisee, because they were more enraged than all the rest, as if they had cared more about religion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mention of ‚Äòthe band‚Äô has been made an object of ridicule, as if it could only mean ‚Äòhalf a Roman army.‚Äô The ridicule is groundless."
2. "The Romans in all probability did not think of one man only to be made prisoner, but of the danger of a popular tumult."
3. "The trees of the garden made ‚Äòlanterns and torches‚Äô necessary. Although the moon was near the full, the Jews would imagine that Jesus might hide Himself in the covert and so escape."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "[The soldiers] secured from the Tower of Antonia."
2. "Judas took no chances for it may have been cloudy and there were dark places by the walls and under the olive trees."
3. "Probably the temple guard had weapons as well as the soldiers."

### John Gill:
1. "A large number indeed, to take an unarmed person."
2. "To see that the men did their work, and did not return without him."
3. "As if they had a thief or a murderer to apprehend, or a little army of men to encounter with."

### John Wesley:
1. A troop of soldiers ‚Äî A cohort of Roman foot.
