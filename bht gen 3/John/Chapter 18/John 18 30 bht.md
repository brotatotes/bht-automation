# John 18:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jewish leaders, in their bid to secure Pilate's agreement for Jesus's execution, conveniently left out the charge of blasphemy against Him, fearing it might undermine their cause. Aware that they lacked evidence, they relied on their own authority and sought permission from Pilate, as they couldn't carry out the death sentence. Accusing Jesus of being an evil-doer, their pride and self-importance blinded them to His true nature as a healer and miracle-worker, failing to produce any substantial evidence of His alleged crimes.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Jewish religious leaders, in their desperate attempt to seek Pilate's approval for the execution of Jesus, conveniently omitted the charge of blasphemy, perhaps out of fear that it would undermine their entire cause. They wanted to present their own authority as sufficient proof of Jesus' guilt, knowing that they had found Him guilty by their own law. Unable to carry out the death sentence under Roman rule, they came to Pilate merely seeking his permission. Their accusation of Jesus as a malefactor or evil-doer was driven by envy and a desire to appear important and dignified. However, their pride and self-righteousness blinded them to Jesus' true nature as a healer and miracle-worker, and they failed to produce any concrete evidence of his alleged crimes.
