- Attempt 1 BHT: In the midst of the public judgment, Pilate personally summoned Jesus and asked Him, Art thou the King of the Jews? The charge brought against Jesus was that He claimed to be a king, challenging the authority of Caesar. Pilate, perhaps intrigued by this claim, sought to understand whether Jesus saw Himself as a king in a civil or theocratic sense.
