# John 18:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' response to Pilate's question about whether He claimed to be a king was aimed at discerning the nature of Pilate's inquiry. If it was from Pilate himself, it would imply one meaning of kingship, while if it came from others, it would open the way to the true understanding of Jesus' kingship. Jesus sought to establish whether the charge against Him was political, within Pilate's jurisdiction, or purely religious, with which Pilate had no concern. He was striving for a fair trial, exposing the base motives of His accusers and shifting the guilt onto them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I regard this question, Sayest thou this thing of thyself... as intended to distinguish the senses of the word King as applied to Jesus."
2. "If he asked of himself, the word could certainly have but one meaning, and that one would be wrongly applied."
3. "If from information derived from the Jews, this very fact would open the way to the true meaning in which He was King of the Jews."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus answered . . . Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?" 
2. "an important question for our Lord's case, to bring out whether the word 'King' were meant in a political sense, with which Pilate had a right to deal." 
3. "or whether he were merely put up to it by His accusers, who had no claims to charge Him but such as were of a purely religious nature, with which Pilate had nothing to do."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "During all the time in which you have been praetor, have you seen anything in me that has led you to apprehend sedition or danger to the Roman power?"

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's meaning is, whether he asserted this from the sentiments of his own mind..."
2. "...he was desirous of convincing Pilate of his weakness, if he so judged of himself, and of his imprudence and hastiness, if he took up this from others..."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus responded to Pilate's question about whether He claimed to be a king by asking if Pilate was inquiring on his own or if he had been informed by others. This was a significant question because it distinguished the different meanings of the word king in relation to Jesus. If Pilate had asked out of his own curiosity, it would imply a political interpretation of Jesus' kingship, which fell within Pilate's jurisdiction. However, if he had been influenced by the accusations of the religious leaders, it would point to a purely religious charge that Pilate had no authority to deal with. Jesus sought a fair trial and wanted Pilate to recognize that there was no evidence of sedition or danger to the Roman power in His actions. Ultimately, Jesus aimed to shift the guilt of His impending death onto the appropriate parties and highlight the unjustness of the whole situation.
