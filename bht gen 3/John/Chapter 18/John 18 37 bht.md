# John 18:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Art thou, thus captured, bound, standing as a criminal in peril of thy life, a king? To this end have I been born...I have been born, but not therein commencing my beingâ€”I am (or, have) come into the world. The King is the representative of the truth: the truth of dealing between man and man;â€”the truth of that power which in its inmost truth belongs to the great and only Potentate, the King of Kings. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
