## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His celebrated question is perhaps more the result of indifferentism than of scepticism; it expresses, not without scoff and irony, a conviction that truth can never be found."
2. "It was rather an inability than an unwillingness to find the truth."
3. "His conduct presents a pitiable specimen of the moral weakness of that spirit of worldly power, which reached its culminating point in the Roman empire."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou stirrest the question of questions, which the thoughtful of every age have asked, but never man yet answered."
2. "The only certainty," says the elder PLINY, "is that nothing is certain, nor more miserable than man, nor more proud."
3. "The revelation of the eternal truth alone was able to breathe new life into ruined human nature, and that in the apprehension of complete redemption."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This question had long agitated the world. It was the great subject of inquiry in all the schools of the Greeks." 
2. "They have a fixed contempt for the Bible; they deride the instructions of religion; they are unwilling to investigate and to wait at the gates of wisdom; and hence, like Pilate, they remain ignorant of the great Source of truth, and die in darkness and in error."
3. "All might find truth if they would seek it; none ever will find it if they do not apply for it to the great source of light the God of truth, and seek it patiently in the way in which he has chosen to communicate it to mankind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus meant the absolute truth : Pilate, truth in any particular case."
2. "Pilate's exclamation is neither the expression of an ardent thirst for truth, nor that of the despair of a soul which has long sought it in vain; it is the profession of a frivolous skepticism, such as is frequently met with in the man of the world, and especially in the statesman."
3. "Fault [Î±Î¹Ï„Î¹Î±Î½]. Properly, cause of accusation. Rev., crime."

### John Calvin:
1. "For my own part, I rather think that it is an expression of disdain; for Pilate thought himself highly insulted when Christ represented him as destitute of all knowledge of the truth."
2. "Though we are all aware of our ignorance, yet there are few who are willing to confess it; and the consequence is, that the greater part of men reject the true doctrine."
3. "That Pilate spoke in mockery is evident from this circumstance, that he immediately goes out. In short, he is angry with Christ for boasting that he brings forward the truth, which formerly lay hidden in darkness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not surely the question of one seriously searching after truth, for in that case he would have waited for a reply."
2. "He went forth again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no crime. It is a distinct sentence of acquittal."
3. "A Roman governor, a Gentile, declares the innocence and even feels to some extent the true majesty of Him who, though King of the Jews, is rejected and doomed to death by that blinded and guilty people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What is truth? This famous sneer of Pilate reveals his own ignorance of truth, as he stood before Incarnate Truth."
2. "The answer in Latin is Vir est qui adest as has been succinctly said by the use of the same letters."
3. "Pilate turned with indifference from his own great question and rendered his verdict: 'I find no crime in him'. Pilate therefore should have set Jesus free at once."

### John Gill:
1. "Many things might be observed in answer to this question, as that there is the truth and faithfulness of God in his word and promises..."
2. "The Gospel is truth in general; it comes from the God of truth; lies in the Scriptures of truth; Christ, who is truth itself, is the substance of it..."
3. "This confession is both to the shame of Pilate and the Jews; to the reproach of Pilate, that after this he should condemn him; and of the Jews, that after such a fair and full declaration from the judge, they should insist upon his crucifixion..."

### John Wesley:
1. "What is truth? â€” Said Pilate, a courtier; perhaps meaning what signifies truth?"
2. "Is that a thing worth hazarding your life for?"
3. "He left him presently, to plead with the Jews for him, looking upon him as an innocent but weak man."
