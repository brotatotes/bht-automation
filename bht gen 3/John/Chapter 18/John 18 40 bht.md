# John 18:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle‚Äôs words capture the irony as Barabbas, a robber, is chosen by the crowd. Jesus is likened to a sin-offering, the goat upon which the Lord's lot fell. The loud and importunate cry signifies their choice. John implies a previous unrecorded crying out, while Barabbas, a notorious bandit, is contemptuously preferred over Jesus. The priests influence the crowd‚Äôs decision, and Pilate offers the alternative. The guilty nature of their cry intensifies as they reject the holy Jesus in favor of a robber.
