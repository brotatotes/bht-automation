## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "St. John detected Judas standing among them, and notices the detail, as is his constant habit, by way of enhancing the tragic character of the history."
2. "The narrative common to the three Gospels related the kiss which presently took place; but this self-tradition of our Lord was not related in it."
3. "St. John therefore adds this touch of exactness, to shew that the answer, Jesus of Nazareth, was not given because they were ignorant of His Person, so as not to be able to say ‚ÄòThee;‚Äô‚Äîbut because they feared to say it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They answered . . . Jesus of Nazareth‚Äîjust the sort of blunt, straight forward reply one expects from military men, simply acting on their instructions." 
2. "I am He‚Äî(See on :-)." 
3. "Judas . . . stood with them‚ÄîNo more is recorded here of his part of the scene, but we have found the gap painfully supplied by all the other Evangelists."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of Nazareth [œÑŒøŒΩ ŒΩŒ±Œ∂œâœÅŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ] . Literally, the Nazarene. 
Stood [ŒµŒπœÉœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒπ] . Imperfect tense. Rev., correctly, was standing.


### John Calvin:
1. "There was no want of power in him, therefore, to restrain their hands, if he had thought proper; but he wished to obey his Father, by whose decree he knew that he was called to die."
2. "We may infer from this how dreadful and alarming to the wicked the voice of Christ will be, when he shall ascend his throne to judge the world."
3. "And what was the word? He thunders no fearful excommunication against them, but only replies, It is I. What then will be the result, when he shall come, not to be judged by a man, but to be the Judge of the living and the dead; not in that mean and despicable appearance but shining in heavenly glory, and accompanied by his angels?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The answer may perhaps reveal the light in which Judas had represented Jesus to the Roman authorities, 'of Nazareth,' a Galilean, prone to revolt; or it may be that the Evangelist beholds in it one of those unconscious prophecies of the enemies of Jesus."
2. "Before the effect produced by the reply is related, a parenthetical clause is introduced."
3. "We have before us Judas possessed by Satan. The powers of evil are concentrated in him; and to bring him thus prominently forward as sharing the fate of others illustrates in the most striking manner the victory of Jesus even in this hour of apparent defeat."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Judas in the very act of betraying Jesus."
2. "John does not mention the kiss by Judas as a sign to the soldiers and police."
3. "Jesus stepped forth and affirmed that he was the one whom they were seeking."

### John Gill:
1. "nor do they say 'Christ', for they rejected and denied him as the Messiah; nor do they call him that deceiver, or seditious person, as they sometimes did, being willing to cover their malicious views and intentions; but Jesus of Nazareth"
2. "Judas at first did not know him any more than the rest; so that he might easily have passed them if he had pleased; and that Judas did not stand with them as an idle spectator; he came with them to betray him, and was looking out for him"
3. "to inform us, that he fell to the ground with the rest; which is related in John 18:6"
