# John 19:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus acknowledges Pilate's power, but asserts that it is derived from a higher authority. Pilate's authority over Jesus is not absolute, as it is granted to him by divine decree. Those who delivered Jesus to Pilate, especially Caiaphas representing the Jewish authorities, bear a greater sin because their actions were motivated by malice and envy, with a greater understanding of the truth. Jesus' response not only reveals the truth and grace in his words, but also positions him as superior to both his accusers and his judge.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This saying, observes Meyer, breathes truth and grace."
2. "Our Lord concedes to Pilate 1) Power. He acknowledged the authority of a human court, because His kingdom was not earthly, destroying human magistrates: nor did He dispute the authority of Pilate and the Romans over the Jews."
3. "He acknowledges that that power extended even over Himself, since all concerning Him was being done by divine decree."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou thinkest too much of thy power, Pilate: against Me that power is none, save what is meted out to thee by special divine appointment, for a special end."
2. "He that delivered me unto theeâ€”Caiaphas, too witâ€”but he only as representing the Jewish authorities as a body."
3. "Hath the greater sinâ€”as having better opportunities and more knowledge of such matters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No such power as you claim. You have not originated the power which you have. You have just as much as is given, and your ability extends no further."
2. "Men of office and talent, as well as others, should remember that God gives them what they have, and that they have no influence except as it is conceded to them from on high."
3. "God thus brings about his wise ends; and while Pilate was free, and acted out his nature without compulsion, yet the purposes of God, long before predicted, were fulfilled, and Jesus made an atonement for the sins of the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. He that delivered. Caiaphas.


### John Calvin:
1. "The statement is, no doubt, true, that this world is regulated by the disposal of God, and that, whatever may be the efforts of wicked men, still they cannot even move a finger but as the secret power of God directs."
2. "Consider, then, that His heavenly throne is far higher than thy tribunal. It is impossible to find any admonition better fitted to repress the insolence of those who rule over others, that they may not abuse their authority."
3. "Yet Christ does not aggravate their guilt, for the purpose of extenuating that of Pilate; for he does not institute a comparison between him and them, but rather includes them all in the same condemnation, because they equally pollute a holy power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In using his power, therefore, against the Son of God, he was really fighting against God."
2. "The sin thus committed was, on the part of those who were guilty of it, a sin against greater light than in Pilateâ€™s case."

2. "Power was given to Pilate from heaven against him; not for any evil he himself had committed, or merely to gratify the envy and malice of the Jews, but for the salvation of God's elect, and for the glorifying of the divine perfections."
3. "The sin of Judas in delivering him into the hands of the chief priests and elders, and of the chief priest and elders and people of the Jews, in delivering him to Pilate to crucify him, according to the Roman manner, were greater, inasmuch as theirs proceeded from malice and envy, and was done against greater light and knowledge."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou couldst have no power over me - For I have done nothing to expose me to the power of any magistrate."
2. "Therefore he that delivered me to thee, namely, Caiaphas, knowing this, is more blamable than thou."
