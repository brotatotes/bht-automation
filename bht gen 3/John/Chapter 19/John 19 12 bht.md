## BHT:
Pilate, affected by Jesus' words of majesty and compassion, attempted once again to release Him, but he faced the threat of being accused of disloyalty to Caesar. The Jewish leaders, driven by their determination to destroy Jesus, feigned zeal for a foreign prince, causing Pilate to fear going against their will. In their pursuit of their own ends, the Jews plunged themselves into the depths of ignominy and shame, leaving Pilate with the unfulfilled desire to expose their degradation and Jesus' innocence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Pilate himself was deeply struck by these words of majesty and mildness, and almost sympathy for his own weakness; and he made a last, and, as this verse seems to imply, a somewhat longer attempt than before, to deliver Him."
2. "C√¶sar‚Äôs friend... The meaning is, ‚Äòwell affected to C√¶sar.‚Äô"
3. "This was a terrible saying, especially under Tiberius, with whom, as Tacitus assures us, the undefined charge of disaffection to the person of the emperor was used to fill up all other accusations."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If thou let this man go, thou art not C√¶sar's friend, &c.‚Äî'This was equivalent to a threat of impeachment, which we know was much dreaded by such officers as the procurators, especially of the character of Pilate or Felix. It also consummates the treachery and disgrace of the Jewish rulers, who were willing, for the purpose of destroying Jesus, to affect a zeal for the supremacy of a foreign prince'"
2. "When Pilate... heard that... he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in... the judgment seat‚Äîthat he might pronounce sentence against the Prisoner, on this charge, the more solemnly."
3. "in a place called the Pavement‚Äîa tesselated pavement, much used by the Romans. In the Hebrew, Gabbatha‚Äîfrom its being raised."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was more and more convinced of his innocence, and more unwilling to yield him to mere malice and envy in the face of justice."
2. "He feared that he would be accused of unfaithfulness to the interests of the Roman emperor if he did not condemn a man whom his own nation had accused of sedition."
3. "This emperor was, during the latter part of his reign, the most cruel, jealous, and wicked that ever sat on the Roman throne."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou art not true to the emperor."
2. "The title 'Augustus' was always reserved for the monarch, while 'Caesar' was more freely communicated to his relations."
3. "From the reign of Hadrian at least (A.D. 117 - 138) [the title 'Caesar'] was appropriated to the second person in the state, who was considered as the presumptive heir of the empire."

### John Calvin:
1. "He is a judge, and yet he meekly permits the accused person to be his reprover."
2. "By threats they prevail on Pilate to condemn Christ; for they could do nothing that was more hateful, or more fitted to produce terror, than to hold him suspected of disloyalty to Caesar."
3. "It is of great importance to us to know, that Pilate did not condemn Christ, before he had several times acquitted him with his own mouth, in order that we may learn from it, that it was for our sins that he was condemned, and not on his own account."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The attempts were vain."
2. "He has another object far more nearly at heart, to exhibit the woeful, the self-confessed, degradation to which the proud Jewish people, by their opposition to Jesus, had reduced themselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sought (ŒµŒ∂Œ∑œÑŒµ). Imperfect active, 'kept on seeking,' 'made renewed efforts to release him.' He was afraid to act boldly against the will of the Jews."
2. "If thou release this man (ŒµŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒøœÖœÑŒøŒΩ Œ±œÄŒøŒªœÖœÉŒ∑ŒπœÇ). Condition of third class, a direct threat to Pilate. He knew all the time that the Sanhedrin might tell Caesar on him."
3. "Thou art not Caesar's friend (ŒøœÖŒ∫ Œµ œÜŒπŒªŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÉŒ±œÅŒøœÇ). Later to Vespasian this was an official title, here simply a daring threat to Pilate."

### John Gill:
1. "He sought by all means, and studied every way to bring the Jews to agree to his release."
2. "Pilate would show but little regard to Caesar, by whom he was raised to this dignity."
3. "Christ did not give out that he was such a king, but, on the contrary, that his kingdom was not of this world."
