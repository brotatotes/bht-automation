# John 19:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the vigil of the Passover, the preparation day before the evening sacrifice, Jesus stood before the Jewish leaders. There seems to be a discrepancy in the time mentioned here, with some suggesting that the true reading is the third hour, or 9 A.M. Pilate's statement Behold your King was likely an ironic mockery toward the Jews. As the day progressed, Pilate took a sort of quiet revenge on them by giving in to their demands, which only fueled their cry to crucify Him. This preparation day heralded the sacrifice of the true Paschal Lamb, Jesus Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This preparation day is ‚Äòthe vigil of the Passover,‚Äô i.e. the day preceding the evening when the passover was killed."
2. "We must certainly suppose, as did Eusebius, Theophylact, and Severus, that there has been some very early erratum in our copies."
3. "The words Behold your King seem to have been spoken in irony to the Jews‚Äîin the same spirit in which afterwards the title was written over the cross."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The true reading here is probably, 'the third hour'‚Äîor nine A.M.‚Äîwhich agrees best with the whole series of events, as well as with the other Evangelists."
2. "Having now made up his mind to yield to them, he takes a sort of quiet revenge on them by this irony, which he knew would sting them."
3. "This only reawakens their cry to despatch Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. The preparation of the passover - See the notes at Mark 15:42.
The sixth hour - Twelve o‚Äôclock noon. Mark says Mark 15:25 that it was the third hour. See the difficulty explained in the notes at that place.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sixth hour. See on 1 39.


### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelists appear to differ, and even to contradict each other, in the computation of time." 
2. "It is plain enough from other passages that the day was at that time divided into four parts, as the night also contained four watches."
3. "Hence we infer that Christ was crucified at or about the sixth hour; for, as the Evangelist afterwards mentions, (John 19:20,) the place was near to the city."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The day now dawning, and the events now occurring, were 'a preparation of the Paschal lamb' yet not of the lamb of the Jewish feast, but of the true Paschal Lamb, Jesus Himself, of the Lamb now on His way to be sacrificed for the life of His people."
2. "If, on the other hand, the word denotes the weekly day of preparation ('Friday'), it is clear that in John 19:31 any explanatory addition would be superfluous."
3. "Pilate had no motive for being sarcastic with regard to [Jesus]. He had been impressed by the spectacle of meekness and innocence which Jesus presented. He would have set Him free had he possessed sufficient earnestness and depth of moral character to carry into effect what he knew to be right."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Preparation of the passover (œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÉŒ∫ŒµœÖŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒ±œÉœáŒ±). That is, Friday of passover week, the preparation day before the Sabbath of passover week."
2. "About the sixth hour (œâœÇ ŒµŒ∫œÑŒ∑). Roman time, about 6 A.M. (a little after 6 no doubt) when Pilate rendered his final decision."
3. "Behold your king (ŒôŒ¥Œµ Œø Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœÖœÇ œÖŒºœâŒΩ). ŒôŒ¥Œµ is here an exclamation with no effect on the case of Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœÖœÇ just as in John 1:29."

### John Gill:
1. "And it was the preparation of the passover... but then this preparation of the passover was not of the passover lamb, for that had been prepared and eaten the night before."
2. "Their canon runs thus: 'a feast day which falls on the eve of the sabbath, a man may not boil (anything) at the beginning of the feast day for the sabbath; but he may boil for the feast day; and if there is any left, it may be left for the sabbath; and he may make a boiling on the eve of a feast day, and depend on it for the sabbath.'"
3. "The time of Christ's crucifixion being supposed to be somewhat before, but yet near our twelve of the clock, it may be truly here said that it was about the sixth hour; and as truly by Mark the third hour; that space, which was called by the name of the third hour, being not yet passed, though it drew toward an end."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every Friday was called the preparation, (namely, for the Sabbath.)"
2. "And as often as the passover fell on a Friday, that day was called the preparation of the passover."
3. "For this reason both the Jews and Pilate were desirous to bring the matter to a conclusion."
