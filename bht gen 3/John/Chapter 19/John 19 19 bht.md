Amidst the conflicting passions of men, the truth of Jesus, the King of the Jews, was proclaimed from the Cross itself, in the chief tongues of mankind, shedding a lurid yet grand light on His identity. The Jewish ecclesiastics, stung by this, requested that the title be altered to reflect His false claim to dignity, but Pilate, having yielded already, refused their request. Jesus, the crucified Messiah, became the true King of the people of God, bearing their sins on the cross.
