# John 19:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inscription on the cross, written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, served as a mocking accusation by the Jews, but it also carried profound significance. By using these three languages, representing different civilizations, it emphasized the centrality of the cross in world history. The inclusion of Hebrew was for the benefit of the people of Jerusalem, Latin for the Roman authority, and Greek for the broader audience. This inscription highlighted the convergence of civilizations, and furthermore, suggested that Christ's impact would transcend mere religious significance to reach civil administration and common speech.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. The same spirit of mockery of the Jews shewed itself in the title, as before, ver. 14.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hebrew was the rational dialect, Latin the official, and Greek the common dialect. As the national Hebrew, King of the Jews was translated into Latin and Greek, so the inscription was prophetic that Christ should pass into civil administration and common speech."
2. "The cross is the real center of the world's history."
3. "The three civilizations which had prepared the way for Christ thus concentrated at His cross."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The place outside the city, but really belonging to the city, is viewed only in this latter aspect, as 'the place of the city,' because a closer connection is thus established between the crime committed there and the guilty city of Jerusalem."
2. "The language in which this proximity of Golgotha to the city is spoken of is in a high degree remarkable: not 'the place was nigh to the city,' but 'the place of the city was nigh.'"
3. "And it was written in Hebrew and Latin and Greek, the three great languages of the then known world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was meant to be read."
2. "Latin was the legal and official language; Aramaic (Hebrew) was for the benefit of the people of Jerusalem; Greek was for everybody who passed by who did not know Aramaic."
3. "Many of the Jews mocked as they read the accusation."

### John Gill:
1. "Golgotha, the place of Christ's crucifixion, was not more than two furlongs, or a quarter of a mile from the city of Jerusalem."
2. "These words were written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin; that it might be read by all, Jews, Greeks, and Romans."
3. "These three languages may be very well thought to be understood by Pilate; at least so much of them as to qualify him to write such an inscription as this."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was written in Latin â€” For the majesty of the Roman empire..."
2. "...in Hebrew - Because it was the language of the nation..."
3. "...and in Greek - For the information of the Hellenists, who spoke that language, and came in great numbers to the feast."
