## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. The citation is verbatim from the LXX.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That a prediction so exceedingly specific â€” distinguishing one piece of dress from others, and announcing that while those should be parted amongst several, that should be given by lot to one person â€” that such a prediction should not only be fulfilled to the letter, but by a party of heathen military, without interference from either the friends or the enemies of the Crucified One, is surely worthy to be ranked among the wonders of this all-wonderful scene."
2. "We thank you, O ye chief priests, scribes, and elders, for this triple testimony, unconsciously borne by you, to our Christ: first to His habitual trust in God, as a feature in His character so marked and palpable that even ye found upon it your impotent taunt; next, to His identity with the Sufferer of the twenty-second Psalm, whose very words ye unwittingly appropriate, thus serving yourselves heirs to the dark office and impotent malignity of Messiah's enemies; and again, to the true sense of that august title which He took to Himself, 'THE SON OF GOD,' which He rightly interpreted at the very first as a claim to that oneness of nature with Him, and dearness to Him, which a son has to his father."
3. "While the ecclesiastics deride Him for calling Himself, 'the Christ, the King of Israel, the Chosen, the Son of God,' the soldiers, to whom all such phraseology was mere Jewish jargon, make sport of Him as a pretender to royalty ('KING of the Jews'), an office and dignity which it belonged to them to comprehend."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let us not rend it - It would then have been useless."
2. "The outer garment, being composed of several parts - fringes, borders, etc."
3. "That the scripture ..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Vesture [Î¹Î¼Î±Ï„Î¹ÏƒÎ¼Î¿Î½] . Clothing, collectively. Rev., garments, for iJmatia, is better than raiment, which is collective, while the word is used of the separate pieces of clothing.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Both in the dividing and in the casting of lots the Evangelist sees Scripture fulfilled."
2. "That the scripture might be fulfilled, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they cast lots."
3. "The words may either be intended to emphasize the presence of God in the scene, as He made the Roman soldiers fulfil His Scripture; or may simply arise out of the intense interest with which John narrates each particular of these eventful hours."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let us not rend it. It was too valuable to ruin."
2. "Cast lots...no example has been found where it means 'cast lots' as here."
3. "The enemies of the Lord's Anointed treated him as already dead and so cast lots."

### John Gill:
1. "The whole psalm is to be understood of the Messiah, not of David, as some do... all which had their literal accomplishment in Jesus."
2. "The Scriptures are the garments of Christ... these exhibit and show forth Christ in his glory... though it may be played with, betrayed, sold, or denied, it cannot be destroyed, but is, and will be preserved by divine providence."
3. "The righteousness of Christ may be signified by this robe, which is often compared to one, because it is put on the saints, and they are clothed with it... it covers, keeps warm, protects, beautifies, and adorns them; this is seamless, and all of a piece, and has nothing of men's works and services tacked unto it."

### John Wesley:
1. "No circumstance of David's life bore any resemblance to this, or to several other passages in the 22nd Psalm."
2. "In this scripture, as in some others, the prophet seems to have been thrown into a preternatural ecstasy."
3. "He spoke barely what the Spirit dictated, without any regard to himself."
