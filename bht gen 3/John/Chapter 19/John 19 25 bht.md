- Attempt 1 BHT: At the cross where Jesus was crucified, there stood by him his mother Mary, his mother's sister Salome, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. Salome is understood to be the sister of Jesus' mother, and Mary the wife of Cleophas is believed to be another sister. These women witness the crucifixion and are present when Jesus breathes his last. The presence of Mary, the mother of Jesus, in this group is mentioned only by John. We are not certain if this Mary is the same as the mother of James and Joses or a different person, as the information is not clear. Despite the uncertainty, the devotion and love shown by these women at the cross serve as an example to us. They do not turn away but stand witness to the suffering of Jesus. We can learn from them to look upon a crucified Christ, reflect on his sorrows and sufferings, and the weight of our sins laid upon him. May we also respond with genuine tears of affection, humility, and joy for our crucified Savior.
