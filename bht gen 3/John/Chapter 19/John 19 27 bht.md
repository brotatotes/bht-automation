# John 19:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Romanist idea that Jesus entrusted all his disciples to the care of his mother is absurd. We cannot draw a certain conclusion about whether the brethren of the Lord believed in him at the time. The phrase he took her to his own home does not necessarily imply that John had a house in Jerusalem, but rather that wherever he was, she lived with him. This act demonstrates Jesus' humanity, John's love for him, and the importance of showing affectionate regard and tender care towards Jesus' mother.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Romanist idea, that the Lord commended all his disciples, as represented by the beloved one, to the patronage of His mother, is simply absurd."
2. "No certain conclusion can be drawn from this commendation, as to the 'brethren of the Lord' believing on Him or not at this time."
3. "The words, he took her to his own home, need not imply that John had a house in Jerusalem. The name would equally apply to his lodging during the feast; only meaning, that henceforth, wherever he was, she was an inmate with him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Behold thy mother! - One who is to be to thee as a mother."
2. "The fact that she was the mother of Jesus would secure the kindness of John, and the fact that she was now intrusted to him demanded of him affectionate regard and tender care."
3. "John seems to have been in better circumstances than the other apostles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. His own home [Ï„Î± Î¹Î´Î¹Î±] . See on 1 11. 
28 - 30. Compare Matthew 27:45-50; Mark 14:33-37; Luke 23:44-46.


### John Calvin:
1. "It is a token of the reverence due by a disciple to his master, that John so readily obeys the command of Christ."
2. "Hence also it is evident, that the Apostles had their families; for John could not have exercised hospitality towards the mother of Christ, or have taken her to his own home, if he had not had a house and a regular way of living."
3. "Those men, therefore, are fools, who think that the Apostles relinquished their property, and came to Christ naked and empty; but they are worse than fools, who make perfection to consist in beggary."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unto his own home (ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ Ï„Î± Î¹Î´Î¹Î±)."
2. "John had a lodging in Jerusalem, whether a house or not."
3. "The mother of Jesus lived with him there."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows the meanness of Christ, who had nothing to leave her, though Lord of all."
2. "He now, in his dying moments, commits her to the care of this disciple; which is an instance of his humanity, and of his regard to every duty."
3. "His doing this forthwith shows his great regard to Christ, his readiness and cheerfulness to comply with his orders and directions, and his unfeigned love unto him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold thy mother â€” To whom thou art now to perform the part of a son in my place, a peculiar honour which Christ conferred on him."
2. "From that hour â€” From the time of our Lord's death."
