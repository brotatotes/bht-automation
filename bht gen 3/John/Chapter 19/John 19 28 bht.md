3. "Nec hoc levamentum petiisset, nisi scivisset id quoque ad Œ∫œÅŒπœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒ± Messi√¶ secundum Prophetas spectare. Unde h√¶c altera motiva additur: ut consummaretur Scriptura."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

1. "Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished; or just upon being accomplished, were as good as finished; and as they were to be, would be in a very short time; even all things relating to his sufferings, and the circumstances of them, which were afore appointed by God, and foretold in prophecy, and of which he had perfect knowledge."
2. "That the Scripture might be fulfilled: might appear to have its accomplishment, which predicted the great drought and thirst that should be on him, Psalms 22:15 and that his enemies at such a time would give him vinegar to drink, Psalms 69:21."
3. "Saith, I thirst; which was literally true of him, and may be also understood spiritually of his great thirst and eager desire after the salvation of his people."
