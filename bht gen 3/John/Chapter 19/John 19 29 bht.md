# John 19:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sour wine, or vinegar and water, was a common drink of the Roman soldiers, while the hyssop plant was used for sprinkling and represented the height of the cross. Jesus' loud voice was not an indicator of His remaining strength, but rather an expression of the exultant spirit of a Dying Victor. The vinegar offered earlier was a stupefying draught, while the vinegar here likely aimed to revive Him. The sponge soaked in vinegar was fastened to the hyssop end of the rod and raised to Christ's mouth, symbolizing the transfer of the draught to Him.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This 'loud voice,' noticed by three of the Evangelists, does not imply, as some able interpreters contend, that our Lord's strength was so far from being exhausted that He needed not to die then, and surrendered up His life sooner than Nature required, merely because it was the appointed time."
2. "But just as even His own dying saints, particularly the martyrs of Jesus, have sometimes had such gleams of coming glory immediately before breathing their last, as to impart to them a strength to utter their feelings which has amazed the by-standers, so this mighty voice of the expiring Redeemer was nothing else but the exultant spirit of the Dying Victor, receiving the fruit of His travail just about to be embraced, and nerving the organs of utterance to an ecstatic expression of its sublime feelings."
3. "Yes, the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. His soul has emerged from its mysterious horrors; 'My God' is heard no more, but in unclouded light He yields sublime into His Father's hands the infinitely precious spiritâ€”using here also the words of those matchless Psalms which were ever on His lips."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The sour wine, or vinegar and water, was a common drink of the Roman soldiers, while the hyssop was a plant used for sprinkling and had hints of the height of the cross. Some argue that the loud voice of Jesus does not suggest that His strength was still intact, but rather that He was expressing the exultant spirit of a Dying Victor. The vinegar offered to Jesus earlier was a stupefying draught, but the vinegar here was probably offered to revive Him. The sponge soaked in vinegar was fastened to the hyssop end of the rod and raised to Christ's mouth. Ultimately, the act of fixing the sponge on hyssop represented the transfer of the draught to Jesus.

- Attempt 3 BHT: The sour wine, commonly consumed by Roman soldiers, and the hyssop plant, associated with sprinkling, hold significance in understanding John 19:29. Although Jesus' loud voice is not an indication of His strength, it represents the triumphant spirit of a Dying Victor. The vinegar offered to Him earlier had sedative properties, while the vinegar provided here may have been offered for revival.
