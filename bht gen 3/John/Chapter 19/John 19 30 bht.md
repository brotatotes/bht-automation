2. "Mark, ejxepneusen, breathed forth (his life)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The whole accomplishment of our salvation, and all the parts of it, are contained in his death." 
2. "Every thing which contributes to the salvation of men is to be found in Christ, and ought not to be sought anywhere else." 
3. "The children of God, as well as the reprobate, die; but there is this difference between them, that the reprobate give up the soul, without knowing where it goes, or what becomes of it; while the children of God commit it, as a precious trust, to the protection of God, who will faithfully guard it till the day of the resurrection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is finished.' The word is the same as in John 19:28, but now He utters what there He 'knew.' It is the shout of victory, not the cry of satisfaction that suffering is at an end."
2. "Having said this, 'He bowed His head,' and 'delivered up His spirit.' The verb used for 'delivered up' is peculiarly important. The choice of the word leaves no doubt as to the meaning of the Evangelist. However true it is that by the cruelty of man the death upon the cross was brought about as by its natural cause, there was something deeper and more solemn in it of which we must take account."
3. "It was His own free will to die. There is in Him an ever-present life and power and choice in which He, even at the very last moment, offers Himself as a sacrifice."

2. "Bowed his head. This vivid detail only in John."
3. "Gave up his spirit. Jesus died with the words of this Psalm upon his lips."

### John Gill:
1. "It is finished; that is, the whole will of God; as that he should be incarnate, be exposed to shame and reproach, and suffer much, and die."
2. "Hence a perfect righteousness was finished agreeably to the law, which was magnified and made honourable by it, and redemption from its curse and condemnation secured."
3. "His own course of life ended: the reason of his saying so was, because all this was near being done, just upon finishing, and was as good as done; and was sure and certain, and so complete, that nothing need, or could be added to it."

### John Wesley:
1. It is finished ‚Äî My suffering: the purchase of man's redemption.
He delivered up his spirit ‚Äî To God, Matthew 27:50.
