# John 19:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
That day, a double sabbath, marked the beginning of unleavened bread and was a high day. The Jews, despite their recent allegiance to Caesar, were now meticulous about following the law. So, they pleaded with Pilate to break the legs of the crucified men with clubs as a sort of coup de grace. By doing this, they sought to hasten the men's death, ensuring that their bodies wouldn't remain on the cross overnight and defile the sacred Sabbath and the start of the festival week.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The Jews - Sabbath. The Jews, who had so recently asserted their sole allegiance to Caesar, are now scrupulous about observing the letter of the law.


### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist says, that the Jews besought that the bodies might be taken down from the crosses. This had undoubtedly been enjoined by the Law of God; but the Jews, as is usually the case with hypocrites, direct their whole attention to small matters, and yet pass by the greatest crimes without any hesitation."
2. "Yet, by their agency, the Lord carries into effect what was of the greatest importance for our salvation, that, by a wonderful arrangement, the body of Christ remains uninjured, and blood and water flow out of his side."
3. "If we read ·ºêŒ∫Œµ·Ω∑ŒΩŒøœÖ in the genitive case, (·ºêŒ∫Œµ·Ω∑ŒΩŒøœÖ œÑŒø·ø¶ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ of that Sabbath) the word Sabbath must be understood to denote the week; as if the Evangelist had said, that the festival of that week was very solemn, on account of the Passover."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word here used has in itself the double meaning of ‚Äòpreparation‚Äô and of ‚ÄòFriday.‚Äô" 
2. "These words, therefore, so far from supporting the view of those who think that the legal Passover had not yet been celebrated, tend rather in the opposite direction."
3. "The operation of breaking the legs, though not sufficient to cause death, would naturally hasten it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A 'great' day, since 'the sabbath day following synchronized with the first day of unleavened bread which was a 'great' day" (Bernard). A double reason therefore for wanting the bodies removed before sunset when the Sabbath began."
2. "This crurifragium was done with a heavy mallet and ended the sufferings of the victim."
3. "Legs (œÉŒ∫ŒµŒªŒ∑). Old word, here only in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "What was the usage of the Jews at this time is not certain; according to the Roman laws, such bodies hung until they were putrefied, or eaten by birds of prey; wherefore that their land might not be defiled, and especially their sabbath, by their remaining on the cross, they desire to have them taken down."
2. "for that sabbath day was an high day; it was not only a sabbath, and a sabbath in the passover week, but it was the day in which all the people appeared and presented themselves before the Lord in the temple, and the sheaf of the first fruits was offered up; all which solemnities meeting together made it a very celebrated day."
3. "hence the Jews pretending a great concern lest that day should be polluted, though they made no conscience of shedding innocent blood, besought Pilate that their legs might be broken."

### John Wesley:
1. "Lest the bodies should remain on the cross on the Sabbath... of that in particular." 
2. "For that Sabbath was a great day... a treble solemnity."
