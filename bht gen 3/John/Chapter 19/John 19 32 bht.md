# John 19:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John's Gospel includes a unique detail: the breaking of the legs of the crucified criminals. This brutal act involved striking their legs with a heavy mallet to accelerate death. The soldiers likely approached from opposite sides, hitting each criminal before reaching Jesus. This serves as a symbolic image of the final judgment, with the righteous on Christ's right hand and the wicked on the left. If the criminal who reviled Jesus had his legs broken, it would vividly illustrate the separation at the last day.
