# John 19:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John uniquely records that the soldiers broke the legs of the crucified men, a punishment often inflicted on slaves, using a heavy mallet to hasten death. The soldiers likely approached from opposite sides, striking the legs of the criminals before reaching Jesus. The question remains as to which criminal was struck first, but this event symbolizes the division on the last day when the sheep and goats stand on the right and left hand of Christ.
