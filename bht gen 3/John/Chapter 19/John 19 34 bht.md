## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The lance must have penetrated deep, for the object was to ensure death,‚Äîand see ch. xx. 27, probably into the left side, on account of the position of the soldier, and of what followed."
2. "The medical opinions on the point are very various, and by no means satisfactory."
3. "Meyer's view after all seems to be the safe and true one‚Äîthat the circumstance is related as a miraculous sign, having deep significance as to the work of the Redeemer, and showing Him to be more than mortal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But one of the soldiers‚Äîto make assurance of the fact doubly sure."
2. "Had life still remained, it must have fled now."
3. "It is now well known that the effect of long-continued and intense agony is frequently to produce a secretion of a colorless lymph within the pericardium."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This man appears to have doubted whether he was dead... so, therefore, that there could not be the least doubt of his resurrection to life."
2. "To make out this fact was of special importance, probably, in the time of John, as the reality of the death of Jesus was denied... by the Gnostics."
3. "This fact it was of importance to prove... This John establishes. He shows... the fullest proof that he had truly expired... thus laid the foundation for undoubted assurance that the Lord Jesus died for the sins of men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The question has been raised whether the Evangelist means to describe a gash or a prick."
2. "It has been suggested that the body was merely pricked with the spear to ascertain if it were yet alive."
3. "I think, however, with Meyer, that John evidently intends to describe the incident as something entirely unexpected and marvelous."

### John Calvin:
1. "But they who despise Christ, and seek the intercessions of the dead, deserve that the devil should drive them to ghosts and phantoms."
2. "The sacraments which Christ has left to his Church have the same design; for the purification and sanctification of the soul, which consists in newness of life, is pointed out to us in Baptism, and the Lord‚Äôs Supper is the pledge of a perfect atonement."
3. "When Baptism and the Lord‚Äôs Supper lead us to Christ‚Äôs side, that by faith we may draw from it, as from a fbuntain, what they represent, then are we truly washed from our pollutions, and renewed to a holy life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With a spear (ŒªŒøŒ≥œáŒ∑). Instrumental case of this old word, here only in the N.T."
2. "Pierced his side (Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒªŒµœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩ ŒµŒΩœÖŒæŒµŒΩ). First aorist active indicative of ŒΩœÖœÉœÉœâ, old word to pierce, here only in N.T., and œÄŒªŒµœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩ (side), another old word, occurs in N.T. only here and John 20:20; John 20:25; John 20:27."
3. "Blood and water (Œ±ŒπŒºŒ± Œ∫Œ± œÖŒ¥œâœÅ). Dr. W. Stroud (Physical Cause of the Death of Christ) argues that this fact proves that the spear pierced the left side of Jesus near the heart and that Jesus had died literally of a broken heart since blood was mixed with water."

### John Gill:
1. "this the soldier did, partly out of spite to Christ, and partly to know whether he was really dead; and which was so ordered by divine providence"
2. "that it might beyond all doubt appear that he really died, and was not taken down alive from the cross"
3. "rather they signify the blessings of sanctification and justification, the grace of the one being represented by water, as it frequently is in the Old and New Testament, and the other by blood, and both from Christ"

### John Wesley:
1. "Forthwith there came out blood and water ‚Äî It was strange, seeing he was dead, that blood should come out; more strange, that water also; and most strange of all, that both should come out immediately, at one time, and yet distinctly."
2. "It was pure and true water, as well as pure and true blood."
3. "The asseveration of the beholder and testifier of it, shows both the truth and greatness of the miracle and mystery."
