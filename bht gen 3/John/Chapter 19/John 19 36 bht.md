# John 19:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fulfillment of Scripture is seen in the protection of the sacred body of Christ from further indignity after His crucifixion. While various forms of violence had been permitted before His death, an Unseen hand ensured that no bone of His body would be broken. This divine interposition not only fulfilled the ordinance regarding the Paschal Lamb, but it also affirmed the certainty of His death and resurrection. Just as the paschal lamb's bones were not to be broken, so too, the unbroken bones of Christ symbolize the unbroken strength with which He accomplished our redemption.
