## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prophecy, they shall look on Him whom they pierced, does not refer to the Roman soldiers."
2. "But to the repentant in the world, who, at the time the Gospel was written, had begun to fulfil the prophecy."
3. "It is not without a prophetic reference to the future conversion of Israel, who were here the real piercers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How suitable this was to express the action of the Roman soldier, is manifest; and our Evangelist uses the exactly corresponding word, which the Septuagint certainly does not."
2. "Very different is the other word for 'pierce' in Zechariah 12:10 - 'They pierced my hands and my feet.' The word there used is one signifying to bore as with an awl or hammer."
3. "How striking are these small niceties!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We must here be struck with the wonderful providence of God, that so many scriptures were fulfilled in his death."

3. "But in this way God had so ordered it that the firmest foundation should be laid for the belief that he was the true Messiah."

1. "Christ is that God who formerly complained... that the Jews had pierced his heart."
2. "Christ is God manifested in the flesh... in his visible flesh was plainly accomplished what his Divine Majesty had endured from the Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "Though the Jews are to this day hardened against him, that part of the prophecy which concerns their looking to him, and mourning for him on account of his being pierced by them, will also, in God's own time, be fulfilled."
2. "Nor is it any objection to the application of this prophecy to our Lord Jesus, that not the Jews, but the Roman soldiers pierced him, since what one does by another, he may be said to do himself."
3. "From the citation of this passage it appears, that the writers of the New Testament did not always follow the Greek version of the Old Testament, but John cites them according to the Hebrew text, even which we now have, and which is an instance of the truth, purity, and integrity of the present Hebrew books of the Old Testament."

### John Wesley:
1. "They shall look on him whom they have pierced."
2. "They who have occasioned his sufferings by their sins shall either look upon him in this world with penitential sorrow."
