## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The narrative implies, though it does not mention (as St. Mark and St. Luke do), that Joseph himself took down the Body from the cross."
2. "The words of ver. 31, 'that they might be taken away,' need not imply, 'by their hands.' It was customary to grant the bodies of executed persons to their friends."
3. "On Joseph, and the other particulars, see notes on Matthew."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Marvellous it certainly is, that one who while Jesus was yet alive merely refrained from condemning Him, not having the courage to espouse His cause by one positive act, should, now that He was dead, and His cause apparently dead with Him, summon up courage to go in personally to the Roman governor and ask permission to take down and inter the body."
2. "The heroism of faith is usually kindled by desperate circumstances, and is not seldom displayed by those who before were the most timid, and scarce known as disciples at all."
3. "But, whatever were Pilate's motives, two most blessed objects were thus secured: The reality of our Lord's death was attested by the party of all others most competent to decide on it, and certainly free from all biasâ€”the officer in attendanceâ€”in full reliance on whose testimony Pilate surrendered the body."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A disciple of Jesus. Matt. calls him a rich man; Mark, an honorable counselor, i e., a member of the Sanhedrim; and Luke, a counselor, good and just."
2. "Gave him leave. According to Roman law...The bodies of those who are capitally punished cannot be denied to their relatives."
3. "Avaricious governors sometimes sold this privilege...If this is grievous to parents, they may buy the liberty of burial."

### John Calvin:
1. "Till now, therefore, riches had prevented them from professing to be the disciples of Christ, and might afterwards have no less influence in keeping them from making a profession so much hated and abhorred."
2. "They bring their spices to embalm the body of Christ; but they would never have done so, if they had been perfumed with the sweet savor of his death."
3. "Our slothfulness will be base and shameful if, now that he reigns in the heavenly glory, we withhold from him the confession of our faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is easy to understand that Pilate should at once grant the permission asked. He had no interest in keeping the body; and by giving it up to disciples of Jesus he would have a fresh opportunity of at once doing despite to, and exasperating, the Jews."
2. "It seems not unlikely that in the fact that disciples receive the body of the Lord the Evangelist beholds a token of the care with which it was watched over by His Father in Heaven."
3. "Joseph, however, was not alone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An example of the rulers described in John 12:41-43 who through cowardice feared to own their faith in Jesus as the Messiah." 
2. "But it must be put down to the credit of Joseph that he showed courage in this darkest hour when the majority had lost heart."
3. "Else the body of Jesus might have gone to the potter's field. Pilate gladly consented."

### John Gill:
1. "But now being inspired with zeal and courage, 'went in boldly', as Mark says, and besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus."
2. "This Pilate, the Roman governor, had the disposal of, and to him Joseph applies for it; which was a great instance of his affection for Christ, and was a declaring openly for him, and must unavoidably expose him to the malice and resentment of the Jews."
3. "he took the body of Jesus; down from the cross, and carried it away. The Alexandrian copy, different from all others, and in language uncommon, reads, 'the body of God'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Acknowledging Christ, when even his chosen disciples forsook him."
2. "In that extremity Joseph was no longer afraid, Nicodemus no longer ashamed."
3. "Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate â€” And Nicodemus also came."
