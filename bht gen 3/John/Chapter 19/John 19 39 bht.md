## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Their love to Jesus was called out by the might of His love. His Death is the Power which constrains men." 
2. "And thus this act of love on the part of both these men is a testimony for Jesus, and for the future effect of His death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The quantity of spices thus brought by Nicodemus is certainly remarkable; and hence some have shrunk from taking the words in their literal sense, holding that â€˜a hundred poundâ€™ (especially as here qualified by â€˜aboutâ€™) may be an expression merely denoting a great quantity."
2. "The humiliation of the King of Israel (chap. John 3:3, John 12:13), so far from discouraging, does but strengthen the once weak faith of the true disciple; and in contrast with (and may we not add in expression of shame and penitence for) timorous hesitation, we read of the lavish offering of a love open and avowed."
3. "The declaration of chap. John 12:32 begins to receive its fulfilment."

2. "Myrrh was one of the principal spices in the anointing oil and holy perfume."
3. "And so the aloe was used to perfume, and to give a good scent."
