## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus bore the mockery with kingly dignity as part of the shame of the Cross."
2. "This exclamatory introduction of Jesus in mock coronation robes...was clearly intended to excite pity and to show how absurd the charge of the Sanhedrin was."
3. "Pilate failed utterly in this effort and did not dream that he was calling attention to the greatest figure of history, the Man of the ages."

### John Gill:
1. "with his temples scratched and torn with the thorny crown, and the blood running down from thence, and his face and eyes swollen with the blows he had received from their closed fists, and all besmeared with his own blood, and the soldiers' spittle." 
2. "behold the man; not their king, that would have provoked them; though he did say so afterwards, when he found he could not prevail upon them to agree to his release."
3. "and that he was a poor despicable man, as the condition he was in showed; and that it was a weak thing in them to fear anything with respect to any change of, or influence in, civil government from one that made such a figure; and therefore should be satisfied with what had been done to him, and dismiss him."
