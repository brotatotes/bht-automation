## BHT:
As different individuals in a mob report differently, Pilate's vacillation between Jesus' innocence and the fear of displeasing the Jews becomes apparent. The crucifixion request is picked up by the whole mob, highlighting their fiendish rage. Pilate, in ironic mockery, delivers Jesus entirely into their hands, asserting that he finds no fault in Him. When determined on evil, reason fails, and Pilate refuses to be their executioner. Unusually, the Jews desire the very type of death prophesied for the Messiah, causing Pilate to distance himself from their unrighteous actions.
