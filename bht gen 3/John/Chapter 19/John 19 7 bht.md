# John 19:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jewish leaders, in their pursuit of Jesus' death, accuse him of blasphemy, citing their own law as the reason for his condemnation.

The hostility towards Jesus has been long-standing, and now they exploit this opportunity to secure Pilate's consent. Let us be cautious of those who misuse Scripture to serve their own agenda and ensure the authority of God's Word remains intact.
