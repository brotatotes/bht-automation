## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This charge served to increase the fear which Pilate had before."
2. "The name Son of God served also to confirm the omen already furnished by the dream of his wife."
3. "That this fear was not a fear of the Jews, nor of acting unjustly, but of the Person of Jesus, is evident from what follows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the lofty sense evidently attached to it by His Jewish accusers"
2. "the dialogue he had already held with Him"
3. "the dream of his wife"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was the more afraid - What was the ground of his fear is not declared by the evangelist. It was probably, however, the alarm of his conscience, and the fear of vengeance if he suffered such an act of injustice to be done as to put an innocent man to death."
2. "He was convinced of his innocence. He saw more and more clearly the design of the Jews; and it is not improbable that a pagan, who believed that the gods often manifested themselves to people, dreaded their vengeance if he suffered one who claimed to be divine, and who might be, to be put to death."
3. "It is clear that Pilate was convinced that Jesus was innocent; and in this state of agitation between the convictions of his own conscience, and the clamors of the Jews, and the fear of vengeance, and the certainty that he would do wrong if he gave him up, he was thrown into this state of alarm, and resolved again to question Jesus, that he might obtain satisfaction on the subjects that agitated his mind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These words of the Jews produced an effect on Pilate for which they were not prepared."
2. "All that he had heard related of the miracles of Jesus, the mysterious character of His person, of His words and of His conduct, the strange message which he had just received from his wife - all is suddenly explained by the term 'Son of God.'"
3. "Was this extraordinary man truly a divine being who had appeared on the earth? The truth naturally presents itself to his mind in the form of pagan superstitions and mythological legends."

### John Calvin:
1. "Pilate dreaded lest some blame should be imputed to him, if a tumult arose, because he had not condemned Christ."
2. "After having heard the name of the Son of God, his mind was moved by religion."
3. "His mind was moved by religion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was already afraid because of his wife's message." 
2. "The claim of Jesus to deity excited Pilate's superstitious fears."

### John Gill:
1. "He was afraid to put him to death, or to consent to it before; partly on account of his wife's message to him, and partly upon a conviction of the innocence of Christ, in his own conscience." 
2. "He might be the more uneasy, lest the thing they charged him with asserting, should be really fact; that he was one of the gods come down in the likeness of man."
3. "He was strengthened... by calling to mind what he had lately said to him, that his kingdom was not of this world, and that he was come into it to bear witness to the truth."

### John Wesley:
1. He was the more afraid â€” He seems to have been afraid before of shedding innocent blood.
