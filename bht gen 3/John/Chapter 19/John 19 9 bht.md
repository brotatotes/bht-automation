## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Whence is thine origin? Observe that the fear of Pilate is not mere superstition, nor does it enter into the Jewish meaning of 'the Son of God:' but arises from an indefinite impression made on him by the Person and bearing of our Lord." 
2. "Our Lord, in His silence, was acting according to His own precept, Matt. vii. 6." 
3. "Notwithstanding Pilate‚Äôs fear of Him, he was not in earnest;‚Äînot determined to be led by his conscience, but had already given way to the unjust demands of the people."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whence art thou?‚Äîbeyond all doubt a question relating not to His mission but to His personal origin."
2. "He had said enough; the time for answering such a question was past."
3. "The weak and wavering governor is already on the point of giving way."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whence art thou?"
2. "See the notes at John 7:27."
3. "Jesus gave him no answer."

### John Calvin:
1. "It ought to be observed that, when he asks whence Christ is, he does not inquire about his country, but the meaning is, as if he had said, 'Art thou a man born on the earth, or art thou some god?'"
2. "This example is highly worthy of observation. Though the countenance of Christ was so disfigured, yet, as soon as Pilate hears the name of God, he is seized with the fear of violating the majesty of God in a man who was utterly mean and despicable."
3. "We ought not to think it strange that Jesus makes no reply; at least, if we keep in mind what I have formerly mentioned, that he did not stand before Pilate to plead his own cause, ‚Äî as is customary with persons accused who are desirous to be acquitted, ‚Äî but rather to suffer condemnation; for it was proper that he should be condemned, when he appeared in our room."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Whence art thou? (œÄŒøŒ∏ŒµŒΩ Œµ œÉœÖ;). Pilate knew that Jesus was from Galilee (Luke 23:6). He is really alarmed. See a like question by the Jews in John 8:25."
2. "Gave him no answer (Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπŒΩ ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµŒ¥œâŒ∫ŒµŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑœâ). See same idiom in John 1:22. ŒëœÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπœÇ (old word from Œ±œÄŒøŒ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒ±) occurs also in Luke 2:47; Luke 20:26."
3. "The silence of Jesus, like that before Caiaphas (Mark 14:61; Matthew 26:63) and Herod (Luke 23:9), irritates the dignity of Pilate in spite of his fears."

### John Gill:
1. "Whence art thou?...from whence he sprung, who were his ancestors, and whether his descent was from the gods, or from men." 
2. "For his question was frivolous, and deserved none; and besides, he was not worthy of one, who had used him so ill, when he knew, in his own conscience, that he was innocent."
3. "Since Christ was come to die for the salvation of his people, it was not proper he should say anything that might be a means of hindering it."

### John Wesley:
1. Whence art thou? ‚Äî That is, whose son art thou?

- Attempt 1 BHT: Pilate, driven by a mix of fear and curiosity, asks Jesus, Whence art thou? His question goes beyond Jesus' mission; he wants to know Jesus' personal origin. But Jesus remains silent, fulfilling His own teaching to not cast pearls before swine. Pilate's fear intensifies, yet he lacks sincere determination and has already succumbed to the unjust demands of the people. This exchange, similar to the Jews' question in John 8:25, deeply unsettles the weak governor, pushing him closer to conceding to the pressure. Jesus' silence not only irritates Pilate's dignity, but it also serves a higher purpose: He did not come to plead His own case but to be condemned in our place.

- Attempt 4 BHT: Questioning the origin of Jesus, Pilate's fear is not based on superstition or Jewish beliefs but arises from his impression of Jesus' person and demeanor. Jesus chooses to remain silent, acting in accordance with His own teaching of not casting pearls before swine. Pilate, though afraid, lacks sincerity and is already inclined to appease the crowd's demands. This question of origin is not about Jesus' mission but about His personal background, and Jesus' silence only amplifies Pilate's internal struggle.

- Attempt 5 BHT: Pilate, driven by fear and curiosity, asks Jesus about His origin. Jesus' silence in response to this question is intentional, aligning with His teaching not to cast pearls before swine.

This exchange reveals Pilate's wavering and weak character as he teeters on the brink of conceding. Jesus' silence serves a greater purpose, as He is not there to defend Himself but to be condemned on our behalf.
