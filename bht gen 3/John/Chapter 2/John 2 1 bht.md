- Attempt 1 BHT: On the third day, Jesus and his disciples arrived at a wedding in Cana of Galilee. The mother of Jesus was also there, perhaps because of her close connection with the family hosting the wedding. The specific names of the individuals involved are not mentioned by St. John, implying that they were already well-known. The wedding festivities extended over several days, as was the tradition, and it is likely that Mary and Jesus were invited to be part of this joyous celebration. The timing of their arrival was not coincidental, but rather divinely orchestrated to create an opportunity for Jesus to perform a miracle. The scarcity of wine at the wedding feast was a problem that needed divine intervention, and it provided the perfect backdrop for Jesus to display His glory and begin His ministry.
