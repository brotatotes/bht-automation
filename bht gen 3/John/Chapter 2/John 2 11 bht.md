## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "It was a miracle eminently shewing forth the glory of the Word, by whom all things were made, in His state of having become flesh."
3. "But never did a narrative present a more stubborn inflexibility to the wresters of Scripture:â€”never was simple historical veracity more strikingly stamped on any miracle than on this."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nothing in the least like this is said of the miracles of prophet or apostle, nor could without manifest blasphemy be said of any mere creature."
2. "As the miracle did not make bad good, but good better, so Christianity only redeems, sanctifies, and ennobles the beneficent but abused institution of marriage; and Christ's whole work only turns the water of earth into the wine of heaven."
3. "Thus 'this beginning of miracles' exhibited the character and 'manifested forth the glory' of His entire Mission."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a high honor given to marriage, that Christ not only deigned to be present at a nuptial banquet, but honored it with his first miracle."
2. "The proper time for displaying his glory was now come, when he wished to make himself known agreeably to the command of his Father. Hence, also, we learn the end of miracles."
3. "The faith which is now full grown had at first its infancy, nor is it so perfect in any as not to make it necessary that all to a man should make progress in believing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The miracles of Jesus, and all His works, manifested not only Godâ€™s glory, but His own: they were signs of what He is."
2. "Each miracle is a sign of what He is, not only in regard of the power by which it is wrought, but also by its own nature and character, in other words, it is a symbol of His work."
3. "The miracles in this Gospel, like the parables in the other Gospels, are a test of faith. They lead onward the believer to a deeper and firmer trust; they repel those who refuse to believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We have now passed from the 'witness' of the Baptist to the 'witness' of the works of Jesus" (Bernard).
2. "He selects eight in his Gospel by which to prove the deity of Christ" (John 20:30) of which this is the first.
