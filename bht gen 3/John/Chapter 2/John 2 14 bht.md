# John 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The market that emerged in the temple allowed Jews from distant places to conveniently obtain animals for sacrifice and exchange foreign money into sacred shekels. However, this market brought an unsuitable combination of sacred and profane transactions, which Jesus addresses through the cleansing of the temple. By driving out those who sold animals and overturning the tables of money-changers, Jesus protests against the desecration, emphasizing his mission to reform worship abuses and restore reverence for God's glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This market appears to have sprung up since the captivity, with a view to the convenience of those Jews who came from a distance, to provide them with the beasts for offering, and to change their foreign money into the sacred shekel." 
2. "The very fact of the market being held there would produce an unseemly mixture of sacred and profane transactions, even setting aside the abuses which would be certain to be mingled with the traffic."
3. "It is to the former of these evils that our Lord makes reference in this first cleansing; in the second, to the latter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "in the templeâ€”not the
temple itself, but the temple-court."
2. "sold oxen, &amp;c.â€”for
	the convenience of those who had to offer them in sacrifice."

Roman into Jewish money, in which the temple dues had to be paid."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "On each occasion he showed that his great regard was for the pure worship of his Father; and one great design of his coming was to reform the abuses which had crept into that worship, and to bring man to a proper regard for the glory of God."
2. "If it be asked how it was that those engaged in this traffic so readily yielded to Jesus of Nazareth, and that they left their gains and their property, and fled from the temple at the command of one so obscure as he was, it may be replied..."
3. "Though Jesus thus purified the temple at the commencement of his ministry, yet in three years the same scene was to be repeated."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The kindred noun kerma, money, which occurs only in ver. 15, is from keirw, to cut into bits, and means therefore small coin; 'small change,' of which the money-changers would require a large supply." 
2. "Hence changers of money means, strictly, dealers in small change."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Those that sold... They were in the Court of the Gentiles within the temple precinct... Probably their very presence in his Father's house angered Jesus." 
2. "The Synoptics record a similar incident... If there was only one, it would seem more natural at the close. But why could it not occur at the beginning also?"
3. "Here it is an obvious protest by Christ at the beginning of his ministry as in the Synoptics it is an indignant outcry against the desecration."

### John Gill:
1. "But in the court of the Gentiles, or the outward court, even all that space of ground which was between the wall which divided the whole from common ground, and the buildings of the temple, and which was open to the air."
2. "the oxen, or bullocks, were for the Chagigah, or feast kept on the second day of the passover; and the sheep, or lambs, as the Persic version reads, for the passover supper; and the doves were for the offerings of the poorer sort of new mothers"
3. "the changers of money sitting: who changed foreign money into the current coin of the Jews, strangers coming, at this feast, from several parts of the world; and sometimes there was need of changing shekels into half shekels"
