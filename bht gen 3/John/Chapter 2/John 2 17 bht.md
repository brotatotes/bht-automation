## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "His zeal for God and God's Church resulted in the buffeting, the scourging, the Cross."

2. "rising high even in some not worthy to loose the latchet of His shoes"
3. "Exodus 32:19, &amp;c."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Hath eaten me up - Hath absorbed me, or engaged my entire attention and affection; hath surpassed all other feelings, so that it may be said to be the one great absorbing affection and desire of the mind."
3. "There is no combination of wicked men, and no form of depravity, that can stand before the faithful, zealous, pure preaching of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It was written [Œ≥ŒµŒ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ] . Literally, it stands written. This form of the phrase, the participle with the substantive verb, is peculiar to John in place of the more common gegraptai."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are at the same time reminded, that when God holds us as it were in suspense, it is our duty to wait for the time of more abundant knowledge, and to restrain the excessive haste which is natural to us; for the reason why God delays the full manifestation of his works is, that he may keep us humble."
2. "Accordingly, the Evangelist says, that this was one of the marks by which the disciples knew that it was Jesus who protected and restored the kingdom of God. Now observe that they followed the guidance of Scripture, in order to form such an opinion concerning Christ as they ought to entertain; and, indeed, no man will ever learn what Christ is, or the object of what he did and suffered, unless he has been taught and guided by Scripture."
3. "Now as Paul informs us that, in the example of the head, a general doctrine is presented to the whole body, (Romans 15:3,) let each of us apply to the invitation of Christ, that ‚Äî so far as lies in our power ‚Äî we may not permit the temple of God to be in any way polluted. But, at the same time, we must beware lest any man transgress the bounds of his calling."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The zeal of Thine house consumed me: and the reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on me. The parallelism of the lines shows that the chief antithesis lies in the pronouns. Dishonour shown to God has been felt by the psalmist as a cruel wrong to himself."
2. "Zealous indignation for Thine house, inspired by the sight or news of unworthy treatment of Thine house, consumed me, so to say, destroyed my very life."
3. "His zeal for His Father‚Äôs house will devour His very life-will bring destruction in its train."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The disciples are helped, the traders are angered."
2. "The zeal for thy house."
3. "Shall eat me up."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is represented in it, as suffering for the sins of his people; for he himself was innocent; and was hated without a cause; but having the sins of his people imputed to him, he made satisfaction for them, and so restored what he took not away." 
2. "Such was Christ's regard to his Father's house, and which was typical of the church of God; and such his concern for his honour, ordinances, and worship, that when he saw the merchandise that was carried on in the temple, his zeal, which was a true and hearty affection for God, and was according to knowledge, was stirred up in him, and to such a degree, that it was like a consuming fire within him, that ate up his spirits; so that he could not forbear giving it vent, and expressing it in the manner he did, by driving those traders out of it."
3. "And he also showed a zeal for the discipline of God's house, by his severe reflections on human traditions; by asserting the spirituality of worship; by commanding a strict regard to divine institutions; and by sharply inveighing against the sins of professors of religion."

### John Wesley:
1.  Psalm 69:9.
