# John 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus drives out the abomination from the temple, the Jews demand a sign from Him to justify His actions and mission. They are unconvinced by the act and words of Jesus, asking for further evidence. Jesus responds with a challenging tone, urging them to destroy the temple. His words carry a double meaning, referring to the literal temple and His own person as the holy dwelling-place of God. This exchange highlights the skepticism and lack of faith of the Jews, who fail to recognize the sign in Jesus' cleansing of the temple.

### John Gill:
1. "It is surprising, that they did not rise up and destroy him at once, a single man, unarmed, and without assistance, having so highly provoked them; the restraint upon them must be his almighty power."
2. "They argued, that either he did these things of himself, by his own authority, and then they must be deemed rash and unjustifiable; or he did it by the authority of others."
3. "Then they insisted upon a sign or miracle to be wrought, to prove that God was his Father, as he suggested; and that he was the proprietor and owner of the temple, and had a right to purge it, as he had done."

### John Wesley:
1. "What sign showest thou?" - So they require a miracle, to confirm a miracle!
