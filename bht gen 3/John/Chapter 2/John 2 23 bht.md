# John 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the people witnessed the miracles Jesus was performing, their belief in Him was not yet a firm decision but based on the signs they saw. The specific miracles are not recorded, but they were powerful demonstrations of Jesus' authority and His name as the Messiah. These signs led many to believe in Jesus, recognizing Him as the teacher sent from God. While this initial belief was significant, it remained to be seen whether it would develop into a genuine and steadfast trust in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They believed on Him, but not firmly. Those converts believed in a stricter sense, who believed not owing to the miracles only, but owing to His teaching." 
2. "What miracles these were, is not related:‚Äîcertainly some notable ones, see ch, iii. 2."
3. "The mention of them precludes us from understanding ch. iv. 54, as indicating that the healing of the ruler‚Äôs son was absolutely His second miracle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Superficially, struck merely by 'the miracles He did.'" 
2. "Of these we have no record."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Feast-day - Feast. During the celebration of the Passover, which continued eight days."
2. "Miracles which he did - These miracles are not particularly recorded."
3. "We should always seek and embrace opportunities of doing good, and we should not be 'deterred,' but rather 'excited,' by the multitude around us to make known our real sentiments on the subject of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Believe on His name, compare believe on Him...to believe on the name is rather to believe in Him as being that which he claims to be, in this case the Messiah. It is believing recognition rather than appropriation."
2. "Their faith in His name (as that of the Messiah) did not yet amount to any decision of their inner life for Jesus, but was only an opinion produced by the sight of His miracles, that He was the Messiah" (Meyer).
3. "He did [ŒµœÄŒøŒπŒµŒπ]. Better, was doing; the imperfect denoting the wonderful works as in progress."

### John Calvin:
1. "This appearance of faith, which hitherto was fruitless, might ultimately be changed into true faith, and might be a useful preparation for celebrating the name of Christ among others."
2. "For hypocrites assent to the Gospel, not that they may devote themselves in obedience to Christ, nor that with sincere piety they may follow Christ when he calls them, but because they do not venture to reject entirely the truth which they have known."
3. "Miracles do indeed assist the children of God in arriving at the truth; but it does not amount to actual believing, when they admire the power of God so as merely to believe that it is true, but not to subject themselves wholly to it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In this verse we pass from the public presentation of Jesus to the people and ‚Äòthe Jews‚Äô in the house of His Father to His more private ministry in Jerusalem: rejected as the Son of God, He continues His work as a Prophet, doing many ‚Äòsigns,‚Äô and by these leading many to faith in His mission."
2. "The words would also point to our Lord‚Äôs observing the feast Himself. It is noticeable that we do not here read ‚Äòthe Passover of the Jews:‚Äô the desecration of the festival has been condemned in one of its manifestations, but the festival itself is honored."
3. "The signs attested His words, which were the description of His ‚Äòname‚Äô (see chap. John 1:12), and, beholding the signs, many became believers in His name, accepting Him as being in truth what He declared Himself to be."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Believed on his name (ŒµœÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœÖœÉŒ±ŒΩ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ). See on John 1:12 for this phrase. Only one has to watch for the real import of œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœÖœâ."
2. "Beholding his signs (Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒµœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ œÑŒ± œÉŒ∑ŒºŒµŒπŒ±). Present active participle (causal use) of Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒµœâ."
3. "Which he did (Œ± ŒµœÄŒøŒπŒµ). 'Which he was doing' (imperfect tense). He did his first sign in Cana, but now he was doing many in Jerusalem."

### John Gill:
1. "and the feast to be the particular feast of the first day of it, which was the fifteenth; to which may be added, that on this day all the males made their appearance in court... and so was a very proper time for Christ to work his miracles in, when there were so many spectators."
2. "though the modern ones, in order to shift off the evidence of Jesus being the Messiah, from his miracles, deny that miracles are the characteristic of the Messiah, or will be performed by him; at least, that there is no necessity of them to prove him to be the person."
3. "being surprised at the marvellous things he did, and upon the evidence of these extraordinary works, there were many that concluded he must be come from God."

### John Wesley:
1. Many believed ‚Äî That he was a teacher sent from God.

However, these signs and wonders were instrumental in leading many to have faith in His mission. Although the specific miracles are not recorded, they were indicative of His power and authority. The timing of these miracles, taking place during the feast when there were many witnesses, heightened the impact and caused many to conclude that Jesus was a teacher sent from God.
