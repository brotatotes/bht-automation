## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "The Lord here most effectually and once for all stamps with His condemnation that false system of moral reformation, which would commence by pledges to abstain from intoxicating liquors."
2. "He pours out His bounty for all, and He vouchsafes His grace to each for guidance; and to endeavor to evade the work which He has appointed for each man,‚Äîby refusing the bounty, to save the trouble of seeking the grace, is an attempt which inst ever end in degradation of the individual motives, and in social demoralization."
3. "The filling with water,‚Äîand drawing out wine, is all that is related. ‚ÄòThe moment of the miracle,‚Äô says L√ºcke, ‚Äòis rather understood than expressed. It seems to lie between vv. 7 and 8‚Äô (i. 471). The process of it is wholly out of the region of our imagination."

2. "If there had been only two or three jars, many might have suspected that they had been brought from some other place."
3. "And in the present day, when the light of the Gospel shines so clearly around us, they are not ashamed to practice those tricks, which certainly is not to deceive by enchantments, but daringly to mock men as if they were blind."

### Philip Schaff:
