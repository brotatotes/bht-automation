# John 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servants were instructed to fill the waterpots with water, which they did obediently, filling them up to the brim. This may have seemed absurd at first, as they already had an abundance of water, but Jesus often acts in unexpected ways to display his power. By using the waterpots, which were only used for water, there was no room for suspicion that any wine had been left in them. The vessels were filled to their maximum capacity, ensuring that nothing else could be infused into them. Through this miracle, Jesus was able to provide an abundant supply of wine for the feast and demonstrate his ability to fulfill the needs of the people.
