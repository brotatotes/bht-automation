## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ruler of the feast seems to be the same with the 'master of a feast'." 
2. "It would seem, from the place in Ecclesiasticus, that he was one of the guests raised to the post of presiding over the arrangements of the feast." 
3. "Here, he tastes the wine; and therefore probably was a guest himself."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Jesus made no parade about it, and it does not even appear that he approached the waterpots."
3. "This was a clear exertion of divine power, and made in such a manner as to leave no doubt of its reality."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb, therefore, originally, means to bale out bilge - water; thence, generally, to draw, as from a well."
2. "Some explain the word as meaning the superintendent of the banqueting - chamber, a servant whose duty it was to arrange the table - furniture and the courses, and to taste the food beforehand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Still there is nothing in the text that leads necessarily to this interpretation; while the language of John 2:9, ‚Äòthe servants which had drawn the water,‚Äô distinctly suggests that what they drew was water, which, either as soon as drawn, or as soon as presented to the guests, became wine."
2. "The original word is simply ‚Äòdraw,‚Äô or ‚Äòdraw water.‚Äô This would seem to suggest that the servants were sent again to the spring or fountain from which they had drawn the water to fill the waterpots."
3. "First, the vessels set for the purifying of the Jews are completely filled. Nothing is neglected that can be needed to prepare for all ceremonial requirements. There the water rests, and rests unchanged. Not till now is the water drawn for the thirsty guests, in bowls filled, not from vessels of purification, but at the spring itself; it is borne to the ruler of the feast, and it is wine!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The servants seem bidden to draw from the large water-jars now full of water. Apparently the water was still water when it came out of the jars, but was changed to wine before reaching the guests. The water in the jars remained water." 
2. "The Œ±œÅœáŒπœÑœÅŒπŒ∫ŒªŒπŒΩŒøœÇ was originally the superintendent of the dining-room who arranged the couches and tasted the food, not the toast-master." 
3. "Apparently not knowing at first that they bore wine."

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as ever the vessels were filled with water, without any more delay, he ordered the servants to draw out of those larger, into lesser vessels." 
2. "He does not say what, water or wine." 
3. "The servants having drawn out of the stone vessels, by cocks, into smaller ones, carried the liquor, as they were ordered, to the above person."
