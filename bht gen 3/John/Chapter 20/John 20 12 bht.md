## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What wonder, if the heavenly hosts were variously and often visible on this great day, when ‚Äòthe morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?'" 
2. "What can be more accurate in detail than this description of the vision of Mary?" 
3. "They are in white, because from the world of light: they sit, as not defending, but peacefully watching the Body: at the Head and the Feet, for the Body of the Lord was from head to foot in the charge of His Father and of His servants."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "They are going to point out to her the incongruity."

### Marvin Vincent:

Angels. Angels are rarely mentioned in John's narrative. See John 1:51; John 12:29; John 20:12.


### John Calvin:
1. "For it is no small honor which he confers on them by sending his angels, and, at length, making himself known to them, which he had not done to the apostles."
2. "In white garments. Whether Mary knew them to be angels, or thought that they were men, is uncertain...by the dress of the angels God pointed out something remarkable and uncommon, and put marks on them, as it were, that they might be distinguished from men."
3. "One angel only is mentioned by Matthew...There is no good ground for Augustine's allegory, that the position of the angels ‚Äî one at the head, and the other at the feet ‚Äî pointed out that the Gospel would be preached from the East to the West."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô garments are the symbol of purity and glory."
2. "That one of the angels was ‚Äòat the head‚Äô and the other ‚Äò at the feet‚Äô where the body of Jesus had lain,' is to be regarded as expressive of the fact that the body was wholly under the guardianship of Heaven."
3. "If, however, they may exist, their manifestation of themselves must be regarded as also possible; and the manner of the manifestation their appearing to some and not to others, their appearing suddenly and then as suddenly disappearing is to be looked at as dependent upon laws of which we can say nothing, because we have ourselves no practical experience of them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter and John had not seen the two angels. Westcott suggests an 'economy' in such manifestations as the explanations." 
2. "Better our own ignorance as to the reason why only the women saw them." 
3. "Angels were commonly believed to be clad in white."

### John Gill:
1. "And seeth two angels in white...whom he calls men, because they appeared in an human form, and in shining garments, or white apparel..."
2. "...good angels, or ministering spirits, are clothed in white, expressive of their spotless purity and innocence..."
3. "Sitting the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain..."
