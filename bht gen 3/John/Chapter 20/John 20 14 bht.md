# John 20:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary, overwhelmed with sorrow, did not initially recognize Jesus who stood before her. Her tears acted as a veil, obscuring her vision of the Living One. In her grief-stricken state, her focus was on her loss rather than expecting His presence. It was as if her tears prevented her from perceiving the reality in front of her. Yet, when Jesus called her by name, she turned and saw Him, experiencing a deep, spiritual recognition. This encounter teaches us that we must remain open to the unexpected ways in which Christ reveals Himself, for His spiritual presence may not always align with our assumptions or expectations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Her tears wove a veil, which concealed Him who stood before her. The seeking after the Dead prevents us from seeing the Living."
2. "She did not recognize our Lord... she did not expect Him to be there, and was wholly preoccupied with other thoughts."
3. "It seems to me that while she was saying these words, the sudden appearance of Christ behind her struck the angels, who saw their Lord, with amazement."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But Mary, arriving perhaps by another direction after they left, lingers at the spot, weeping for her missing Lord."
2. "As she gazes through her tears on the open tomb, she also ventures to stoop down and look into it, when lo! 'two angels in white' appear to her in a 'sitting' posture."
3. "As having finished some business, and awaiting someone to impart tidings to."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Knew not that it was Jesus - She was not expecting to see him. It was yet also twilight, and she could not see distinctly.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We can imagine also that she became conscious of another Presence, as we often feel the approach of a visitor without distinctly seeing or hearing him."
2. "She looks at Him steadfastly and inquiringly as at a stranger."
3. "Indicating a knowledge based on spiritual fellowship and affinity, an inward, conscious, sure conviction of His identity."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is in the power of God... to lessen their sharpness of vision whenever he thinks proper, that seeing they may not see."
2. "In Mary we have an example of the mistakes into which the human mind frequently falls."
3. "Though Christ presents himself to our view, yet we imagine that he assumes various shapes, so that our senses conceive of anything rather than of the true Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That she did not know Jesus must, therefore, have proceeded from some other cause."
2. "The idea that Jesus had risen from the grave had not yet dawned upon her... no supposition lay so near as that it was the gardener who had drawn near."
3. "Her ‚Äòeyes were holden‚Äô that she should not discern her Lord. She was not yet ready for any such recognition as might correspond to the new stage of existence upon which He had entered."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "She turned herself back (ŒµœÉœÑœÅŒ±œÜŒ∑ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ± ŒøœÄŒπœÉœâ)."
2. "In the disappearance of the aorist middle before the aorist passive see Robertson, Grammar, p.817."
3. "Instinctively Mary felt the presence of some one behind her."

### John Gill:
1. "So sometimes, in a spiritual sense, Christ is with, and near his people, and they know it not." 
2. "The spiritual presence of Christ, is more or less, in some way or another, always in all his churches, and among his dear people."
3. "nor does he appear to them always in the same form; sometimes against them, at least in their apprehensions, nor always in a manner agreeably to their expectations."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Mary, consumed with grief and unaware of the living presence before her, was unable to recognize Jesus at first. Her tears obscured her vision, preventing her from seeing the one she sought. It was as if a veil had been woven by her sorrow, blinding her to the truth. In her desperation, she assumed the man before her was the gardener, unaware of the miraculous resurrection that had taken place. But as she turned back and gazed at Him, she felt an instinctive awareness of another presence. It was only when Jesus, with compassion and familiarity, spoke her name that she truly saw Him. This encounter serves as a reminder that Christ's spiritual presence is not always recognized or understood by His people, often appearing differently from what we expect or imagine.
