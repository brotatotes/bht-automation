# John 20:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary, overwhelmed by her love for Jesus, fails to recognize Him and mistakes Him for the gardener. Her focus is solely on finding the earthly body of Christ, disregarding the divine power of His resurrection. However, her deep affection and relentless pursuit of Jesus evoke the image of a truly gracious soul that eagerly seeks Him. Just as Mary's love compelled her to fervently pursue Jesus, so too should we wholeheartedly seek after His presence, cherishing Him above all else.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We must believe the clothing of His risen Body to have been that which He pleased to assume; not earthly clothing, but perhaps some semblance of it." 
2. "Certainly, in this case, He was clothed;‚Äîor she must at once have recognized Him."
3. "She forgets her lack of strength for this, in the overbearing force of her love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It reminds one of the question of the Spouse, 'Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?'" (Commentary)
2. "Wilt thou, dear fragile woman? But it is the language of sublime affection, that thinks itself fit for anything if once in possession of its Object." (Commentary)
3. "Like Joseph, He can no longer restrain Himself." (Commentary)

### John Calvin:
1. "We see that Mary has no view of this matter but what is earthly."
2. "She desires only to obtain the dead body of Christ, that she may keep it hidden in the sepulcher."
3. "She leaves out the most important matter, the elevation of her mind to the divine power of his resurrection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The object of the questions seems to be, to recall Mary to herself and to awaken more deliberate thought."
2. "She is confounded by all that has happened, overwhelmed by her emotions, and hence unable to judge justly of what she is to see."
3. "So much is Mary absorbed in her own thoughts, and so completely is her mind filled with one great subject, that she imagines that every one must at once enter into her feelings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sir (ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒµ). Clearly not 'Lord' here, for she thought him to be 'the gardener' (Œø Œ∫Œ∑œÄŒøœÖœÅŒøœÇ), old word (Œ∫Œ∑œÄŒøœÉ, ŒøœÖœÅŒøœÇ), keeper of the garden, only here in the N.T."
2. "If thou hast borne him hence (Œµ œÉœÖ ŒµŒ≤Œ±œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒøœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ). Condition of the first class. Note emphasis on œÉœÖ (thou). A new idea struck Mary as mistaken as the other one. Jesus had repeated the question of the angels, but she did not recognize him."
3. "And I (Œ∫Œ±Œ≥œâ). Emphasis and crasis."

### John Gill:
1. "She supposing him to be the gardener... she could not imagine that Joseph should be there so early in the morning, but might reasonably think the gardener was." 
2. "She addresses him, though she took him to be but the gardener, in a very civil and courteous manner; which was rightly judged, especially since she had a favour to ask of him."
3. "So in a spiritual sense, a truly gracious soul is willing to do anything, and to be at any trouble, so that it may but enjoy Christ; it dearly loves him, as this good woman did; it early, and earnestly, and with its whole heart, seeks after him, as she did; and absence of him, or loss of his presence for a while, sharpens the desire after him, and makes his presence the more welcome."
