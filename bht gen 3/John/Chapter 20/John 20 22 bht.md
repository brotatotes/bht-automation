## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The presence of the Lord among them now was a slight and temporary fulfilment of His promise of returning to them; and so the imparting of the Spirit now, was a symbol and foretaste of that which they should receive at Pentecost."
2. "This giving of the Spirit was not the Spiritâ€™s personal imparting of Himself to them, but only a partial instilling of His influence."
3. "The very same word in the LXX version is that in Gen. ii. 7, expressing the act of God in the original infusion of the spirit of life into man. This act is now by God Incarnate repeated, sacramentally representing the infusion of the new life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He breathed on themâ€”a symbolical conveyance to them of the Spirit."
2. "Receive ye the Holy Ghostâ€”an earnest and first-fruits of the more copious Pentecostal effusion."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was customary for the prophets to use some significant act to represent the nature of their message."
2. "In this case the act of breathing was used to represent the nature of the influence that would come upon them, and the source of that influence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Breathed on them [ÎµÎ½ÎµÏ†Ï…ÏƒÎ·ÏƒÎµÎ½]. Only here in the New Testament. The act was symbolic, after the manner of the Hebrew prophets."

### John Calvin:
1. "We need not be astonished, therefore, that no man is found qualified unless he be inspired by the Holy Spirit; for no man can speak a word concerning Christ unless the Spirit guide his tongue, (1 Corinthians 12:3;) so far is it from being true that there is any man who is competent to discharge faithfully and honestly all the duties of so excellent an office."
2. "What Christ chiefly, however, intended by it was, to uphold the dignity of the rank of the Apostles; for it was reasonable that those, who had been chosen to be the earliest and most distinguished preachers of the Gospel, should possess uncommon authority."
3. "Let us therefore learn, that all the sacraments which men have contrived are nothing else than absolute mockeries or frivolous amusements, because the signs can have no truth unless they be accompanied by the word of the Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The gift now bestowed is, therefore, not simply symbolical but real: at that moment the Spirit was given."
2. "The gift, too, was imparted not to apostles only, but to all the disciples present; it is a gift not for the ministry alone, but for the whole Church of Christ."
3. "The former thought is important in relation to the development of the disciples: the latter in its connection with John 20:23, and especially in its presentation of the Redeemer as Himself the Giver of the Holy Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He breathed on them... It was a symbolic art with the same word used in the LXX when God breathed the breath of life upon Adam." (Quote 1)
2. "Jesus gives the disciples a foretaste of the great pentecost." (Quote 2)
3. "No real distinction is to be observed, for Holy Spirit is treated as a proper name with or without the article." (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "And when he had said this,.... That is, declared he sent them forth in like manner as his Father sent him:
he breathed on them; in allusion to God's breathing the breath of life into man, at his creation;"
2. "And saith unto them, receive ye the Holy Ghost; meaning not the grace of the Holy Ghost in regeneration, which they had received already; but the gifts of the Spirit, to qualify them for the work he now sent them to do, and which were not now actually bestowed;"
3. "Hence it appears, that it is the Spirit of God, who, by his gifts and grace, makes and qualifies men to be ministers of the Gospel; and our Lord by this action, and these words, gives a very considerable proof of his deity."

### John Wesley:
1. "He breathed on them - New life and vigour."
2. "As ye receive this breath out of my mouth, so receive ye the Spirit out of my fulness."
3. "The Holy Ghost influencing you in a peculiar manner, to fit you for your great embassy."
