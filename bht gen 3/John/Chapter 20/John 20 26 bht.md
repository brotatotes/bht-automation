## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The eight days‚Äô interval is the first testimony of the recurring day of the resurrection being commemorated by the disciples." 
2. "It forms however an interesting opening of the history of THE LORD'S DAY, that the Lord Himself should have thus selected and honoured it."
3. "The whole narrative points out the same place as before."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They probably met every day during the preceding week."
2. "Their Lord designedly reserved His second appearance among them till the recurrence of His resurrection day."
3. "That He might thus inaugurate the delightful sanctities of THE LORD'S DAY."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "His repeated presence gave such a sanction, and the historical fact is indisputable that from this time this day was observed as the Christian Sabbath."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Then came Jesus. There is no connecting particle, then, and the verb is in the present tense. The abrupt Jesus cometh is more graphic.


### John Calvin:
1. "When Christ so readily yields to the improper request of Thomas, and, of his own accord, invites him to feel his hands, and touch the wound of his side, we learn from this how earnestly desirous he was to promote our faith and that of Thomas; for it was not to Thomas only, but to us also, that he looked, that nothing might be wanting which was necessary for confirming our faith."
2. "Thus it happens that, when we render to the word of God less honor than is due to it, there steals upon us, without our knowledge, a glowing obstinacy, which brings along with it a contempt of the word of God, and makes us lose all reverence for it."
3. "We ought, therefore, to be most zealously on our guard not to fall from faith; and yet we ought to believe that God restrains his elect by secret bridle, that they may not fall to their destruction, and that He always cherishes miraculously in their hearts some sparks of faith, which He afterwards, at the proper time, kindles anew by the breath of his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That the apostles were assembled on the Sunday appears to indicate that they already regarded the host day of the week as a day which the Risen Lord would peculiarly bless."
2. "Jesus cometh when the doors had been shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you."
3. "All is the same as at John 20:19."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After eight days (ŒºŒµŒ∏' Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±œÇ ŒøŒ∫œÑœâ). That is the next Sunday evening, on the eighth day in reality just like 'after three days' and 'on the third day.'"
2. "Within (ŒµœÉœâ). Apparently in the same room as before."
3. "Cometh (ŒµœÅœáŒµœÑŒ±). Vivid dramatic present. The other items precisely as in verse John 20:19 save Thomas was with them."

### John Gill:
1. "And it also shows Thomas's regard to them, and affection for them, by meeting with them, though he had not the same faith in the resurrection of Christ."
2. "Christ has his set times to himself, when he will appear and manifest himself to his people."

- Attempt 1 BHT: On the eighth day, the disciples gathered together, and it is believed that they had been meeting daily in the preceding week. As they assembled on this significant day, Jesus appeared among them once again.
