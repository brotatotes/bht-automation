## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "We need not wonder that, having passed through a week so rich in training power, Thomas, when he did behold the Risen Lord, should have leaped at once from his former unbelief to faith in its highest stage, or that he should have exclaimed to Jesus, 'My Lord and my God.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
