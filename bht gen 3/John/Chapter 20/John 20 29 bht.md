## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "'Thou hast indeed believed; it is well: it is only on the evidence of thy senses, and after peremptorily refusing all evidence short of that.'" 
2. "Wonderful indeed and rich in blessing for us who have not seen Him, is this closing word of the Gospel." 
3. "And indeed, as the Lord pronounced them blessed who not having seen Him have yet believed, so for that one end have the whole contents of this Gospel been recorded, that all who read it may believe on Him, and believing, have life in that blessed name."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus here approves the faith of Thomas, but more highly commends the faith of those who should believe without having seen."
2. "Blessed - Happy, or worthy of the divine approbation. The word has here the force of the comparative degree, signifying that they would be in some respects more blessed than Thomas."
3. "Those who should be convinced by the testimony of the apostles, and by the influences of the Spirit. They would evince stronger faith. All faith is of things not seen; and God blesses those most who most implicitly rely on his word."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Thomas. Omit.


### John Calvin:
1. "Faith cannot flow from a merely experimental knowledge of events, but must draw its origin from the word of God."
2. "Here Christ commends faith on this ground, that it acquiesces in the bare word, and does not depend on carnal views or human reason."
3. "Faith is not of a right kind, unless it be founded on the word of God, and rise to the invisible kingdom of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast is of a deeper kind, between a faith resting entirely upon outward evidence of Divine claims, and a faith rising higher and resting upon that intuitive perception of the Divine in Jesus which is afforded by the consideration of what He is in Himself as the Crucified and Risen Lord."
2. "Thus to us, who are separated by many centuries from the time when the Lord was personally present in the world, is the blessed assurance given that, though we have not seen Him, we may love Him; and that, though now we see Him not, we may rejoice in Him with a joy unspeakable and glorified."
3. "The more we penetrate through the outward to the inward, through the flesh to the spirit, through communion with the earthly to communion with the heavenly Lord, the more do we learn to know the fullness that is in Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was sight, not touch that convinced Thomas."
2. "Thomas made a noble confession, but he missed the highest form of faith without the evidence of the senses."
3. "Peter uses language that seems like a reminiscence of the words of Jesus to Thomas which Peter heard."

### John Gill:
1. "If thou seest not, thou wilt not believe."
2. "From hence may be observed, that Christ allows of the epithets and titles given him by Thomas, and therefore must be Lord and God."
3. "Now such are happy that have true faith [...] for they enjoy many blessings now, as a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin, adoption, freedom of access to God, and security from condemnation; they have spiritual peace, joy, and comfort in their souls, and shall at last be saved with an everlasting salvation."
