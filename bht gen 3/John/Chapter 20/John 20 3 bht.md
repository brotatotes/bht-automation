### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word rendered 'went forth' is so often used in this Gospel in regard to the most solemn events in the life of Jesus, as implying a Divine mission, the accomplishment of a Divine purpose..."
2. "It is possible also that there is design in the manner in which the names of the two apostles are introduced: not 'Peter and the other disciple went forth,' but 'Peter went forth, and the other disciple.'"
