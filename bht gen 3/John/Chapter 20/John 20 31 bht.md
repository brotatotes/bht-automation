## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mere miracle-faith, so often reproved by our Lord, is not that intended here. This is faith in Himself, as the Christ the Son of God."
2. "The Evangelist means, that enough is related in this book to be a ground for such a faith, by shewing us His glory manifested forth."
3. "These words (see Acts iv. 10; 1 Cor. vi. 11) describe the whole standing of the faithful man in Christ,‚Äîby which and in which he has life eternal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But these are written‚Äîas sufficient specimens."
2. "the Christ, the Son of God‚Äîthe one His official, the other His personal, title."
3. "believing... may have life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole scope or end of the book is to accomplish two objects." 
2. "This point had not been kept in view so directly by either of the other evangelists."
3. "If this design of John is kept steadily in view, it will throw much light on the book, and the argument is unanswerable, framed after the strictest rules of reasoning, infinitely beyond the skill of man, and having throughout the clearest evidence of demonstration."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Are written [Œ≥ŒµŒ≥œÅŒ±œÄœÑŒ±Œπ] . Have been or stand written. The perfect tense. John's intent was to write a gospel rather than a biography. 


### John Calvin:
1. "No other use is here assigned to miracles than to be the aids and supports of faith; for they serve to prepare the minds of men, that they may cherish greater reverence for the word of God."
2. "Faith does not confine its view to miracles, but carries us direct to the word."
3. "He who, after having received those striking proofs, which are to be found in the Gospel, does not perceive Christ to be God, does not deserve to look even at the sun and the earth, for he is blind amidst the brightness of noonday."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The book has had precisely this effect of continuous and successive confirmation of faith in Jesus Christ through the ages."
2. "Jesus is the Son of God with all that this high term implies, the Logos of John 1:1-18 (the Prologue). 'Very God of very God,' Incarnate Revealer of God."
3. "Life (Œ∂œâŒ∑ŒΩ) is eternal life so often mentioned in this Gospel, life to be found only in the name (and power) of Jesus Christ the Son of God."

### John Gill:
1. "that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God"
2. "believers have their spiritual and eternal life through Christ"
3. "faith is the way and means in which they enjoy it"

### John Wesley:
1. But these things are written that ye may believe ‚Äî That ye may be confirmed in believing. Faith cometh sometimes by reading; though ordinarily by hearing.
