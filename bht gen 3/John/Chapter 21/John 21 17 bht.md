# John 21:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter was deeply grieved by the third time Jesus asked him if he loved Him, as it reminded him of his own three denials. Jesus' deliberate repetition of Peter's own words was a probing incision into his wounded heart, bringing to light the weight of his denials. However, Jesus, the omniscient Physician, used this interaction to dispel the lingering shame and restore Peter completely, affirming his love and commissioning him to continue His work without the cloud of past failures.
