2. "when Christ was magnified, and God was glorified by his zeal and courage, faith and patience, constancy and perseverance to the end"

"follow me: which may be understood literally, Jesus now rising up, and ordering him to come after him; and yet as a sign of his following him, in a spiritual sense, exercising every grace upon him, discharging every duty towards him, faithfully and constantly performing his work and office, as an apostle and preacher of the Gospel, in which he had now reinstated and confirmed him, and patiently bearing and suffering all kind of reproach, persecution, and death, for his name's sake."

### John Wesley:
1. By what death he should glorify God â€” It is not only by acting, but chiefly by suffering, that the saints glorify God.
Follow me â€” Showing hereby likewise what death he should die.
