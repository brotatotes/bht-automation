- Attempt 3 BHT: The details surrounding this verse are obscure, leaving room for speculation about the narrative.

However, despite the ambiguity, Peter immediately followed Jesus as directed. It is clear that the disciple whom Jesus loved had a unique familiarity with Him, as shown by his leaning back and whispering to Jesus during a supper.
