## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words what is that to thee? imply a rebuke;‚Äînot perhaps however so sharp a one as has been sometimes seen in them."
2. "His appointed lot is no element in thy onward course: it is ME that thou must follow."
3. "At the destruction of Jerusalem began that mighty series of events of which the Apocalypse is the prophetic record, and which is in the complex known as the ‚ÄòCOMING OF THE LORD,‚Äô ending, as it shall, with His glorious and personal Advent."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From the fact that John alone of the Twelve survived the destruction of Jerusalem, and so witnessed the commencement of that series of events which belongs to 'the last days,' many good interpreters think that this is a virtual prediction of fact, and not a mere supposition."
2. "It seems more natural to consider our Lord as intending to give no positive indication of John's fate at all, but to signify that this was a matter which belonged to the Master of both, who would disclose or conceal it as He thought proper, and that Peter's part was to mind his own affairs."
3. "Observe the absolute disposal of human life which Christ claims: 'If I will that he tarry till I come,' &c."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If I will that he should not die at all, it is nothing to thee."
2. "Our main business is to follow the Lord Jesus Christ."
3. "We should go forward to whatever he calls us to persecution or death - not envying the lot of any other man, and anxious only to do the will of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Till I come [ŒµœâœÇ ŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒ±Œπ] . Rather, while I am coming. Compare John 9:4; John 12:35, John 12:36; 1 Timothy 4:13. 
What is that to thee [œÑŒπ œÄœÅŒøœÇ œÉŒµ; ] ? Literally, what as concerns thee?


### John Calvin:
1. "It is no concern of yours... think only about yourself, and prepare to follow where you are called."
2. "Not that all anxiety about brethren is uncalled for, but it ought to have some limit, so that it may be anxiety, and not curiosity, that occupies our attention."
3. "Let every man, therefore, look to his neighbors, if by any means he may succeed in drawing them along with him to Christ, and let not the offenses of others retard his own progress."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If I will (ŒµŒ±ŒΩ Œ∏ŒµŒªœâ). Condition of the third class with ŒµŒ±ŒΩ and the present active subjunctive of Œ∏ŒµŒªœâ."
2. "Till I come (ŒµœâœÇ ŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒ±). Literally, 'while I am coming' (ŒµœâœÇ and the present indicative, not ŒµœâœÇ ŒµŒªŒ∏œâ (second aorist active subjunctive)."
3. "What is that to thee? (œÑ œÄœÅŒøœÇ œÉŒµ;). A sharp rebuke to Peter's keen curiosity."

### John Gill:
1. "If it was his pleasure that he should live, not till his second coming to judge the quick and dead at the last day, but till he should come in his power and take vengeance on the Jewish nation, in the destruction of their city and temple by the Romans, and in dispersing them through the nations of the world; till which time John did live, and many years after; and was the only one of the disciples that lived till that time, and who did not die a violent death; what was that to Peter? it was no concern of his."
2. "The question was too curious, improper, and impertinent; it became him to attend only to what concerned himself, and he was bid to do."
3. "It becomes the saints to mind their duty in following Christ, and not concern themselves in things that do not belong to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Certainly he did tarry, till Christ came to destroy Jerusalem."
2. "And who can tell, when or how he died?"
3. "What is that to thee? - Who art to follow me long before."
