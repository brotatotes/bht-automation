# John 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Unaware of the providential plan unfolding, the disciples reverted to their previous occupation of fishing in the hope of catching something. Little did they know that their lack of success that night was no coincidence, but rather a deliberate arrangement allowing the forthcoming miracle to be all the more remarkable. This recurring principle in Christ's ministry often involves God testing believers, prompting them to value His blessings even more. Peter's proposal to go fishing, based on his previous experience, was met with immediate agreement from the other disciples.

1. "I go a fishing,... until the Spirit was poured down in an extraordinary manner, which was given to be expected, in the mean while he was inclined to, and resolved upon taking up his former employment;"
2. "But now these disciples, or the greater part of them at least, belonging to the tribe and division in which the sea was, had a right to carry a ship or boat thither, and make use of a net, as they did."
3. "They went out in the evening of the day, and fished all night, that being a proper time for such business, and the most likely to succeed in, but caught no fish, or very little: and so it is sometimes with Gospel ministers, who are fishers of men, though they take every opportunity, and the most proper methods to gain souls to Christ, yet sometimes do not succeed; which makes things look dark and gloomy in their apprehensions."
