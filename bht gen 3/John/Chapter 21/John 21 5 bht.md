2. "Any meat - This word (Greek) means anything eaten with bread."
3. "It was used by the Greeks especially to denote fish (Schleusner)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Children [παιδια]. Or, little children. Used also by John, in address, twice in the First Epistle (ii. 13, 18), where, however, the more common word is teknia, little children." 
2. "Have ye any meat [μη τι προσφαγιον εχετε]? The interrogative mh ti indicates that a negative answer is expected: you have not, I suppose, anything."

2. "There is at least a striking coincidence between the word ('children') here used and that used in Hebrews 2:13 (Isaiah 8:18). He who speaks is engaged in the same occupation, takes the same position, is called to the same work as they." 
3. "It ought to be carefully noted also that, as is shown by the particular form of the question, it is the meal that is before the mind of Jesus: only when we see this do we gain the true point of view from which to contemplate the whole narrative."

1. "Children (Παιδια). Diminutive of παις and used here alone by Jesus in addressing his disciples. It is a colloquial expression like 'my boys.'" 
2. "Have ye aught to eat? (μη τ προσφαγιον εχετε;). The negative answer is expected by this polite inquiry as in John 4:29."
3. "The rare and late word προσφαγιον from the root φαγ (εσθιω, to eat) and προς (in addition) was used for a relish with bread and then for fish as here."

3. "He has made provisions for them in the ministry of the word and ordinances... will kindly invite them to the provisions he himself makes; will bid them welcome, and bless them to them."
