## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "John is the more keen-sighted, Peter the more ardent. So John recognizes Him before Peter; but Peter goes forth to Him before John." 
2. "He put on his fisher's coat or shirt for decorum: he bound it round him, to facilitate his swimming."
3. "He was naked, i.e. he was stripped for his fisher's work;... Some take it literally, that he was absolutely naked, which is more probable, and understand the putting on of the coat as above."

1. "It is the Lord‚Äîagain having the advantage of his brother in quickness of recognition."
2. "His vest only on, worn next the body."
3. "Not meaning therefore to swim, but to get sooner to Jesus than in the full boat."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "His fisher‚Äôs coat - His upper or outer garment or tunic, in distinction from the inner garment or tunic which was worn next the skin."
3. "Did cast himself into the sea - With characteristic ardor, desirous of meeting again his Lord, and showing his affection for him."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "He does not call him simply Simon Peter; but, as in chap. John 18:10, he interposes a word between the two names, 'Simon, therefore, Peter.'"
3. "The girding is probably not to pass unnoticed. It was thus that at John 13:4-5, our Lord prepared Himself for service: His apostle, when preparing for the active service of his Master, must do the same."
