# John 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The brazen serpent, a symbol of the Redeemer Jesus, was displayed on a pole to bring healing to the Israelites bitten by fiery serpents. In a similar manner, Jesus must be lifted up on the cross, showing both his passion and glory, to bring healing and salvation to all who believe. Just as a simple look at the serpent resulted in instant cure, real faith in Jesus, no matter how distant or weak, brings certain and immediate healing to the perishing soul. This truth illumines the work of God's kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The brazen serpent sets forth the Redeemer."
2. "The â€˜serpentâ€™ is in Scripture symbolism, the devil,â€”from the historical temptation in Gen. iii. downwards."
3. "Did not He, on His Cross, make an open shew of, and triumph over, the Enemy, so that it was as if the Enemy himself had been nailed to that Cross (Col. ii. 15)?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By 'fiery serpents' bittenâ€”serpents, probably, with skin spotted fiery red [KURTZ]â€”the instrument of cure is a serpent of brass or copper, having at a distance the same appearance."
2. "In both cases the remedy is conspicuously displayed; in the one case on a pole, in the other on the cross, to 'draw all men unto Him' (John 12:32)."
3. "In both cases the efficacy is the same. As one simple look at the serpent, however distant and however weak, brought an instantaneous cure, even so, real faith in the Lord Jesus, however tremulous, however distantâ€”be it but real faithâ€”brings certain and instant healing to the perishing soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Men are sinners. There is no cure by human means for the maladies of the soul; and as the people who were bitten might look on the image of the serpent and be healed, so may sinners look to the Saviour and be cured of the moral maladies of our nature."
2. "Even so - In a similar manner and with a similar design. He here refers, doubtless, to his own death."
3. "Must - It is proper; necessary; indispensable, if men are saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Must signifies the eternal necessity in the divine counsels." 
2. "The uplifting on the cross." 
3. "It is characteristic of John to blend the two ideas of Christ's passion and glory."

### John Calvin:
1. "To be lifted up means to be placed in a lofty and elevated situation, so as to be exhibited to the view of all."
2. "Christ is clearly exhibited to us in the Gospel, in order that no man may complain of obscurity."
3. "As it was only the outward appearance of a serpent, but contained nothing within that was pestilential or venomous, so Christ clothed himself with the form of sinful flesh, which yet was pure and free from all sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus draws a vivid parallel between the act of Moses and the Cross on which he himself 'must' be lifted up."
2. "In John Ï…ÏˆÎ¿Ï‰ always refers to the Cross."
3. "Jesus is complimenting the standing and intelligence of Nicodemus as 'the teacher of Israel' by telling him this great truth and fact that lies at the basis of the work of the kingdom of God."

### John Gill:
1. "There is, in many things, an agreement between this serpent, and Jesus Christ:... this may denote the meanness of Christ in his human nature, in his birth and parentage, and place of education and converse; and especially in his crucifixion and death; and which, to an eye of carnal sense and reason, seemed a very improbable means of saving sinners..."
2. "...so it may be expressive of the glory of Christ, as the only begotten of the Father, and who is the brightness of his Father's glory; and which is the great attractive, motive, and inducement to engage souls to look unto him, and believe in him..."
3. "...so the greatest of sinners, and who are afar off from God, and all that is good, and who have faith but as a grain of mustard seed, or but glimmering view of Christ, of his glory, fulness, and suitableness, shall be saved by him."

### John Wesley:
1. And as Moses â€” And even this single witness will soon be taken from you; yea, and in a most ignominious manner. Numbers 21:8,9.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The brazen serpent, in the context of John 3:14, is a symbol of the Redeemer, Jesus. Just as the serpent on a pole brought healing to the Israelites bitten by fiery serpents, Jesus, when lifted up on the cross, brings healing to all who believe in him. The parallel between Moses lifting up the serpent and Jesus being lifted up on the cross highlights the necessity and efficacy of faith in Christ for the salvation of the perishing soul. This divine necessity is characteristic of God's eternal plan, and the act of Jesus being lifted up on the cross signifies both his passion and glory. The uplifting on the cross signifies Jesus' exaltation and serves as a testimony for all to see and believe. Just as the serpent on the pole was plainly exhibited, Christ is clearly presented to us in the Gospel that no one may complain of obscurity. Despite the meanness and seeming improbability of the cross, it is through this means that sinners are saved. Therefore, Jesus reveals this great truth and fact to Nicodemus as the foundation of God's kingdom work, complementing his standing and intelligence as 'the teacher of Israel.'
