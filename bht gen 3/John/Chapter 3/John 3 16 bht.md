# John 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's love for the world is the driving force behind His purpose in redemption and salvation. His love is not limited to a select few, but extends to the entire human race, including both Jews and Gentiles. The gift of His only Son, Jesus Christ, is a profound expression of this unfathomable love. This act of divine self-sacrifice stands in stark contrast to the gods of paganism, who demand sacrifices from mortals without offering anything in return. Through faith in Christ, believers can find deliverance from destruction and inherit eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord here reveals Love as the one ground of the divine counsel in redemption,â€”salvation of men, as its one purpose with regard to them."
2. "These words seem to carry a reference to the offering of Isaac; and Nicodemus in that case would at once be reminded by them of the love there required, the substitution there made, and the prophecy there uttered to Abraham, to which the following words of our Lord so nearly correspond."
3. "By the repetition of this final clause verbatim from ver. 15, we have the identity of the former clauses established: i.e. the uplifting of the Son of Man like the serpent in the wilderness is the manifestation of the divine Love in the gift of the Son of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For God so loved, c.â€”What proclamation of the Gospel has been so oft on the lips of missionaries and preachers in every age since it was first uttered?"
2. "What has sent such thrilling sensations through millions of mankind?"
3. "What to kindle in the cold and selfish breasts of mortals the fires of self-sacrificing love to mankind, as these words of transparent simplicity, yet overpowering majesty?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God hates wickedness, but he still desires the Happiness of those who are sinful... 'He hates the sin, but loves the sinner.'"
2. "His love for the world, or for all mankind, in giving his Son, was shown by these circumstances: That he gave - It was a free and unmerited gift."
3. "A parent who should give up his only son to die for others who are guilty if this could or might be done - would show higher love than could be manifested in any other way."

### John Calvin:
1. "For God so loved the world. [...] we must see whence Christ came to us, and why he was offered to be our Savior. [...] the Heavenly Father loves the human race, and wishes that they should not perish. And this order ought to be carefully observed; for such is the wicked ambition which belongs to our nature, that when the question relates to the origin of our salvation, we quickly form diabolical imaginations about our own merits."
2. "And, indeed, it is very evident that Christ spoke in this manner, in order to draw away men from the contemplation of themselves to look at the mercy of God alone. Nor does he say that God was moved to deliver us, because he perceived in us something that was worthy of so excellent a blessing, but ascribes the glory of our deliverance entirely to his love."
3. "This, he says, is the proper look of faith, to be fixed on Christ, in whom it beholds the breast of God filled with love: this is a firm and enduring support, to rely on the death of Christ as the only pledge of that love. [...] we should not doubt or fear death, for the faith of Christ brings deliverance and eternal life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The humiliation and exaltation of Him who came down out of heaven were the expression of Godâ€™s love to the whole world."
2. "The universality of the blessing is marked with twofold emphasis; designed, not for Israel only, but for the whole world, it is the actual possession of every believer."
3. "The Divine purpose is presented under two aspects, not one only; it is that the believer may be saved from perdition, and may now possess eternal life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This 'Little Gospel' as it is often called, this 'comfortable word' (the Anglican Liturgy), while not a quotation from Jesus is a just and marvellous interpretation of the mission and message of our Lord."
2. "Loved... used here as often in John of God's love for man... In John 21:15 John presents a distinction between Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î±Ï‰ and Ï†Î¹Î»ÎµÏ‰."
3. "The whole cosmos of men, including Gentiles, the whole human race. This universal aspect of God's love appears also in 2 Corinthians 5:19; Romans 5:8."

### John Gill:
1. "God has so loved the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, that he gave his only begotten Son; to, and for them, as well as for the Jews."
