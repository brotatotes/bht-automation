## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The persecutions and murder of the Prince of Life hence found their greatest aggravation, that they were carried on against the conclusions of their own minds, out of bitter malice, and worldly disappointment at His humble and unobtrusive character, and the spiritual purity and self-sacrifice which He inculcated."
2. "Some degree of ignorance there must necessarily have been in all of them, even Caiaphas included, of our Lordâ€™s office and Person."
3. "Against this inconsistencyâ€”the inner knowledge that the Kingdom of God was come, and He who was to found it, on the one handâ€”and the rationalizing endeavor to reduce this heavenly kingdom to mere learning, and its Founder to a mere teacher, on the otherâ€”is the following discourse directed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "One of those superficial 'believers' mentioned in John 2:23; John 2:24, yet inwardly craving further satisfaction..."
2. "...comes to Jesus in quest of it, but comes 'by night'..."
3. "...unable to repress his convictions, he is afraid of committing himself too far."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The most favorable opportunity for teaching such men the nature of personal religion is when they are alone."
2. "When we read the words of Jesus in the Bible, it should be with a belief that he came from God, and was therefore qualified and authorized to teach us the way of life."
3. "Miracles show that a prophet or religious teacher comes from God, because God would not work a miracle in attestation of a falsehood or to give countenance to a false teacher."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By night, 'when Jewish superstition would keep men at home.'"
2. "We may be sure that a member of the sect that carefully scrutinized the Baptist's credentials would not lightly address Jesus by this title of honor, or acknowledge Him as teacher."
3. "From God. These words stand first in the sentence as emphatic. It is from God that thou hast come."

### John Calvin:
1. "From the circumstance of his coming by night we infer that his timidity was excessive; for his eyes were dazzled, as it were, by the splendor of his own greatness and reputation."
2. "But as there are none who more haughtily and more daringly boast of having been sent by God than the false prophets do, we need discernment in this case for trying the spirits."
3. "Miracles are a sufficiently powerful attestation of the presence of God, as Nicodemus here declares it to be."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We cannot doubt that he came alone; whether Jesus also was alone, or whether John or other disciples were present at the interview, we cannot tell."
2. "The confession of Nicodemus was made in the name of others besides himself. â€˜We know;â€™ others amongst the Pharisees, perhaps already others amongst the rulers (chap. John 12:42), had reached the same point."
3. "Nicodemus acknowledges the works to be â€˜signsâ€™(not so the Jews, chap. John 2:18), and he shows that in him the signs had precisely answered the designed end."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus was already in the public eye and the interest of Nicodemus was real and yet he wished to be cautious."
2. "Nicodemus does recognize him as such and calls him 'My Master' just as Andrew and John did. It was a long step for Nicodemus as a Pharisee to take."
3. "This is the explanation of Nicodemus for coming to Jesus, obscure Galilean peasant as he seemed, evidence that satisfied one of the leaders in Pharisaism."

### John Gill:
1. "The same came to Jesus by night....some things may be said in favour of this conduct of Nicodemus...it was very common with the Jewish doctors, to meet and converse together, and study the law in the night."
2. "And Nicodemus acknowledges Jesus as such; and as one that did not come, or was sent by men, as their doctors were; nor did he come of himself, as false teachers did; but he came from God, and had his mission and commission from him."
3. "Miracles were expected by the Jews, to be wrought by the Messiah, and many believed in Jesus on this account; though the modern Jews deny it to be necessary, that miracles should be done by the Messiah; but Nicodemus, and other Jews, thought otherwise, and considered the miracles of Christ as such, as could never be done by man, nor without the presence and power of God."

### John Wesley:
1. The same came â€” Through desire; but by night - Through shame: We know - Even we rulers and Pharisees.
