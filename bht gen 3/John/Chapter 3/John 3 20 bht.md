# John 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who live righteous lives have their deeds, which have lasting value and fruit, but those who practice evil have nothing to show for their deeds, only condemnation. The light of truth exposes and rebukes their wickedness, leaving them uncomfortable and resistant to Christ, choosing to remain in darkness in order to hide their sins. They hate the light because it condemns their actions and reveals their own wickedness. Therefore, they reject Christ and His Gospel, cherishing their condemnation and preferring to remain in sinful darkness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "He that does, makes, creates (for this is the force of the second verb), has his deed, or thing made,â€”he has abiding fruit; his works do follow him."
3. "In the allusion to darkness, there may possibly be a hint at the coming by night of Nicodemus, but surely only by a distant implication."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:

2. "He hates the gospel, for it condemns his conduct, and his conscience would trouble him if it were enlightened."
3. "No man who is a sinner loves it; and no man by nature is disposed to come to it, any more than an adulterer or thief is disposed to come to the daylight, and do his deeds of wickedness there."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Evil, therefore, considered on the side of worthlessness."
2. "The test exposes and demonstrates the error, and refutes it, thus convincing, convicting, and rebuking the subject of it."

2. "Every one whose life is thus evil knows that in the presence of the light he must stand self-condemned."
3. "The last word of the verse is remarkable, as it is more naturally applied to the doer than to his deed. Not only will the works be shown by the light be exposed in their true character: the works are looked on as of themselves the criminals they will be self-convicted, self-condemned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hence talks against it, ridicules Christ, Christianity, churches, preachers, etc. Does it in talk, magazines, books, in a supercilious tone of sheer ignorance."
