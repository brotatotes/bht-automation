Ignorance and people-pleasing tendencies can lead to mistakes and contention, as seen in this situation. The Jews were resistant to John's baptism, which they saw as a threat to their traditional purifications. It would have been better if such disputes over baptism had been avoided, focusing solely on the purifications required by the Law.
