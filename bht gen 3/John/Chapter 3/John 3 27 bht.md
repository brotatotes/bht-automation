# John 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I cannot arrogate to myself what God has not given. If all men come to Him, it is no wonder since He is divine. My role is to point the burdened to the Lamb of God, to bring together the Savior and those He came to seek and save. Any success I have is from God, just as Jesus's success comes from heaven. We can only receive what has been given to us from above.
