# John 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To see and enter the kingdom of God, a complete inward change, a new birth from above, is necessary. This transformation is not merely about new works done, but about becoming a new man, with a different manner of thinking, feeling, and acting in relation to spiritual things. Our natural birth introduces us to a world of sin, but to escape from sin and be part of God's kingdom, we must undergo a fundamental and permanent revolution. This truth, revealed by Jesus, applies to all individuals without exception.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "My teaching is not of doing and leaving undone, but of a change in the man;‚Äîso that it is, not new works done, but a new man to do them; not another life only, but another birth."
2. "Born anew or afresh is a better rendering than 'born again,' being closer to the meaning of the Greek word, 'from the very beginning;'‚Äî 'unless a man begin his life anew altogether, he cannot...'"
3. "His witness is not, like John‚Äôs, only of what he has been forewarned to expect, but of that which He has seen and heard."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nicodemus probably thought he had gone a long way, and expected, perhaps, to be complimented on his candor. Instead of this, he is virtually told that he has raised a question which he is not in a capacity to solve." 
2. "Had the man been less sincere, this would certainly have repelled him but with persons in his mixed state of mind...such methods speed better than more honeyed words and gradual approaches."
3. "Be born again...begin life anew in relation to God; his manner of thinking, feeling, and acting, with reference to spiritual things, undergoing a fundamental and permanent revolution."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Except a man - This is a universal form of expression designed to include all mankind. Of 'each and every man' it is certain that unless he is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."
2. "Our natural birth introduces us to light, is the commencement of life, throws us amid the works of God, and is the beginning of our existence; but it also introduces us to a world of sin."
3. "To escape from sin, to be happy in the world to come, it is necessary that man should be changed in his principles, his feelings, and his manner of life. This change, or the beginning of this new life, is called the 'new birth,' or 'regeneration.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word [born again] is used in the following senses in the New Testament, where it occurs thirteen times...from the top...from above...from the beginning...again." 
2. "In favor of the other rendering, again, it may be said: that from above does not describe the fact but the nature of the new birth...That Nicodemus clearly understood the word as meaning again...That it seems strange that Nicodemus should have been startled by the idea of a birth from heaven."
3. "The things of God's kingdom are not apparent to the natural vision. A new power of sight is required, which attaches only to the new man."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as it is useless to sow seed in a field which has not been prepared by the labors of the husbandman, so it is to no purpose to scatter the doctrine of the Gospel, if the mind has not been previously subdued and duly prepared for docility and obedience."
2. "So long as thou art destitute of that which is of the highest importance in the kingdom of God, I care little about your calling me Master; for the first entrance into the kingdom of God is, to become a new man."
3. "If Christ had said to one person, or to a few individuals, that they could not enter into heaven, unless they had been previously born again, we might have supposed that it was only certain characters that were pointed out, but he speaks of all without exception."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord‚Äôs words, then, teach the fundamental truth, that not natural birth, descent from the stock of Israel, but a second birth, the being begotten anew, a complete spiritual change (see John 3:5), admits into the kingdom of God."
2. "To a state of outward earthly privilege rights of natural birth might give admittance. In declaring that without a complete inward change none can possibly see (have a true perception of) ‚Äòthe kingdom of God,‚Äô Jesus declares the spiritual character of His kingdom."
3. "In it none but the spiritual can have any part."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Except a man be born anew... Which is the meaning here? The puzzle of Nicodemus shows that he took it as 'again,' a second birth from the womb."
2. "It is a second birth, to be sure, regeneration, but a birth from above by the Spirit."
3. "He cannot see the kingdom of God... For this use of ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒπŒΩ (second aorist active infinitive of ŒøœÅŒ±œâ) see John 8:51; Revelation 18:7."

### John Gill:
1. "Nicodemus, according to the general sense of the nation, thought that when the Messiah came, and his kingdom was set up, they should all share in it, without any more ado; they being the descendants of Abraham, and having him for their father: but Christ assures him, that he must be 'born again'; in distinction from, and opposition to his first birth by nature..."
2. "By this phrase our Lord signifies, that no man, either as a man, or as a son of Abraham, or as a proselyte to the Jewish religion, can have any true knowledge of, or right unto, the enjoyment of the kingdom of God, unless he is born again or regenerated, and quickened by the Spirit of God..."
3. "...unless he be 'born from above', as the word is rendered in John 3:31; that is, by a supernatural power, having the heavenly image stamped on him; and being called with an heavenly calling, even with the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."

### John Wesley:
1. "That knowledge will not avail thee unless thou be born again - Otherwise thou canst not see, that is, experience and enjoy, either the inward or the glorious kingdom of God."
2. "In this solemn discourse our Lord shows, that no external profession, no ceremonial ordinances or privileges of birth, could entitle any to the blessings of the Messiah's kingdom: that an entire change of heart as well as of life was necessary for that purpose."
3. "If our Lord by being born again means only reformation of life, instead of making any new discovery, he has only thrown a great deal of obscurity on what was before plain and obvious."
