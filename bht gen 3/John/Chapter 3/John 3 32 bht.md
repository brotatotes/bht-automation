# John 3:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though multitudes were drawn to Jesus, few truly received his testimony as the Christ, the Saviour and Lord. They were more ready to accept him for their own desires rather than embrace him for who he truly was. Even though his doctrine was pure, plain, and sublime, few truly believed and accepted it in faith. Jesus alone bears witness to that which he has seen and heard, teaching nothing but what has been fully ascertained. Yet, so few receive, that they seem as nothing in comparison with those who reject him.
