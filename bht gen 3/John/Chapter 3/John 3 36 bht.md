# John 3:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Unbelief implies disobedience and a state of darkness, where one will never have everlasting life or see it. This contradicts the idea that there was no need for anything in God to be removed by Christ, as the removal of sin is necessary for life. On the other hand, he who believes in the Son has the highest blessing of life eternal, already possessing it through faith. The contrast is between those who obey the Son and those who do not, with the latter facing the wrath of God. Ultimately, Jesus is the test of human life, and enjoyment and life are found in Him alone through faith.
