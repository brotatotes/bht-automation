### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "While they weary out their whole life with profound speculations, as to all that strictly relates to the worship of God, to the confident hope of our salvation, or to the exercises of religion, they know no more on these subjects than a cobbler or a cowherd knows about the course of the stars..."
2. "...taking delight in foreign mysteries, they openly despise the true doctrine of Scripture as unworthy of the elevated rank which belongs to them as teachers."
3. "We need not wonder, therefore, to find here that Nicodemus stumbles at a straw; for it is a just vengeance of God, that they who think themselves the highest and most excellent teachers, and in whose estimation the ordinary simplicity of doctrine is vile and despicable, stand amazed at small matters."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The solemn emphasis laid on the words ‚Äòborn anew‚Äô forbids his thinking of a mere figure of speech, and apparently banishes from his mind the Old Testament expressions which approach the same truth." 
2. "The privilege which he attached to natural birth within the bounds of Israel is tom away by a word; the‚Äô any one ‚Äòof our Lord‚Äôs answer, makes all men equal; and the prize which seemed almost within his grasp is given to every one who has been born anew."
3. "In his bewilderment he sees no meaning in the words of Jesus, except they be understood physically of a second natural birth; and the evident impossibility of this he expresses in the very strongest terms."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This stupid misunderstanding of the meaning of Jesus is precisely what John represents Nicodemus as making." 
2. "The blunder of Nicodemus is emphasized by the second question with the ŒºŒ∑ expecting the negative answer." 
3. "The learned Pharisee is as jejune in spiritual insight as the veriest tyro."

### John Gill:
1. "How can a man be born when he is old?"
2. "Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"
