# John 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The contrast between flesh and Spirit in John underscores the fallen and depraved condition of humanity. Our corrupted nature, born of flesh, is unfit for the Kingdom of God. However, the Spirit generates new life in us, transforming us into a spiritual and heavenly nature. The necessity of this new birth by the Spirit is clear, as our natural state leaves us unable to discern spiritual things. Only through the grace of the Spirit and the second birth can we become fit for the kingdom and understand spiritual truths.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The neuter gender denotes not only the universal application of this truth, but the very first beginnings of life in the embryo, before sex can be predicated."
2. "Such 'flesh and blood' cannot inherit the Kingdom of God."
3. "Just as flesh generates flesh, so spirit generates spirit, after its own image."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That which is begotten carries within itself the nature of that which begat it."
2. "Not the mere material body, but all that comes into the world by birth, the entire man; yet not humanity simply, but in its corrupted, depraved condition, in complete subjection to the law of the fall."
3. "He would be no nearer this 'new birth' than before."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'flesh' in the Scriptures is often used to denote the sinful propensities and passions of our nature."
2. "None are renewed but by the Spirit of God. If man did the work himself, it would he still carnal and impure."
3. "No man can have evidence that he is born again who is not holy, and just in proportion as he becomes pure in his life will be the evidence that he is born of the Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The aorist tense (3, 4, 5, 7), marks the fact of birth; the perfect (as here), the state of that which has been born."
2. "John uses the word sarx generally, to express humanity under the conditions of this life, with sometimes a more definite hint at the sinful and fallible nature of humanity."
3. "The Holy Spirit of God, or the principle of life which He imparts. Spirit and flesh are the distinguishing principles, the one of the heavenly, the other of the earthly economy."

### John Calvin:
1. "But if the flesh is contrasted with the Spirit, as a corrupt thing is contrasted with what is uncorrupted, a crooked thing with what is straight, a polluted thing with what is holy, a contaminated thing with what is pure, we may readily conclude that the whole nature of man is condemned by a single word."
2. "The corruption of all mankind in the person of Adam alone did not proceed from generation, but from the appointment of God, who in one man had adorned us all, and who has in him also deprived us of his gifts."
3. "Thus in the whole of our nature there remains not a drop of uprightness. Hence it is evident that we must be formed by the second birth, that we may be fitted for the kingdom of God; and the meaning of Christâ€™s words is, that as a man is born only carnal from the womb of his mother; he must be formed anew by the Spirit, that he may begin to be spiritual."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Flesh produces flesh. Spirit produces spirit." 
2. "The necessity of a new birth is enforced, and the 'cannot' of John 3:3 explained."
3. "The spiritual life of the kingdom of God can only come from the new spiritual principle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The sharp contrast between flesh and Spirit serves to remind Nicodemus."
2. "The contrast between flesh and Spirit drawn already in John 1:13."
3. "The crudity of his question about a second physical birth."

### John Gill:
1. "Man by his natural birth, and as he is born according to the flesh of his natural parents, is a mere natural man; that is, he is carnal and corrupt, and cannot discern spiritual things." 
2. "And therefore there is a necessity of his being born again, or of the grace of the Spirit, and of his becoming a spiritual man." 
3. "A man that is regenerated by the Spirit of God, and the efficacy of his grace, is a spiritual man; he can discern and judge all things of a spiritual nature; he is a fit person to be admitted to spiritual ordinances and privileges."

### John Wesley:
1. That which is born of the flesh is flesh â€” Mere flesh, void of the Spirit, yea, at enmity with it; And that which is born of the Spirit is spirit - Is spiritual, heavenly, divine, like its Author.
