# John 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus emphasizes that being born again is necessary to enter the kingdom of God. He Himself did not need to be born again because His spirit was not alien from holiness, having inherited the weakness of the flesh but without sin. This new birth is indispensable because only a spiritual nature, solely imparted by the Holy Spirit, can perceive and enter the kingdom of God. Jesus's words apply not only to Nicodemus but also to those he represents, highlighting the need for a profound inward transformation from sinfulness to holiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord did not, could not, say this of Himself. Why?â€”Because in the full sense in which the flesh is incapacitated from entering the kingdom of God, He was not born of the flesh."
2. "He inherited the weakness of the flesh, but His spirit was not, like that of sinful man, alien from holiness and God; and therefore on Him no second birth passed; when the Holy Spirit descended on Him at his baptism, the words spoken by the Father were indicative of past approval, not of renewal."
3. "His obedience was accepted as perfect, and the good pleasure of the Father rested on Him. Therefore He includes not Himself in this necessity for the new birth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If a spiritual nature only can see and enter the kingdom of God if all we bring into the world with us be the reverse of spiritual; and if this spirituality be solely of the Holy Ghost, no wonder a new birth is indispensable."
2. "Ye mustâ€”'Ye, says Jesus, not we' [BENGEL]. After those universal propositions, about what 'a man' must be, to 'enter the kingdom of God' ( :-) â€”this is remarkable, showing that our Lord meant to hold Himself forth as 'separate from sinners.'"
3. "If a spiritual nature only can see and enter the kingdom of God if all we bring into the world with us be the reverse of spiritual; and if this spirituality be solely of the Holy Ghost, no wonder a new birth is indispensable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Marvel not - Wonder not." 
2. "It is possible that Nicodemus in some way still expressed a doubt of the doctrine." 
3. "Jesus took occasion in a very striking manner to illustrate it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unto thee - ye must. Note the change from the singular to the plural pronoun."
2. "In his address to Nicodemus (thee) the Lord had spoken also to those whom Nicodemus represented."
3. "His error was the error of his class."

### John Calvin:
1. "For all draw from the air their vital breath; we perceive the agitation of the air, but know not whence it comes to us or whither it departs."
2. "If in this frail and transitory life God acts so powerfully that we are constrained to admire his power, what folly is it to attempt to measure by the perception of our own mind his secret work in the heavenly and supernatural life, so as to believe no more than what we see?"
3. "When Christ says to Nicodemus that he ought not to wonder, we must not understand it in such a manner as if he intended that we should despise a work of God, which is so illustrious, and which is worthy of the highest admiration."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of â€˜marvelâ€™ in other passages would seem to show that in this Gospel the word indicates much more than amazement. It is certainly not the astonishment of admiration, but incredulous and sometimes angry surprise."
2. "Our Lordâ€™s teaching had set at nought the accepted teaching of Israel, thoughts and hopes to which Nicodemus had long and firmly clung, and his heart rebels."
3. "Before, He had spoken of â€˜any one,â€™ leaving the application to His hearer; now, as Nicodemus had said â€˜We know,â€™ Jesus says â€˜Ye must,â€™ even ye who possess the treasures of Israelâ€™s learning, and whom the signs are guiding to the King of Israel, â€˜ye must be born again:â€™ â€˜Marvel not at this.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Do not begin to wonder" (ingressive first aorist active subjunctive with Î¼Î·), as clearly Nicodemus had done. In John the word Î¸Î±Ï…Î¼Î±Î¶Ï‰ usually means "unintelligent wonder" (Bernard).
2. "Ye must be born anew" (Î´Îµ Ï…Î¼Î±Ï‚ Î³ÎµÎ½Î½Î·Î¸Î·Î½Î± Î±Î½Ï‰Î¸ÎµÎ½). 
3. "Jesus repeats the point in verse John 3:3 (Î´Îµ and the infinitive instead of ÎµÎ±Î½ Î¼Î· and the subjunctive) with Î±Î½Ï‰Î¸ÎµÎ½ (from above) only and not ÎµÎ¾ Ï…Î´Î±Ï„Î¿Ï‚."

### John Gill:
1. "There is a necessity of the regeneration of those, who are the chosen of God, and the redeemed of the Lamb; and of them only can the words be understood."
2. "The people of God 'must' [be born again] partly because it is the will of God...and partly, because of the case and condition of men, which requires it."
3. "To take off the surprise of Nicodemus, our Lord instances in a common natural case, and to which this affair of regeneration may be compared, and by it illustrated."

### John Wesley:
1. "To be born again, is to be inwardly changed from all sinfulness to all holiness."
2. "It is fitly so called, because as great a change then passes on the soul as passes on the body when it is born into the world."
