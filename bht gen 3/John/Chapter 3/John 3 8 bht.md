# John 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mysterious working of the Holy Spirit in the spiritual life is like the gentle breath of the wind, heard but not felt. Just as the wind's origins and course are unknown, so the Holy Spirit works in us, leading and accompanying us with His spiritually discerned voice. Though the wind's motion remains a mystery, its effects are evident, paralleling the visible evidence of the Spirit's power. The Spirit, like the wind, transcends our understanding, yet His working is undeniable.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word pneuma is not the violent wind, which is otherwise expressed, but the gentle breath of the wind;â€”and it is heard, not felt;â€”a case in which 'thou knowest not, &c.' is more applicable than in that of a violent wind steadily blowing." 
2. "It is one of those sudden breezes springing up on a calm day, which has no apparent direction, but we hear it rustling in the leaves around."
3. "He describes the mystery of the spiritual life: we see its effects, in ourselves, and others who have it; but we cannot trace its beginnings, nor can we prescribe to the Holy Spirit His course: He works in us and leads us on, accompanying us with His witness,â€”His voice, spiritually discerned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wind, c.â€”Breath and spirit (one word both in Hebrew and Greek) are constantly brought together in Scripture as analogous."
2. "The laws which govern the motion of the winds are even yet but partially discovered."
3. "The risings, failings, and change in direction many times in a day, of those gentle breezes here referred to, will probably ever be a mystery to us: So of the operation of the Holy Ghost in the new birth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We ought no more to doubt that they are produced by some cause - by some mighty agent, than when we see the trees moved, or the waters of the ocean piled on heaps, or feel the cooling effects of a summerâ€™s breeze." 
2. "The proper evidence of conversion is the effect on the life."
3. "Everyone that is born of the Spirit is, in some respects, like the effects of the wind. You see it not, you cannot discern its laws, but you see its effects, and you know therefore that it does exist and operate."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The wind is dying away."
2. "The statement of Jesus is not meant to be scientifically precise, but is rather thrown into a poetic mold, akin to the familiar expression 'free as the wind.'"
3. "The subject of the Spirit's invisible influence gives visible evidence of its power."

### John Calvin:
1. "The wind bloweth where it pleaseth. Not that, strictly speaking, there is will in the blowing, but because the agitation is free, and uncertain, and variable..." 
2. "Christ means that the movement and operation of the Spirit of God is not less perceptible in the renewal of man than the motion of the air in this earthly and outward life, but that the manner of it is concealed..."
3. "...we are ungrateful and malicious, if we do not adore the inconceivable power of God in the heavenly life, of which we behold so striking an exhibition in this world..."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nature itself may teach him. In nature there is an agent whose working is experienced and acknowledged by all, while at the same time it is full of mystery; yet the mystery makes no man doubt the reality of the working."
2. "The wind breatheth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth. From the beginning the wind seems to have been the divinely-intended witness and emblem in the natural world of the Spirit of God."
3. "Thou hearest its voice, it is present though invisible; thou feelest its power, for thou art in its course; but where the course begins, what produces the breath, whither the course is tending, what is the object of the breath,-thou knowest not."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Spirit is the use of Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î± as metaphor."
2. "Certainly the conclusion 'of the Spirit' is a direct reference to the Holy Spirit who works his own way beyond our comprehension."
3. "Even as men even yet do not know the law of the wind."

### John Gill:
1. "The Spirit of God is a free agent in regeneration; he works how, and where, and when he pleases."
2. "This grace of the Spirit in regeneration, like the wind, is powerful and irresistible; it carries all before it; there is no withstanding it."
3. "Regeneration by the Spirit of God, who is comparable to the wind, and whose name so signifies, need not be thought so marvellous and astonishing, though the natural man discerns it not, and cannot account for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The wind bloweth â€” According to its own nature, not thy will, and thou hearest the sound thereof - Thou art sure it doth blow, but canst not explain the particular manner of its acting."
2. "So is every one that is born of the Spirit â€” The fact is plain, the manner of his operations inexplicable."
