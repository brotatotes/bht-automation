# John 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees' opposition to Jesus was stronger than their hostility towards John the Baptist, which may have been due to previous events in Jerusalem. Jesus, being aware of their anger, left Judea for Samaria. Just as Jesus made disciples before baptizing them, we should be cautious and baptize only those who have truly become disciples of Christ. These disciples are the ones who should proudly wear the symbol of their allegiance to Him.
