# John 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In response to the woman at the well, Jesus subtly suggests His superiority over Jacob by emphasizing that the water He offers is greater than what Jacob provided.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus, in His response, subtly points out that He is greater than Jacob, without directly stating it. He acknowledges that Jacob's gift was water, which ultimately cannot satisfy. The contrast between the water Jacob offers and the living water that Christ gives is all-encompassing and fundamental. This living water, striking the depths of our being, transforms us into fountains rather than cisterns, allowing us to experience enduring and satisfying spiritual life. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of Christ is the secret to this life with all its enduring energies and satisfactions. Those who continually drink from this water will never thirst again, for it quenches the soul eternally. The grace of Christ is a continually flowing fountain that will never dry up, and those who have been renewed by this grace will be sustained. While earthly water temporarily satisfies physical thirst, it cannot prevent thirst from returning. Similarly, the water offered by Jacob's well could not completely remove thirst.
