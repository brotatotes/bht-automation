### Henry Alford:
1. "The manna was as insufficient to satisfy hunger,â€”as this water, thirst... it is only the living water, and the bread of life, which can satisfy."
2. "Whosoever shall have drunk sets forth the once having tasted, and ever continuing in the increasing power, and living forth-flowing, of that life-long draught. Shall thirst no more for ever, shall never have to go away and be exhausted, and come again to be filled."
3. "All earthly supplies have access only into those lower parts of our being... but the heavenly gift of spiritual life... enters into the very secret and highest place of their personal life."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Thirst is to be taken in the same sense in both clauses, as referring to that natural craving which the world cannot satisfy, and which is therefore ever restless."

2. "The living water of which Jesus speaks becomes in him who hath drunk of it a perennial fountain, a fountain of water that is ever springing up in freshness and life."
3. "The Holy Spirit is the special gift of Jesus; and, reciprocally, it is through the Holy Spirit that the believer remains united to his Lord in an abiding fellowship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall never thirst...the strongest possible negative." 
2. "Jesus has not answered the woman's question save by the necessary implication here that he is superior to Jacob."
3. "'Spring (or fountain) of water leaping (bubbling up) unto life eternal.' The woman's curiosity is keenly excited about this new kind of water."

### John Gill:

2. "[Regenerate persons] do not hanker after sin as they did, nor drink up iniquity like water, or commit sin with greediness, as before."
3. "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water...springing up into everlasting life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Will never thirst â€” Will never (provided he continue to drink thereof) be miserable, dissatisfied, without refreshment." 
2. "If ever that thirst returns, it will be the fault of the man, not the water."
3. "But the water that I shall give him â€” The spirit of faith working by love, shall become in him - An inward living principle, a fountain - Not barely a well, which is soon exhausted, springing up into everlasting life - Which is a confluence, or rather an ocean of streams arising from this fountain."
