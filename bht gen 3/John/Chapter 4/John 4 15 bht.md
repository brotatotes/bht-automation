### Henry Alford:

2. "It expresses a wondering desire after she scarce knew what from this mysterious Stranger."
3. "A wondering desire after she scarce knew what from this mysterious Stranger."

### Albert Barnes:
1. The woman said ... - It may seem strange that the woman did not yet understand him, but it shows how slow sinners are to understand the doctrines of religion.


### John Calvin:
1. "This woman undoubtedly is sufficiently aware that Christ is speaking of spiritual water; but because she despises him, she sets at naught all his promises." 
2. "For so long as the authority of him who speaks is not acknowledged by us, his doctrine is not permitted to enter." 
3. "Indirectly, therefore, the woman taunted Christ, saying, 'Thou boastest much, but I see nothing: show it in reality, if thou canst.'"

1. "In the mysterious words of the Jewish traveller one thing was plain, instead of the water she came to draw, water was offered that would satisfy thirst now and for ever."
2. "Could she gain this gift, she would no longer need to traverse the distance from Sychar to Jacob‚Äôs well."
3. "It is in every way more probable and true to nature to consider it as the expression of a bewildered mind eager to receive such a gift as has been offered, little as she could comprehend of what nature the gift could be."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This water (œÑŒøœÖœÑŒø œÑŒø œÖŒ¥œâœÅ). This peculiar kind of water. She did not grasp the last phrase 'unto life eternal,' and speaks half ironically of 'this water.'" 
2. "That I thirst not (ŒπŒΩŒ± ŒºŒ∑ Œ¥Œπœàœâ). Final clause with ŒπŒΩŒ±, alluding to the words of Jesus, water that will prevent thirst."
3. "Neither come (ŒºŒ∑Œ¥Œµ Œ¥ŒπŒµœÅœáœâŒºŒ±). Carrying on the negative purpose with present middle subjunctive, 'nor keep on coming' as she has to do once or twice every day. She is evidently puzzled and yet attracted."

### John Gill:
1. "Pray give me some of this fine water you talk of, that I may never thirst again; and so have no occasion to be at all this fatigue and trouble." 
2. "Though some think, that she now spoke seriously, having some little knowledge of what our Lord meant by living water, but with a mixture of much ignorance, and that she heartily desired it."
3. "But the reason she gives, shows the contrary."

### John Wesley:
1. That I thirst not ‚Äî She takes him still in a gross sense.
