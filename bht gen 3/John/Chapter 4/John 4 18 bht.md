# John 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The truth of the woman's situation is evident in the fact that she had truly experienced five husbands, none of whom were her lawful husband. Although the conviction of her sin may not have fully transformed her at that moment, Jesus' words and her journey back to the city began to deepen the realization of her wrongdoing. Despite her choices, her heart remained unhardened, leaving room for repentance and a potential change of heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice it is true (a factâ€”bare truth), not truly: this one word was true."
2. "The conviction of sin here lies beneath the surface: it is not pressed, nor at the moment does it seem to have worked deeply."
3. "Our Lordâ€™s words in vv. 25, 26 would tend to infix it more deeply, and we find at ver. 29, that it had been working during her journey back to the city."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hast had five husbands - Who have either died; or who, on account of your improper conduct, have divorced you; or whom you have left improperly, without legal divorce. Either of these might have been the case."
2. "Is not thy husband - You are not lawfully married to him. Either she might have left a former husband without divorce, and thus her marriage with this man was unlawful, or she was living with him without the form of marriage, in open guilt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The â€˜fiveâ€™ were no doubt lawful husbands, from whom she had been separated either by death or by divorce."
2. "In contrast with the lawful marriages is set the present unlawful union with one who was no husband."
3. "Whatever may have led her to an evil life, it is plain that her heart was not yet hardened."

### John Gill:
1. "Which she either had had lawfully, and had buried one after another; ... Or rather, she had had so many, and had been divorced from everyone of them, for adultery..." 
2. "and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband; that is, not thy lawful husband..." 
3. "thus Christ the omniscient God, who knew her full well, exposes all unto her."

### John Wesley:
1. Thou hast had five husbands â€” Whether they were all dead or not, her own conscience now awakened would tell her.
