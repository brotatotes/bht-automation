# John 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is intricately linked to the Jewish people, as Jesus identifies Himself with them, embodying the true essence of Jewish worship. The Samaritans, though they worshipped God, were in the dark, lacking the revealed authority and knowledge that the Jews possessed. True worship cannot be a result of ignorance but must be grounded in knowledge obtained from God's Word. Salvation, as prophesied, came from the Jews and would eventually spread to all nations under heaven.

2. "And though after Manasseh, and other Jews were come among them, and they had received the law of Moses, they might have some knowledge of the true God, yet they glorified him not as God; and though they might in words profess him, yet in works they denied him."
3. "And the true worshippers among the Jews, of which sort Christ was, knew God, whom they worshipped, spiritually and savingly; and the generality of that people had right notions of the God of Israel, having the oracles, and service of God, and being instructed out of Moses, and the prophets."

### John Wesley:
