# John 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True worship is the genuine response to the salvation offered by Jesus, distinct from hypocritical and imperfect worship. God not only requires, but seeks, worshipers who offer it in spirit and truth. This new form of worship was being established during Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman, as He revealed Himself as the Messiah. Rooted in the highest part of our humanity, true worship involves a deep spiritual connection with God, a truthful understanding of the object of worship, and is not confined to a specific location.

3. "Such worshippers God not only 'requires,' from His very nature, but seeks,â€”is seeking."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "True worship includes a spiritual sense of the object worshipped, and a spiritual communion with it; the manifestation of the moral consciousness in feelings, motions of the will, 'moods of elevation, excitements,' etc. It includes also a truthful conception of the object."
3. "To worship in truth is not merely to worship in sincerity, but with a worship corresponding to the nature of its object."

### John Calvin:
1. "The worship of God is said to consist in the spirit, because it is nothing else than that inward faith of the heart which produces prayer, and, next, purity of conscience and self-denial, that we may be dedicated to obedience to God as holy sacrifices."
2. "In all ages God wished to be worshipped by faith, prayer, thanksgiving, purity of heart, and innocence of life; and at no time did he delight in any other sacrifices."
3. "What it is to worship God in spirit and truth appears clearly from what has been already said. It is to lay aside the entanglements of ancient ceremonies, and to retain merely what is spiritual in the worship of God; for the truth of the worship of God consists in the spirit, and ceremonies are but a sort of appendage."

2. "This is what matters, not where, but how (in reality, in the spirit of man, the highest part of man, and so in truth)."
3. "John pictures the Father as seeking worshippers, a doctrine running all through the Gospel (John 3:16; John 6:44; John 15:16; 1 John 4:10)."
