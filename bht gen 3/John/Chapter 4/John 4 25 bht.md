### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I know that Messias cometh - As the Samaritans acknowledged the five books of Moses, so they expected, also, the coming of the Messiah."
2. "Which is called Christ - These are probably the words of the evangelist, as it is not likely that the woman would explain the name on such an occasion."
3. "Will tell us all things - Jesus had decided the question proposed to him John 4:20 in favor of the Jews. The woman does not seem to have been satisfied with this answer, and said that the Messiah would tell them all about this question. Probably she was expecting that he would soon appear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They looked for Him to restore the kingdom of Israel and to re-establish the worship on Gerizim, where they supposed that the tabernacle was hidden. They called Him Hushab or Hathab, meaning the Converter, or, according to some, the Returning One." 
2. "The Samaritan idea was less worldly and political than the Jewish."
3. "He is come [ŒµŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÇ] . Emphatic; pointing to Messiah as contrasted with all other teachers."

### John Calvin:
1. "When she says that the Messiah is about to come, she seems to speak of the time as near at hand; and, indeed, it is sufficiently evident from many arguments, that the minds of men were everywhere aroused by the expectation of the Messiah."
2. "The woman prefers Christ to Moses and to all the Prophets in the office of teaching; for she comprehends three things in a few words."
3. "I wish that those who now boast of being the pillars of the Christian Church, would at least imitate this poor woman, so as to be satisfied with the simple doctrine of Christ, rather than claim I know not what power of superintendence for putting forth their inventions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is nothing surprising in her avowal that a Deliverer was looked for."
2. "The Samaritan hope was mainly founded on the great passage in the Pentateuch, Deuteronomy 18:15-18."
3. "The woman‚Äôs words, indeed, may not convey her whole conception of Messiah, for the context has pointed only to revelation and teaching."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Messiah cometh (ŒúŒµœÉœÉŒπŒ±œÇ ŒµœÅœáŒµœÑŒ±). Hebrew word in N.T. only here and John 1:41 and explained by ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ in both places."
2. "The Samaritans looked for a Messiah, a prophet like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:18)."
3. "Wistfully she turns to this dim hope as a bare possibility about this strange 'prophet.'"

2. "The Messiah is come, who lay in the bosom of the Father, and has made known all things to his disciples."
3. "God has spoken all he has to say that appertains to his own worship, and the salvation of the children of men by his Son Jesus Christ."
