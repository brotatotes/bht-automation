2. "It may be considered, whether or no these two questions may not relate separately, the one to the woman, the other to Christ; as, the first, what seekest thou? to the woman, and the sense be, that no man said to her, what do you want with our master? what are you inquiring about of him? what would you have of him? or what do you seek for from him? and the latter, why talkest thou with her? peculiarly to Christ."

2. "They marvelled likewise at his talking with a woman of that nation, which was so peculiarly hateful to the Jews."
3. "Yet none said â€” To the woman, What seekest thou? - Or to Christ, Why talkest thou with her?"

- Attempt 1 BHT: The disciples stood and contemplated Jesus talking with a woman, marveling at the sight. They were surprised not because he was talking with that particular woman, but rather because he was conversing with any woman in public. The disciples held Jesus in such high regard, believing him to be a rabbi, and they felt that his actions were beneath his dignity. The Jews had a precept that forbid talking with women in public, even one's own wife. Nevertheless, Jesus defied societal norms and engaged in conversation with this woman, demonstrating his deep understanding and disregard for cultural restrictions. In their astonishment, the disciples missed the profound spiritual instruction taking place before their eyes. It is a lesson for us all to not be hindered by our own preconceived notions or societal expectations but to be open to God's work, even when it may appear unconventional or unexpected.
