## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Is not this the Christâ€”The form of the question is a distant, modest way of only half insinuating what it seemed hardly fitting for her to affirm."
2. "Nor does she refer to what He said of Himself, but solely to His disclosure to her of the particulars of her own life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Is not this the Christ? - Though she probably believed it, yet she proposed it modestly, lest she should appear to dictate in a case which was so important, and which demanded so much attention."
2. "The evidence on which she was satisfied that he was the Messiah was that he had told her all things that she had done - perhaps much more than is here recorded."
3. "The question which she submitted to them was whether this was not satisfactory proof that he was the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus' insight in the one case convinced her that He knew everything, and to her awakened conscience it seemed as though He had told everything."
2. "Is not this the Christ? Rather, can this be. The particle suggests a negative answer. Surely this cannot be, yet with some hope."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was a very powerful stimulant which she employed to excite them, when she knew, by a sign which was not obscure or doubtful, that he was a prophet."
2. "This having been ascertained, they begin to attend to his doctrine."
3. "Yet we see that the woman, kindled by a holy zeal, does not spare herself, or her reputation, to magnify the name of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did. She fixes on the wonderful knowledge which the Stranger had displayed: what had impressed her must also convince them."
2. "Let them come for themselves, not rest on her testimony; and let them draw their own conclusions."
3. "Her own belief she expresses in the form of doubt, or problem to be solved; and every reader must feel how natural and wise was her procedure."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All things that ever I did... Ha, not Î¿ÏƒÎ± (as many as), no 'ever' in the Greek." 
2. "But a guilty conscience (verse John 4:18) led her to exaggerate a bit." 
3. "She is already convinced herself (verses John 4:26), but she puts the question in a hesitant form to avoid arousing opposition."

### John Gill:
1. "Come, see a man,.... An uncommon, an extraordinary man, a prophet, and, who himself says, he is the Messiah..."
2. "Which told me all things that ever I did... referring more especially to the account he had given her of her having had five husbands..."
3. "is not this the Christ? that was to come, has been promised and prophesied of, and we have expected, who is of quick understanding, and even God omniscient; surely this must be he, as he himself says he is."

### John Wesley:
1. "His words awakened her conscience, which soon told her all the rest."
