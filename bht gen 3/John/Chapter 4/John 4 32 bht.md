## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The bodily thirst (and hunger probably, from the time of day) which our Lord had felt before, had been and was forgotten in the carrying on of His divine work in the soul of this Samaritan woman."
2. "Although I and you are emphatic, the words are not spoken in blame, for none was deserved: but in fulness and earnestness of spirit."
3. "In a feeling analogous to that which comes upon us when called from high and holy employment to the supply of the body or to the business of this world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I have been eating all the while, and such food as ye dream not of."
2. "What can that be? they ask each other; have any supplies been brought Him in our absence?"
3. "He knows what they are saying though He hears it not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. I have meat to eat - See John 4:34.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Meat (brwsin). Originally the act of eating (Colossians 2:16), but often of that which is eaten. A parallel is found in the vulgar phrase, a thing is good or poor eating." 
2. "The word is always used by Paul in its original sense."
3. "Know not of [ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒøŒπŒ¥Œ±œÑŒµ] . Incorrect. Rev., rightly, ye know not; i.e., you do not know its virtue."

### John Calvin:
1. "He only points out what he must do first, and what must be done afterwards; and thus he shows, by his example, that the kingdom of God ought to be preferred to all the comforts of the body."
2. "He who shall place it before him as the end of life to serve the Lord, from which we are not at liberty to turn aside even for the immediate danger of death, will certainly reckon it to be of more value than eating and drinking."
3. "The metaphor of eating and drinking is so much the more graceful on this occasion, that it was drawn seasonably from the present discourse."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I have meat to eat that ye know not." 
2. "This 'eating' the disciples 'knew not. The common rendering entirely obscures the meaning: our Lord does not say 'know not of, but 'know not,' ye have no experience of it."
3. "As yet, they had not learned the power of such work as His (the complete fulfilment of His Father‚Äôs will, John 4:34) to satisfy every want."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Meat (Œ≤œÅœâœÉŒπŒΩ). Originally the act of eating (Romans 14:17) from Œ≤ŒπŒ≤œÅœâœÉŒ∫œâ, but soon and commonly as that which is eaten like Œ≤œÅœâŒºŒ± once in John (verse John 4:34)."
2. "So here and John 6:27; John 6:55. Cf. vernacular English 'good eating,' 'good eats.'"
3. "I ... ye (ŒµŒ≥œâ ... œÖŒºŒµŒπœÇ). Emphatic contrast. Spiritual food Jesus had."

### John Gill:
1. "I have meat to eat that ye know not of: meaning the conversion of the Samaritan woman, and of other Samaritans, who were flocking in great numbers to him, which he knew, though his disciples did not..."
2. "...and the harvest of souls he had a prospect of, see John 4:35, was as meat unto him, delightful and refreshing..."
3. "...his mind and thoughts were so taken up with these things, that he had no inclination to any corporeal food."
