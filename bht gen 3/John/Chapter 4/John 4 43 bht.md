- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus left Judea for Galilee to avoid the increasing attention and fame surrounding Him and His ministry. He specifically chose Galilee because it was His own country where, as a prophet, He was unlikely to be honored. After spending two days in Sychar, Jesus proceeded to Galilee, as He had intended to do before the interruption in Sychar. It is likely that He went to other parts of Galilee, possibly even Cana, but not to Nazareth, where He was not esteemed.
