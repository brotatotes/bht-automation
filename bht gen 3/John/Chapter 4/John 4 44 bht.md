# John 4:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus went into the region of Galilee, but not to that part called 'His own country,' Nazareth. He acted on the maxim that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. This maxim explains Jesus's motive in going into Galilee, where he had not yet labored and where he apparently had no such fame as in Judea and now in Samaria. Jesus understood that he would not be properly received by those who were familiar with him, therefore he sought new areas to share his message.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus went into the region of Galilee, not to his own country of Nazareth, because he knew that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. He acted on this maxim, recognizing that his own country, whether it be Judea or Galilee, would not properly receive him. Although some may argue that this quote does not appear to apply to Judea since Jesus was leaving Judea due to his popularity there, it is likely that John is referring to Judea as Jesus's own country. Regardless of the specific location, the verse emphasizes the lack of honor Jesus received from those who were familiar with him, as they treated him with contempt and disrespect.
