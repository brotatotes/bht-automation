## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The little spark of faith in the breast of this nobleman is by Him lit up into a clear and enduring flame for the light and comfort of himself and his house."
3. "come down: see on ch. ii. 12."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If men receive benefits of Christ, they must come in the same manner. The rich and the poor, the high and the low, must come personally as humble suppliants, and must be willing to bear all the reproach that may be cast on them for thus coming to him."
2. "This man showed strong faith in being willing thus to go to Jesus, but he erred in supposing that Jesus could heal only by his being present with his son."
3. "One design of Jesus in working this miracle was to show him that this was not necessary. Hence he did not go down to Capernaum, but healed him where he was."

### John Calvin:
1. "But Christ describes here far greater wickedness; for the Jews depended so much on miracles, that they left no room for the word."
2. "Thus they had no religion, no knowledge of God, no practice of godliness, except what consisted in miracles."
3. "I wish there were not many persons in the present day affected by the same disease; but nothing is more common than this saying, 'Let them first perform miracles, and then we will lend an ear to their doctrine;'"

1. "The faith of this father rested on the miracles of which he had heard."
2. "Would Jesus but come down from Cana to Capernaum, his son also might be healed."
3. "But Jesus must always reprove the spirit which requires 'signs and wonders' before yielding faith; and He does it now."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The news spread rapidly about Jesus."
2. "He had heard the people talk about the miracles in Jerusalem and the first one in Cana."
3. "Reason for the urgency. Imperfect active of Î¼ÎµÎ»Î»Ï‰ with present active infinitive old and common verb for what is about to be and it is used with the infinitive present as here, the aorist infinitive (Revelation 13:16), or the future infinitive (Acts 11:28)."

### John Gill:
1. "The nobleman believed that Christ had power to do it, by what he had heard concerning him, but thought his corporeal presence was absolutely necessary to it."
2. "For he was at the point of death; or 'would die': he was very near it; there was no likelihood of his recovery."
3. "He seemed to be near his death, and must die for any human help that could be obtained, or natural means that could be used."

### John Wesley:
1. To come down â€” For Cana stood much higher than Capernaum.
