# John 4:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The charge brought against the Jews was that they would only believe in Jesus if they saw signs and wonders, while the Samaritans believed through His word alone. Jesus, though disappointed to be seen primarily as a miracle worker, still received the nobleman and performed the sign. The Jews' sin of unbelief was their constant demand for more signs, whereas the Samaritans believed without them. This illustrates the importance of faith in Jesus beyond relying solely on miracles.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Jews, including the nobleman, demanded to see signs and wonders in order to believe in Jesus, while the Samaritans had believed simply through His word. Despite their imperfect understanding and condition of faith, Jesus did not dismiss the nobleman, but worked the sign for him. However, Jesus expressed disappointment that he was primarily regarded as a miracle worker in Galilee. The Jews' sin of unbelief lay in their continual demand for more signs, even though they had already witnessed miracles. This charge was particularly directed towards the Galileans, who were eager to see more miracles. The contrast between the Samaritans' faith and the Jews' demand for signs highlights the different levels of belief and the significance of believing in Jesus without solely relying on miracles.
