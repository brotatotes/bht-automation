### John Calvin:

2. "With this agrees the circumstance of the time; for it is not wonderful that, being thirsty and fatigued, he rested at the well about noon."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The city which gave its name to this district of the Holy Land, Samaria, distant about six miles, had recently been rebuilt in a style of great magnificence by Herod the Great, who gave it the name of Sebaste."
2. "The Samaritans received one portion only, the Pentateuch; but for this they professed peculiar reverence. A comparison of the Samaritan Pentateuch with that of the Hebrew Bible shows that many alterations had been introduced into the text by the Samaritans, but at the same time that these had only been made for the purpose of authenticating their own mode of worship and of maintaining the honour of their sacred places."
3. "The slight sketch which we have been able to give of the history of this people will be sufficient to show how singular was their situation. The ancient writings of the Jews themselves deal with Samaritans now as with heathen, now as with men belonging to the stock of Israel; and the narrative of this chapter places them in the same position‚Äîa position not wholly Gentile, but intermediate between the Jewish and Gentile world."

3. "Parcel of ground (œáœâœÅŒπŒøœÖ). Old use of this diminutive of œáœâœÅŒøœÇ or œáœâœÅŒ±, a piece of ground."


### John Gill:
