# John 4:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The nobleman's weak faith was strengthened by Jesus' words, and his belief in the healing of his son was almost as miraculous as the physical one. In contrast to the centurion, Jesus spoke the word only and the man believed, resulting in the immediate cure of his dying son. The man's faith was evidenced by his departure from Jesus, and the wave of salvation extended to his household. The words Thy son is living seemed too good to be true, but the instantaneous faith of the nobleman trusted in Jesus' word.
