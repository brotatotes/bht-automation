# John 4:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The nobleman left Jesus confidently, believing that an amendment was taking place. When Jesus responded bluntly, he sought to deepen the nobleman's faith, as he did with Nicodemus. Although the nobleman did not witness the healing, his son was restored, affirming the power of Jesus' word. This serves as a reminder that when the Lord offers his blessings, his power will always fulfill his promises, as long as we do not shut the door with unbelief. It is important to assess our faith when we do not see immediate aid.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The nobleman in this verse appeared to have left Jesus gradually and confidently, believing in the amendment that was taking place. Jesus, in his response, sought to deepen the nobleman's faith, as he had done with Nicodemus. The nobleman's son was healed even though he did not witness the exact moment of the healing, which reveals the power of Jesus' word.

We may not always see immediate aid, but this should prompt us to examine our level of faith and trust in the Lord.
