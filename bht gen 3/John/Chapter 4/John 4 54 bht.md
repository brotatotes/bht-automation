# John 4:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By both, half-belief was strengthened into faith in Him: but in each case it is of a different kind. The inner kernel of the history is the elevation of a weak and mere wonder-seeking faith into a deep conviction of the personal power and love of our Lord. The external point brought out in the commendation there, 'I have not seen such faith, no, not in Israel,' is not only different from, but stands in absolute contrast with, the depreciating charge here, 'Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.'
