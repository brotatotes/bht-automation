## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly, it seems to me, on account of the part which this miracle bore in the calling ont and assuring of faith by the manifestation of His glory, as that first one had done before."
2. "By both, half-belief was strengthened into faith in Him: but in each case it is of a different kind."
3. "The inner kernel of the history is, in our case here,‚Äîthe elevation of a weak and mere wonder-seeking faith into a deep conviction of the personal power and love of our Lord; in the other, the commendation of a noble confession of our Lord‚Äôs divine power, indicating great strength and grasp of faith, and inducing the greatest personal humility."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two points upon which our attention is fixed seem to be (1) that this miracle was wrought in Galilee; (2) that it was a second miracle there."
2. "The first of these points receives importance from the fact that the 'sign' now related was done after Jesus had left 'His own country,' rejected by 'His own' to be accepted by Galileans."
3. "It is not necessary to discuss the question whether this miracle is identical with that related in Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:2-10. We may wonder that such a question was ever raised."

1. "The second sign that (Œ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ œÉŒ∑ŒºŒµŒπŒøŒΩ)."
2. "No article, simply predicate accusative, 'This again a second sign did Jesus having come out of Judea into Galilee.'"
3. "The first one was also in Cana (John 2:1), but many were wrought in Jerusalem also (John 2:23)."

### John Gill:
