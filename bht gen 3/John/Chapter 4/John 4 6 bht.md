## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is no authority for the meaning 'just as he was,' or 'just as it happened,' i.e. on the bare stone." 
2. "The unusualness of a woman coming to draw water at mid-day is no argument against its possibility; indeed the very fact of her being alone seems to show that it was not the common time."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We seem to be beside Him, overhearing all that is here recorded, nor could any painting of the scene on canvas, however perfect, do other than lower the conception which this exquisite narrative conveys to the devout and intelligent reader."
2. "But with all that is human, how much also of the divine have we here, both blended in one glorious manifestation of the majesty, grace, pity, patience."
3. "What music is that which I hear from His lips, 'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jacobâ€™s well - This is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was called 'Jacobâ€™s well,' probably, either because it was handed down by tradition that he dug it, or because it was near to the land which he gave to Joseph." 
2. "There is still a well a few miles to the east of Nablus, which is said by the people there to be the same. Eli Smith, missionary to Syria, stated to me that he had visited this well." 
3. "The sixth hour - About twelve oâ€™clock noon. This was the common time of the Jewish meal, and this was the reason why his disciples were gone away to buy food."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The traditional well still remains. 'At the mouth of the valley of Schechem two slight breaks are visible in the midst of the vast plain of corn - one a white Mussulman chapel; the other a few fragments of stone. The first of these covers the alleged tomb of Joseph,... the second marks the undisputed site of the well, now neglected and choked up by the ruins which have fallen into it; but still with every claim to be considered the original well.'"
2. "All confirm the saying of the Samaritan woman that 'the well is deep.' Maundrell, in 1697, makes the depth one hundred and five feet, with fifteen feet of water. Mr. Calhoun, in 1838, found nearly the same depth of water. Dr. Wilson, in 1841, found the depth only seventy-five feet, which is confirmed by the later measurements of Captain Anderson in 1866, and of Lieutenant Conder in 1875."
3. "Sixth Hour. According to the Jewish reckoning, mid-day. According to the Roman mode, between 5 and 6 P.M. See on 1 39. Evening was the usual time for drawing water."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Yet it may be worth noticing that the litter name is used by the woman of Samaria: to the Evangelist the well is a â€˜fountain,â€™ and his name implies far deeper and richer thoughts than hers."
2. "Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the fountain."
3. "If our Lordâ€™s journey through Samaria took place in the middle of December (see the note on John 4:35), 5 P.M. would be about the time of sunset, and the evening twilight would last until about half-past 6."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John emphasizes the human emotions of Jesus."
2. "Thus wearied, a graphic picture."
3. "Roman time, about 6 P.M., the usual time for drawing water."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey ... proves the truth and reality of it, was greatly fatigued; having very probably travelled all that morning, if not a day, or days before."
2. "he sat like a weary person, glad to set himself down any where; and not caring how, or where, he sat to rest his weary limbs."
3. "it was a time of day to take some refreshment, which as yet he had not, the disciples being gone to buy food; and a time of day also, when the sun if out, and has any strength, beats with its greatest vehemence; and all which considered, it is no wonder that he should be weary, faint, and thirsty."

### John Wesley:
1. Jesus sat down â€” Weary as he was.
It was the sixth hour â€” Noon; the heat of the day.
