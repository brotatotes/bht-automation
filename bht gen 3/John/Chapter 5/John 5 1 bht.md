# John 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The specific feast mentioned in this portion of Scripture is not definitively identified, with suggestions including the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. The lack of a clear designation is consistent with the Gospel of John's approach of only including what is relevant to the narrative. While the evidence leans towards it being a Passover, the reasons for this conclusion cannot be fully elaborated. It is worth noting that John does not aim to provide a comprehensive account of Jesus' actions, leaving room for the possibility of Jesus visiting Jerusalem prior to the events in chapter 6.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "No reason need be given why St. John does not name the feast; it is quite in accordance with his practice of mentioning nothing that does not concern his subject-matter."
3. "It can hardly have been a Passover, both because it is called a feast, not the feast, as in ch. vi. 4, and because if so, we should have an interval of a whole year between this chapter and the next, which is not probable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No question has more divided the Harmonists of the Gospels, and the duration of our Lord's ministry may be said to hinge on it."
2. "Those who are dissatisfied with the Passover-view all differ among themselves what other feast it was, and some of the most acute think there are no grounds for deciding."

2. "To John, through clearness of insight, not from power of fancy, every action of his Master was fraught with deep significance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John does not attempt a full story of the work of Jesus."
2. "Surely it is not incongruous to think of Jesus making a visit to Jerusalem before the events in chapter 6."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: It is uncertain which specific feast is being referred to in this verse, with some suggesting the Passover, Pentecost, or the Feast of Tabernacles. The lack of clarity is consistent with the Gospel of John's practice of mentioning only what is relevant to the narrative. Although the evidence leans towards it being a Passover, the reasons cannot be fully explained here. It is important to note that John does not attempt to present a comprehensive account of Jesus' work, so it is not unlikely for Jesus to have made a visit to Jerusalem prior to the events mentioned in chapter 6. We can imagine Jesus traveling towards Jerusalem from various directions, except from Hebron. Throughout the Gospel of John, the mention of festivals is always intended to convey deeper truths and serve as types of Jesus and His work.
