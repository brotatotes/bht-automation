# John 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:

This miraculous cure serves as a powerful testimony to the complete healing, and emphasizes Jesus as the Lord of the Sabbath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews, never the multitude, but always those in authority of some kind, whom John ever puts forward as the representatives of the whole people in their rejection of the Lord."
2. "Our Lord does not... appeal here to the reasonableness of the deed being done on the Sabbath, saving the sanctity of the Sabbath, but takes altogether loftier ground, as being One greater than the Sabbath."
3. "The whole kernel of this incident and discourse is not, that it is lawful to do works of mercy on the Sabbath: but that the Son of God (here) is Lord of the Sabbath."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A glorious testimony to the cure, as instantaneous and complete, from the lips of the most prejudiced!"
2. "In ordinary circumstances, the rulers had the law on their side."
3. "Yet they ingeniously parried the thrust, asking him, not who had 'made him whole'‚Äîthat would have condemned themselves and defeated their purpose‚Äîbut who had bidden him 'take up his bed and walk,' in other words, who had dared to order a breach of the sabbath?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. Not lawful - It was forbidden, they supposed, in the Old Testament. The Jews were very strenuous in the observation of the external duties of religion.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. Cured [œÑŒµŒ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖŒºŒµŒΩœâ] . See on Matthew 8:7; Luke 5:15; Acts 17:25. 
To carry [Œ±œÅŒ±Œπ] . Rev., more correctly, to take up. It is Jesus ' own word in ver. 8.


### John Calvin:
1. "We are therefore taught by this example to avoid every rash judgment, until the reason of each action be fully known."
2. "Whatever contradicts the word of God deserves to be condemned without hesitation; but, as it frequently happens that there are mistakes in this matter, we ought first to inquire modestly and calmly, that our decision may be sound and sober."
3. "But this appears to be worthy of reproof, that a miracle turns him aside from obedience to the Law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question must be decided apart from the miracle, of which at this moment the Jews seem to have had no knowledge."
2. "The law of Moses forbade any work on [the Sabbath]; and the special enactments in the Pentateuch show how this law was to be interpreted."
3. "Our Lord‚Äôs answer to the Jews makes no reference to their casuistical distinctions or to traditions by which the law was overlaid."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unto him that was cured (œÑœâ œÑŒµŒ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖŒºŒµŒΩœâ). Perfect passive articular participle of Œ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖœâ (only example in John), 'to the healed man.'" 
2. "To take up thy bed (Œ±œÅŒ± œÑŒøŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÑœÑŒøŒΩ). The very words of Jesus (verse John 5:8), only infinitive (first aorist active)." 
3. "The healing of the man was a minor detail."

### John Gill:
1. "Surely you forget yourself, or you would never be guilty of such an action as this."
2. "Carrying out and bringing in anything, from one place to another, is said to be work, and one of the principal works."
3. "He that rolls up a bed of the brasiers or tinkers (i.e. on the sabbath day) is bound to a sin offering."
