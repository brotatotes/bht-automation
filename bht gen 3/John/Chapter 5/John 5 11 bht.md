# John 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The man's excuse reveals the depth of the matter since the one who had the power to make him whole also had the power to go against the law. This reasoning, though it may not have been consciously present in the man's mind, was clear to the Jews who shifted blame from him to the one who healed him. By using the demonstrative pronoun, it is emphasized that the same one who made him whole had the authority to suspend the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The manâ€™s excuse is simple and sufficient; and for us, important, inasmuch as it goes into the depth of the matter, and is by the Jews themselves accepted."
2. "He who had power to make him whole, had power to suspend that law which was, like the healing, Godâ€™s work. The authority which had overruled one appointment of Providence, could overrule another."
3. "I do not mean that this reasoning was present to the manâ€™s mind;â€”he very likely spoke only from intense feeling of obligation to One who had done so much for him;â€”but it lay beneath the words, and the Jews recognized it, by transferring their blame, from the man, to Him who healed him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If Jesus had power to work so signal a miracle, he had a right to explain the law."
2. "The mercy of God in pardoning our sins, or in bestowing any signal blessing, imposes the obligation to obey him."
3. "Our business is a simple, hearty, child-like obedience, let the men of the world say or think of us as they choose."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. He that made - the same [Î¿ Ï€Î¿Î¹Î·ÏƒÎ±Ï‚ - ÎµÎºÎµÎ¹Î½Î¿Ï‚] . The demonstrative pronoun points with emphasis to the subject of the preceding clause. A characteristic usage of John. See John 1:18, John 1:33; John 9:37; John 10:1; John 12:48, etc.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whether the man knew the Rabbinical saying that a prophetâ€™s command to transgress the letter of the law was to be obeyed, save in the case of idolatry, may be doubted..."
2. "But the impression made on him by the majesty of Jesus was sufficient to guide his answer."
3. "Divine power had healed him: a command from One who wielded such power could not transgress the law of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The same (ÎµÎºÎµÎ¹Î½Î¿Ï‚). 'That one,' emphatic demonstrative as often in John." 
2. "The man did not know who Jesus was nor even his name."
3. "Whole (Ï…Î³Î¹Î·). Predicate accusative agreeing with Î¼Îµ (me)."

### John Gill:
1. "he that had such divine power, as to make him whole, had power to dispense with the sabbath."
2. "his word was warrant and authority sufficient, to support him in what he did."
3. "he that had wrought this cure for him, he concluded must be from God; was at least a great prophet, and to be hearkened to and obeyed, in one thing as well as another."
