# John 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people, more interested in seizing upon any excuse to condemn, ask not about the one who performed the healing, but instead question the authority behind the command to carry the bed. They focus solely on this supposed breach of the Sabbath law, displaying the cunning of malice and a deliberate desire to obscure and disregard the merciful work that had taken place. Their indifference to the miracle and their complete unwillingness to give glory to Christ is a clear illustration of their hard-hearted malice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not, ‚Äòwho is he that healed thee?‚Äô but they carefully bring out the unfavourable side of what had taken place."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thus men often assume that a certain course or opinion is proper, and when anyone differs from them they look only at the difference, but not at the reasons for it."
2. "One great source of dispute among men is that they look only at the points in which they differ, but are unwilling to listen to the reasons why others do not believe as they do."
3. "It is always enough to condemn one in the eyes of a bigot that he differs from 'him,' and he looks upon him who holds a different opinion, as the Jews did at this man, 'as certainly wrong;'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "See the cunning of malice. They do not say, 'Who is he that healed thee?' but, 'Who bade thee take up thy bed?'" 
2. "Literally, take up and walk."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mention of the cure has no effect in leading them to suspend their judgment."
2. "They content themselves with passing it by, and laying stress on what they consider an undeniable breach of the very letter of the commandment."
3. "This complete indifference to the work of mercy plainly illustrates the hard-hearted malice of ‚Äòthe Jews.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Who is the man? (Œ§ŒπœÇ ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ Œø Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÉ;). Contemptuous expression, "Who is the fellow?" They ask about the command to violate the Sabbath, not about the healing. 


### John Gill:
1. "They take no notice of the cure, being unwilling to give any glory to Christ, and still less to spread it; but chose rather that it should be obscured, hid, and unobserved..." 
2. "And they call him a man, as supposing him to be a mere man, and a wicked man too, for giving orders to transgress a tradition of the elders..." 
3. "And so the Jews since, though they cannot find fault with the cure, which they put an 'if' upon, yet are highly displeased with the order, to take up his bed and carry it..."
