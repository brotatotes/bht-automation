# John 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus performed a miraculous healing during a crowded feast, the man who had been healed did not even know who had cured him. Jesus purposefully slipped away to avoid hasty popularity and precipitate hatred. This man, though he may not have known Jesus, was well aware that someone remarkable had healed him. The context required Jesus to withdraw, as it was not yet time for His glory to be fully revealed. The man's lack of faith did not hinder the healing, but rather highlighted that Jesus was the true source of the miracle.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His fame had not been so spread yet, but that He might during the crowd of strangers at the feast pass unnoticed."
2. "Jesus passed on unobserved by him: just spoke the healing words, and then went on among the crowd."
3. "The context requires this interpretation: being violated by the ordinary one, that Jesus â€˜conveyed himself away, because a multitude was in the place.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That some one, with unparalleled generosity, tenderness and power, had done it, the man knew well enough."
2. "He disappeared too quickly for any inquiries."
3. "He slipped out of the crowd that had gathered, to avoid both hasty popularity and precipitate hatred."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Wist not - Knew not."
2. "Had conveyed himself away - Was lost in the crowd."
3. "He had silently mingled with the multitude, or had passed on with the crowd unobserved, and the man had been so rejoiced at his cure that he had not even asked for the name of his benefactor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that was healed [Î¹Î±Î¸ÎµÎ¹Ï‚]. Compare ver. 10, and note the different word for healing."
2. "Who it was [Ï„Î¹Ï‚ ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½]. The present tense, who it is."
3. "Had conveyed Himself away [ÎµÎ¾ÎµÎ½ÎµÏ…ÏƒÎµÎ½]. The verb means, literally, to turn the head aside, in order to avoid something. Hence, generally, to retire or withdraw. Only here in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ certainly did not intend that the glory of so great a work should pass away..."
2. "He intended that it should become generally known before that he acknowledged himself to be the Author of it."
3. "And hence we learn that the cure of this man cannot be ascribed to his faith, since, even after having been cured, he does not acknowledge his Physician."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We need not wonder that this man, unable to move from place to place, perhaps only recently come to Jerusalem, had no previous knowledge of Jesus."
2. "After his cure, too, he could hear nothing of his benefactor, for, to avoid the recognition and enthusiasm of the multitude (comp. chap. John 6:15), Jesus withdrew, literally â€˜slipped aside,â€™ became suddenly lost to sight."
3. "The conflict between Jesus and the Jews has begun: all His actions deepen their hatred against Him. The â€˜multitude,â€™ on the other hand, is the object of His compassion: from time to time they follow Him eagerly, however slight may be their knowledge of His true teaching and aims (John 6:2; John 6:15)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He that was healed (Î¿ Î¹Î±Î¸ÎµÎ¹Ï‚). First aorist passive articular participle of Î¹Î±Î¿Î¼Î± (John's usual word)."
2. "Who it was (Ï„Î¹Ï‚ ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½). Present tense preserved in indirect question."
3. "Had conveyed himself away (ÎµÎ¾ÎµÎ½ÎµÏ…ÏƒÎµÎ½). First aorist active indicative of ÎµÎºÎ½ÎµÏ‰, old verb to swim out, to slip out, or from ÎµÎºÎ½ÎµÏ…Ï‰, to turn out, to turn the head to one side (to one side with which compare ÎµÎ½ÎµÎ½ÎµÏ…Î¿Î½, they nodded, Luke 1:62)."

### John Gill:
1. "He had never seen, and perhaps had never heard of Christ before, and so knew him not..."
2. "Christ gave him no opportunity of conversing with him, or so much as to ask him who he was..."
3. "He passed through them, and went his way to the temple, where he found the man he had healed..."
