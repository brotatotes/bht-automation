# John 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as the Son of God, sanctifies the Sabbath by working on it and elevates it above a mere legal discipline. The true essence of Sabbath lies not in the abstention from labor, but in the opportunity for divine and heavenly work. The Father's unceasing activity in maintaining and redeeming the world serves as the precedent for Jesus' own work. By emphasizing his equal will and procedure to that of the Father, Jesus justifies his healing on the Sabbath and establishes his unique relationship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Sabbath was made for man;â€”and, in its Jewish form, for man in a mere state of legal discipline."
2. "He, the only-begotten of the Father, doing the works of God in the world, stands on higher ground, and hallows, instead of breaking the Sabbath, by thus working on it."
3. "Abstinence from outward work belongs not to the idea of a Sabbath, it is only more or less the necessary condition of it for beings so framed as ever to be in danger of losing the true collection and rest of the spirit in the multiplicity of earthly toil and business."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The creative and conservative activity of My Father has known no sabbath-cessation from the beginning until now, and that is the law of My working."
2. "The 'I' is emphatic."
3. "My Father worketh hitherto and I work."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God has not ceased to work on the Sabbath... the obligation to 'rest' on the Sabbath does not extend to Him." 
2. "As God does good on that day; as he is not bound by the law which requires his creatures to rest on that day, so 'I' do the same." 
3. "The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Father's work in maintaining and redeeming the world has continued from the creation until the present moment: until now, not interrupted by the Sabbath."
2. "The two clauses are coordinated. The relation, as Meyer observes, is not that of imitation, or example, but of equality of will and procedure."
3. "Man's true rest is not a rest from human, earthly labor, but a rest for divine, heavenly labor."

### John Calvin:
1. "What Christ insists upon is this, that the holy rest which was enjoined by the Law of Moses is not disturbed when we are employed in works of God."
2. "For it is only from their own works that men are commanded to abstain; and, accordingly, circumcision â€” which is a work of God, and not of men â€” is not at variance with the Sabbath."
3. "But it is chiefly concerning himself that Christ speaks, to whom the Jews were more hostile. He declares that the soundness of body which he has restored to the diseased man is a demonstration of his divine power. He asserts that he is the Son of God, and that he acts in the same manner as his Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God rested from His works of creation on the seventh day; this day was hallowed and set apart for manâ€™s rest from labour, a rest which was the shadow of the rest of God, and which was designed to remove from man everything that might hinder him from entering in spirit into that fellowship with God which is perfect rest."
2. "From the creation to this very moment the Father hath been working; in His very rest upholding all things by the word of His power, providing all things for His creatures, working out the purpose of His love in their redemption."
3. "'My Father worketh until now,' with no pause or intermission: 'I also work.' He who can thus call God His Father finds in the works of His Father the law of His own works."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not 'our Father,' claim to peculiar relation to the Father." (John 5:17)
2. "He made the Sabbath for man's blessing, but cannot observe it himself." (John 5:17)
3. "Jesus puts himself on a par with God's activity and thus justifies his healing on the Sabbath." (John 5:17)

### John Gill:
1. "He who is my Father, not by creation, or adoption, but by nature, though he ended all his work on the seventh day, and rested from what he had done; yet he did not cease from working at all, but has continued to work ever since."
2. "I work in conjunction with him, as a co-efficient cause in the works of providence, in the government of the world, in upholding all things in it, in bearing up the pillars of the earth, in holding things together, and sustaining all creatures."
3. "I do but what my Father does, and therefore, as he is not to be blamed for his works on that day, as none will say he is, no more am I."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Man's obedience to the Sabbath is merely a state of legal discipline, while Jesus, as the Son of God, hallowed the Sabbath by doing the works of God on that day. The true meaning of Sabbath is not the absence of outward work, but rather the opportunity for divine, heavenly labor. The Father's continuous activity in maintaining and redeeming the world allows no interruption, and Jesus, claiming a unique relationship with the Father, affirms his equality in will and procedure. Therefore, his healing on the Sabbath is justified because he aligns himself with God's perpetual work. In asserting his divine power, Jesus emphasizes that he is co-working with the Father in the works of providence, upholding and sustaining all things. This truth is further explained and confirmed in subsequent verses.
