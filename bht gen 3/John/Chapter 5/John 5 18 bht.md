# John 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews objected to Jesus' use of MY FATHER because they understood it to indicate His unique relationship and equality with God, which they considered blasphemous. This opposition unwittingly affirmed the high doctrine Jesus taught. By claiming God as His own Father in the highest sense, Jesus was indeed asserting His equality with God. Their hostility grew as they perceived Jesus annulling the Sabbath law, leading to their relentless pursuit of His death. Jesus, however, exemplified unwavering commitment to truth, even in the face of danger and opposition.
