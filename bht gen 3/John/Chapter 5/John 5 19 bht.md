# John 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son, being one with God, cannot act independently of the Father as His very Person is grounded in the Father's will and counsel. This unity prevents the Son, even in human form, from committing sin. Their nature and action are so closely intertwined that the Son can have no separate interest or action from the Father. Jesus's claim that whatever the Father does, the Son does in the same way affirms His absolute equality with the Father, a claim that stirs further animosity from His enemies.

"The Son does the selfsame works as the Father does, such as the works of creation and providence, the government both of the church, and of the world; and he does these things in like manner, with the same power, and by the same authority, his Father does, and which proves him to be equal with him; the very thing the Jews understood him to have asserted, and which they charged him with."
