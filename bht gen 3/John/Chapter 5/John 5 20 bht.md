## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (this last is ensured by the fact, that) the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him... all things that himself doeth... and this manifestation will go on increasing in majesty." 
2. "...the wonder which now is excited in you by these works may be brought out to its full measure." 
3. "...wonder leading naturally to the 'honour' of ver. 23."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As love has no concealments... the Father communicates to the Son all His counsels, and what has been thus shown to the Son is by Him executed in His mediatorial character." 
2. "With the Father, doing is willing; it is only the Son who acts in Time." 
3. "Their oneness of interest is no unconscious or involuntary thing, but a thing of glorious consciousness, will, and love, of which the Persons themselves are the proper Objects."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This authority he traces to the love which the Father has for him - that special, ineffable, infinite love which God has for his only-begotten Son, feebly and dimly illustrated by the love which an earthly parent has for an only child."
2. "From apostles, prophets, and philosophers no small part of the doings of God are concealed. From the 'Son' nothing is."
3. "The greater works to which he refers are those which he proceeds to specify - he will raise the dead and judge the world, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Filew represents a warmer, more instinctive sentiment, more closely allied to feeling, and implying more passion. Hence ajgapaw is represented by the Latin diligo, the fundamental idea of which is selection, the deliberate choice of one out of a number, on sufficient grounds, as an object of regard." 
2. "Both elements are combined in the Father 's love for the Son (Matthew 3:17; John 3:35; John 4:20)." 
3. "'Eraw, in which the idea of sensual passion predominates, is nowhere used in the New Testament."

2. "And, indeed, out of Christ it will be in vain to seek the power of God."
3. "Though you are dull and stupid, yet the works which God shall afterwards perform by me will draw you, however reluctantly, into admiration."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The principle of the relation between the Father and the Son, out of which this communion springs, is 'love,' an eternal and continuous and infinite love, the source of an eternal and continuous and perfect communion."
2. "The word â€˜showethâ€™ in the first part of the verse includes all time: here the future tense is used, not as pointing to a change in the relation of the Son to the Father, but because the eternal purpose of the Father for mankind is fulfilled in time."
3. "The design of these greater works, of this higher and more complete manifestation of Jesus, is â€˜that ye may marvel.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ï†Î¹Î»ÎµÏ‰ presents the notion of intimate friendship (Ï†Î¹Î»Î¿Ï‚, friend), fellowship, the affectionate side, while Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î±Ï‰ (Latin diligo) is more the intelligent choice."
2. "The Father who does these works... There is more to follow."

2. "At the same time (not at different times) the Father showeth and doth, and the Son seeth and doth."
3. "Greater works â€” Jesus oftener terms them works, than signs or wonders, because they were not wonders in his eyes."
