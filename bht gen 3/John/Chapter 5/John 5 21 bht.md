# John 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son's work in creation is His proper and essential work, while the work of raising and quickening the dead is opened up before Him in His humanity. Just as it is the Father's essential work to vivify the dead, so the Son also has the power to vivify whom He wills. This power to raise and give life is the Son's absolute prerogative as God, and He exercises it according to His own will. In fact, the quickening is the controlling fact of the raising, as the Son's will to give life encompasses both.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is very important to observe the distinction here between the working of the Eternal Son (in creation, e.g.) as He is 'in heaven' with God, and His working in the state of His humiliation, in which the Father should by degrees advance Him to exaltation and put His enemies under His feet." 
2. "The former belong to the Son as His proper and essential work: the latter are opened out before Him in the process of His passing onward in the humanity which He has taken."
3. "So here,â€”as it is the Fatherâ€™s essential work to vivify the dead, so the Son vivifies whom He will: this last whom He will not implying any selection out of mankind, nor said merely to remove the Jewish prejudice that their own nation alone should rise from the dead,â€”but meaning, that in every instance where His will is to vivify, the result invariably follows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "raiseth the dead and quickeneth them â€”one act in two stages. This is His absolute prerogative as God."
2. "so the Son quickeneth themâ€”that is, raiseth up and quickeneth."
3. "whom he willâ€”not only doing the same divine act, but doing it as the result of His own will, even as the Father does it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God has power to raise the dead... Jesus here expressly affirms it, and says he has the same power."
2. "The power of raising the dead must be one of the highest attributes of the divinity."
3. "He has power to renew them, and the renewing of the heart is as much the result of his 'will' as the raising of the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Son quickeneth. Not raiseth and quickeneth. The quickening, however (zwopoiei, maketh alive), includes the raising, so that the two clauses are coextensive." 
2. "In popular conception the raising precedes the quickening; but, in fact, the making alive is the controlling fact of the raising." 
3. "Egeirei, raiseth, means primarily awaketh."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now life contains within itself not only righteousness, but all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and every part of our salvation." 
2. "We ought also to observe in what manner Christ bestows life upon us; for he found us all dead, and therefore it was necessary to begin with a resurrection." 
3. "He specially confers this grace on none but certain men, that is, on the elect."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first example of these works of the Father, which â€˜the Son also doeth in like manner,â€™ is raising up the dead and making to live."
2. "The work spoken of is divided into two parts, the raising and the giving of life."
3. "The Sonâ€™s will is the manifestation of the Fatherâ€™s purpose. There is no suggestion of an absolute decree."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus had not raised the dead, but he claims the power to do it on a par with the power of the Father."
2. "Jesus exercises this power on those 'whom he wills.'"
3. "Christ has power to quicken both body and soul."

### John Gill:
1. "For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them...."

### John Wesley:
1. "The power of quickening whom he will follows from the power of judging."
2. "The acquittal of believers, which presupposes judgment, is treated of."
3. "The general resurrection."
