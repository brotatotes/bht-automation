# John 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Father does not vivify any, but entrusts all quickening power to the Son. The judgment mentioned is about bestowing everlasting life and the Son's role as Judge of the living and the dead. Raising the dead is a sign of the Son's authority in judgment. All judgment, including administration and the final award of condemnation, is given to the Son by the Father. This prerogative of judgment for Christ is not new but has been claimed before. Ultimately, the Son's ability to judge reflects His divine nature and equality with the Father.

2. "The power of judging the world implies ability to search the heart, and omniscience to understand the motives of all actions."
