# John 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, for the Son is the Lord of life and the Judge of the world. It is through knowing and honoring the Son that we can truly know and honor the Father who sent Him. The Father intended for men to honor the Son in the same way they honor Him, and those who do not honor the Son are not truly honoring the Father. We must seek and worship the Father in and through Christ, acknowledging His power and giving Him the honor that is due.
