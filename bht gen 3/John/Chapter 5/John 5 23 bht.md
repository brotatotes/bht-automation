# John 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly honor the Father, we must honor the Son, for they are one in essence and glory. Refusing to honor the Son is ultimately dishonoring the Father who sent Him. Honoring the Son goes beyond recognizing Him as a teacher but acknowledging His divinity and giving Him the reverence due to Him. Through Christ, we come to know and worship the Father. Any dishonor done to the Son reflects upon the Father, as they are equal in honor and glory. Let us honor and worship the Son with the same reverence we give to the Father.

1. "It is true, indeed, that the â€˜judgmentâ€™ of John 5:22 implies condemnation, and that, by consequence, this verse might seem to relate to foes only and not obedient subjects in the kingdom of God.

3. "Whatever dishonour is done to one, reflects on the other."

### John Wesley:

- Attempt 1 BHT: The ultimate purpose in all things is to bring honor to the Father through the Son. Those who refuse to honor the Son are ultimately dishonoring the Father who sent Him. Honoring the Son is not merely acknowledging Him as a teacher, but recognizing His divinity and giving Him the same reverence as the Father. The Father's intention in entrusting judgment to the Son was so that all may honor Him. To withhold proper homage from Jesus Christ is to deny His claims and to be without true Christian faith. It is through Christ that we truly know and worship the Father. Any dishonor to the Son reflects back on the Father, for they are equal in honor and glory. Therefore, let us honor and worship the Son with the same equal honor that we give to the Father.
