- Attempt 1 BHT: He, the Son, is the Lord of life and the Judge of the world, deserving of equal honor to that of the Father. It is imperative to honor Him just as we honor the Father, for the Father intended for all judgment to be entrusted to the Son. Any failure to honor the Son is tantamount to dishonoring the Father who sent Him. There is no comfort in praising Jesus as a teacher while denying the worship due to Him. It is the duty of every believer to give proper homage to Jesus Christ, recognizing and obeying His authority. This signifies the Father's desire to be acknowledged and worshipped in the Son, and therefore, we must seek God the Father through Christ, beholding His power and worshipping Him in Christ. Ultimately, at the Judgment Day, all people will be compelled to honor the Son as every knee will bow to Him and every tongue confess that He is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. This serves as a clear demonstration of the Son's equality with the Father.
