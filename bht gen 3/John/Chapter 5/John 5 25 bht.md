### John Calvin:
1. "When the Evangelist represents the Son of God as swearing so frequently in reference to our salvation, hence we perceive, first, how eagerly he desires our welfare, and next, of how great importance it is that the faith of the Gospel should be deeply fixed and thoroughly confirmed."
2. "Christ declares that we are fully condemned to death. And indeed as we have been, since the revolt of the first man, alienated from God through sin, all who do not acknowledge that they are overwhelmed with everlasting destruction do nothing else than deceive themselves by empty flatteries."
3. "The grace of Christ is a true resurrection from the dead. This grace is conferred on us by the Gospel...For he does not speak indiscriminately of all the dead, but means the elect only, whose ears God pierces and opens, that they may receive the voice of his Son, which restores them to life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that have heard shall live."
2. "The â€˜will showâ€™ is brought into prominence, for it is of the historical fulfilment of those words that the verse before us speaks."

### John Gill:

3. "the voice of Christ is intended his Gospel, which is a voice of love, grace, and mercy, of life and liberty, of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation by him"

### John Wesley:
1. The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God â€” So did Jairus's daughter, the widow's son, Lazarus.
