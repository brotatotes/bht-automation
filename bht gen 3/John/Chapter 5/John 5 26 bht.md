# John 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son's vivifying and judging work are deeply connected as the Father has given Him life in Himself as the Son of God. While we lack life within ourselves, our existence is sustained by Him. The question of whether this refers to the Son's essential life before all time or to God's purpose for this life within the Incarnate Son remains challenging. Nonetheless, Christ's essential relation to the Father serves to clarify and exalt His mediatorial functions. The Son possesses the same life-giving power as the Father, making Him the ultimate source of life.

- Attempt 1 BHT: In this verse, we see the intimate connection between the vivifying and judging work of the Son. The Father has given the Son life in Himself as the Son of God. While none of us have life in ourselves, we find our life in Him. The question of whether this refers to the essential life of the Son before all time or to the purpose of God for this life to reside in the Incarnate Son is a difficult one. But the main point here is that all that Christ says about His essential relation to the Father is meant to explain and exalt His mediatorial functions. The Son has been given this power of life by the Father. This power is not a matter of degree but of fact. It is the unchangeable possession of life, just like that of the Father, which enables Him to be the Giver of life to others.
