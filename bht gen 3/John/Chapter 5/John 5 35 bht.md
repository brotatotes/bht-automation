# John 5:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Baptist was a burning and shining light, attracting crowds at first. However, their interest in him was shallow and short-lived, for they were attracted by his brightness, not his warmth. Even those who remained true to him did not follow his direction to Christ. The Baptist illuminated the way, but he did not shine by his own light. As the great light of his day, he prepared the path for the ultimate Light that is Jesus, rendering his lamp unnecessary.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But you wished only to disport yourselves in his light for a timeâ€”came out to him in crowds at first,â€”andâ€”like silly children who play with the fire till it burns and hurts them, and then shrink from and loathe it,â€”when he began to speak of deep repentance as the preparation for Godâ€™s Kingdom, and laid the axe to the root of the trees, you left him."
2. "No one cared, when he was imprisoned and put to death."
3. "And even those few who remained true to him, did not follow his direction to Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was a burning and a shining lightâ€”literally, 'the burning and shining lamp' (or torch):â€”that is, 'the great light of his day.'"
2. "Christ is never called by the humble word here applied to Johnâ€”a light-bearerâ€”studiously used to distinguish him from his Master, but ever the Light in the most absolute sense."
3. "There is a play of irony here, referring to the hollow delight with which his testimony tickled them."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The interest in the Baptist was a frivolous, superficial, and short-lived excitement."
