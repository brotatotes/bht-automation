# John 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' statement regarding the Father's testimony highlights that God's witness does not come through audible voice or visible form. The witness of the Father is a permanent state of failure to hear and see Him. Instead, God's witness is found in the Scriptures and in the hearts of believers. The Jews, however, have disregarded God's voice and failed to recognize Him in their midst. Had they truly known the Father, they would have recognized Him when Jesus spoke.
