# John 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The spuriousness of this controverted passage can hardly be questioned."
2. "The Vatican, Paris, Cambridge, and Sinaitic MSS. omit it."
3. "The Alexandrine MS. contains it, but with the important variation of 'an angel washed in' instead of 'went down into'."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We have heard of many waters having a medicinal virtue but what water was ever known to cure instantaneously a single disease?"
2. "And who ever heard of any water curing all, even the most diverse diseasesâ€”'blind, halt, withered'â€”alike?"
3. "Any of these peculiaritiesâ€”much more all taken togetherâ€”must have proclaimed the supernatural character of the cures wrought."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All that is special about them in the record is that this was produced by the ministry of an angel. This was in accordance with the common sentiment of the Jews, the common doctrine of the Bible, and the belief of the sacred writers."
2. "What man can prove that all his temporal blessings do not come to him through the medium of others - of parents, of teachers, of friends, of 'angels?' And who can prove that it is unworthy the benevolence of angels to minister to the wants of the poor, the needy, and the afflicted, when 'man' does it, and Jesus Christ did it, and God himself does it daily?"
3. "When this fountain was discovered, or how long its healing properties continued to be known, it is impossible now to ascertain. All that we know of it is what is mentioned here, and conjecture would be useless."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought to guard against the foolish speculations of Plato, for the distance between us and God is too great to allow us to go to the angels, that they may obtain favor for us; but, on the contrary, we ought to come direct to Christ, that, by his guidance, protection, and command, we may have the angels as assistants and ministers of our salvation."
2. "But the manner of curing, which is here described, shows plainly enough that nothing is more unreasonable than that men should subject the works of God to their own judgment; for pray, what assistance or relief could be expected from troubled water?"
3. "Yet the troubling of the water was a manifest proof that God freely uses the elements according to his own pleasure, and that He claims for himself the result of the work."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All of this verse is wanting in the oldest and best manuscripts... It is undoubtedly added... to make clearer the statement."
2. "The Jews explained the healing virtues of the intermittent spring by the ministry of angels."
3. "It is a relief to many to know that the verse is spurious."

### John Gill:
1. "Now this angel may represent a minister of the Gospel, for such are called angels, Revelation 1:20; being called of God, and sent by him, with messages of grace to the sons of men."
2. "The preaching of the Gospel by such, may be aptly signified by the troubling of the waters, as it is by the shaking of heaven, earth, and sea."
3. "Whoever now, upon the preaching of the Gospel, are enabled to step forth and come to Christ, and believe in him, are cured of all their soul maladies and diseases, be they what they will; all their inquiries are pardoned, their persons justified, and they are saved in Christ, with an everlasting salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "An angel â€” Yet many undoubtedly thought the whole thing to be purely natural."
2. "God might design this to raise expectation of the acceptable time approaching, to add a greater lustre to his Son's miracles, and to show that his ancient people were not entirely forgotten of him."
3. "The first â€” Whereas the Son of God healed every day not one only, but whole multitudes that resorted to him."
