### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The disputed verse in John 5:4, which describes the troubling of the waters and the healing that followed, is considered by many to be spurious due to its absence in the oldest and best manuscripts. The notion that a particular water source had the power to cure diseases instantaneously at a certain season only for the first person to enter after the waters were stirred seemed highly improbable and lacking supernatural credibility. The Jews attributed such healing powers to the ministry of angels, but it is important to note that God can freely use elements according to His will. Some commentaries suggest that the troubling of the water may symbolize the preaching of the Gospel, with the angel representing a minister of God's grace. Through faith in Christ, believers are cured of their spiritual ailments. This verse serves to emphasize the power and efficacy of Jesus' miracles, contrasting the limited healing offered by the water with the abundant healing provided by the Son of God to multitudes of people.
