# John 5:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The absence of love for God prevents His covenant people from seeking honor from Him and appreciating the glory He has given to His Son. Without this love in them, they do not have a single desire to know God's will or yield themselves to it, regardless of prejudice or consequences. These rabbis did not love God, and therefore, they did not love Christ. Love for God is the foundation for self-sacrifice and seeking the Father's will rather than seeking glory from men. Their lack of understanding of God's righteousness and the purpose behind His commands was their error. When the love of God does not prevail, there is no desire to obey Him.
