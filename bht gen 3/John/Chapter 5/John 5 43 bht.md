# John 5:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Throughout history, the Jewish people have been quick to embrace false messiahs, even as they reject the true Messiah, Jesus Christ. These impostors come in their own name, seeking personal gain and lacking a divine commission. It is striking how their receptiveness to false Messiahs stands in stark contrast to their rejection of Christ Himself. Jesus, on the other hand, came in His Father's name, not seeking His own glory but obediently carrying out God's will. Let us beware of impostors, always seeking alignment with God's will to avoid being deceived.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Throughout history, the Jewish people have been quick to embrace false messiahs, even though they reject the true Messiah. These impostors come in their own name, seeking their own ends and not pretending to have a divine commission. This pattern has been so consistent that there have been sixty-four recorded false Christs who have deceived the Jews. The tragic irony is that the Jews, who are credulous about these impostors, remain incredulous about Christ Himself. Jesus, on the other hand, came in His Father's name, not seeking His own glory, but carrying out the will of God. The rulers of God's people, both in Jesus' time and throughout history, have often rejected the truth and promoted falsehood under the guise of serving God. Let us be wary of false teachers and impostors, always seeking to align ourselves with God's will and not be deceived by those who come in their own name.

- Attempt 5 BHT: Throughout history, the Jewish people have eagerly welcomed numerous false Messiahs, while simultaneously rejecting the true Messiah, Jesus Christ. These impostors, driven by selfish motives, enter in their own name without any divine authority. The irony lies in the fact that the Jews, who readily believe in these impostors, doubt and refuse to accept Jesus' identity as the true Messiah. Unlike the false teachers, Jesus came in His Father's name, dedicated to fulfilling God's will rather than seeking personal glory. We must be cautious of deceptive figures who come in their own name and remain steadfast in aligning ourselves with God's will.
