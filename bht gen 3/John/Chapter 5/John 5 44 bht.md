# John 5:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews' failure to believe in the unity of God, as revealed by Moses, and their preference for seeking human honor over the glory that comes from God prevented them from truly believing in Christ and receiving the Gospel. Their pursuit of earthly glory was incompatible with genuine faith, hindering them from pleasing God. By exalting the law and Moses, they missed the truth. Only by redirecting their focus from the world to God can one be prepared to receive the Gospel message and enter into true faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
