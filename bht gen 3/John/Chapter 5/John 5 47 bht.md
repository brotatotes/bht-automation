## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Men give greater weight to what is written and published, the letter of a book, than to mere word of mouth."
2. "If then ye believe not what he has written, which comes down to you hallowed by the reverence of ages,â€”how can you believe the words which are uttered by Me, to whom you are hostile?"
3. "Moses leads to Christ:â€”is one of the witnesses by which the Father hath testified of Him: â€˜if then ye have rejected the means, how shall ye reach the end?â€™"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "his writings . . . my wordsâ€”a remarkable contrast, not absolutely exalting Old Testament Scripture above His own words, but pointing to the office of those venerable documents to prepare Christ's way."
2. "the necessity universally felt for documentary testimony in revealed religion."
3. "the relation which the comparative 'letter' of the Old Testament holds to the more flowing 'words' of 'spirit and life' which characterize the New Testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If ye believe not his writings - If you do not credit what he has written which you profess to believe, it is not to be expected that you will believe my declarations."

3. "No one can read this without being struck with his profound wisdom; and it is scarcely possible to conceive that there could be a more distinct declaration and proof that he was equal with God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Gramma primarily means what is written. Hence it may describe either a single character or a document... The word occurs in its narrower sense of characters.... In Acts 28:21, it means official communications.... In John 7:15, Acts 26:24) it is used in the plural as a general term for scriptural and Rabbinical learning.... The one passage in second Timothy cannot be urged in favor of the general use of the term for the scriptures..." 
2. "Thus, too, those who discovered in the Old Testament scriptures references to Christ, would be stigmatized by Pagans, as following the ingenious and fanciful method of the Jewish interpreters, which they held in contempt."
3. "It seems to me, therefore, that the antithesis between the writings of Moses, superstitiously reverenced in the letter, and minutely and critically searched and expounded by the Jews, and the living words (rJhmasin, see on Luke 1:37), is to be recognized."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ appears here to claim less authority for himself than for Moses."
2. "Heaven and earth have been shaken by the voice of the Gospel."
3. "He shows their unbelief to be more aggravated, because the truth of God, recorded in an authentic form, has no authority with them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But if ye believe not his writings, how will ye believe my words?"
2. "if however they did not truly believe the written word, which was constantly in their hands, which was the object of so much reverence, which, as written, could be studied again and again for the removal of every difficulty and the investigation of every claim, then might it well be expected that they would refuse to receive the words which Jesus spoke."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The authority of Moses was the greatest of all for Jews."
2. "Jesus clearly states the fact that Moses wrote portions of the Old Testament, what portions he does not say."
3. "There was no answer from the rabbis to this conclusion of Christ."

3. "It was more likely they should regard what he should say, than what Jesus of Nazareth should, whom they despised."
