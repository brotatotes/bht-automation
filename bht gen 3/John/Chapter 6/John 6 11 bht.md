## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "St. John describes the distribution as being the act of the Lord Himself, and leaves the intervention of the disciples to be understood."
2. "The giving thanks here answers to blessing in the other Gospels. It was the 'grace' of the father of the family; perhaps the ordinary one in use among the Jews."
3. "St. John seems to connect with it the idea brought out by St. Luke, 'He blessed them,' i.e. the loaves."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Perhaps he used the familiar formula, 'Blessed art thou Jehovah our God, King of the world, who causes to come forth bread from the earth.'" (100 words)
2. "He distributed to them that were set down." (7 words)
3. "As much as they would. Peculiar to John." (6 words)

### John Calvin:
1. "Those things which God has appointed for our use, being evidences of his infinite goodness and fatherly love towards us, call on us to offer praise to Him; and thanksgiving, as Paul informs us, is a kind of solemn sanctification, by means of which the use of them begins to be pure to us."
2. "When Christ determined that the bread given to the disciples should grow among their hands, we are taught by it that God blesses our labor when we are serviceable to each other."
3. "And not only does this office belong to his eternal Divinity, but even in his human nature, and so far as he has taken upon him our flesh, the Father has appointed him to be the dispenser, that by his hands he may feed us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "However done, the work of distribution was really His, and the Evangelist would fix our thoughts on Him alone."
2. "It is curious to note that in all the other narratives of it our Lord is said to have â€˜blessedâ€™ before He broke the loaves, whereas in the two accounts of the feeding of the four thousand He â€˜gave thanksâ€™ before breaking the bread: here, however, giving thanks takes the place of blessing."
3. "This would seem to show that the word is here used with intentional significance, probably with marked reference to the Paschal meal, at which thanksgiving played so important a part."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Synoptics use 'blessed' ÎµÏ…Î»Î¿Î³Î·ÏƒÎµÎ½ (Mark 6:41; Matthew 14:19; Luke 9:16)."
2. "He distributed (Î´Î¹ÎµÎ´Ï‰ÎºÎµÎ½). First aorist active indicative of Î´Î¹Î±Î´Î¹Î´Ï‰Î¼, old verb to give to several (Î´Î¹Î±, between)."
3. "As much as they would (Î¿ÏƒÎ¿Î½ Î·Î¸ÎµÎ»Î¿Î½). Imperfect active of Î¸ÎµÎ»Ï‰, 'as much as they wished.'"

### John Gill:
1. "And Jesus took the loaves... and when he had given thanks; he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were sat down." 
2. "It was not by his own hands, but by the means of the disciples...so that the sense is the same."
3. "They had as much... as they chose: in some printed copies it is read, 'as much as he would,' and so the Persic version; that is, as much as Jesus would; but the former is the true reading, and makes the miracle more illustrious."
