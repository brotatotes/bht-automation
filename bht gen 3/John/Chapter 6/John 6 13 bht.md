## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "John goes into fuller detail than the Synoptists."
2. "A detail peculiar to John, emphasizing the identity of the fragments with the original loaves."
3. "Unto them that had eaten (bebrwkosin). Only here in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since, therefore, a smaller quantity is sufficient for a greater number of men, and since the quantity left is nearly double, hence we see more clearly of what value is that blessing of God, against the sight of which we deliberately shut our eyes." 
2. "We ought also to observe, in passing, that though Christ commands them to fill the baskets for illustrating the miracle, yet he likewise exhorts his disciples to frugality, when he says, Gather the fragments which are left, that nothing may be lost; for the increase of the bounty of God ought not to be an excitement to luxury." 
3. "Let those, therefore, who have abundance, remember that they will one day render an account of their immoderate wealth, if they do not carefully and faithfully apply their superfluity to purposes which are good, and of which God approves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The repetition of the words, ‚Äòthe five barley loaves,‚Äô is remarkable; the writer wishes to lay emphasis on the identity of the fragments with the loaves of the original supply." 
2. "Nor is it fanciful to see in this a token that what was symbolized by the precious bread was destined for each tribe of Israel." 
3. "John‚Äôs agreement with the other Evangelists in so minute a point as the use of cophinus in connection with this miracle is interesting and important."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Twelve baskets (Œ¥œâŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ± Œ∫ŒøœÜŒπŒΩŒøœÖœÇ). One for each of the apostles."

3. "Unto them that had eaten (œÑŒøŒπœÇ Œ≤ŒµŒ≤œÅœâŒ∫ŒøœÉŒπŒΩ). Articular perfect active participle (dative case) of Œ≤ŒπŒ≤œÅœâœÉŒ∫œâ, old verb to eat, only here in N.T., though often in LXX."

### John Gill:
1. "Therefore they gathered [them] together,.... The several broken bits of bread, which lay about upon the grass, which the people had left, after they had been sufficiently refreshed." 
2. "and filled twelve baskets; every disciple had a basket filled."
3. "which remained over and above unto them that had eaten; such a marvellous increase was there, through the power of Christ going along with them; insomuch that they multiplied to such a degree, either in the hands of the distributors, or of the eaters."
