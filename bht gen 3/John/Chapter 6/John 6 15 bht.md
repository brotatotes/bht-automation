# John 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the miraculous feeding, the people sought to make Jesus their earthly king, but He withdrew alone to a mountain to rest and pray. He understood their misguided intentions and the movement to start a revolution against Roman rule. Jesus was isolated in his understanding, even from his disciples, as only the Father truly comprehended him at that stage. This incident highlights the danger of neglecting God's word and our tendency to contrive our own opinions, instead of faithfully following Him.
