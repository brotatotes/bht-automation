## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word So, with which ver. 19 begins, seems to me to render this supposition necessary,â€”to bind their having rowed twenty-five or thirty stadia, with the fact that the Lord had not come, and it was dark, and the sea swelling into a storm."
2. "It would appear as if the disciples were lingering along shore with the expectation of taking in Jesus: but night had fallen, and He had not come to them."
3. "The lake is forty furlongs wide: so that, as we can hardly assume the passage to have been to a point directly opposite, they were somewhere about 'in the midst of the sea'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ship. Rev., boat. See on Luke 5:2. The best texts omit the article."
2. "Went. The imperfect, were going. So Rev."
3. "It was now dark. Literally, darkness had already come on."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those who conjecture that they were still about the middle of the lake when Christ appeared to them...are led into a mistake by supposing that they had sailed to the farther or opposite bank."
2. "The Evangelist intended to show that, when Christ presented himself to them, they were in the utmost danger."
3. "The Lord often makes his people fall into alarming dangers, that they may more plainly and familiarly recognize him in their deliverance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And darkness had already come on, and Jesus was not yet come to them." 
2. "Probably they were intending to coast along the shore of the lake between Bethsaida-Julias and Capernaum."

### John Gill:
1. "And went over the sea towards Capernaum; steered their course from Bethsaida, where they took shipping over the sea of Galilee; at least over one part of it, a creek or bay of it, as they intended, towards the city of Capernaum." (Commentary, part 1)
2. "And it was now dark; quite night, which made their voyage more uncomfortable, especially as it afterwards was tempestuous." (Commentary, part 2)
