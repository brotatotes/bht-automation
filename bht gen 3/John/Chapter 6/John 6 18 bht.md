# John 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were in great peril as the sea became thoroughly agitated and a great wind blew, causing a storm that tossed their ship and lifted up the waves. They struggled in rowing against the headwind, but their efforts were to little effect. From His mountain-top, Jesus looked down upon their toiling and the gathering danger, but He did not yet go to their relief. The storm was relentless, the darkness had fallen, and the sea was rising, all while Jesus waited for His own time to come.
