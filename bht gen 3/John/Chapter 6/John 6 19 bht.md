# John 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There can be no doubt about the intention of the author to relate a miracle. The disciples were afraid, taking Jesus, initially mistaken for a spirit, into the ship. How often do we miscall our chiefest mercies, thinking them distant when they are near, or thinking the best the worst? They rowed for a little over halfway across the sea before they beheld Jesus slipping closer and closer to them on the water. Upon His reassurance, their fear turned to joy and peace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There surely can be no question in the mind of an unprejudiced reader, that it is John‚Äôs intention to relate a miracle." 
2. "There could be in the minds of the disciples no doubt about that miracle,‚Äîno chance of a mistake as to what they saw." 
3. "They were afraid:‚Äîbut upon being reassured by His voice, they were willing to take Him into the ship [...] the ship in a comparatively short time was at the land."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "lo! this is here done in flesh, by 'THE SON OF MAN.'" 
2. "He would appear to them at first like a dark moving speck upon the waters; then as a human figure, but‚Äîin the dark tempestuous sky, and not dreaming that it could be their Lord‚Äîthey take it for a spirit."
3. "How often thus we miscall our chiefest mercies‚Äînot only thinking them distant when they are near, but thinking the best the worst!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Had rowed [ŒµŒªŒ∑ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÑŒµœÇ] . Literally, had driven or propelled (the boat)." 
2. "Five and twenty, etc. The lake being about forty furlongs, six miles, at its broadest, they had gone only a little more than half - way."
3. "They see [Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒøœÖœÉŒπ] . Rev., behold; with an intent gaze."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is impossible not to be seized with consternation and dread when an apparition is presented before our eyes; for we conclude that it is either some imposture of Satan, or some bad omen which God sends us." 
2. "John here holds out to us, as in a mirror, what kind of knowledge of Christ we may obtain without the word, and what advantage may be reaped from that knowledge."
3. "After we have thus wandered in our understanding, this is immediately followed by trembling and a confused terror of heart. But when he begins to speak, we then obtain from his voice clear and solid knowledge, and then also joy and delightful peace dawn upon our minds."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The agreement between the two narratives is clearly ‚Äòundesigned,‚Äô and therefore the more interesting."
2. "When Jesus drew near to the boat, it was the ‚Äòfourth watch‚Äô (Matthew 14:25), and therefore the darkest part of the night; some eight or nine hours had passed since they left Him with the multitude."
3. "They knew not that it was He, and were terrified."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Furlongs (œÉœÑŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒøœÖœÇ). Stadia, accusative of extent of space, a little over halfway across, 'in the midst of the sea' (Mark 6:47). It was about forty stadia (six miles) across."
2. "They behold (Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ). Graphic dramatic present active indicative of Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒµœâ, vividly preserving the emotions of the disciples."

### John Gill:
