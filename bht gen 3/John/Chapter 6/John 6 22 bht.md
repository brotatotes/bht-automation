They observed that Jesus did not board the boat with his disciples, and instead remained behind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These verses are involved and parenthetical in construction, but very characteristic of the minute care with which the Evangelist will account for every circumstance which is essential to his purpose in the narrative."
2. "We are not to understand the whole multitude who were fed,â€”but that portion of them which had remained on the coast over the night."
3. "The other boats had perhaps brought some of them thither: or the spot nigh unto the place where they ate the bread, &c., might have been some landing-place of merchandise."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These verses are a little involved, from the Evangelist's desire to mention every circumstance, however minute, that might call up the scene as vividly to the reader as it stood before his own view."
2. "The people which stood on the other side of the seaâ€”not the whole multitude that had been fed, but only such of them as remained over night about the shore, that is, on the east side of the lake."
3. "The meaning is, the people had observed that there had been only one boat on the east side where they were namely, the one in which the disciples had crossed at night to the other, the west side, and they had also observed that Jesus had not gone on board that boat, but His disciples had put off without Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The people which stood on the other side of the sea - That is, on the east side, or on the same side with Jesus."
2. "The country was called the region beyond or on, the other side of the sea, because the writer and the people lived on the west side."
