## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Howbeit, there came other boats from Tiberias whose passengers were part of the multitude that had followed Jesus... these boats were fastened somewhere... nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks." 
2. "Thus he refers to the glorious 'miracle of the loaves' and now they were put in requisition to convey the people back again to the west side." 
3. "For when 'the people saw that Jesus was not there, neither His disciples, they also took shipping [in these boats] and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The city afterward became a celebrated seat of Jewish learning... The number of Christian families is 30 or 40, all Greek Catholics."
2. "Ever since the destruction of Jerusalem, it has been chiefly celebrated in connection with the Jews, and was for a long time the chief seat of rabbinical learning."
3. "What can induce human beings to settle down in such a place? And yet some 2,000 of our race make it their chosen abode."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Howbeit there came other boats [Œ±ŒªŒªŒ± Œ¥Œµ Œ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ œÄŒªŒøŒπŒ±œÅŒπŒ±] . 
Some editors omit de, howbeit, change alla, other, into ajlla, but, and read, but there came boats.


### John Calvin:
1. "I approve more highly of the latter exposition; for Bethsaida, near which Luke states that the miracle was performed, is half-way between Tiberias and Capernaum."
2. "Accordingly, when ships came down from that place, which was farther up the lake, they sailed along that shore on which the multitude were standing; and there can be no doubt that they came to land for the purpose of taking in passengers."
3. "When John again mentions that Christ gave thanks, it is not a superfluous repetition; for he means that Christ obtained by prayer that those few loaves were sufficient for feeding so many people; and as we are cold and indolent in prayer, he presses upon us the same thing a second time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whilst they were still in wonder and doubt, other boats came across the sea near to the scene of the miracle of the preceding day."

2. "Tiberias, capital of Herod Antipas, diagonally across the lake, is only mentioned in John in the N.T."
3. "Boats (œÄŒªŒøŒπŒ±). Called 'little boats' (œÄŒªŒøŒπŒ±œÅŒπŒ±) in verse John 6:24."

### John Gill:
1. "Here was a famous university, and here the Misna and Jerusalem Talmud were written; and here the sanhedrim sat, after it removed from Jerusalem." 
2. "So that these men that were waiting by the sea side, had an opportunity of going over in these boats in quest of Christ, to whom they were now become greatly attached, by feeding them in so wonderful a manner."
3. "Which clause is added to show, that the multiplication of the bread, and the refreshment the men had by it, were owing to the power of Christ, and his blessing it."
