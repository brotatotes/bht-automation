## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the Evangelist's desire to mention every circumstance, however minute, that might call up the scene as vividly to the reader as it stood before his own view."
2. "the people which stood on the other side of the seaâ€”not the whole multitude that had been fed, but only such of them as remained over night about the shore, that is, on the east side of the lake"
3. "the people had observed that there had been only one boat on the east side where they were...and they had also observed that Jesus had not gone on board that boat, but His disciples had put off without Him"

### Albert Barnes:
1. Took shipping - Went into the boats.
Came to Capernaum - This was the ordinary place of the residence of Jesus, and they therefore expected to find him there.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "If Jesus was neither on the eastern shore nor at Tiberias, He might be sought near Capernaum, in the direction of which town the disciples had sailed."
