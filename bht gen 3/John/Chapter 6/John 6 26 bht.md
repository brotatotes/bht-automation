# John 6:26 Commentary Help Text

The people sought Jesus with a selfish desire to benefit from His works, rather than recognizing the true significance of His miracles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The seeking Him, on the part of these people,â€”to Him, who saw the hearts,â€”was merely a low desire to profit by His wonderful works,â€”not a reasonable consequence of deduction from His miracles that He was the Saviour of the world."
2. "Work not for, because in the original the root of the word is the same in verses 27, 29, 30."
3. "It is important to bear in mind that the 'working for' spoken of above, which also applies to this, was not a 'labouring for,' or 'bringing about of,' but a following Christ in order to obtain."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye seek Me not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled." 
2. "From this He proceeds at once to that other Bread, just as, with the woman of Samaria, to that other Water." 
3. "He had taken the two breads, the perishing and the living bread, for the subject of His profound and extraordinary discourse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To seek him because they had seen them, and were convinced by them that he was the Messiah, would have been proper; but to follow him simply because their wants were supplied was mere selfishness of a gross kind."
2. "Yet, alas! many seek religion from no better motive than this. They suppose that it will add to their earthly happiness, or they seek only to escape from suffering or from the convictions of conscience, or they seek for heaven only as a place of enjoyment, and regard religion as valuable only for this. All this is mere selfishness."
3. "We are aiming at the loaves and fishes, and not at the honor of God and the good of his kingdom; and if this is the only or the main motive of our entering the church, we cannot be Christians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "You do not seek me because you saw signs. What you saw in my works was only marvels. You did not see in them tokens of my divine power and mission."
2. "You did not see in them tokens of my divine power and mission."
3. "Were filled."

### John Calvin:
1. "The fault which he complains of in them is, that they seek Christ for the sake of the belly and not of the miracles...they expect nothing greater from him than to live happily and at ease in this world." 
2. "He who does not aspire to the kingdom of God, but rests satisfied with the conveniences of the present life, seeks nothing else than to fill his belly." 
3. "In seeking Christ, therefore, the chief point is, to despise the world and seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This solemn declaration is only seemingly discordant with John 6:2 or John 6:14. Those who witnessed a miracle of Jesus, and did not understand its significance, might be said to see the sign and yet not see it."
2. "The design of the work in its relation to the Saviour was to manifest His glory as the Giver of the highest blessings; in its relation to the people, to fix their eyes on Him and to awaken their desire for that of which the bread had been the sign."
3. "He must now so complete their training that they may be led to leave the carnal and seek the spiritual, that they may be brought to behold in His deeds not merely the tokens of His power to satisfy every earthly desire of His followers, but the impress of His Divine character and work."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They had seen the 'signs' wrought by Jesus, but this one had led to wild fanaticism and complete failure to grasp the spiritual lessons."
2. "Ye were filled. They were more concerned with hungry stomachs than with hungry souls."
3. "It was a sharp and deserved rebuke."

### John Gill:
1. "Not willing to gratify their curiosity; and knowing from what principles, and with what views they sought after him, and followed him; and willing to let them know that he knew them, being the searcher of hearts, and to reprove them for them, thus addressed them."
2. "Ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles; of feeding so large a number with so small a quantity of food, and of healing them that needed it."
3. "They regarded their own bellies more than the honour and glory of Christ, and even than the good of their immortal souls, and the spiritual and eternal salvation of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord does not satisfy their curiosity, but corrects the wrong motive they had in seeking him."
2. "Hitherto Christ had been gathering hearers: he now begins to try their sincerity, by a figurative discourse concerning his passion."
3. "The fruit of [Christ's] passion [is] to be received by faith."
