# John 6:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The manna given by Moses to your ancestors was not the true bread from heaven; it was only a representation of the genuine bread provided by my Father. Moses did not have the authority to give the true bread, but my Father does. This authentic bread surpasses mere physical sustenance and offers spiritual nourishment. It is I, the Son, who am the true bread from heaven, offering eternal life to all who partake in me.

2. "But my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven...he also gives that bread which the manna was typical of, by which he means himself."
3. "Christ may be called the 'true' bread, because he is the truth and substance of the types of him; the unleavened bread, eaten at the passover, was typical of him, as he was free from sin in nature and life; and from all error in doctrine."

### John Wesley:
1. Moses gave you not bread from heaven â€” It was not Moses who gave the manna to your fathers; but my Father who now giveth the true bread from heaven. Psalm 78:24.
