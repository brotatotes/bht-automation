## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The bread of God is that (not He) which cometh, &c."
2. "The manna is still kept in view, which 'when the dew fell on the camp.... fell (the Greek word in the LXX is the same as here, came down) upon it,' Num. xi. 9."
3. "And the present tense, here used in reference to the manna, is dropped when the Lord Himself is spoken of."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the bread of God is he." 
2. "Divine, spiritual, and eternal its ordained Fountain and essential Substance, 'Him who came down from heaven to give it.'" 
3. "That Eternal Life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He which cometh down... that which, referring to artov, bread."

### John Calvin:
1. "The heavenly bread is that which hath come down from heaven to give life to the world." 
2. "This passage teaches that the whole world is dead to God, except so far as Christ quickens it, because life will be found nowhere else than in him."
3. "In the coming down from heaven two things are worthy of observation; first, that we have a Divine life in Christ, because he has come from God to be the Author of life to us; secondly, that the heavenly life is near us, so that we do not need to fly above the clouds or to cross the sea."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‚Äòbread of God‚Äô is the bread which God gives... The expressions in John 6:50; John 6:58 do not decide the point; for after John 6:35 the descent from heaven might with equal propriety be connected either with the bread or with Him whom the bread symbolized."
2. "On the whole, however, it seems best to carry on the thought of the bread in this verse... But if the figure is still continued in this verse, it is only a thin veil that conceals the truth."
3. "The last word is very significant. The manna had been for ‚Äòthe fathers;‚Äô the true bread is for the world... The unlimited offer also recalls chap. John 4:14, ‚ÄòWhosoever hath drunk of the water that I will give him;‚Äô and in both cases the result is the same."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The bread of God. All bread is of God
(Matthew 6:11). The manna came down from heaven
(Numbers 11:9) as does this bread."

notes that this phrase (coming down) is used seven
times in this discourse."
3. "Chrysostom observes that the manna gave nourishment
(œÑœÅŒøœÜŒ∑), but not life (Œ∂œâŒ∑). This is a most
astounding statement to the crowd."

### John Gill:
1. "For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven...and which clearly points out Christ himself..." 
2. "and this not to a few only, or to the Israelites only, but to the Gentiles also, and even to the whole world of God's elect." 
3. "of such extensive virtue and efficacy is Christ, the bread of God, in which he appears greatly superior to that manna the Jews instance in."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that ‚Äî giveth life to the world - Not (like the manna) to one people only: and that from generation to generation."
2. "Our Lord does not yet say, I am that bread; else the Jews would not have given him so respectful an answer."
