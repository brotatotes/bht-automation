# John 6:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we come to Christ in faith, we find the satisfaction our souls crave, for He is the bread of life, the source of all that sustains and satisfies. He gives life to the world, and when we accept and believe in Him, we receive the life that our souls need. Those who come to Him, seeking what their souls truly long for, will never hunger or thirst again, but will have conscious and lasting satisfaction. Through faith in Him, we find life, peace, and everlasting fulfillment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the genitive of life, is implied, 'which came down from heaven and giveth life unto the world.'"
2. "On the assurance of never hungering or thirsting, see note at ch. iv. 14."

2. "he that cometh to me‚Äîto obtain what the soul craves, and as the only all-sufficient and ordained source of supply."
3. "hunger . . . thirst‚Äîshall have conscious and abiding satisfaction."

### Albert Barnes:

Shall never hunger - See the notes at John 4:14.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I am the bread of life." 
2. "Faith in its active aspect and in its resting aspect."
3. "Never [ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑]. Rather, in nowise, or by no means. Rev., shall not."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our souls do not live by an intrinsic power, so to speak, that is, by a power which they have naturally in themselves, but borrow life from Christ." (quote 1)
2. "He now defines the way of taking this food; it is when we receive Christ by faith... it is in consequence of being driven by the feeling of our hunger that we fly to Christ to seek life." (quote 2)
3. "Whoever shall betake himself to Christ, to have life from him, will want nothing, but will have in abundance all that contributes to sustain life." (quote 3)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am the bread of life (ŒïŒ≥œâ ŒµŒπŒº Œø Œ±œÅœÑŒøœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ∂œâŒ∑œÇ). This sublime sentence was startling in the extreme to the crowd."
2. "He that cometh to me (Œø ŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ œÄœÅŒøœÇ ŒµŒºŒµ). The first act of the soul in approaching Jesus."
3. "Shall never thirst (ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑ Œ¥ŒπœàŒ∑œÉŒµ œÄœâœÄŒøœÑŒµ). So the old MSS. the future active indicative instead of the aorist subjunctive as above, an even stronger form of negation."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is so called, because he gives life to dead sinners: men in a state of nature are dead in trespasses and sins."
2. "He that cometh to me shall never hunger...and he that believeth on me shall never thirst."
