### John Calvin:
1. "If Christ had not made known his power, and plainly showed that he came from God, the plea of ignorance might have alleviated their guilt; but when they reject the doctrine of him whom they formerly acknowledged to be the Lordâ€™s Messiah, it is extreme baseness."
2. "It is no doubt true, that men never resist God purposely, so as to reflect that they have to do with God; but unbelievers, because they willingly shut their eyes against the light are justly said to see that which immediately vanishes from their sight, because Satan darkens their understandings."
3. "This, at least, is beyond all controversy, that when he said that they saw, we must not understand him to mean his bodily appearance, but rather that he describes their voluntary blindness, because they might have known what he was, if their malice had not prevented them."

3. "The charge is very grave, but it is not made in anger, nor does it leave the accused in hopelessness: not judgment, but encouragement, is the spirit that pervades this part of the discourse."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Though Jesus claims that the people have seen the true Bread from heaven and yet have not believed, it is unclear as to what exactly he is referring. He may be alluding to other sayings that were not recorded, or he could be referencing a previous statement made in verse 26. Regardless, his message remains the same: despite witnessing his majesty through his life, teachings, and works, the people still do not believe. This charge is not made in anger, but rather with the intention of encouraging faith. Jesus recognizes the gravity of their disbelief, as they had seen his miracles and experienced his provisions firsthand, yet they did not recognize him as the spiritual Savior of their souls. Their voluntary blindness and refusal to acknowledge him reveal their extreme baseness.
