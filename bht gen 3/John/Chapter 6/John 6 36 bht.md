# John 6:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though you have seen me, and yet do not believe, I repeat what I said to you: you have seen, but have not accepted the true Bread from heaven. Even though you have witnessed the signs and miracles, you have not recognized the majesty of my life, my teaching, and my works. This charge is not made in anger, but rather to encourage you to believe, for my purpose is not judgment but salvation. You have seen my miracles and benefited from them, yet you still do not believe in me as the spiritual Savior and Redeemer of your souls.

2. "But when they reject the doctrine of him whom they formerly acknowledged to be the Lordâ€™s Messiah, it is extreme baseness."
3. "This, at least, is beyond all controversy, that when he said that they saw, we must not understand him to mean his bodily appearance, but rather that he describes their voluntary blindness, because they might have known what he was, if their malice had not prevented them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is remarkable that the people themselves have used words almost identical (John 6:30): â€˜What doest Thou as a sign, that we may see and believe Thee?â€™ that is, may see Thee in Thy working, and believe Thee."
2. "The charge, therefore, that â€˜they seeing saw notâ€™ is perfectly equivalent to what is said in that verse; they had indeed seen Him in the works which were the manifestation of Himself, but they had not been led to faith."
3. "The charge is very grave, but it is not made in anger, nor does it leave the accused in hopelessness: not judgment, but encouragement, is the spirit that pervades this part of the discourse."

3. "Nor did they come to him in a spiritual way, for eternal life and salvation."
