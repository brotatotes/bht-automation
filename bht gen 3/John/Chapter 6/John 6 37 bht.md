### John Calvin:
1. "Christ meets this offense, when he affirms, that all those who do not believe are not his own, and that we need not wonder if such persons have no relish for the word of God, but that it is embraced by all the children of God."
2. "In the first place, he says, that all whom the Father giveth him come to him; by which words he means, that faith is not a thing which depends on the will of men, so that this man and that man indiscriminately and at random believe, but that God elects those whom he hands over, as it were, to his Son."
3. "This is added for the consolation of the godly, that they may be fully persuaded that they have free access to Christ by faith, and that, as soon as they have placed themselves under his protection and safeguard, they will be graciously received by him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All that which the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that is coming to me I will in no wise cast out."
2. "The gift of the Father must not be understood by us in the sense of a predestinating decree. Both here and in the other passages of this Gospel where we read of the Father as giving to the Son His people, it is the moral and spiritual state of the heart that is thought of under the word."
3. "The test, then, of this work in the heart is the coming to Christ."

"Christ will never cast them out of his affections; nor out of his arms; nor out of that family that is named of him; nor out of, and from his church, which is his body, and of which they are members; nor out of a state of justification and salvation; and therefore they shall never perish, but have everlasting life."

2. "And him that thus cometh to me, I will in nowise cast out..."
3. "I will give him pardon, holiness, and heaven, if he endure to the end-to rejoice in his light."
