## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not different hearers, nor does the scene of the discourse here change."
2. "They were the same,â€”perhaps the principal among them, the official superintendents of the synagogue."
3. "St. John generally uses 'the Jews' in this official sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jews murmuredâ€”muttered, not in our Lord's hearing, but He knew it."
2. "Missing the sense and glory of this, and having no relish for such sublimities, they harp upon the 'Bread from heaven.'"
3. "What can this mean? Do we not know all about Himâ€”where, when, and of whom He was born? And yet He says He came down from heaven!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Murmured [ÎµÎ³Î³Î¿Î³Ï…Î¶Î¿Î½] . See on Jude 1:16, and compare 1 Corinthians 10:10; Philippians 2:14. The word is constantly used in the Septuagint of the murmuring of Israel in the wilderness." 
2. "The word is constantly used in the Septuagint of the murmuring of Israel in the wilderness."
3. "Implying that they addressed their remonstrances to Him. But peri means about or concerning."

### John Calvin:
1. "But we are guilty of excessive malignity, if we despise the Lord of glory because on our account he emptied himself, and took upon him the form of a servant, for this was rather an illustrious proof of his boundless love towards us, and of his wonderful grace."
2. "The Divine majesty of Christ was not so concealed under the mean and contemptible appearance of the flesh, as not to give out the rays of his brightness in a variety of ways; but those gross and stupid men wanted eyes to see his conspicuous glory."
3. "We, too, sin daily in both of these ways. First, it is a great hinderance to us, that it is only with carnal eyes that we behold Christ; and this is the reason why we perceive in him nothing magnificent, for by our sinful views we pervert all that belongs to him and to his doctrine, so unskilful are we to profit by them, or to view them in the proper light."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The â€˜murmuringâ€™ denotes more than that indistinct complaining to which we generally apply the word."
2. "The Jews did not complain in the presence of Jesus, but sought to foment discontent and ill-feeling amongst those who at the time had been willing hearers of His words."
3. "On the offer of life, eternal life, they will not dwell."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Murmured (ÎµÎ³Î¿Î³Î³Ï…Î¶Î¿Î½). Imperfect active of the onomatopoetic verb Î³Î¿Î³Î³Ï…Î¶Ï‰, late verb in LXX (murmuring against Moses), papyri (vernacular), like the cooing of doves or the buzzing of bees."
2. "These Galilean Jews are puzzled over what Jesus had said (verses John 6:33; John 6:35) about his being the bread of God come down from heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews then murmured at him... and had no desire unto: and thus being disappointed of the delicious corporeal food they expected, they grew uneasy, and displeased." 
2. "Because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven; for though, as yet, he had not said this in so many words, and in this direct form... And this last renders the first clause 'mocked at him'." 
3. "And which was to be fed upon in a spiritual manner by faith, which they were ignorant of... And this last renders the first clause 'mocked at him'."
