# John 6:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The drawing of individuals to Christ is not an external force; rather, it is the opening of the mind by divine teaching. Through the teaching of God, the willing response of individuals is initiated, and they come to Christ. This teaching is not limited to external revelation but encompasses internal illumination. Those who have been truly taught by God cannot fail to come to Christ, as the divine attraction to Him prompts the final decision of the human will.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This clearly intimates the kind of drawing meant in the last verse:â€”the opening the eyes of the mind by divine teaching."
2. "The beginning is, The Father draws him: the progress, he hears and learnsâ€”here is the consenting willâ€”â€˜Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth:â€™â€”the end, he cometh to Christâ€”here is the will acting on the whole man."
3. "The final decision of the human will, acted on by the divine attraction to Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Lord thus falls back upon Scripture authority for this seemingly hard saying."
2. "All taught of Godâ€”not by external revelation merely, but by internal illumination."
3. "As none can come to Me but as divinely drawn, so none thus drawn shall fail to come."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Shall be all taught of God - This explains the preceding verse. It is by the teaching of his Word and Spirit that men are drawn to God."
2. "This shows that it is not compulsory, and that there is no obstacle in the way but a strong voluntary ignorance and unwillingness."
3. "and it is probable that Jesus had reference only to the place in Isaiah, as this was the usual way of quoting the prophets."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Taught of God [Î´Î¹Î´Î±ÎºÏ„Î¿Î¹ Ï„Î¿Ï… Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï…] . The idea is thrown into a compound adjective, qeodidaktoi, in 1 Thessalonians 4:9.


### John Calvin:
1. "The way of teaching, of which the prophet speaks, does not consist merely in the external voice, but likewise in the secret operation of the Holy Spirit. In short, this teaching of God is the inward illumination of the heart."
2. "The amount of what is said is, that all who do not believe are reprobate and doomed to destruction; because all the sons of the Church and heirs of life are made by God to be his obedient disciples."
3. "These two clauses utterly overturn the whole power of free will, of which the Papists dream. For if it be only when the Father has drawn us that we begin to come to Christ, there is not in us any commencement of faith, or any preparation for it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The truth of that verse is set in a new light, presented on its human rather than on its Divine side. The â€˜drawingâ€™ is a â€˜teaching:â€™ he that hath been drawn by the Father, is he that hath truly received the teaching of the Father."
2. "All who hear may also learn, but many hear who will not heed, and therefore cannot learn; just as there are many who see the Son but will not remain to â€˜behold the Sonâ€™ and to believe in Him."
3. "Not one allows us to think of compulsion or the forcing of manâ€™s will: all with one voice give glory to the Father as the source of every impulse towards the light and the life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Taught of God [...] There is here the ablative case Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï… with the passive verbal adjective Î´Î¹Î´Î±ÎºÏ„Î¿."
2. "It is not enough to hear God's voice. He must heed it and learn it and do it."
3. "This one inevitably comes to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "all that are ordained to eternal life; all that are given to Christ, and are chosen in him; all the children of Zion, and who are the children of God; these are all, sooner or later, in a special manner, taught of God"
2. "special teachings, such as are attended with the energy of divine grace, and the power of the Spirit of God, who guides into all truth, savingly and spiritually"
3. "everyone that has heard the voice of the Father's love, grace, and mercy in the Gospel, and has learned of him the way of peace, life, and salvation by Christ, under the influence of his grace, comes unto Christ; being encouraged by the declarations and promises of grace he has heard and learned, and ventures his soul on Christ, and commits it to him; trusting and relying on his person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, for justification, pardon, atonement, acceptance with God, and eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. Every man that hath heard â€” The secret voice of God, he, and he only believeth. Isaiah 54:13.
