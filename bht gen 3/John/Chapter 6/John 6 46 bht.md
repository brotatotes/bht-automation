# John 6:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Only Christ, who is from God, has seen the Father and has a complete and immediate knowledge of Him. Our knowledge of the Father is partial and derived through Christ. It is important to note that our hearing and learning from the Father is not the same as Christ's direct access to Him. While we cannot see the Father with our eyes, we can see Him through the Son. Thus, the only way for us to truly see God is to see Him through Christ.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Only Christ, who is from God and the only one who has seen the Father, can fully and immediately know the Father. His knowledge is distinct from ours; we can only hear and learn from the Father through Him. It is important to understand that the Son's immediate access to the Father should not be confused with any personal communication we may have with God. We cannot see the Father directly, but through the Son, who is from God and in association with Him. Therefore, the only way for us to truly see God is to see Him through Christ.
