- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus, looking out at the approaching multitude and knowing that they were hungry, asked Philip where they could buy bread. The intention behind this question was not to test Philip's knowledge or to highlight his connection to Bethsaida, but rather to arouse their minds and to display the extraordinary remedy that would soon be revealed. It is important to note that Jesus disregarded the disciples' objections and continued with His plan. Later, Jesus spoke directly to Philip because he was from Bethsaida and possibly had knowledge of the area. This question to Philip was independent of the later petition made by the twelve. While the narratives may appear to disagree in their details, the humble and believing Christian must see the grace of God in the independent witnesses. Despite the disagreements, the accordance in the central truths of the Gospel is all the more weighty.
