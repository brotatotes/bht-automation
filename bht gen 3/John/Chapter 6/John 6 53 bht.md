# John 6:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly understand the significance of eating and drinking, we must realize that it is not about physically consuming flesh and blood. Rather, it is a spiritual appropriation of Jesus Christ by faith. By partaking in His sacrificial death, we find true spiritual and eternal life. This act of faith is indispensable, as it allows us to be nourished and find life in Christ alone. Without this spiritual appropriation, we have no life in ourselves.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This Blood is not to be eaten in the Flesh, which was the forbidden thing... but to be drunk, separate from the flesh: again presupposing death." 
2. "By the shedding, pouring forth, of that Blood, is remission of sin... it is quite impossible that these words should... be merely an expansion of 'eating His flesh.'"
3. "To eat the flesh of Christ is to realize, in our inward life, the mystery of His Body now in heaven... To drink His Blood is to realize, in our inward life, the mystery of His satisfaction for sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is indispensable."
2. "The truth really conveyed here is no other than that expressed in John 6:51, though in more emphatic termsâ€”that He Himself, in the virtue of His sacrificial death, is the spiritual and eternal life of men."
3. "Unless men voluntarily appropriate to themselves this death, in its sacrificial virtue, so as to become the very life and nourishment of their inner man, they have no spiritual and eternal life at all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Eat the flesh. Appropriate the life." 
2. "Drink His blood. Appropriate the saving merit of His death." 
3. "All true life must be in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "If you hold my flesh in contempt, rest assured that there remains for you no other hope of life."
2. "Despise me as much as you please, on account of the mean and despicable appearance of my flesh, still that despicable flesh contains life."
3. "The ordinance of Christ forbids them [young children] to partake of the Lordâ€™s Supper; because they are not yet able to know or to celebrate the remembrance of the death of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The only possible meaning is the spiritual appropriation of Jesus Christ by faith, for 'ye have not life in yourselves.' Life is found only in Christ." (Quote 3)
2. "Jesus repeats the statement in verses John 6:50; John 6:51." (Quote 1)
3. "This addition makes the demand of Jesus seem to these Jews more impossible than before if taken in a baldly literal sense." (Quote 2)

### John Gill:
1. "The 'flesh' and 'blood' of Christ do not design those distinct parts of his body; much less as separate from each other; nor the whole body of Christ, but his whole human nature."
2. "But the words design a spiritual eating of Christ by faith. To eat the flesh, and drink the blood of Christ, is to believe that Christ is come in the flesh, and is truly and really man."
3. "Without this there, is no evidence of life in them not such live as feed on sinful pleasures, or on their own righteousness; only such that believe in Christ are living souls."

### John Wesley:
1. Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man â€” Spiritually: unless ye draw continual virtue from him by faith. Eating his flesh is only another expression for believing.
