## BHT:
To truly grasp the meaning of eating Jesus' flesh and drinking His blood, we must move beyond the literal understanding. It signifies the spiritual appropriation of His sacrificial death and the forgiveness of sins. Jesus uses their objections to declare profound truths and emphasize the indispensable nature of faith for eternal life. By appropriating Jesus' death and His saving merit through faith, we partake in a spiritual nourishment that becomes integral to our inner being. All genuine and everlasting life is found in Christ alone.

2. "By the shedding, pouring forth, of that Blood, is remission of sin."
3. "The eating of His Flesh and drinking of His Blood import the making to ourselves and using as objectively real, those two great Truths of our Redemption in Him, of which our Faith subjectively convinces us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He meant something above the gross idea which the bare terms expressed."
2. "He takes advantage of their very difficulties and objections to announce, for all time, those most profound truths."
3. "Unless men voluntarily appropriate to themselves this death, in its sacrificial virtue, so as to become the very life and nourishment of their inner man, they have no spiritual and eternal life at all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Eat the flesh. Appropriate the life." 
2. "Drink His blood. Appropriate the saving merit of His death."

### John Calvin:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The only possible meaning is the spiritual appropriation of Jesus Christ by faith, for 'ye have not life in yourselves.'" 
2. "Jesus repeats the statement in verses John 6:50; John 6:51. Note change of ŒºŒøœÖ (my) in verse John 6:51 to œÑŒøœÖ œÖŒπŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÖ with the same idea."
3. "This addition makes the demand of Jesus seem to these Jews more impossible than before if taken in a baldly literal sense."

### John Gill:
1. "The 'flesh' and 'blood' of Christ do not design those distinct parts of his body; much less as separate from each other; nor the whole body of Christ, but his whole human nature; or Christ, as having united a perfect human nature to him."
2. "To eat the flesh, and drink the blood of Christ, is to believe that Christ is come in the flesh, and is truly and really man; that his flesh is given for the life of his people, and his blood is shed for their sins."
3. "Without this there, is no evidence of life in them not such live as feed on sinful pleasures, or on their own righteousness; only such that believe in Christ are living souls."

### John Wesley:
1. Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man ‚Äî Spiritually: unless ye draw continual virtue from him by faith. Eating his flesh is only another expression for believing.
