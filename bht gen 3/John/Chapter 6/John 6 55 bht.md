# John 6:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus makes it clear that His flesh is not a metaphor but true food to be eaten. Our earthly food and drink cannot compare to the real nourishment and refreshment found in Him. Unless we appropriate His sacrificial death and allow it to become the very life and sustenance of our inner being, we cannot attain true spiritual and eternal life. Meat indeed and drink indeed highlight the reality and efficacy of the spiritual sustenance believers receive in Christ. Just as our bodies are sustained by physical food and drink, our souls are truly nourished by partaking in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "My Flesh is true meat, i.e. really TO BE EATEN, which they doubted."
2. "This verse is decisive against all explaining away or metaphorizing the passage."
3. "Food and drink, are not here mere metaphors;‚Äîrather are our common material food and drink mere shadows and imperfect types of this only real reception of refreshment and nourishment into the being."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Except ye eat the flesh... and drink the blood... no life, c." - The harshest word He had yet uttered in their ears.
2. "The truth really conveyed here is no other than that expressed in John 6:51- :, though in more emphatic terms‚Äîthat He Himself, in the virtue of His sacrificial death, is the spiritual and eternal life of men."
3. "Unless men voluntarily appropriate to themselves this death, in its sacrificial virtue, so as to become the very life and nourishment of their inner man, they have no spiritual and eternal life at all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Indeed [Œ±ŒªŒ∑Œ∏œâœÇ] . Literally, truly. The best texts read ajlhqhv, true : true meat, true drink.


### John Calvin:
1. "For when he declares that his flesh is truly food, he means that souls are famished, if they want that food."
2. "Thus we ought to boast, with Paul, that we reckon nothing to be excellent but Christ crucified; because, as soon as we have departed from the sacrifice of his death, we meet with nothing but death."
3. "Embrace Christ, therefore, as the Servant of the Father, that he may show himself to thee to be the Prince of life. For when he emptied himself, in this manner we were enriched with abundance of all blessings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Meat indeed (Œ±ŒªŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑œÇ Œ≤œÅœâœÉŒπœÇ). So the best MSS., 'true food.'"
2. "Drink indeed (Œ±ŒªŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑œÇ œÄŒøœÉŒπœÇ). Correct text, 'true drink.'"
3. "For œÄŒøœÉŒπœÇ see Romans 14:17; Colossians 2:16 (only N.T. examples)."

### John Gill:
1. "They are both 'truly' meat and drink, as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions render it or are 'true' meat and drink."
2. "These phrases may denote the reality, substance, and solidity of that spiritual food believers have in Christ, in opposition to the imaginary food of sensual sinners."
3. "These words may also be expressive of the virtue, efficacy, and excellency of this food, it being soul quickening, nourishing, strengthening, satisfying, and delightful food."

### John Wesley:
1. Meat ‚Äî drink indeed - With which the soul of a believer is as truly fed, as his body with meat and drink.
