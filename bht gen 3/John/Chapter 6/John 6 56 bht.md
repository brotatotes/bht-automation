## BHT:
As our food becomes incorporated with ourselves, so Christ and those who partake of Him become spiritually one life, though personally distinct.

This dwelling in Christ involves the believer remaining in the belief of His teachings and participating in the benefits of His death. Through faith alone, Christ becomes one with us, dwelling not in our heads and tongues, but in our hearts.
