# John 6:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The meaning of this ascent is surely clear in itself; but if it were not, the mention of a past descent would remove all doubt. If, when I am here before you, you cannot understand what is meant by eating my flesh and drinking my blood, cannot apprehend the spiritual meaning which such words must bear, how much more will you, in this your carnal apprehension of what I say, be made to stumble if you should see me ascending where I was before, to be no longer upon earth at all!
