## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is only the Spirit that can vivify the spirit of man; the flesh can profit nothing towards this."
2. "He does not say â€˜My Flesh profiteth nothing,â€™ but â€˜the flesh.â€™ To make Him say this, as the Swiss anti-sacramentalists do, is to make Him contradict His own words."
3. "The words that I have spoken... are spirit and life:â€”spirit, not flesh only:â€”living food, not carnal and perishable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Much of His discourse was about 'flesh'; but flesh as such, mere flesh, could profit nothing, much less impart that life which the Holy Spirit alone communicates to the soul." 
2. "The whole burden of the discourse is 'spirit,' not mere flesh, and 'life' in its highest, not its lowest sense, and the words I have employed are to be interpreted solely in that sense."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My doctrine is spiritual; it is fitted to quicken and nourish the soul. It is from heaven."
2. "Your doctrine or your views are earthly, and may be called flesh, or fleshly, as pertaining only to the support of the body."
3. "They are not to be understood literally, as if you were really to eat my flesh, but they are to be understood as denoting the need of that provision for the soul which God has made by my coming into the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever confines his whole attention to the earthly nature of the flesh will find in it nothing but what is dead; but they who shall raise their eyes to the power of the Spirit, which is diffused over the flesh, will learn from the actual effect and from the experience of faith, that it is not without reason that it is called quickening." (Quote 1)
2. "It profiteth not, if it be estimated by its origin and nature; for the seed of Abraham, which is in itself subject to death, does not bestow life, but receives from the Spirit its power to feed us; and, therefore, on our part also, that we may be truly nourished by it, we must bring the spiritual mouth of faith." (Quote 2)
3. "He calls his word life, from its effect, as if he had called it quickening; but shows that it will not be quickening to any but those who receive it spiritually, for others will rather draw death from it." (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "It is the Spirit of God that quickens dead sinners, by entering into them as the spirit of life, and causing them to live."
2. "It is spiritual eating, or eating the flesh, and drinking the blood of Christ in a spiritual sense, which quickens, refreshes, and comforts the minds of believers."
3. "The Gospel, and the truths of it, which are the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ, are the means of conveying the Spirit of God, as a spirit of illumination and sanctification, into the hearts of men, and of quickening sinners dead in trespasses and sins."

### John Wesley:

3. "The flesh - The bare, carnal, literal meaning, profiteth nothing."
