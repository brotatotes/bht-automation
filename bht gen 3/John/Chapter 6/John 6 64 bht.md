# John 6:64 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The murmuring and unbelief towards Jesus stem from a failure to truly believe his words. Jesus had knowledge of the hearts and motives of his disciples, even within his inner circle. He knew from the beginning that one of them, Judas, would ultimately betray him, but this did not absolve Judas of his responsibility for his actions. Jesus' knowledge extended beyond outward appearances, and he offered his teachings to all, but it was crucial for individuals to approach him with humility and open hearts in order to fully comprehend and embrace his teachings.

Jesus offered his teachings to all, but it was up to each person to have a humble and open heart to truly understand and believe his words.
