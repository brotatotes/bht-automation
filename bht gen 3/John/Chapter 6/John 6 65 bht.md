### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who do not believe in Jesus have not experienced the drawing of the Father, which is necessary for true coming to Him. The Father has the power to give both the ability to come to Jesus and to believe in Him. This emphasizes the necessity of divine teaching, as some are not familiar with it. The Father's drawing is not simply an external invitation, but an internal and powerful operation. The impulse to faith comes from God, and not all are expected to believe. Even Judas, one of the disciples, did not truly believe. The words of Jesus were a stumbling block to the unbelievers, who had not come to Him and received the gift from the Father. They resisted the Father's drawing and lacked the proper preparation of heart to receive Jesus' words. Faith is a remarkable gift of the Spirit of God, and the Gospel is not received everywhere and by all. No one can come to Jesus by their own wisdom or effort, as all are blind until illuminated by the Spirit. God draws us out of free grace and love. Faith is the gift of God and coming to Jesus is due to His efficacious grace. It is only given by the Father to those who receive it on His terms.
