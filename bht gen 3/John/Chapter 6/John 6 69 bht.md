## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "we have believed seems to be used absolutely, as in ver. 64: we believe [in Thee], and have long done so."
2. "The circumstance of the Lord not being elsewhere called the Holy One of God by John, is of course in favour of the reading."
3. "I regard the coincidence with the testimony of the demoniacs, Mark i. 24 and parallel places, as a remarkable one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There are seasons when one's faith is tried to the utmost, particularly by speculative difficulties; the spiritual eye then swims, and all truth seems ready to depart from us."
2. "At such seasons, a clear perception that to abandon the faith of Christ is to face black desolation, ruin and death; and on recoiling from this, to be able to fall back, not merely on first principles and immovable foundations, but on personal experience of a Living Lord in whom all truth is wrapt up and made flesh for our very benefitâ€”this is a relief unspeakable."
3. "Under that blessed Wing taking shelter, until we are again fit to grapple with the questions that have staggered us, we at length either find our way through them, or attain to a calm satisfaction in the discovery that they lie beyond the limits of present apprehension."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Peter says we are sure, in the name of the whole of the apostles." 
2. "Jesus immediately cautions him, as he did on other occasions, not to be too confident."
3. "For one of them actually had no such feelings, but was a traitor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith, produced by the overpowering impression of Jesus' works and person, preceded intellectual conviction."
2. "The best texts substitute oJ agiov tou Qeou, the holy one of God."
3. "The two confessions differ in that 'here the confession points to the inward character in which the Apostles found the assurance of life; there the confession was of the public office and theocratic person of the Lord' (Westcott)."

### John Calvin:
1. "In these words Peter gives a brief summary of faith."
2. "The obedience of faith is the commencement of right understanding."
3. "Knowledge is connected with faith, because we are certain and fully convinced of the truth of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We have come to believe and still believe."
2. "We have come to know and still know."
3. "That is to my mind a wooden conception of the apostles in their growing apprehension of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "There was a reality and a certainty in it, as there is in all true faith, with respect to the object, though not always with respect to interest in it."
2. "God the father is called 'the living God', though the Vulgate Latin version leaves out the word 'living', not to distinguish him from his son, but to distinguish him from the idols of the Gentiles, who have no life nor breath in them."
3. "Christ is called the son of the living God, as he is a divine person, as he is truly God; and to show that he has the same life his father has; being a partaker of the same nature, and divine perfections."

### John Wesley:
1. And we â€” Who have been with thee from the beginning, whatever others do, have known - Are absolutely assured, that thou art the Christ.
