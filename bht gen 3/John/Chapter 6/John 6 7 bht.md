# John 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples had only loaves of two hundred denarii, worth about thirty to thirty-five dollars, which would not be enough to feed the large crowd. Even if they were to distribute this little amount, it would only provide a small portion for each person. With around five thousand men present, and even more people when including women and children, it was clear that the disciples did not have the means to adequately provide for everyone.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The disciples were faced with the task of feeding thousands of people, but they were only able to find loaves of two hundred denarii, which would amount to around thirty to thirty-five dollars. This would barely provide a small amount for each individual. Philip, realizing the insufficiency, expressed his concern that even this amount would not be enough. However, the number of people was even greater, with about five thousand men alone. If we include women and children, the amount of bread available would be even less, and it is clear that they did not have the means to provide for everyone.

- Attempt 3 BHT: The disciples faced a daunting task in providing food for the large crowd. With only two hundred pennyworth, equivalent to thirty to thirty-five dollars, they knew it would not be enough to feed everyone. As the number of people alone was five thousand, even dividing the amount up would only provide about eight pence of our money for twenty-five people. Philip, in his concern, recognized this insufficiency. Andrew, on the other hand, may have been alarmed at the magnitude of the need and the lack of resources, prompting his statement about the impossibility of providing for such a large group. Yet, the real miracle occurred when Jesus took what seemed inadequate and made it more than enough, ensuring that everyone had the opportunity to receive nourishment.
