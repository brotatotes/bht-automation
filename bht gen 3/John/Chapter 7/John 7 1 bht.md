## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But it will not follow from this, that ch. vi. is not in its right place: it contains an independent memoir of a miracle and discourse of our Lord in Galilee which actually happened in the interval, and only serves to shew us the character of this Gospel as made up of such memoirs, more or less connected with one another, and selected by the Evangelist for their higher spiritual import, and the discourses arising from them." 
2. "I would understand this verse as merely carrying on the time from ch. v. and ch. vi.,â€”and its contents as introductory to the account of Jesus not going up at first to the feast."
3. "Ch. vi. is in some measure presupposed in our ver. 3, as indicating that He had not constantly observed the festal journeys of late."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "After these thingsâ€”that is, all that is recorded after :-."
2. "walked in Galileeâ€”continuing His labors there, instead of going to Judea, as might have been expected."
3. "sought to kill himâ€”referring back to John 5:18. Hence it appears that our Lord did not attend the Passover mentioned in John 6:4 â€”being the third since His ministry began, if the feast mentioned in John 6:4- : was a Passover."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "After these things - After the transactions which are recorded in the last chapters had taken place..."
2. "Jesus walked - Or Jesus lived, or taught. He traveled around Galilee teaching."
3. "The Jews sought - That is, the rulers of the Jews. It does not appear that the common people ever attempted to take his life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The association of the latter event with harvest was designed to remind the people in their prosperity of the days of their homeless wandering, that their hearts might not be lifted up and forget God, who delivered them from bondage." 
2. "Therefore they were commanded to quit their permanent homes and to dwell in booths at the time of harvest." 
3. "The festival was also known as the Feast of Jehovah, or simply the Festival, because of its importance, and of being the most joyful of all festivals."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ sojourned for a time in Galilee, because he could not remain in safety anywhere among the Jews."
2. "He conducted himself as a man who was liable to dangers, and therefore, it was not proper that he should throw himself at random into dangerous situations."
3. "When a small and despised corner of Galilee grants a lodging to Christ, whom Judea cannot endure, we learn from it that piety and the fear of God are not always to be found in the chief places of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "During that time Jesus â€˜was walking in Galilee,â€™ for in Judea His enemies â€˜were seeking to kill Him.â€™"
2. "The ministry in Galilee is in the main passed over, partly, no doubt, because the Evangelist well knew that the types of Gospel teaching that were most widely current chiefly presented the Saviourâ€™s work in Galilee."
3. "The principal outward characteristics of this portion of our Lordâ€™s public ministry are the wider range of His travels and the comparative privacy which He seems usually to have maintained."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John's favourite general note of the order of events."
2. "He now skips the period of withdrawal from Galilee of about six months."
3. "Imperfect active again, progressive attitude, had been seeking to kill him."

### John Gill:

2. "But being rejected and ill treated, he left them; which was a prelude of the Gospel being taken from them, and carried to another people."
3. "And very lawful and advisable it is for good men when their lives are in danger, to make use of proper means to preserve them, for further usefulness in the cause of God, and for the benefit of men."
