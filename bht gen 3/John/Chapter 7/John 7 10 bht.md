# John 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, not openly, went up to the feast, possibly taking a different route to avoid attracting attention. This decision was in direct contrast to the advice of his brothers, who urged him to make a more public display of his messianic mission. By going in secret, Jesus demonstrated his fulfillment of the law and purposefully avoided those who sought to harm him. While this journey to the feast was not the one where he would suffer, the subsequent Passover marked his triumphant entrance into Jerusalem as the acclaimed King of Israel.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus went up to the feast not openly, but rather in secret. He deliberately disregarded the insincere counsel of his brothers and purposefully chose a different route to avoid drawing attention to himself. Although it is uncertain whether the Twelve were with him, it is likely that they were, as Jesus rarely separated from them for any extended period of time. His decision to go in secret was a deliberate act to fulfill the law and avoid those who sought to harm him. This journey to the feast was not the one where he would suffer, but the following Passover, where he would enter Jerusalem triumphantly, proclaimed as the King of Israel.
