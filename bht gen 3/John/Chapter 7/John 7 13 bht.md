# John 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During this time, fear of the ruling Jews prevented people from openly supporting Jesus. No one dared to speak their minds in his favor, as they were afraid of the consequences. His enemies, however, had no reservations about speaking against him. It was a delicate balance, with friends of Jesus desiring to say something positive about him but lacking the courage to do so openly. This climate of secrecy and fear led to conflicting opinions and a suppression of the truth. Nevertheless, Jesus' power and the truth he represented persevered, shining brightly even in the face of opposition.
