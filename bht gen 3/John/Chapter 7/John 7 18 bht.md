# John 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to teaching, there are two types: those who seek their own glory and those who seek the glory of God. The first type, self-taught and driven by self-exaltation, is prone to unrighteousness and deceit. In contrast, the teachers who seek to glorify God are true and free from unrighteousness. They humbly fulfill their role as ambassadors of God and aim to exalt Him. Discerning true teaching involves looking for those who prioritize glorifying God and promoting His truth, as they are the ones who are faithful in their teaching.

### John Calvin:
