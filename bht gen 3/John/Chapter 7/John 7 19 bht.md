### John Calvin:
1. "True, this defense would not have been sufficient to prove the point. Granting that â€” under a false pretense â€” they concealed their wicked and unjust hatred, still it does not follow that Christ did right, if he committed any thing contrary to the injunction of the Law; for we must not attempt to extenuate our own blame by the sins of others."
2. "In the former, he addresses the consciences of his enemies, and, since they proudly boasted of being defenders of the Law, he tears from them this mask; for he brings against them this reproach, that they allow themselves to violate the Law as often as they please, and, therefore, that they care nothing about the Law."
3. "Those who, in the present day, are the fiercest enemies of the Gospel and the most strenuous defenders of Popery, have nothing more plausible to urge in their behalf than that they are excited by ardor of zeal. But if their life be narrowly examined, they are all filled with base crimes, and openly mock at God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were therefore self-convicted by their own works of opposing the revealed will of God: no wonder therefore that they had rejected Jesus."
2. "In Jesus, as a true messenger, there is no unrighteousness. What they have called unrighteousness is altogether righteous, nay, it is what they themselves habitually do, and rightly do."
3. "Every one of them (as the example afterwards given proves) sets aside one of two conflicting laws, breaks one commandment when there is no other way of keeping a higher command inviolate; and this is all that Jesus did in the act for which they seek to kill Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And yet they violated that law by not practising it."
2. "Jesus had previously known that the Jews really rejected the teaching of Moses while professing to believe it."
3. "He undoubtedly alludes to their conduct then and charges them with the same purpose now."

### John Gill:
1. "Though they boasted of it as a singular privilege, and rested in it, and their obedience to it for life and salvation, yet daily broke it in various instances, in thought, word, or deed."
2. "Nor could the most holy and righteous man among them perfectly keep it."
3. "An harmless and innocent man, who never injured you in your persons and properties; and which is a proof of their not keeping that body of laws Moses gave them."

### John Wesley:
1. But ye are unrighteous; for ye violate the very law which ye profess so much zeal for.
