# John 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Circumcision, which predates Sabbath law, was not an infringement of the Law. Healing a man's entire body on the Sabbath, which does not even compare to circumcision, should be permissible. The reality of the miracle is affirmed by the lack of opposition. This invites us to look beyond the letter of the law, honoring the spirit of the ordinance. It teaches us that the worship of the Sabbath is not violated by the works of God, especially when they bring about healing, body and soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The argument seems to be, Moses on this account gave you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers... it is no part of the law of Moses, properly so called."
2. "If this may be done on the Sabbath... how much more may it by a deed of mercy, a benevolent exercise of divine power, the approval of which is anterior to and deeper than all ceremonial enactment?"
3. "Circumcision was older than the enactment of strict rest on the Sabbath by the law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though servile work was forbidden on the sabbath, the circumcision of males on that day (which certainly was a servile work) was counted no infringement of the Law." 
2. "How much less ought fault to be found with One who had made a man 'every whit whole'‚Äîor rather, 'a man's entire body whole'‚Äîon the sabbath-day?" 
3. "What a testimony to the reality of the miracle, none daring to meet the bold appeal."

### John Calvin:

2. "it has in this manner been sufficiently demonstrated to them, that the worship of the Sabbath is not violated by the works of God" 
3. "Moses, who so rigidly demanded the keeping of the Sabbath, commanded that infants should be circumcised on the eighth day, even though it should fall on the day of Rest"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The very law was intended to teach them the fundamental principle upon which Jesus rested His defence, to look beyond the letter to the spirit, and to see that sometimes an ordinance is most honoured when its letter is broken."
2. "They felt that to receive the sign of God‚Äôs covenant, the token of consecration and of the removal of uncleanness could never be really inconsistent with any command of God."
3. "This passage is of great interest as showing that in many respects the law, even whilst seeming to deal in positive precepts only, was intended to become, and in some measure actually was, a discipline, preparing for the 'dispensation of the Spirit.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For this cause (Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑŒøœÖœÑŒø). Some would take this phrase with the preceding verb Œ∏Œ±œÖŒºŒ±Œ∂ŒµœÑŒµ (ye marvel for this cause)."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The argument seems to be that circumcision, which predates the strict rest on the Sabbath by the law, was not part of the law of Moses but of the fathers. If circumcision, a servile work, was allowed on the Sabbath, how much more should a benevolent act of mercy, like healing a man's entire body on the Sabbath, be permitted? This points to the reality of the miracle, as no one dared to challenge this bold appeal. The law of circumcision emphasized the need to look beyond the letter to the spirit, as sometimes an ordinance is most honored when its letter is broken. Overall, this verse invites us to consider that the worship of the Sabbath is not violated by the works of God, especially when it involves the greater good of healing a man, body, and soul.
