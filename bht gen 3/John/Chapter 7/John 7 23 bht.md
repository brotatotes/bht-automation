3. "...that the law of Moses should not be broken, viz. that which (after the fathers) ordains circumcision on the eighth day."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That the law of Moses should not be broken."
2. "You yourselves, in interpreting the law about the Sabbath, allow a work of necessity to be done... As you allow this, you ought also, for the same reason, to allow that a man should be completely restored to health."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their reverence for the law and their determination that it should not be broken led them to break the letter of the Fourth Commandment, or rather to do that which they would otherwise have thought inconsistent with its precept." 
2. "He had performed a far more healing work than circumcision. He had given not merely a token of the removal of uncleanness, but complete freedom from the blight and woe which sin had brought on the 'whole man.'"
3. "It may be thought that in this last expression our Lord refers only to the cure of a disease by which the entire body had been prostrated; but the verse just quoted, and the recollection of the figurative and spiritual application of the rite of circumcision with which the prophets had made the Jews familiar, warn us against limiting the miracle at the pool of Bethesda to the restoration of physical health."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That the law of Moses may not be broken... They are punctilious about their Sabbath rules and about circumcision on the eighth day. When they clash, they drop the Sabbath rule and circumcise."
2. "Are ye wroth with me?... Vivid picture of bitter spleen against Jesus for healing a man on the sabbath when they circumcise on the Sabbath."
3. "A man every whit whole... Literally, 'a whole (Î¿Î»Î¿Î½) man (all the man) sound (Ï…Î³Î¹Î·, well),' not just one member of the body mended."

### John Gill:
1. "If circumcision was administered on the sabbath day, 'without breaking the law of Moses', as some render the words, which commanded the observation of the sabbath, are ye angry at me; and pursue me with so much wrath and bitterness?"
2. "I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? or 'a man that was whole, sound on the sabbath day'; who was wholly, or all over disordered, every limb of whom shook with the palsy."
3. "If it was no breach of the sabbath to make a wound, and lay a plaster on it, as in circumcision; it would be no violation of it, nor ought any to be offended with it, that Christ should heal a diseased man, who was so in every part of his body, and restore health to his soul likewise."
