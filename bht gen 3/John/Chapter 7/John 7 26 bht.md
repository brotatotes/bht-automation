# John 7:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do the rulers know indeed? Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ, the Messiah? Some suspect a change in their purpose, on account of His being permitted to teach freely. But there is bewilderment in the inconsistency between the rulers' supposed wishes and the boldness with which Jesus speaks openly. Could it be that there is some secret reason behind this, that the rulers have made a discovery but are reluctant to reveal it?
