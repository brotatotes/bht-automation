- Attempt 1 BHT: The Jews, in discussing the origins of the Messiah, believe that the Messiah will not be known until anointed by Elias. They base their belief on Isaiah 53:8 and view the Messiah as one who will be supernaturally sent into the world. The people have settled convictions about the Messiah, while the rulers have searched and watched to ascertain their knowledge. The Jews had knowledge of Jesus' family in Nazareth, causing them to question how Jesus could be the Messiah.

This belief, though not historically proven, is credible due to the belief in Jesus' divine origin and the obscurity of the Davidic family.
