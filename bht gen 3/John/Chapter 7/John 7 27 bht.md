# John 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, in their understanding of the Messiah's arrival, believed that he would come suddenly from obscurity, anointed by Elias, and his origin would be mysterious. They acknowledged that they knew about Jesus' family in Nazareth, but questioned if he truly could be the Messiah. They held the popular belief that the Messiah's birthplace would be unknown, and therefore believed that Jesus, who they knew only as from Nazareth, could not be the Christ. However, they failed to see the truth that Jesus' miraculous birth, foretold of in the Scriptures, made him stand apart from ordinary human beings.

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "No one knoweth whence He is. Opinions differ as to the precise reference of these words."
