# John 7:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus responded, You know me and my local parentage, but I am not of myself. Despite the people's claim to know His earthly origin, they lacked the understanding of His divine nature and purpose.

Their ignorance and arrogance led them to despise Him, but Jesus fearlessly confronted their mistaken assumptions and proclaimed His heavenly origin and mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ye both know me....] It has been questioned whether these words are to be taken ironically, interrogatively, or affirmatively. I incline to the latter view, for this reason:â€”obviously no very high degree of knowledge whence He was is implied, for they knew not Him that sent Him."
2. "The answer is made in their own sense:â€”they knew that He was from Nazareth in Galilee, see ver, 41,â€”and probably that He was called the son of Joseph. In this sense they knew whence He was; but further than this they knew not."
3. "and I am not come; and moreoverâ€”i. e. besides this.The nearest English word would be real: but this would not convey the meaning perspicuously to the ordinary mind;â€”perhaps the A.V. true is better, provided it be explained to mean really existent, not â€˜truthful.â€™"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yes, ye know both Myself and My local parentage, and (yet) I am not come of Myself."
2. "but he that sent me is true, &amp;c.â€”Probably the meaning is, 'He that sent Me is the only real Sender of any one.'"
3. "He that sent Me is the only real Sender of any one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye know whence I am - You have sufficient evidence of my divine mission, and that I am the Messiah."
2. "Is true - Is worthy to be believed. He has given evidence that I came from him, and he is worthy to be believed."
3. "Many read this as a question - Do ye know me, and know whence I am? I have not come from myself, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cried teaching implies speaking in a peculiarly solemn manner and with an elevation of voice."
2. "Conceding the truth of the people's statement in ver. 27, we know this man whence he is, so far as His outward person and His earthly origin were concerned."
3. "True to the ideal of a sender: a genuine sender in the highest sense of the term."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is not a more destructive plague than when men are so intoxicated by the scanty portion of knowledge which they possess, that they boldly reject every thing that is contrary to their opinion."
2. "While you have your eyes fixed on the earth, you think that every part of me is before your eyes; and therefore you despise me as mean and unknown. But God will testify that I have come from heaven."
3. "Christ sees that he is despised; but so far is he from yielding, that, on the contrary, he boldly repels the furious arrogance of those who hold him in no estimation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And I am not come of myself."
2. "Whom ye know not."
3. "They know not God."

### John Gill:
1. "Yes, you know me, and you know whence I am; you know me to be Jesus of Nazareth, but you are wrong, I am not of Nazareth; you suppose I come from Galilee, but that is your ignorance; you take me to be the real son of Joseph, to be begotten by him on Mary, but that is your mistake: such is your knowledge of me." 
2. "And I am not come of myself; into this world, by incarnation, or the assumption of human nature, to work out the salvation of men; the Father called him to it, and he agreeing to do it, was in the fulness of time sent about it; this was not a device of his own, or an honour he took to himself; he was not alone in it; it was a mutual agreement between him and his Father, in consequence of which he was sent and came." 
3. "Whom ye know not; so that notwithstanding all their boasted knowledge of him, they knew not his Father, from whence he came, and by whom he was sent; and notwithstanding also their boasted knowledge of the one, only, true, and living God, see Romans 2:17; yet they knew him not in a spiritual sense; they knew him not in Christ, nor as the Father of Christ; they knew neither the Father nor the Son."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then cried Jesus â€” With a loud and earnest voice." 
2. "Do ye both know me, and know whence I am ? â€” Ye do indeed know whence I am as a man."
3. "But ye know not my Divine nature, nor that I am sent from God."
