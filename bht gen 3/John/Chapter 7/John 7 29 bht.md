# John 7:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reality of Jesus being sent by someone unknown to them is emphasized here. Jesus is the Interpreter of God to mankind, the Father's Apostle, and his mission follows from his generation as the only begotten of God. This unique claim of Jesus is pressed during the controversial chapters with the Jews. We should be cautious of arrogant confidence, but boldly resist people when we are certain of God's truth, for those who know that God is with them have no reason to fear being accused of insolence in challenging the arrogance of the world.
