# John 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' brothers despised his lack of prudence and consistency in not showing himself to the world, despite recognizing his miracles. They urged him to depart from his current place and go to Jerusalem, accusing him of concealing himself and desiring to be known by all. They wanted him to go to the feast of tabernacles so that his disciples in Judea could witness his works. His reserved display of power went against their expectations, and they desired a more prominent impact in Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They recognized his miracles, but despised his apparent want of prudence and consistency of purpose, in not shewing himself to the world."
2. "The indication furnished by this verse of the practice of our Lord with regard to His miracles up to this point is very curious."
3. "He appears as yet to have made His circuits in Galilee, and to have wrought miracles there, in the presence of but a small circle of disciples properly so called."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But as they were in the 'upper room' among the one hundred and twenty disciples who waited for the descent of the Spirit after the Lord's ascension, they seem to have had their prejudices removed, perhaps after His resurrection." 
2. "Indeed here their language is more that of strong prejudice and suspicion (such as near relatives, even the best, too frequently show in such cases), than from unbelief."
3. "'Thou hast many disciples in Judea here in Galilee they are fast dropping off; it is not like one who advances the claims Thou dost to linger so long here, away from the city of our solemnities, where surely 'the kingdom of our father David' is to be set up.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. His brethren - See the notes at Matthew 12:47.
Thy disciples - The disciples which he had made when he was before in Judea, John 4:1-3.
The works - The miracles.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. Thy disciples. Both those who had been gained by former teaching in Judaea and Jerusalem, and others from other parts.


### John Calvin:
1. "He says that they mocked at Christ, because he shunned to be seen or known, and concealed himself in a mean and despised district of Judea."
2. "But granting this, still it is evident that they ridicule him, because they do not think that his conduct is rational and judicious; and they even upbraid him with folly."
3. "Thou wishest to be known by all, and yet thou concealest thyself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To these 'brethren,' then, brought up in the prevalent Messianic belief, there appeared an inconsistency between the loftiness of His claims and the comparatively limited display of what He offered as His credentials."
2. "The reserve with which He manifested His powers went far with them towards destroying the impression made by His miracles."
3. "At the feast, the whole body of His disciples would be gathered together, and what might be done in Jerusalem would be conspicuous to all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His brethren (Î¿ Î±Î´ÎµÎ»Ï†Î¿ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï…). 'His brothers' (half-brothers actually), who 'were not believing on him' (Î¿Ï…Î´Îµ ÎµÏ€Î¹ÏƒÏ„ÎµÏ…Î¿Î½ ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½) as stated in verse John 7:5."
2. "Depart hence (Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Î²Î·Î¸ ÎµÎ½Ï„ÎµÏ…Î¸ÎµÎ½). Second aorist active imperative of Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Î²Î±Î¹Î½Ï‰, to pass to another place (John 5:24; John 13:1). It was impertinence on their part."
3. "Which thou doest (Î± Ï€Î¿Î¹ÎµÎ¹Ï‚). To what works they refer by this language we do not know. But Jesus had been away from Galilee for some months and from Judea for a year and a half. Perhaps the brothers of Jesus may actually have been eager to rush Jesus into the hostile atmosphere of Jerusalem again."

### John Gill:
1. "The feast of tabernacles being at hand, they put him upon going up to it, being willing to be rid of him..." 
2. "Depart hence: which is the language of carnal men, who desire not the company of Christ, nor the knowledge of his ways..."
3. "That thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest: meaning not his twelve disciples, but the disciples he had made, and baptized in Judea..."

### John Wesley:
1. His brethren â€” So called according to the Jewish way of speaking. They were his cousins, the sons of his mother's sister.
Depart hence â€” From this obscure place.
