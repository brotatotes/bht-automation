# John 7:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite the people's eagerness to seize Jesus, they were hindered, potentially by fear of the crowd, but mainly because it was not yet God's appointed time for Him to be taken. Their inability to harm Him was fueled by both their malice and impotence. Jesus' claim to be sent from God sparked controversy and led to their desire to apprehend Him. However, they were unable to do so because God's timing had not yet arrived. Jesus' persecution and crucifixion were part of a preordained plan, and the Father's protection shielded Him until the appointed hour.
