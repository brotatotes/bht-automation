# John 7:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus spoke these words not just to the officers, but to all the people, to show them the futility of attempting to seize him before his appointed time. The Jews, not knowing the one who sent him, found these words obscure. He acknowledged their desire to be rid of him, assuring them that soon they would be separated from him forever, as he would go where they could not follow. In a little while, he would be withdrawn from their midst, returning to the Father who had sent him.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The words spoken by Jesus in this verse were directed not only at the officers but to all the people. He was essentially telling them that their attempts to seize him would be futile until the appointed time. To the Jews who did not know the one who sent him, these words were obscure. Jesus acknowledged their desire to be rid of him, but reminded them that soon they would be separated from him forever. He would go where they could not follow, and even in their desperate seeking, they would not be able to find him. These words carried both tenderness and judgment, revealing Jesus' perfect knowledge of their intentions and taking away their last hope. In a little while, Jesus would be gone, withdrawn from their midst, returning to the Father who had sent him.
