# John 7:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus's words indicate that there will come a time when the Jews, who currently seek Him out of hostility, will seek Him for help and assistance instead. However, their ongoing hostility and the difference in character will make it essentially impossible for them to find Him. This is because they cannot grasp the eternal spiritual home of Christ and His absolute fellowship with the Father. His bodily presence will be withdrawn, and He will be in a place inaccessible to those seeking Him.

- Attempt 1 BHT: When Jesus says, Ye shall seek Me and shall not find Me, He is indicating that His bodily presence will be withdrawn and that He will be in a place that is inaccessible to those seeking Him. This withdrawal is not simply temporary, but signifies an essential truth. While the Jews currently seek Him for their own purposes, they will eventually seek Him for help. However, the difference in character and the hostility of these Jews will make it essentially impossible for them to find Him. This seeking, which will be too late, is rooted in the fact that they are unable to comprehend the eternal spiritual home of Christ in absolute fellowship with the Father.
