2. "Now these Christ invites to come unto him, not to Moses and his law, moral or ceremonial, and to obedience to them, and works of righteousness done by them, to any creature, or creature acts; for these are cisterns without water, where no true peace, joy, righteousness, and salvation are to be had."
3. "Salvation by him is of free grace, and the pardon of sin is according to the riches of grace, and justification is freely by his grace, and so all other blessings; and of this they may drink abundantly, or they may partake of it largely: there is a fulness of grace in Christ, and there is an abundance of it communicated to his people; it is exceeding abundant; it flows, and overflows, and may be drank of to satisfaction, till their souls are as a watered garden, and they are satisfied with the goodness of the Lord."

- Attempt 1 BHT: On the last day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out with urgency, inviting all who thirsted to come to Him and drink. This invitation was no ordinary offer, but one that echoed the deepest longings of the human soul. Similar to when Jesus called the weary and heavy-laden to find rest in Him, this proclamation spoke to the profound need for satisfaction and relief found only in Him. Jesus's words were not to be taken lightly; they echoed the ancient call of Jehovah to all who thirsted, and the response to such an offer could only be either rejection or a heartfelt declaration of faith. The timing of Jesus's proclamation on this specific day, the eighth and final day of the feast, added depth to His words, as it was a day of significance and remembrance. The feast itself symbolized the entrance into the promised land, and on this day, the pouring of water from the pool of Siloam onto the sacrifice symbolized the joy of drawing water from the wells of salvation. Thus, Jesus used this significant occasion to make clear that He alone could truly satisfy the spiritual thirst of humanity, and to disregard His offer would be to seek relief in vain.
