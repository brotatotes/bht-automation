# John 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one can claim the position that Christ does and keep hidden the works that prove it. The motive behind the advice to disclose one's deeds is evil, but Christ rejects their wishes and instructs us not to yield to the desires of our brethren or relations. For no one does such things in secret; they seek to be known openly.
