# John 7:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many of them did believe on him, including Nicodemus and Joseph, but not one of these had openly confessed Him. This appeal must have stung such of them as heard it to the quick. Power was slipping through their fingers and that was the secret of their hostility to Jesus. Is there any instance in which those who are high in rank or in office have embraced him as the Messiah? This shows the rule by which they judged of religion - a wider circle and the most orthodox of all. But they err in this respect, that, while they claim for themselves the highest authority, they are unwilling to submit to God. All the authority that is possessed by pastors, therefore, is subject to the word of God, that all may be kept in their own rank, from the greatest to the smallest, and that God alone may be exalted.
