# John 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even Jesus' own brothers, who were among the Twelve, did not believe in Him at that time. Their refusal to accept His Messianic claims, despite witnessing miracles, highlights the importance of faith as a habitual and controlling belief. This serves as a reminder that carnal relationships hold little value in the spiritual realm. It is only by becoming new creatures in Christ that one truly aligns with Him, regardless of any earthly associations or allegiances.
