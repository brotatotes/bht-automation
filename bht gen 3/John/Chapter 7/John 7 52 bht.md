# John 7:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The contemptuous aristocrats of Jerusalem, driven by deep prejudice and blind rage, failed to recognize the historical accuracy that prophets like Jonah and Hosea emerged from Galilee. In their vehement opposition to Jesus, they resorted to personal attacks and avoided any meaningful discussion or examination of the facts. Their false declaration that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet revealed both their refusal to acknowledge the truth and their damaging assumption that no one, except from Galilee, could support Jesus.
