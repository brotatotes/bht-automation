### Henry Alford:
1. "The circumstance that this verse is included in the dubious passage is remarkable, and seems to shew, as remarked above, that the doubt has not arisen from any ethical difficulty." (Commentary)
2. "We must now regard it as fragmentary, forming the beginning of the account of the woman taken in adultery." (Commentary)
3. "Taken in conjunction with what follows, I should say that they indicate some time during the last days of the Lord‚Äôs ministry." (Commentary)

### Albert Barnes:

2. "So wild and furious are the passions of men when they oppose the person and claims of the Son of God!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. This verse, and the portion of Chapter 8, as far as ver. 12, are generally pronounced by the best critical authorities not to belong to John's Gospel. 


### John Calvin:
1. "If any one take into account what was the reign of the priests at that time, with what rage they were excited, and how vast was their retinue, and, on the other hand, if he consider that Christ was unarmed and defenceless, and that there was no body of men to protect him, the conclusion must be, that it was all over with him a hundred times."

3. "And we have often found that, whatever contrivances our enemies have made to extinguish the Gospel, yet by the amazing kindness of God, it immediately fell powerless to the ground."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The narrative before us to be no genuine part of the Gospel of John."
2. "It bears the almost unmistakeable impress of a wisdom which could not have originated with the men of our Lord‚Äôs time, and which the world even in our own time hardly comprehends."
3. "It may be noted in addition that the incident bears in its spirit a striking similarity to that recorded in Mark 12:13-17."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This verse and through John 8:12 (the passage concerning the woman taken in adultery) is certainly not a genuine part of John's Gospel." 
2. "It is probably a true story for it is like Jesus, but it does not belong to John's Gospel." 
3. "First aorist passive indicative of œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒøŒºŒ± used as a deponent verb without passive idea. In this context the verb has to refer to the Sanhedrin with a rather pointless contrast to Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The officers not bringing Jesus with them, and the sanhedrim being posed with Nicodemus, broke up without doing any business, and every member of it went home."
2. "This we may suppose was about the time of the evening sacrifice."
3. "After the evening daily sacrifice, the sanhedrim went, 'to their own houses'; as they now did, and not to their booths, the feast of tabernacles being now over."

### John Wesley:
1. "So that short plain question of Nicodemus spoiled all their measures, and broke up the council!"
2. "A word spoken in season, how good it is!"
3. "Especially when God gives it his blessing."
