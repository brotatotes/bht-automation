# John 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus tells his brothers that his time has not yet come to go up to the feast. He distinguishes between their readiness to go, as they have no great plans or divine mission, and his own purpose to manifest himself to the world. While the brothers are always ready to associate with the world, Jesus, being in essential antagonism to the world, waits for the appropriate and fitting occasion to fulfill his role as the Messiah and denounce the hypocrisy and abominations of the world.
