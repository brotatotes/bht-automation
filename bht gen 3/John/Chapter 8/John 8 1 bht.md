# John 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus chose to go to the Mount of Olives, a place St. John never mentions elsewhere, which adds significance to this location. He preferred the tranquility of Bethany, the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, over the busyness of the city. By spending the night on the Mount, Jesus deliberately contrasted the people's return to their homes with his own nomadic way of living. It is possible that he went there for private prayer, like before choosing his apostles, and to avoid the dangers the Jews posed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The return of the people to the inert quiet and security of their dwellings, at the close of the feast, is designedly contrasted with our Lord's homeless way, so to speak, of spending the short night." 
2. "One cannot well see why what is recorded in Luke 21:37; Luke 21:38 may not even thus early have taken place; it might have been the Lord's ordinary custom from the beginning to leave the brilliant misery of the city every night."
3. "Preferring for His resting-place Bethany, and the Mount of Olives, the scene thus consecrated by many preparatory prayers for His final humiliation and exaltation."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "It is probable that our Lord intended to spend the whole night upon the Mount; and it may be that He would spend it as He did before making choice of His twelve apostles, â€˜in prayer to Godâ€™ (Luke 6:12)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
