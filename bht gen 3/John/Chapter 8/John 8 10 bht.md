# John 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus responds to the woman caught in adultery with remarkable tenderness and grace, neither pardoning her nor declaring her guilt, but leaving the matter unresolved. As her accusers gradually disappear, no one dares to carry out the sentence they proposed, resulting in Jesus asking the woman where her condemnors are. This raises the question of why no one stepped forward to execute the intended judgment, implying that no one was willing to pass the official sentence, yet Jesus does not explicitly address this.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What inimitable tenderness and grace!"
2. "He pronounces no pardon upon the woman, much less does He say that she had done nothing condemnable; He simply leaves the matter where it was."
3. "But in saying, 'Go and sin no more,' which had been before said to one who undoubtedly believed, more is probably implied than expressed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus had directed them, if innocent, to cast a stone, thus to condemn her, or to use the power which he gave them to condemn her." 
2. "No one of them had done that." 
3. "They had accused her, but they had not proceeded to the act expressive of judicial condemnation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‚Äòcondemn,‚Äô for which it is not possible to substitute another, conveys most imperfectly the sense of the original Greek."
2. "The meaning is rather, ‚ÄòDoth no man doom thee to the sentence of which they spoke?‚Äô"

3. "No one dared to cast a stone at the woman on Christ's terms."

### John Gill:

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In this verse, Jesus shows incredible tenderness and grace towards the woman caught in adultery. He does not pronounce immediate pardon or mention her innocence, but rather leaves the matter open. When He says, Go and sin no more, there is likely an implied message that goes beyond what is expressed. As Jesus writes in the ground, one by one, the accusers slip away, and no one dares to condemn the woman according to Christ's terms. Jesus then asks the woman, Where are they? Did no man condemn thee? Here, the emphasis is on the lack of condemnation, as Jesus wonders why no one took it upon themselves to carry out the sentence of which they spoke.
