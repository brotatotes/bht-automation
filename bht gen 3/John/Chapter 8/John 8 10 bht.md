What an inimitable display of tenderness and grace from Jesus! Instead of condemning the woman caught in sin, he simply leaves the matter where it was. If she experienced conviction of sin and a willingness to be guided by Him, this call to begin a new life may have brought about a permanent change. Jesus lifts himself up and asks where her accusers are, as if to say, Has no one offered to do unto you what I proposed?

- Attempt 1 BHT: What a display of tenderness and grace from Jesus! He does not condemn the woman caught in sin but rather leaves the matter where it was. If she experienced conviction of sin, admiration for her Deliverer, and a willingness to be guided by Him, this call to begin a new life may have brought about a lasting change.

- Attempt 3 BHT: How amazing is Jesus' tenderness and grace in this situation! Instead of condemning the woman caught in sin, He simply leaves the matter as it was. Perhaps, in that moment of conviction and admiration for her Deliverer, the call to begin a new life carried with it the power to bring about a permanent change. Jesus lifts Himself up and asks, Where are they? Did no man condemn thee? It's clear that he had directed them to condemn her by casting a stone, yet not one of them had actually done so. The word condemn doesn't fully capture the original Greek meaning, which conveys the sense of dooming someone to a sentence. So Jesus is essentially asking, Has no one sentenced you as they spoke?

Though He had urged them to condemn her by casting a stone, not one of them had executed the act of judicial condemnation. His inquiry, Has no one sentenced you as they spoke? reveals the deeper nuance of the original Greek word for condemn.
