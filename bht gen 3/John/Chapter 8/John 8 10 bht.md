## BHT:
Conscious of her guilt and in awe of how her accusers were dispersed, the woman would have been receptive to Jesus' teachings. Jesus doesn't pardon or declare her innocent, but rather leaves the matter unresolved. However, if she experienced a sudden conviction of sin, admired her Deliverer, and was willing to be guided by Him, this call to a new life could have brought about a lasting change.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Conscious of her own guilt, and till now in the hands of men who had talked of stoning her, wondering at the skill with which her accusers had been dispersed, and the grace of the few words addressed to herself, she would be disposed to listen, with a reverence and teachableness before unknown, to our Lord's admonition."
2. "He pronounces no pardon upon the woman...much less does He say that she had done nothing condemnable; He simply leaves the matter where it was."
3. "If brought suddenly to conviction of sin, admiration of her Deliverer, and a willingness to be admonished and guided by Him, this call to begin a new life may have carried with it what would ensure and naturally bring about a permanent change."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus had directed them, if innocent, to cast a stone, thus to condemn her, or to use the power which he gave them to condemn her."
2. "No one of them had done that. They had accused her, but they had not proceeded to the act expressive of judicial condemnation."
3. "They had accused her, but they had not proceeded to the act expressive of judicial condemnation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‚Äòcondemn,‚Äô for which it is not possible to substitute another, conveys most imperfectly the sense of the original Greek." 
2. "The meaning is rather, ‚ÄòDoth no man doom thee to the sentence of which they spoke?‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Where are those thine accusers?"
