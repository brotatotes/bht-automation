## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Neither do I condemn thee - This is evidently to be taken in the sense of judicial condemnation, or of passing sentence as a magistrate..." 
2. "Go, and sin no more - You have sinned...my direction to you is that you sin no more."
3. "It should be added that this passage, together with the last verse of the preceding chapter, has been by many critics thought to be spurious."

### John Calvin:
1. "Neither do I condemn thee. We are not told that Christ absolutely acquitted the woman, but that he allowed her to go at liberty."
2. "He exhorts the woman to repentance, and comforts her by a promise of grace."
3. "In short, by the same word of God, when forgiveness is offered to us, we are likewise called to repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her answer is a simple statement of the fact."
2. "The language, it will be observed, is not a sentence of acquittal: it is rather an intimation to the woman that she has still space given her for repentance and faith."
3. "The narrative has lived on through all ages of the Church as an illustration, not less striking than any other recorded in the Gospels, of that Divine wisdom with which Jesus knew how to combine what human wisdom has never been able to unite, condemnation of sin, and free and unrestricted mercy to the sinner."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No one, Sir." She makes no excuse for her sin. Does she recognize Jesus as 'Lord'?" (Quote 1)
2. "Jesus does not condone her sin... But he does give the poor woman another chance." (Quote 2)
3. "Henceforth no longer go on sinning." One can only hope that the woman was really changed in heart and life. Jesus clearly felt that even a wicked woman can be saved." (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "Christ came not into the world to act the part of a civil magistrate, and therefore refused to arbitrate a case, or be concerned in dividing an inheritance between two brethren."
2. "Nor did he come into the world to condemn it, but that the world, through him, might be saved."
3. "He did not connive at the sin, he reproved for it; nor did he deny that she ought to suffer according to the law of Moses, but rather suggests she ought; but as this was not his province, he did not take upon him to pronounce any sentence of condemnation on her; but called her to repentance."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither do I condemn thee â€” Neither do I take upon me to pass any such sentence. Let this deliverance lead thee to repentance.
