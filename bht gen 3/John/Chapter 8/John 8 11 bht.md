## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Neither do I condemn thee - This is evidently to be taken in the sense of judicial condemnation, or of passing sentence as a magistrate, for this was what they had arraigned her for."
2. "I do not claim power to condemn you to die, and, as your accusers have left you, my direction to you is that you sin no more."
3. "Jesus was endowed with wonderful wisdom in meeting the devices of his enemies, and eluding their deep-laid plans to involve him in ruin."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are not told that Christ absolutely acquitted the woman, but that he allowed her to go at liberty."
2. "Yet the Popish theology is, that in this passage Christ has brought to us the Law of grace, by which adulterers are freed from punishment."
3. "Hence we infer what is the design of the grace of Christ. It is, that the sinner, being reconciled to God, may honor the Author of his salvation by a good and holy life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word â€˜Iâ€™ is peculiarly emphatic. The language, it will be observed, is not a sentence of acquittal: it is rather an intimation to the woman that she has still space given her for repentance and faith."
2. "Let her use her opportunities, and profit by the tender compassion of Him who drew publicans and sinners to His side, then will still more gracious words be addressed to her."
3. "The narrative has lived on through all ages of the Church as an illustration, not less striking than any other recorded in the Gospels, of that Divine wisdom with which Jesus knew how to combine what human wisdom has never been able to unite, condemnation of sin, and free and unrestricted mercy to the sinner."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No man, Lord... She makes no excuse for her sin."
2. "Jesus does not condone her sin... But he does give the poor woman another chance."
3. "Henceforth sin no more... Jesus clearly felt that even a wicked woman can be saved."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ came not into the world to act the part of a civil magistrate, and therefore refused to arbitrate a case, or be concerned in dividing an inheritance between two brethren." 
2. "Nor did he come into the world to condemn it, but that the world, through him, might be saved."
3. "He did not connive at the sin, he reproved for it; nor did he deny that she ought to suffer according to the law of Moses, but rather suggests she ought; but as this was not his province, he did not take upon him to pronounce any sentence of condemnation on her; but called her to repentance, and, as the merciful and compassionate Saviour, gave her reason to hope pardon and eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither do I condemn thee â€” Neither do I take upon me to pass any such sentence. Let this deliverance lead thee to repentance.
