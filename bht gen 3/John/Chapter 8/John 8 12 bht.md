## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Surely to say in both cases, as LÃ¼cke and De Wette do, that the allusion could not have been made unless the usage took place on that day, is mere trifling."
3. "While the feast lasted, and the remembrance of the ceremonies was fresh, the allusion would be perfectly natural."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD"â€”plainly in the most absolute sense.
2. "he that followeth meâ€”as one does a light going before him, and as the Israelites did the pillar of bright cloud in the wilderness."
3. "but shall have the light of lifeâ€”the light, as of a new world, a newly awakened spiritual and eternal life."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Hence it follows, that out of Christ there is not even a spark of true light. There may be some appearance of brightness, but it resembles lightning, which only dazzles the eyes."
3.
