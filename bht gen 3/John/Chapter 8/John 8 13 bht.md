# John 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The opponents of Jesus argue that His self-declaration cannot be trusted, using the human maxim that self-praise is no praise. However, Jesus counters this by affirming that He is an exceptional case, His testimony is supported by the Father. His witness of Himself is valid and truthful beyond mere human self-assertion because it is backed by the Father. Though the opponents raise a technical objection, Jesus acknowledges the need for further witness outside of His own claims. Jesus knows where He came from and where He is going, and His testimony is firm and authentic.
