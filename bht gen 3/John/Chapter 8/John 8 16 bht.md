# John 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The judgment that Jesus pronounces is genuine, true, and final, as it is formed by the testimony of both Himself and the Father who sent Him. It is a judgment that corresponds to the eternal reality of things and is based on the Father's will. Jesus and the Father are not separate, but rather inseparable as one God. Therefore, His judgment is entitled to authority and should be regarded as such.
