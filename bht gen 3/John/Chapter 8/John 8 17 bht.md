# John 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in responding to those who judge his testimony by the mere letter of the law, affirms that he is an exception to the rule. He points out that their law, which they claim as their own, requires the testimony of two witnesses, and in this case, the testimony of him and his Father fulfills that requirement. Jesus does not separate himself from the Jews and the law entirely, but rather exposes the inconsistency in their application and establishes the validity of his testimony through the fulfillment of their own law.
