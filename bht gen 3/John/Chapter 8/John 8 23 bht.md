# John 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus declares that those who oppose him are unable to come where he is going because they originate from a different place. He comes from above, contrasting himself with mankind, who are born from and belong to this earthly order. The fundamental difference in their origin and nature makes it impossible for them to have fellowship or dwell together eternally. These individuals are influenced by sensual and corrupt passions and have a dislike for the heavenly kingdom. Jesus, however, offers a higher perspective that is free from earthly and corrupt notions.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus declares that those who oppose him are unable to come where he is going because they originate from a different place. He comes from above, contrasting himself with mankind, who are born from and belong to this earthly order. The fundamental difference in their origin and nature makes it impossible for them to have fellowship or dwell together eternally. These individuals are influenced by sensual and corrupt passions and have a dislike for the heavenly kingdom. Jesus, however, offers a higher perspective that is free from earthly and corrupt notions. The Gospel is heavenly wisdom, but the minds of these individuals are fixated on earthly matters. Only through the transformative work of Christ's Spirit can one become qualified to be his disciple. Jesus, the one who does not belong to this world, chose to enter it to save sinners, yet he did not conform to its sinful ways, pursuing worldly pleasures, honors, and riches. Rather, he lived a life of suffering and was despised by men, despite being Lord of all. Jesus comes from above, from heaven, and makes it clear that this is his source and ultimate destination.
