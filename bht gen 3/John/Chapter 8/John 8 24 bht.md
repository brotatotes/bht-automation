# John 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you do not believe that Jesus is the Deliverer, you will die in your sins. This speaks to the individual acts of sin that result from a carnal state, a reminder of the ancient declarations of the God of Israel, 'I AM HE'. Jesus seems to claim absolute divine being, which is supported by the claim that he is the Messiah. Without faith in Christ, we are driven away from him and deprived of his grace.

### John Calvin:

3. "Jesus seems to claim absolute divine being."

### John Gill:
1. "True faith in Christ deals not with him in a general way, but in a special regard to a man's self; it is a seeing of Christ for a man's self."
2. "Though perhaps no more than a general faith is here intended, for want of which, and their rejection of Jesus, as the Messiah, the Jews suffered temporal ruin."
3. "Dying in sin, and dying in Christ, are two widely different things. They that die in faith, die in Christ: they that die in unbelief, die in sin; and this is a dreadful dying."
