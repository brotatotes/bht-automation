# John 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many believed on Him with a higher degree of faith than those who witnessed miracles, but they still desired further confirmation. The words spoken by Jesus were of such grandeur that they captivated some who heard them, radiating a divine benignity from His countenance. These new believers came to believe in Him, at least nominally, as the truths presented by Jesus were convincing and had a profound impact on their hearts. However, Jesus tested the faith of these Pharisees-turned-believers, revealing the twofold effect of His teaching: while some became obstinate, others became penitent and believing.
