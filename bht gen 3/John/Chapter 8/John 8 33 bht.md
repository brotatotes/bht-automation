# John 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, in their pride as Abraham's seed, disregard their past and current experiences of bondage and claim to have never been enslaved. Their shallow interpretation of freedom prevents them from understanding that true liberation comes from knowing Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "We be Abraham's seed: see Matt. iii. 9. The assertion that they had never been in bondage to any man was so contrary to historical truth, that we must suppose some technical meaning to have been attached to the word bondage, in which it may have been correct."
3. "'The words cannot be meant. of that generation only, for the word never (never yet at any time, literally) connects with their assertion that they were Abraham's seed, and generalizes it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Have never yet been in bondage; thus giving the force of the perfect tense, never up to this time, and of the pw, yet."
2. "In their reply to Jesus they ignore alike the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Syrian bondage, through which the nation had successively passed, as well as their present subjection to Rome, treating these merely as bondage which, though a fact, was not bondage by right, or bondage to which they had ever willingly submitted, and, therefore, not bondage in any real sense."
3. "These are the very Jews who believed Him (ver. 31). Stier remarks : 'These poor believers soon come to the end of their faith.'"
