# John 8:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we only have a connection with God's family as bond-servants, our tie to the house is precarious; we must be manumitted and adopted as sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty for a real, rightful, and permanent relationship. Unlike a slave, who has no permanent place in the house and can be cast out, the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, will always continue as a Son in his own house.
