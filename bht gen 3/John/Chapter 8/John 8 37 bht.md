# John 8:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You claim to be descendants of Abraham, but your actions prove otherwise. My words do not spread or make any progress within you. Even when I confront you about your intentions to kill me, you do not deny it. The awe of my combined dignity, courage, and kindness strikes you, holding you back. While other prophets spoke of the word of the Lord coming to them, I speak of my own words as something that should find entrance and abiding room in all who hear them. However, my word finds no way in you.
