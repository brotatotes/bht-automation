# John 8:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is a distinction between being the seed of Abraham and being his true children according to faith and holiness. Jesus acknowledges that the Jews were indeed the physical descendants of Abraham, but denies them true sonship because they did not have the same spirit or do the works of Abraham. Simply being descended from Abraham is not enough to be considered his children. True sonship requires faith and likeness to Abraham's character.
