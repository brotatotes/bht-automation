# John 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The temptation for Jesus in this situation was difficult to comprehend. Some argue that Jesus refrained from making a decision because it was a civil matter that did not align with His teachings. The cunning hypocrites were outmatched as the woman had been caught in the act, and her own consciousness of shame was evident. This made further evidence or witnesses unnecessary. The guilt of the woman was revealed through her countenance alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difficulty is even greater than the last, to say, in what sense this was a temptation, to lead to His accusation."
2. "The principal solutions of it have been, (1) that the command of the law had fallen into disuse from the frequency of the crime, and to re-assert it would be contrary to the known mildness of Jesus."
3. "Since Jesus seems to avoid every kind of decision on the question put to Him, it follows that He found in it no reference to the great subjects of His teaching, but treated it as a purely civil or political matter, with which in His ministry He had no concern."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Moses . . . commanded . . . should be stonedâ€”simply put to
	death." 
2. "If He said,
	Stone her, that would seem a stepping out of His province; if He
	forbade it, that would hold Him up as a relaxer of the public morals." 
3. "But these cunning hypocrites were overmatched."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No process of proof was necessary: there was no need to summon witnesses."
2. "The point is that there was no possibility of denying it."
3. "The very countenance of the woman would betray her own consciousness of her shame."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath been taken... caught and still guilty." 
2. "In adultery... herself suffering adultery" 
3. "In the very act... caught in the act of theft"

### John Gill:
1. "They applied to him in a handsome and respectful manner, the better to cover their ill design."
2. "Adultery is a theft; it is an unlawful use of another's property."
3. "In the case of a wife suspected of adultery, they admitted a single witness as valid."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The difficulty lies in understanding the sense in which this situation was a temptation for Jesus. Some suggest that Jesus avoided making a decision on the matter because it was a civil issue that did not pertain to the subjects of His teaching. If He condoned the stoning, He would be seen as stepping out of His role; if He forbade it, He would be viewed as a relaxer of public morals. However, the cunning hypocrites were overmatched; the woman had been caught in the act, and she herself was conscious of her shame. Therefore, there was no need for further proof or witnesses. The woman's countenance alone betrayed her guilt.
