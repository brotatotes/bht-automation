## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difficulty is even greater than the last, to say, in what sense this was a temptation, to lead to His accusation."
2. "What reason had any of His sayingsâ€”who came to fulfil the Law, not to destroy itâ€”given them to expect such mildness in this case?"
3. "Since Jesus seems to avoid every kind of decision on the question put to Him, it follows that He found in it no reference to the great subjects of His teaching, but treated it as a purely civil or political matter, with which in His ministry He had no concern."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Moses . . . commanded . . . should be stonedâ€”simply put to death (Deuteronomy 22:22), but in aggravated cases, at least in later times, this was probably by stoning (Ezekiel 16:40)." 
2. "but what sayest thouâ€”hoping, whatever He might answer, to put Him in the wrong."
3. "But these cunning hypocrites were overmatched."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not only was the sin grievous: the point is that there was no possibility of denying it."
2. "No process of proof was necessary: there was no need to summon witnesses."
3. "We may even well believe that the very countenance of the woman would betray her own consciousness of her shame."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath been taken...caught and still guilty."
2. "In adultery...herself suffering adultery."
3. "In the very act...caught in the act of theft, then extended to any crime in which one is caught."

### John Gill:
1. "They say unto him, Master... the better to cover their ill design."
2. "this woman was taken in adultery... it is an unlawful use of another's property."
3. "in the very act; or 'in the theft itself', for adultery is a theft."
