# John 8:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly belong to God and be His children, the evidence would be your love for me, the Son of God who has come from the essence of the Father. Understand that my coming was not self-initiated, but a result of proceeding forth from the Father. Failure to love me is proof that you do not truly belong to God. Those who reject the Bible and me cannot be friends of God, for if they truly loved God, they would love me, who came from Him and bears His image.
