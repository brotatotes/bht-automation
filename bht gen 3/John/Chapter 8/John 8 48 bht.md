# John 8:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, in their intense and virulent scorn, begin reviling Jesus by calling Him a Samaritan and accusing Him of having a demon. This accusation serves as a baseless retort to Jesus convicting them of not being genuine children of Abraham. By labeling Him as a Samaritan, they imply that He lacks any claim to the title of an Israelite and is hostile to the true law and kingdom of God. Their insults ultimately reveal their rage and desperation, unable to find any legitimate fault in Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews attempt no answer, but commence reviling Him."
2. "They imply, that He differed from their interpretation of the lawâ€”or perhaps, as He had convicted them of not being the genuine children of Abraham, they cast back the charge with a senseless recrimination."
3. "'As in the first clause they sundered Him from the communion of Israel, so now from that of Israel's God.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What intense and virulent scorn!" 
2. "The 'say we not well' refers to Hebrews 12:3-" 
3. "'A Samaritan' means more than 'no Israelite at all'; it means one who pretended, but had no manner of claim to the title."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou art a Samaritan - This was a term of contempt and reproach."
2. "This charge they brought against him because he had said that they were not of God or were not the friends of God."
3. "They also regarded it as evidence that he had a devil. The devil was an accuser or calumniator and as Jesus charged them with being opposed to God, they considered it as proof that he was influenced by such an evil spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Say we not well. Indicating a current reproach. Well is literally, finely, beautifully." 
2. "Sometimes ironical, as Mark 7:6."
3. "Thou art a Samaritan. Literally, a Samaritan art thou... thou who professest such reverence for God and His law, art only a Samaritan, hostile to the true law and kingdom of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "They show more and more how greatly they are stupified by Satan; for, though they are fully convicted, still they are enraged, and are not ashamed to show that they are utterly desperate." (243)
2. "Having no crime more heinous, therefore, to reproach Christ with, they seize at random, and without judgment, this vulgar taunt." (243)
3. "To express it in a few words, we see that with effrontery they curse him, as men are wont to do when, infuriated like enraged dogs, they cannot find anything to say." (243)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To say that Jews were children of the devil seemed an insult, not to themselves only, but to God, whose children they believed themselves to be."
2. "No one but a Samaritan, filled with jealous hatred of the people of God, or one in whom dwelt a demon, one of the spirits whose sole aim was the subversion of Godâ€™s kingdom, could utter such words as these."
3. "We must not overlook the fact that those who are now addressing Jesus are 'the Jews,' not a part, but the Jews as a body."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "On the spur of the moment in their rage and fury they can think of no meaner things to say."
2. "They know, of course, that Jesus was not a Samaritan, but he had acted like a Samaritan in challenging their peculiar spiritual privileges."
3. "The charge of having a demon was an old one by the Pharisees."

### John Gill:
1. "to call a man a Samaritan, was all one as to call him an heretic, an idolater, or an excommunicated person"
2. "the Christians are still in their writings called Cuthites, or Samaritans; and it is indeed with them a general name for all Gentiles and idolaters, or whom they esteem such"
3. "his enemies should fix such a character on him; nor was this an unusual one to be given to good men; the prophets and spiritual men of the Old Testament were accounted madmen"

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou art, a Samaritan - An enemy to our Church and nation..."
2. "and hast a devil? - Art possessed by a proud and lying spirit?"
3. "Say we not well..."
