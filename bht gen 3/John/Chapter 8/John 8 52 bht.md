# John 8:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their misunderstanding keeps to the well-known type, but this time theocratic pride is added to carnal sensuousness. They understood Him to be speaking of natural death. Abraham died. And yet...He shall never taste of death. They thought and said so before, but now they were assured that he must be under diabolical influence, must be possessed with the devil, and mad, and out of his senses; for they thought no man in his senses would ever talk at this rate.
