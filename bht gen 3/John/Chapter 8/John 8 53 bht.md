# John 8:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews set a trap for Jesus, questioning His greatness and accusing Him of blasphemy. They failed to understand that Jesus uses death in a different sense and that He was greater than Abraham and the prophets. Their contemptuous question implied that Jesus, a mere carpenter's son from Nazareth, claimed to be greater than the saints and could defy death. But the glory of the saints pales in comparison to the incomparable brightness of Christ. They failed to grasp that Jesus, as the Messiah, was exalted above Abraham and even higher than the angels.
