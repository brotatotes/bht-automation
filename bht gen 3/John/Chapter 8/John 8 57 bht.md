# John 8:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No inference can be drawn from this as to the age of our Lord at the time as man, but fifty years was with the Jews the completion of manhood. The Jews gave the opposite turn to it, considering it too great an honor for Him to pretend to. His affirmation was not that He had seen Abraham, but that Abraham had seen His day, showing that He was greater than Abraham. The Jews perverted this, affirming that it was impossible for Him and Abraham to have seen each other.
