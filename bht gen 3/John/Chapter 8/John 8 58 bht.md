Jesus' statement highlights His divine nature and eternal being. By declaring I am, He emphasizes His essential pre-existence and eternal existence, distinct from Abraham or any ordinary man.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All unbiassed explanation of these words must recognize in them a declaration of the essential prÃ¦-existence of Christ."
2. "The present, I am, expresses essential existence, see Col. i. 17, and was often used by our Lord to assert His divine Being."
3. "In this verse the Godhead of Christ is involved; and this the Jews clearly understood, by their conduct to Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The statement therefore is not that Christ came into existence before Abraham did (as Arians affirm is the meaning), but that He never came into being at all, but existed before Abraham had a being; in other words, existed before creation, or eternally (as John 1:1)."
2. "[The Jews] then took they up stones to cast at Him, just as they had before done when they saw that He made Himself equal with God (John 1:1- :)."
3. "hid himself"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Before Abraham was - Before Abraham lived."
2. "The expression I am, though in the present tense, is clearly designed to refer to a past time. Thus, in Psalms 90:2, 'From everlasting to everlasting thou art God.'"
3. "This declaration must be referred to another nature; and the passage proves that, while he was a man, he was also endowed with another nature existing before Abraham, and to which he applied the term (familiar to the Jews as expressive of the existence of God) I AM."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Abraham came into being, or was born. Jesus' life was from and to eternity." 
2. "Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am." 
3. "It is important to observe the distinction between the two verbs."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reminds them that he has something greater and higher than human appearance, which is hidden from the senses of the flesh, and is perceived only by the eyes of faith."
2. "By these words he excludes himself from the ordinary rank of men, and claims for himself a power more than human, a power heavenly and divine."
3. "The power and grace of Christ, so far as he is the Redeemer of the world, was common to all ages. It agrees therefore with that saying of the apostle, Christ yesterday, and to-day, and for ever."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the clearest possible manner Jesus declares, not only His existence before Abraham, but also the essential distinction between His being and that of any man."
2. "He claims for Himself that absolute, unchanging existence which is the attribute of God alone."
3. "The conduct of the Jews...clearly understood them to be a distinct (and in their mind a blasphemous) claim of that which belonged to God alone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Before Abraham came into existence or was born."
2. "Jesus claims eternal existence with the absolute phrase used of God."
3. "The contrast between Î³ÎµÎ½ÎµÏƒÎ¸Î± (entrance into existence of Abraham) and ÎµÎ¹Î¼ (timeless being) is complete."

### John Gill:
1. "before Abraham was, I am; which is to be understood, not of his being in the purpose and decree of God, foreordained to sufferings, and to glory... but refers to the passage in Exodus 3:14."

### John Wesley:
1. "Before Abraham was I AM â€” Even from everlasting to everlasting."
2. "This is a direct answer to the objection of the Jews."
3. "...and shows how much greater he was than Abraham."
