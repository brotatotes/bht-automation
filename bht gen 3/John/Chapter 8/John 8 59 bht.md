### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Jews were furious with Jesus because he had made claims that suggested he was divine. As they prepared to stone him, Jesus miraculously hid himself or blended into the crowd of his disciples, who were likely surrounding him. This escape cannot be used to determine Jesus' age since the completion of manhood for Jews was considered to be at fifty years. The Jews, however, twisted the situation, suggesting that Jesus was too young to have seen Abraham. Jesus left the temple without drawing attention to himself, passing through the midst of the angry mob. It is evident that his departure was not a Docetic vanishing, but a bold and deliberate exit.
