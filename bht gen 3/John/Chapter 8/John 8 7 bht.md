## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression, 'without sin,' is not here used in the general sense, meaning, entirely sinless, nor in the strictest, 'free from the crime of adultery'...but...of the sin of uncleanness generally." 
2. "The Lord Jesus was not sent to be a ruler and a judge in this or that particular case of crime, but the Ruler and Judge of all: and His answer expresses this, by convicting them all of sin before Him."
3. "Some of our MSS. read, 'the stone:' in that case, our Lord refers to the first stone, which by Deut. xvii. 7 the witnesses were to cast."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that is without sin‚Äînot meaning sinless altogether; nor yet, guiltless of a literal breach of the Seventh Commandment; but probably, he whose conscience acquits him of any such sin."
2. "Cast a stone‚Äî"the stone," meaning the first one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were determined to extort an answer from him, and showed a perseverance in evil which has been unhappily often imitated."
2. "Is without sin - That is, without this particular sin; he who has not himself been guilty of this very crime - for in this place the connection evidently demands this meaning."

### John Calvin:
1. "And this very argument, had weight with those slanderers, desperate as they were; for no sooner do they obtain a sight of it, than they lay aside those fierce passions with which they were swelled when they came."
2. "Yet there is this difference between the injunction of the Law and the words of Christ, that in the Law God merely enjoined that they should not condemn a man with the tongue unless they were permitted to put him to death with their own hands; but here Christ demands from the witnesses perfect innocence."
3. "No man, therefore, shall be prevented by his own sins from correcting the sins of others, and even from punishing them when it may be found necessary, provided that both in himself and in others he hate what ought to be condemned."
