# John 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees set a trap for Jesus when they brought the woman caught in adultery before Him. However, their plan failed as Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and convicted their consciences. Instead of catching Jesus, their trap ensnared them, leaving Jesus alone with the woman. This incident exposed the corrupt state of public morals and demonstrated the power of an evil conscience. It serves as a reminder that when sin is exposed, it brings about conviction and the need for repentance, leading us to humbly surrender ourselves to the Lord's judgment and grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They had said, ver. 5, 'such women'â€”they now perceive that they themselves were such men."
2. "It was a case somewhat analogous to that in which His saying, 'I am he,' struck His foes to the ground, ch. xviii. 6."
3. "If the consciences of older sinners have heavier loads on them, those of younger ones are more tender."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "they immediately made offâ€”which makes the impudence of those impure hypocrites in dragging such a case before the public eye the more disgusting."
2. "the trap failed to catch Him for whom it was laid, it caught those who laid it."
3. "the woman in the midstâ€”that is, of the remaining audience."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The consciousness of crime showed that the state of the public morals was exceedingly corrupt." 
2. "Jesus only was left with the woman." 
3. "It is by no means probable that the people had left them; and, as this was in the temple on a public occasion, they were doubtless surrounded still by many."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here we perceive how great is the power of an evil conscience. Though those wicked hypocrites intended to entrap Christ by their cavils, yet as soon as he pierces their consciences by a single word, shame puts them to flight. This is the hammer with which we must break the pride of hypocrites."
2. "Our attention is drawn to this circumstance, that, according as each of them surpassed the others in honorable rank, he was the more quickly moved by his condemnation... We ought also to observe how widely this conviction of sin, by which the scribes were affected, differs from true repentance."
3. "Nor is there any reason to doubt that we shall succeed in defeating all the contrivances of our enemies, provided that we permit ourselves to be governed by the same Spirit... When it is said that the woman remained with Christ, let us learn by this example that there is nothing better for us than to be brought, as guilty, to his tribunal, provided that we surrender ourselves mildly and submissively to his government."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were brought to a conception of morality of which they had never dreamed." 
2. "They who came to condemn Jesus went away self-condemned, because He had opened their eyes to that spirit of the law which is so much greater than the letter." 
3. "To all intents Jesus is alone with the woman. He reads her heart, as if His thoughts were concentrated upon her; and she can see none but Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They are summoned to judge themselves rather than the woman" (Dods).
2. "Jesus was left behind alone."
3. "The woman was left behind also 'being in the midst' as they had placed her."

### John Gill:
1. "Being convicted by their own conscience; that they were not without sin, nor free from this; they had a beam in their own eye, who were so forward to observe the mote in another's."
2. "When sin lies at the door, and conscience is awakened and open, it is as good as a thousand witnesses; and lets in, and owns the sin which lies heavy, and makes sad work; and fills with anguish, confusion, and shame."
3. "And Jesus was left alone; not by his disciples, nor the multitude, but his antagonists, who came to tempt and ensnare him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Beginning at the eldest â€” Or the elders."
2. "Jesus was left alone â€” By all those scribes and Pharisees who proposed the question."
3. "But many others remained, to whom our Lord directed his discourse presently after."
