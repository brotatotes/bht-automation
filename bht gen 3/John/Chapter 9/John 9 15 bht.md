## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The enquiry was official, as addressed to the chief witness in the matter."
2. "We cannot hence infer that no one else was present at the healing but Jesus and His disciples."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The proper question to have been asked in the case was whether he had in fact done it, and not in what way."
2. "The question, also, about a sinnerâ€™s conversion is whether in fact it has been done, and not about the mode or manner in which it is effected."
3. "No small part of the disputes and inquiries among men are about the mode in which the Spirit renews the heart, and not about the evidence that it is done."

### John Calvin:
1. "And, first, leaving out of view the question as to the fact, they dispute only about the law of the case; for they do not deny that Christ restored sight to the blind man, but they find a crime in the circumstance of the time when it was done, and assert that it is not a work of God, because it violated the Sabbath."
2. "When they take for granted an error which has been so frequently refuted, it must be imputed to obstinate malice; or at least there is no other reason why they go wrong but because they choose to go wrong."
3. "But with all their furious arrogance, they will never hinder the truth, which has been so frequently and so firmly maintained by us, from being at length successful."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To his neighbours and acquaintances his answer had been fuller and more circumstantial."
2. "To the Pharisees, whom He knew to be the enemies of Jesus, he says as little as he may."
3. "He does not even mention his benefactor's name."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Since he has been brought to the Pharisees who must make a show of wisdom."
2. "No denial as yet of the fact, only interest in the 'how.'"
3. "That is the overwhelming fact."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not vary as to the truth of the relation, but this is somewhat more concise and short." 
2. "It is reasonable to suppose, that the Pharisees had talked much with him before, which made it less necessary to be more particular." 
3. "He makes no mention of the name of Jesus, nor of his making the clay, and the manner of it, nor of the Pool of Siloam, or his orders to go there and wash."
