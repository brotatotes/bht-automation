# John 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Among those who opposed Jesus were Nicodemus, Joseph, and potentially Gamaliel, who eventually withdrew and left the majority to carry out their hatred of Jesus. The Pharisees accused Jesus of violating their Sabbath rules and saw it as clear evidence that he was a sinner. This division arose from differing interpretations of the Scriptures. While some focused on the inviolability of the Sabbath law and denied Jesus any divine mission, others saw the miracles as proof of Jesus' holy character and implicitly denied accusations of Sabbath-breaking.

### John Calvin:
1. "Among good men and those who fear God, miracles are undoubted pledges of the power of the Holy Spirit; but it happens by a just judgment of God, that Satan deceives unbelievers by false miracles, as by enchantments."
2. "Let us then remember that we ought to seek God with a sincere disposition of heart, that he may reveal himself to us by the power of his Spirit; and that we ought to lend our ears submissively to his word, that he may clearly point out true prophets by miracles that are not delusive."
3. "A schism is a highly pernicious and destructive evil in the Church of God; and how comes it then that Christ sows the occasion of discord among the very teachers of the Church? The answer is easy. Christ had no other object in view than to bring all men to God the Father, by stretching out his hand to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The one party, taking as their starting-point the inviolability of the sabbatic law, deny to Jesus as a transgressor of this law any divine mission whatever; and from this logically follows the denial of the miracle."
2. "The others, setting out from the fact of the miracle, infer the holy character of Jesus, and implicitly deny the breaking of the sabbath."
3. "The choice of premiss depends in this case, as in all cases, upon the moral freedom; it is at this point of departure that the friends of light and the friends of darkness separate; the rest is simply a matter of logic."

2. "How can a man that is a sinner, or a sabbath breaker, do such miracles?"
3. "Even in the sanhedrim, they could not agree about the character of the person that had done this miracle."

How can a man that is a sinner â€” That is, one living in wilful sin, do such miracles?

- Attempt 1 BHT: Among those who opposed Jesus were Nicodemus, Joseph, and potentially Gamaliel, who eventually withdrew and left the majority to carry out their hatred of Jesus. The Pharisees accused Jesus of violating their Sabbath rules, seeing it as clear evidence that he was a sinner. They found it difficult to reconcile his ability to perform such signs with their understanding of him as a Sabbath-breaker. This division of opinions arose from differing interpretations of the Scriptures. While some focused on the inviolability of the sabbatic law as their starting point and denied Jesus any divine mission, others saw the miracles as proof of Jesus' holy character and implicitly denied accusations of Sabbath-breaking. Ultimately, these differing interpretations led to a division among the Pharisees and a questioning of Jesus' origins and authority.
