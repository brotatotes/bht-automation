The Pharisees confront the parents of the formerly blind man with a complex, three-fold question, aiming to confuse and incriminate them.

The parents wisely choose to answer only a portion of the interrogations, avoiding the trap set by the Pharisees. Their line of questioning suggests that they may have been searching for alternative explanations for the man's restored sight, seeking to invalidate Jesus's miracle.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Pharisees try to confuse the parents of the formerly blind man with a three-fold question that aims to give them a handle to accuse him and destroy the idea of Jesus performing a miracle. They hope to find a flaw in the man's words to accuse him of being complicit with Jesus's actions, allowing them to deal with Jesus as a transgressor of the law. However, their attempts are thwarted, and the parents select only half of the entangled questions to answer. The Pharisees might have hoped that if the man was truly their son and was born blind, there might be another explanation for his sight other than Jesus's miracle.
