# John 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' question about the blind man's condition reflects the Jewish belief that every ailment was the result of sin. They wondered if the man himself or his parents had sinned, even suggesting that prenatal sin might have played a role. While healing congenital blindness was unusual, it shouldn't be assumed that all calamities were punishments for sin. It's important not to delve too deeply into God's judgments, as our understanding can lead to dangerous misconceptions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "According to Jewish ideas, every infirmity was the punishment of sin."
2. "The question may have been asked vaguely, without any strict application of it to the circumstances, merely taking for granted that some sin must have led to the blindness."
3. "Or perhaps, as Stier inclines to suppose, the question may mean, â€˜this man, or, for that is out of the question, his parents?"

2. "Many of the Jews...believed in the doctrine of the transmigration of souls...that the soul of a man, in consequence of sin, might be compelled to pass into other bodies, and be punished there."
3. "They also believed that an infant might sin before it was born and that consequently this blindness might have come upon the child as a consequence of that."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "...that the thoughts of a mother might affect the moral state of her unborn offspring." (John 9:2)
3. "The apostasy of one of the greatest Rabbis had, in popular belief, been caused by the sinful delight of his mother in passing through an idol grove." (John 9:2)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question seems to show a conviction on their part that the cause was sin; but the conviction may have been less firm than the words themselves would imply."
2. "It is not necessary to discuss the various explanations that have been given, some of which seem wholly improbable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Blindness is common in the Orient and Jesus healed many cases... This is the only example of congenital blindness healed."

2. "This question proceeded upon a principle received by the Jews, that an infant might do that which was faulty and criminal, and actually sin in the womb."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: According to Jewish ideas, the disciples asked if the blind man's condition was a punishment for sin. The question may not have been specific to his circumstances, but rather an assumption that sin must have led to his blindness. It was a common Jewish belief that the merits or demerits of the parents would affect their children, and even the thoughts of a mother could impact her unborn child. However, Jesus' healing of this congenital blindness was a unique event, not a common occurrence. It is not necessary to explore all the explanations for the cause of the blindness, as the discussion around it can lead to unclear and improbable theories. We should be cautious not to inquire too deeply into the judgments of God beyond what is reasonable, as our understanding can lead us into dangerous misunderstandings.
