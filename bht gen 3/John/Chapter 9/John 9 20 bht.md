# John 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parents of the man born blind asserted with certainty that he was their son, who had been blind since birth, thereby undermining the Pharisees' disbelief about the healing. Through their failed attempt to question the authenticity of the miracle, the Pharisees only ended up providing additional evidence to support its truth. The parents, though silent in their gratitude and lacking in courage to openly testify about Christ, did not diminish their son's powerful testimony. Even those who denied his identity still acknowledged the striking resemblance between him and their son, thereby confirming the reality of the miraculous healing.

3. "How much less excuse then will they have, who, by treacherous denial, utterly bury Christ, with his doctrine, with his miracles, with his power and grace!"

### John Gill:

- Attempt 1 BHT: The parents of the man born blind responded confidently to the questions of the Pharisees, affirming that this was indeed their son and that he was born blind. In doing so, they effectively refuted the doubts of the Pharisees regarding the reality of the miracle. The enemies of Jesus, in their attempt to find fault and discredit the sign, were ironically presented with even more evidence of its authenticity. The silence of the parents, while displaying their ingratitude and fear, did not negate the powerful testimony of their son.
