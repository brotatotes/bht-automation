## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It could hardly have been before the council at the conclusion of ch. vii."
2. "Probably the first of the three stages of Jewish excommunication."
3. "Trench regards the resolution not as a token that the Sanhedrim had pronounced Him a false Christ, but as shewing that they forbade a private man to anticipate their decision on this point by confessing Him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Had formed an agreement in order to bring about this end."
2. "The confessor of Christ should be excommunicated."
3. "The penalty which the blind man's parents feared was probably separation from all religious fellowship, and from ordinary intercourse of life for perhaps thirty days."

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage shows that the custom of excommunication is ancient, and has been observed in all ages."
2. "The truth of Christ being so powerful that they were not able to put it down by law, or by a regular course of proceedings, they launched the thunders of excommunications to crush it."
3. "We ought to believe that excommunication, when it is violently applied to a different purpose by the passions of men, may safely be treated with contempt."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Had agreed already (ηδη συνετεθειντο)."
2. "We know that many of the rulers nominally believed on Jesus (John 12:42) and yet 'did not confess him because of the Pharisees' (αλλα δια τους Φαρισαιους ουχ ωμολογουν), for the very reason given here, 'that they might not be put out of the synagogue' (ινα μη αποσυναγωγο γενωντα)."
3. "Αποσυναγωγος (απο and συναγωγη) is found in N.T. only here and John 12:42; John 16:2. A purely Jewish word naturally."

### John Gill:
1. "for the Jews had agreed already; the sanhedrim had made a decree, either at this time, upon this account, or some time before, that if any man did confess that he was Christ; that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah, he should be put out of the synagogue."
2. "though these are sometimes put one for another, and signify the same thing; and he that was under the former of those censures, is said to be מן ציבור מובדל, 'separated from the congregation', a phrase by which the word here used may be very well rendered"
3. "And it may be further observed, that excommunication with the Jews was not only on religious accounts, but on civil accounts; on account of money, or when a man would not pay his debts, according to the decree of the sanhedrim."

### John Wesley:
1. He should be put out of the synagogue — That is be excommunicated.
