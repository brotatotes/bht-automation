# John 9:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We know that God hath spoken unto Moses, but as for this man, we do not know whence he is. The Pharisees, in their elevated view of God's revelation to Moses, failed to recognize the authority of Jesus. They clung to their interpretation of the law, assuming it to be infallible, and dismissed Jesus without truly understanding his origin or purpose. Their refusal to acknowledge Jesus as the one sent from God highlights their ignorance and failure to see the fulfillment of scriptures in him.
