# John 9:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They forget that the two charges,â€”one that he had never been born blind, and so was an impostor,â€”the other, that he bore the mark of Godâ€™s anger in a blindness that reached back to his birth,â€”will not agree together. The Pharisees cast him out, unable to tolerate his audacity as a teacher. They accused him of being born in sin, using his blindness as proof. Yet, this undeserved censure teaches us the danger of judging someone solely based on their afflictions. We should always be humble and receptive to the message of God, even if it comes from an unlikely source.
