# John 9:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you truly acknowledged your blindness and recognized your need for the light, then you would not be guilty of rejecting it. However, because you claim to see and boast in your own wisdom, your guilt remains and your sin goes unpardoned. By refusing to humbly come to Jesus, you are sealing yourself in the darkness of unbelief. You are witnesses against yourselves, holding on to the sin that could have been taken away if only you had acknowledged your need for spiritual sight.
