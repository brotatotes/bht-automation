The healing, with or without means, was solely the work of God's almighty power.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The healing power of Jesus exceeded any ordinary means of healing, as no rule could be observed regarding their use. The means used were only external conduits, not the source of healing itself. The use of spittle and clay may seem incongruous, but if they served to awaken faith in the recipients, their use is accounted for. Although spittle was believed to have a peculiar virtue, it did not contribute to the healing effect. The clay and spittle were merely offensive to the rabbis' Sabbath rules. However, the blind man faithfully and simply obeyed Jesus without questioning, showing his commendable obedience. The use of clay was unlikely to restore sight to a man born blind, but it serves as an emblem of the Gospel, an unlikely means of enlightening and saving sinners. The healing, whether with or without means, was solely attributed to the almighty power of God.
