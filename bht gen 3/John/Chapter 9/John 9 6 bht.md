## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "The â€˜conductorâ€™ of the miraculous power was generally the faith of the recipient: and if such means served to awaken that faith, their use would be accounted for."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These operations were not so incongruous in their nature as might appear."
2. "It were absurd to imagine that they contributed in the least degree to the effect which followed."
3. "They were meant, no doubt, only to call forth the faith and obedience of the sufferer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus, therefore, by making this spittle, showed them that their manner of keeping the day was superstitious, and that he dared to do a thing which they esteemed unlawful." 
2. "He showed that their interpretation of the law of the Sabbath was contrary to the intention of God, and that his disciples were not bound by their notions of the sacredness of that day." 
3. "In such instances the prophet showed that the miracle was performed by power communicated through him; so, in this case, Jesus by this act showed to the blind man that the power of healing came from him who anointed his eyes."
