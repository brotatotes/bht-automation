## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the sense of St. Paul; effectually drawn, by God the Father to the knowledge of the Gospel." 
2. "The only allowable sense seems to be, 'in the case of,' 'as regards,' understanding of course that the love of the Father is spoken of."
3. "Reserved, to be His at the day of His coming. If the question be asked, kept by whom? the answer must be, by God the Father."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Greek is not 'by,' but 'in.' God the Father‚Äôs love is the element IN which they are 'beloved.'"
2. "Thus the conclusion, 'Keep yourselves in the love of God.'"
3. "God‚Äôs effectual calling in the exercise of His divine prerogative, guarantees their eternal safety."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That this is a distinction more to be desired than, would be a mere natural relationship to the Saviour, and consequently."
2. "And preserved in Jesus Christ - See the notes, 1 Peter 1:5. The meaning is, that they owed their preservation wholly to him; and if they were brought to everlasting life, it would be only by him."
3. "And called - Called to be saints. See Romans 1:7 note; Ephesians 4:1 note."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jude does not allude to his relationship to the Lord may be explained by the fact that the natural relationship in his mind would be subordinate to the spiritual."
2. "He would shrink from emphasizing a distinction to which none of the other disciples or apostles could have a claim."
3. "The simple dative without preposition. Therefore for Jesus Christ; by the Father to whom Christ committed them."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever is not called, arrogates to himself presumptuously the right and authority of teaching."
2. "But as calling is nothing else but the effect of eternal election, it is sometimes taken for it."
3. "Jude then mentions here a threefold blessing, or favor of God, with regard to all the godly, ‚Äî that he has made them by his calling partakers of the gospel; that he has regenerated them, by his Spirit, unto newness of life; and that he has preserved them by the hand of Christ, so that they might not fall away from salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If he were, as suggested in the Introduction, the brother of our Lord as well as of James, neither of whom speaks of his relation to Christ, the omission is probably owing to the fact that the human relation was temporary and entirely subordinate to the higher relation of spiritual fellowship."
2. "Our affection for Christians springs from their relation to Christ and their likeness to Him, as our love for God‚Äôs children rests on the same grounds."
3. "The safety of all who believe is the Father‚Äôs answer to the Son. God keeps us as we keep His word... 'God keeps us for Jesus Christ;' we 'keep ourselves in the love of God'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Servant (Œ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ). Precisely as James (James 1:1), only James added Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒøœÖ (Lord)."
2. "Brother of James (Œ±Œ¥ŒµŒªœÜŒøœÇ ŒôŒ±Œ∫œâŒ≤ŒøœÖ). Thus Jude identifies himself. But not the 'Judas of James' (Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13)."
3. "Kept for Jesus Christ (ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœâ œÑŒµœÑŒ∑œÅŒ∑ŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπœÇ). Perfect passive participle again with dative, unless it is the instrumental, 'kept by Jesus Christ,' a quite possible interpretation."

### John Gill:
1. "The elect of God are by God the Father sanctified and set apart in the act of election."
2. "Though holiness is not the cause of election, yet it is a means fixed in it, and is certain by it, and an evidence of it."
3. "There is a secret preservation of them in Christ before calling, from condemnation and the second death."

### John Wesley:
1. "The word servant, under the old covenant, was adapted to the spirit of fear and bondage that clave to that dispensation. But when the time appointed of the Father was come, for the sending of his Son to redeem them that were under the law, the word servant (used by the apostles concerning themselves and all the children of God) signified one that, having the Spirit of adoption, is made free by the Son of God."
2. "His being a servant is the fruit and perfection of his being a son."
3. "And preserved through Jesus Christ ‚Äî So both the spring and the accomplishment of salvation are pointed out."
