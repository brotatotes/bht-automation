# Jude 10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Driven by sensual desires, these false teachers speak evil of the spiritual realm they do not understand. Their knowledge is limited to the realm of the senses, resembling the unreasoning animals. Indulging in sensual gratification, they corrupt themselves rather than contemplating higher, invisible, and heavenly things. Ignorant and lacking comprehension, they blaspheme the Scriptures and defy God's laws. Their minds, clouded by brutish sensuality, prevent them from perceiving and honoring what is beyond their understanding.
