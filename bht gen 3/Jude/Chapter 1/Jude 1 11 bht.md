# Jude 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Woe unto them who have gone by the way of Cain, running greedily after gain, and perishing in the gainsaying of Korah. Their actions mirror the sins of envy, hatred, and murder, just as Cain envied his brother and Balaam pursued selfish avarice. They exhibit disobedience, rebellion, and a reckless abandonment of morals, pouring forth without restraint. Let this be a warning of their certain, miserable condition, whether in the present or future, for their path leads only to destruction.

2. "Ran greedily [ŒµŒæŒµœáœÖŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ] . Lit., were poured out. Rev., ran riotously. A strong expression, indicating a reckless, abandoned devotion of the energies."
3. "In the gainsaying [œÑŒ∑ Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ±] . In the practice of gainsaying like Korah's. 'Antilogia is from ajnti, against, and legw, to speak. Hence, literally, contradiction."

### John Calvin:

1. "Woe to them (ŒøœÖŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒπœÇ). Interjection with the dative as is common in the Gospels (Matthew 11:21)."
2. "Ran riotously (ŒµŒæŒµœáœÖŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ). First aorist passive indicative of ŒµŒ∫œáŒµœâ, to pour out, 'they were poured out,' vigorous metaphor for excessive indulgence."
3. "In the gainsaying of Korah (œÑŒ∑ Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒöŒøœÅŒµ). Again either locative or instrumental. The word Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ± is originally answering back (Hebrews 6:16), but it may be by act also (Romans 10:21) as here. This is the sixth example in Jude, not in II Peter."

### John Gill:
1. "The way of Cain was a way of envy, for Cain envied the acceptance of his brother's gift, and that notice which the Lord took of him; so these men envied the gifts bestowed on Christ's faithful ministers, and the success that attended their labors."
2. "The way of Cain was a way of hatred, and murder of his brother, which his envy led him to; so these men hated the brethren, persecuted them unto death, as well as were guilty of the murder of the souls of men, by their false doctrine."
3. "Balaam's error, which he himself was guilty of, was covetousness, or an immoderate love of money...which these false teachers were greatly addicted to...it is a damnable sin, and excludes from the kingdom of heaven, as well as is dishonorable to religion."

### John Wesley:
1. "Woe unto them ‚Äî Of all the apostles St. Jude alone, and that in this single place, denounces a woe."
2. "For they have gone in the way of Cain - The murderer."
3. "And ran greedily ‚Äî Literally, have been poured out, like a torrent without banks."
