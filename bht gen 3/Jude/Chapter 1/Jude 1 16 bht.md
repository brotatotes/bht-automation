# Jude 16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These murmurers and complainers, dissatisfied with their lot, walk according to their lusts and speak great swelling things. They are mean and fawning towards those of wealth and rank, showing respect of persons for personal gain. Their chronic discontent and insatiable desires make them hard to please, grumbling against others and complaining against God for their fate. Their murmuring and complaining stem from the restless insatiability of their desires and their admiration of those in positions of advantage. In reality, they are mere hypocrites, disguising their true motives behind their grandiose words.
