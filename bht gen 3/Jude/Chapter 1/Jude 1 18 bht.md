# Jude 18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the last time, there shall be scoffers, men who sport with what is holy and good, walking according to their own lusts of impieties. These mockers, in their inebriated state of contempt for God, rush headlong into a brutal rejection of the Divine Being. They reject all that is Divine and exhibit aggravated immorality as a result. This is a characteristic quality demonstrated by those who reject the message of the Second Coming of the Lord, casting off every fear and mocking the doctrine of true religion.
