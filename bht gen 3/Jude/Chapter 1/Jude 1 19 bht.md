## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These are they that separate, having no real sympathy with the spirit of the Gospel:‚Äîthat draw lines of distinction, by walking after their own desires, not in the path of the Church‚Äôs obedience." 
2. "He who rests midway, thinking only of self and self‚Äôs interests, whether animal or intellectual, is the psychikos, the selfish man, the man in whom the spirit is sunk and degraded into subordination to the subordinate psyche." 
3. "These men have not indeed ceased to have a spirit, as a part of their own tripartite nature: but they have ceased to possess it in any worthy sense: it is degraded beneath and under the power of the psyche, the personal life, so as to have no real vitality of its own."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Outwardly they took part in Church ordinances, but inwardly they separated themselves from Church communion in its vital, spiritual reality."
2. "Arrogant setting up of themselves, as having greater sanctity and a wisdom and peculiar doctrine, distinct from others, is implied."
3. "In the animal and natural man, the spirit, his higher part, which ought to be the receiver of the Holy Spirit, is not so; and therefore, his spirit not being in its normal state, he is said not to have the spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These be they who separate themselves - That is, from their brethren and from the work of benevolence and truth."
2. "Sensual - Under the influence of gross passions and appetites."
3. "Having not the spirit - The Holy Spirit, or the spirit of true religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Make separations; i.e., cause divisions in the church."
2. "The rendering sensual, here and James 3:15, is inferential: sensual because natural and unrenewed."
3. "The higher spiritual life. So the adjective pneumatikov, spiritual, is everywhere in the New Testament opposed to yucikov, natural."

### John Calvin:
1. "He means that they separated from the Church, because they would not bear the yoke of discipline, as they who indulge the flesh dislike spiritual life."
2. "The word sensual, or animal, stands opposed to spiritual, or to the renovation of grace; and hence it means the vicious or corrupt, such as men are when not regenerated."
3. "They were doing the same thing as those mentioned by Paul in Romans 16:17. They were producing discords in the Church, and not separations from it; and by continuing in it, they became 'spots and stains' to its members."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Everything they are and everything they have tends to disintegration, and the sooner the Church is rid of them the better."
2. "The word describes the man in whom the earthly natural life of the soul is supreme, the spiritual, with all its faculties, being subject; and the man himself is ever doing the ‚Äòdesires of the flesh and of the mind‚Äô."
3. "They have neither the law nor the power of the really regenerate man. Without the Spirit, therefore, means, conscience and affections and reason all subject and defiled, even when the flesh is not absolutely supreme."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They who make separations (Œø Œ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒπŒøœÅŒπŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ)."
2. "Sensual (œàœÖœáŒπŒ∫Œø). Old adjective from œàœÖœáŒ∑ as in 1 Corinthians 2:14; 1 Corinthians 15:44; James 3:15."
3. "Having not the Spirit (œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ± ŒºŒ∑ ŒµœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not from sinners openly profane; such a separation is commendable, being according to the will and word of God, to the mind and practice of Christ, and which tends to the good of men, and to the glory of God."
2. "Not from errors and heresies, and persons that held them, with these they herded; but from the pure doctrines of the Gospel, and ministers of the word, and made divisions and separations among the churches, for worldly ends, and through pride and affectation of vain glory."
3. "Though they might have some external gifts of the Spirit; or he himself dwelling in them as a spirit of conviction and illumination, as a spirit of regeneration and sanctification, as a spirit of faith and comfort, as a spirit of adoption, and as the earnest and pledge of the heavenly glory; they were not under his influence, nor did they feel the operations of his grace, nor had they communion with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having natural senses and understanding only, not the Spirit of God; otherwise they could not separate."
2. "For that it is a sin, and a very heinous one, 'to separate from the church,' is out of all question."
3. "We have no more authority from scripture to call even this schism, than to call it murder."
