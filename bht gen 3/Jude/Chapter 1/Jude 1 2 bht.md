## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Mercy to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied."
2. "God's mercy, Godâ€™s peace, Godâ€™s love: see ver. 21."
3. "In the somewhat similar passage, Eph. vi. 23, the love and faith are clearly, in themselves, the gift of God: mutual love, or love towards God. But the other seems better here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mercy stands first; the mercy of Christ."
2. "Peace... in the Holy Ghost."
3. "Love... of God. The three answer to the divine Trinity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These things are mentioned as the choicest blessings which could be conferred on them: 'mercy' - in the pardon of all their sins and acceptance with God; 'peace' - with God, with their fellow-men, in their own consciences, and in the prospect of death; and 'love' - to God, to the brethren, to all the world." 
2. "What blessings are there which these do not include?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Love. Peculiar to Jude in salutation.


### John Calvin:
1. "Grace is properly the effect of mercy; for there is no other reason why God has embraced us in love, but that he pitied our miseries." 
2. "If it be referred to God, the meaning is, that it might increase towards them, and that the assurance of divine love might be daily more confirmed in their hearts." 
3. "The other meaning is, however, not unsuitable, that God would kindle and confirm in them mutual love."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜Mercyâ€™ is Godâ€™s feeling towards them; â€˜peaceâ€™ is their condition as the result of it; â€˜loveâ€™ is either their feeling Godward and manward as the effect of Godâ€™s grace."
2. "This last view seems preferable; it is for the fulness of love he prays, as it is for abundance of mercy and peace."
3. "In Paulâ€™s view, those who minister in holy things specially need it [mercy], as in Judeâ€™s view do those whom he addresses."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Be multiplied (Ï€Î»Î·Î¸Ï…Î½Î¸ÎµÎ¹Î·). First aorist passive optative of Ï€Î»Î·Î¸Ï…Î½Ï‰ as in 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Peter 1:2. 


### John Gill:
1. "Mercy is a perfection in God; and shows itself in a special manner towards the elect, in the covenant of grace, in the provision of Christ as a Saviour, in the mission of him into this world, in redemption by him, in the forgiveness of sin, in regeneration, and in their whole salvation."
2. "A multiplication of 'peace' from Christ... may include peace, and an abundance of it, among themselves, as well as all prosperity, both external, internal, and eternal."
3. "A multiplication of 'love' is wished for from the Spirit of God... when it is gradually shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, and they are by degrees led into it more and more, and the acts of it are drawn out and set before them one after another, and fresh manifestations of it are made unto them."
