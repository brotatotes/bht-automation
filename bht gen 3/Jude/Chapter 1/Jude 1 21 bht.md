# Jude 21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Keep yourselves in the love of God, the guarantee for your safety, as you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ. The love of God, not objective, but His love towards you, is the source of eternal life. Though man needs to watch and keep himself, it is ultimately only through God's love and keeping that he can truly be kept safe. The mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, which will be fully revealed at His coming, is a testament to the unity of the Father and the Son. Just as the Philippians were called to work out their salvation with fear and trembling, so too must believers actively keep themselves in the love of God.
