# Jude 22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To those in doubt, we are called to show mercy and kindness, offering tender affection. For the contentious, we should firmly rebuke them. The fire referred to is not eternal, but rather the present hell caused by their corrupt practices. We are to snatch them from this fire without hesitation, showing compassion through fervent prayer, humble instruction, and genuine concern. Each individual should be treated differently, with the appropriate level of tenderness or severity depending on their circumstances.
