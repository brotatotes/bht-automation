1. "Verbal from œÄœÑŒ±Œπœâ, to stumble (James 3:2; 2 Peter 1:10), sure-footed as of a horse that does not stumble (Xenophon), and so of a good man (Epictetus, Marcus Antoninus)."
2. "Before the presence of his glory (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµŒΩœâœÄŒπŒøŒΩ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ¥ŒøŒæŒ∑œÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ). Late compound preposition (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±, ŒµŒΩ, œâœÄœÇ), right down before the eye of his glory as in Ephesians 1:4. Cf. Matthew 25:31-33; Colossians 1:22, where Paul has œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÉŒ± like œÉœÑŒ∑œÉŒ± here (first aorist active infinitive) and also Œ±ŒºœâŒºŒøœÖœÇ as here, but Œ±ŒºœâŒºŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ in 2 Peter 3:14."
3. "In exceeding joy (ŒµŒΩ Œ±Œ≥Œ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ±œÉŒµ). See Luke 1:14."

### John Gill:
1. "The people of God are liable to falling into temptation, into sin, into errors and mistakes, from an exercise of grace, or from a degree of steadfastness in Gospel truths, and even into a final and total apostasy, were it not for divine power."
2. "And what he keeps them from is, from falling by temptations, not from being tempted by Satan, but from sinking under his temptations, and from being devoured by him; and from falling by sin, not from the being or commission of sin, but from the dominion of it, and from the falling into it, so as to perish by it."
3. "The manner in which they will be presented is 'with exceeding joy'; in themselves, for what they shall be delivered from, from sin and sorrow, and every enemy, and for the glory and happiness they shall then enjoy; and also in the ministers of the Gospel, who will then bring their sheaves with joy, and then will their converts be their joy and crown of rejoicing; and likewise this presentation will be with the joy of angels, for if they rejoice at the conversion of men, much more at their glorification; and even with the joy of Father, Son, and Spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now to him who alone is able to keep them from falling - Into any of these errors or sins."
2. "And to present them faultless in the presence of his glory - That is, in his own presence."
3. "When he shall be revealed in all his glory."
