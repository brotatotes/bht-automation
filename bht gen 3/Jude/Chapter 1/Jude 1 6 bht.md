## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Angels, those which kept not their own dignity, but left their own [proper] habitation, He hath kept against the judgment of the great day in eternal bonds under darkness."
2. "The fact alluded to is probably that which is obscurely indicated in Gen. vi. 2."
3. "The darkness being considered as brooding over them, and they under it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "their own" implies that, instead of being content with
the dignity
once for all assigned to them under the Son of God, they aspired
higher.
2. Even if Greek
“these,” refer to the
angels,
the sense of “in like manner as these” will be, not that the
angels carnally fornicated
with the daughters of men, but that their ambition, whereby their
affections went away
from
God and they fell, is in God’s view a sin of like kind spiritually
as Sodom’s going away
from God’s order of nature after strange flesh.
3. Their ambitious designs seem to have
had a peculiar connection with this earth, of which Satan before his
fall may have been God’s vicegerent, whence arises his subsequent
connection with it as first the Tempter, then “the prince of this
world.”

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'estate' (ἀρχὴν archēn) is, in the margin, 'principality.' The word properly means, 'beginning, commencement;' and then that which surpasses others, which is 'first,' etc., in point of rank and honor; or pre-eminence, priority, precedence, princedom." 
2. "The word rendered 'habitation' (οἰκητήριον oikētērion) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means here that heaven was their native abode or dwelling-place."
3. "The sense is, that that deep darkness always endures; there is no intermission; no light; it will exist forever."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "First estate [αρχην]. The word originally signifies beginning, and so frequently in New Testament... A peculiar use of the word occurs at Acts 10:1, 'the sheet knit at the four corners [αρχαις];' the corners being the beginnings of the sheet." 
2. "The Jews regarded the angels as having dominion over earthly creatures; and the angels are often spoken of in the New Testament as ajrcai, principalities; as Romans 8:38; Ephesians 1:21; so that this term would be appropriate to designate their dignity, which they forsook." 
3. "Everlasting [αιδιοις]. Only here and Romans 1:20. For a longer form ajeidiov, from ajei, always."

### John Calvin:
1. "He will not then forgive our perfidy, if we depart from the grace unto which he has called us."
2. "This punishment, inflicted on the inhabitants of heaven, and on such superior ministers of God, ought surely to be constantly before our eyes."
3. "For wherever they go, they drag with them their own chains, and remain involved in darkness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fallen angels, accusative case after τετηρηκεν (perfect active indicative of τηρεω, for which verb see 2 Peter 2:4; 2 Peter 2:7) at the end of the verse."
2. "Principality (αρχην). Literally, 'beginning,' 'rule,' (first place of power as in 1 Corinthians 15:24; Romans 8:38). In Acts 10:11 it is used for 'corners' (beginnings) of the sheet."
3. "In everlasting bonds (δεσμοις αιδιοις). Either locative (in) or instrumental (by, with). Αιδιος (from αε, always), old adjective, in N.T. only here and Romans 1:20 (of God's power and deity). It is synonymous with αιωνιος (Matthew 25:46)."

### John Gill:
1. "And this their habitation, which they left, or fell from, or they were cast out of, is by the Jews frequently called the place of their holiness, or their holy place."
2. "He hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness; by these 'everlasting chains' may be meant the power and providence of God over them."
3. "This account shows the imprisoned state of the devils, that they are not their own lords, and cannot do as they would; they are under restraints, and in chains, and not to be feared."

### John Wesley:
1. "But now he loves them no more; they are doomed to endless destruction."
2. "Both his former love, and his present righteous and eternal displeasure towards the same work of his own hands."
3. "He invariably loveth righteousness, and hateth iniquity."
