# Jude 8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These men, in their sinful slumber, defile themselves, despise authority, and speak evil of celestial dignities. Their dreams of indulgence and disobedience lead them to belittle the glories of celestial powers they do not understand. Like the inhabitants of Sodom, they persist in their wickedness, blind to the self-destruction they invite. These dreamers, whose false teachings corrupt themselves and others, seek to undermine order and authority. However, their delusions and fleeting fantasies will not go unchecked, as divine punishment awaits them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notwithstanding these warning examples, these men in their dreams defile the flesh and despise lordship, and speak evil of glories."
2. "The term represents that state of dreaming in the sleep of sin, out of which men are so often called on to awake to righteousness and the light of Christ."
3. "It becomes therefore necessary to understand the words of celestial lordships and dignities: probably in both cases those of the holy angels."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The clause, 'these men dreaming' (that is, in their dreams), belongs to all the verbs, 'defile,' 'despise,' and 'speak evil.' All sinners are spiritually asleep, and their carnal activity is as it were a dream."
2. "Their speaking evil of dignities is because they are dreaming, and know not what they are speaking evil of."
3. "As a man dreaming seems to himself to be seeing and nearing many things, so the natural man's lusts are agitated by joy, distress, fear, and the other passions. But he is a stranger to self-command."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their character resembled that of the inhabitants of Sodom; the example which he adduces of the punishment which was brought on those sinners, leaves it to be clearly inferred that the persons of whom he was speaking would be punished in a similar manner."
2. "Their doctrines were the fruits of mere imagination, foolish vagaries and fancies."
3. "Despise dominion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "though they have these fearful examples before them, yet they persist in their sin."
2. "Kuriothv, dominion, occurs in three other passages, Ephesians 1:21; Colossians 1:16; 2 Peter 2:10."
3. "In Colossians the term is used with thrones, principalities, and powers, with reference to the orders of the celestial hierarchy as conceived by Gnostic teachers, and with a view to exalt Christ above all these."

### John Calvin:
1. "He only shews that they were vessels of wrath appointed to destruction, and that they could not escape the hand of God, but that he would some time or another make them examples of his vengeance."
2. "He intimates that they were so dull and stupid as to give up themselves without any shame to every kind of baseness."
3. "They who abandon themselves to iniquity, do also wish to abolish all order."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And yet these men (Jude 1:4) actually do the same things as the people of Sodom and the fallen angels."
2. "They live in the feelings of their own perverted sense, and they corrupt others as well as themselves."
3. "No other vice, indeed, so easily demoralizes the entire nature."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In like manner (Î¿Î¼Î¿Î¹Ï‰Ï‚). Like the cities of the plain."
2. "These also (ÎºÎ± Î¿Ï…Ï„Î¿). The false teachers of verse Jude 1:4."
3. "In their dreamings (ÎµÎ½Ï…Ï€Î½Î¹Î±Î¶Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿). Present middle participle of ÎµÎ½Ï…Ï€Î½Î¹Î±Î¶Ï‰, to dream."

### John Gill:
1. "False doctrines are dreams, and the teachers of them dreamers...are illusory and deceitful, and are in themselves vanities, and like dreams pass away."
2. "And the dreamers of these dreams may be said to 'defile the flesh'; since they appear to follow and walk after the dictates of corrupt nature."
3. "False teachers are injurious to themselves, disturbers of churches, and pernicious to civil government."

### John Wesley:
1. "In like manner these dreamers â€” Sleeping and dreaming all their lives."
2. "Despise authority â€” Those that are invested with it by Christ, and made by him the overseers of his flock."
3. "Rail at dignities â€” The apostle does not seem to speak of worldly dignities."
