# Luke 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the altar of incense, an angel appeared to Zacharias, standing favorably on the right side between the altar and the candlestick. This was not a mere vision, but an actual objective appearance. Trying to explain away the reality of the angel is futile; we must choose between admitting an objective appearance and a myth. The constant presence of angels in the temple, even in a time of corruption, is significant. The temple, often the scene of the manifestation of the glory of the Lord, becomes the centre, whence the first rays of light secretly break through the darkness.
