## BHT:
Zacharias had long since ceased looking for an answer to his prayer for a son, but God heard and answered.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is heard (ÎµÎ¹ÏƒÎ·ÎºÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¸Î·). First aorist passive indicative. A sort of timeless aorist, 'was heard' when made, and so 'is heard' now."
2. "John (Î™Ï‰Î±Î½Î·Î½). The word means that God is gracious. The mention of the name should have helped Zacharias to believe."
3. "Certainly Luke has preserved the earliest Christian hymns in their oldest sources. He is the first critic of the sources of the Gospels and a scholarly one."

### John Gill:
1. "For thy prayer is heard; which he had many years ago put up for a son; prayer is sometimes immediately heard, and answered; and sometimes an answer is deferred a long time, to try the faith and patience of the saints, and to discover the more the wisdom, power, and goodness of God."
2. "And thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son; who had been always barren, and was called so... a fit name for one that was filled with the gifts and graces of the Spirit; and was the harbinger of the Messiah, who is full of grace and truth; and the ushered in the Messiah's kingdom, which is a dispensation of grace."

3. "John signifies the grace or favour of Jehovah. A name well suiting the person, who was afterward so highly in favour with God, and endued with abundance of grace; and who opened a way to the most glorious dispensation of grace in the Messiah's kingdom."
