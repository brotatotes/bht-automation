2. "and power of Elias‚Äînot his miraculous power, for John did no miracle... but his power 'turning the heart,' or with like success in his ministry.

Whatever weakens family ties cannot be 'reform.'"
3. "A prepared people. Not the people of Israel, but a people prepared out of Israel."

2. "John was to be an instrument of turning some of the unbelieving Jews, to the true knowledge of salvation by Christ; which their righteous progenitors waited for, had a right knowledge of, and an interest in."
