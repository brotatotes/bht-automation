# Luke 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The birth of John, involving human generation, but prophetically announced and supernatural, can be compared to the birth of Isaac in the Old Testament. However, Zacarias's unbelief stands in stark contrast to Abraham's strong faith. While Levites became obsolete at the age of fifty, it seems that this was not the case for priests. While Mary believed without a sign, Zacharias struggled to accept the promise without proof. Like the disciples who doubted Peter's return, Zacharias had prayed for this blessing and yet remained skeptical, asking for a sign due to his old age.
