# Luke 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The birth of John paralleled the supernatural birth of Isaac in the Old Testament, yet Abraham's faith contrasted greatly with Zacharias' unbelief. While Zacharias demanded a sign to believe the promise, Abraham did not stagger at God's promise but remained strong in faith. Similarly, Mary believed without a sign. Zacharias' skepticism and desire for proof resulted in his temporary loss of speech. His lack of faith, unlike Abraham and Mary, caused him to falter in accepting the promised favor.
