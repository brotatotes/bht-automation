## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostles, delivered these matters orally to the Churches in their teaching and others drew up accounts from that catechetical instruction."
2. "He cannot therefore have seen (or, having seen, not recognized as such, which is highly improbable) the Gospel of St. Matthew."
3. "From the beginning... from the official beginning: see Acts i. 21 f. It differs from from the very first below."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 2. from the beginning‚Äîthat is,
	of His public ministry, as is plain from what follows.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "As they delivered them - As they narrated them. As they gave an account of them."
2. "From the beginning - From the commencement of these things - that is, from the birth of John, or perhaps from the beginning of the ministry of Jesus."
3. "Eye-witnesses - Who had seen those things themselves, and who were therefore proper witnesses."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Eye witnesses and ministers." Personal knowledge and practical experience were necessary elements of an apostle.
3. "Ministers [œÖœÄŒ∑œÅŒµœÑŒ±Œπ]. See on Matthew 5:25. In medical language denoting the attendants or assistants of the principal physician."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They delivered them, or, 'handed them down.' The oral instruction of the Apostles is here referred to... Oral tradition came first, but this preface plainly implies its insufficiency."
2. "From the beginning, i.e., from the baptism of John... Eye-witnesses. The Apostles, perhaps the Seventy also. This implies that Luke was not a disciple during the lifetime of our Lord."
3. "The word, i.e., the word of the gospel, the preached word. Certainly not 'the Word,' the Logos, for John only uses this term. Hence 'of the word' is scarcely to be joined with 'eye-witnesses.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke asserts that the previous narratives had their sound basis."
2. "Luke means to say that the handing down was dependable, not mere wives' fables."
3. "Here we have both written and oral sources. Luke had access to both kinds."

### John Gill:
1. "Even as they delivered them unto us... which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word..." 
2. "...the above Christians proposed to write..."
3. "...the truth of his incarnation, and of his ministry and miracles; saw, and conversed with him after his resurrection from the dead and beheld his ascension to heaven..."
