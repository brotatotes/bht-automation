- Attempt 1 BHT: The priest who went into the temple to burn incense clearly had an intense experience, as his manner showed excitement. Although it was not his role to pronounce the benediction, the fact that he couldn't do so heightened their curiosity. In response to their questioning looks, he communicated through signs, repeatedly making the same gestures to convey his message. They understood that he had seen a vision because he was unable to speak, and his nodding and beckoning back and forth reinforced this. The priesthood of the Old Testament became silent when the voice of the preacher was announced, and they immediately inferred that he had encountered something supernatural. This encounter left the priest speechless until the appointed time.
