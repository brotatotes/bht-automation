## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "it seemed good to me also... he intended no disparagement nor blame to them." 
2. "The words which follow imply... superiority of his own qualification for the work." 
3. "There is here no expressed claim to inspiration, but at the same time no disclaimer of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From the very first‚Äîthat is, from the very earliest events; referring to those precious details of the birth and early life, not only of our Lord, but of His forerunner, which we owe to Luke alone."
2. "In order‚Äîor 'consecutively'‚Äîin contrast, probably, with the disjointed productions to which he had referred. But this must not be pressed too far; for, on comparing it with the other Gospels, we see that in some particulars the strict chronological order is not observed in this Gospel."
3. "Most excellent‚Äîor 'most noble'‚Äîa title of rank applied by this same writer twice to Felix and once to Festus (Acts 22:26; Acts 24:3; Acts 26:25). It is likely, therefore, that 'Theophilus' was chief magistrate of some city in Greece or Asia Minor."

3. "Accurately [Œ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒ≤œâœÇ]. From akron, the highest or farthest point. Hence to trace down to the last and minutest detail."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having carefully examined all things."
2. "Luke intended to express his close and laborious investigation."
3. "He perceived everything that had been done as well as if he had been a spectator."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He does not claim, but certainly does not disclaim, inspiration."
2. "The inspired writers were moved by the Holy Spirit, not as passive machines, but as rational and responsible persons."
3. "The name Theophilus imports the temper of mind which God will bless in the Scripture student."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
