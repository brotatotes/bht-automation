# Luke 1:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary's cousin, though the exact nature of their kinship is unknown, was a sign of reward for Mary's faith. The word used can indicate a cousin or someone of the same family. The substitution of a feminine form suggests a kinswoman. The relationship's closeness is unclear, and Mary being of the tribe of Levi does not necessarily follow. However, the example of Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy serves as confirmation of the angel's message, strengthening the miraculous nature of Mary's own pregnancy.
