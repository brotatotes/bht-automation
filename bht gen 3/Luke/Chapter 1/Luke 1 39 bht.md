## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Mary being betrothed to Joseph, had no communications with him, except through the bridesmaids; who, on the first indications of her pregnancy, represented it to him."
2. "As a betrothed virgin she could not travel: but now immediately, and perhaps for the very reason of the circumstances under which Joseph had taken her home, she visits Elisabeth‚Äîremaining with her about three months."
3. "The words rendered a city of Juda may possibly mean 'the city of Juttah,' which was given, together with Hebron, and other neighbouring cities, to the children of Aaron the priest."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "hill country‚Äîthe mountainous tract running along the middle of Judea"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And Mary arose - The word 'arose' here is equivalent to 'setting out,' or starting on a journey."
2. "The hill country - The region in the vicinity of Jerusalem, commonly called the hill country of Judea."
3. "City of Juda - What city is meant is not known. Some have supposed it to be Jerusalem, others Hebron; but all is conjecture. It was probably a Levitical city, and the residence of Zechariah when he was not employed in the temple."

### John Calvin:
1. "This departure mentioned by Luke proves that Mary‚Äôs faith was not of a transitory nature: for the promise of God does not fade away with the presence of the angel, but is impressed upon her mind."
2. "The haste indicates a sincere and strong affection. We may infer from it that the Virgin disregarded everything else and formed a just estimate of this grace of God."
3. "The power of God became more remarkable and striking by taking in at one view both favors, the very comparison of which gave no small additional luster."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With haste, implies that she started at the first opportunity. Hence the improbability that her marriage with Joseph intervened."
2. "The purpose of the journey was to find the confirmation indicated by the words of the angel, and to congratulate her kinswoman. The latter would not in itself be a sufficient reason for a betrothed wife to travel alone, or for a newly married bride to leave her husband."
3. "Most think it was Hebron, which was given to the sons of Aaron in the hill-country of Judah (Joshua 19:11), but this cannot certainly be inferred."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke is very fond of this word [arose], sixty times against twenty-two in the rest of the N.T."
2. "Luke uses this adjective twice in this context [hill country] instead of œÑŒø ŒøœÅŒøœÇ, the mountains."
3. "The name of the city where Zacharias lived is not given unless Judah here means Juttah (Joshua 15:55)."

### John Gill:
1. "directly, immediately, as soon as the angel was gone from her"
2. "partly to know the truth of things, and to make use of the sign which had been given her"
3. "Mary arose...and went into the hill country with haste"

### John Wesley:
1. A city of Judah ‚Äî Probably Hebron, which was situated in the hill country of Judea, and belonged to the house of Aaron.
