# Luke 1:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The salutation spoken by Elizabeth to Mary was a clear inspiration from the Holy Spirit. The movement of the baby in her womb, possibly its first, was a result of this spiritual influence. This extraordinary occurrence, where the unborn John leaped in recognition of the unborn Messiah, goes beyond our common experience and reflects the supernatural workings of the Holy Spirit. The sympathetic emotion of the unconscious babe, moved by the presence of the mother of his Lord, is a testament to the extraordinary effects that may be beyond our understanding.
