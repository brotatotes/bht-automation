2. "The former is the best rendering..."
3. "...and then among women will be the Hebrew superlative..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What beautiful superiority to envy have we here!"
2. "Elisabeth loses sight of it altogether, in presence of one more honored still."
3. "Turn this as we will, we shall never be able to see the propriety of calling an unborn child 'Lord,' but by supposing Elisabeth, like the prophets of old, enlightened to perceive the Messiah's Divine nature."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Elizabeth's sudden and violent emotion at the appearance of Mary, and the movement of the child, prompted an exclamation."

### John Calvin:
