### Henry Alford:
1. "regarded i.e. looked upon."

3. "Ver. 55 is not rendered in the A.V. according to the construction; from Ps. xcvii. 3 it will be seen that in remembrance of his mercy to Abraham are to be joined together, and therefore as he spake to our fathers will be parenthetical."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Is it unnatural to suppose that the spirit of the blessed Virgin had been drawn beforehand into mysterious sympathy with the ideas and the tone of this hymn?"
2. "In both songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold 'the proud, the mighty, the rich,' passed by, and, in their persons the lowliest chosen to usher in the greatest events."
3. "In both songs the strain dies away on CHRIST; in Hannah's under the name of 'Jehovah's King', in the Virgin's song, it is as the 'Help' promised to Israel by all the prophets."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He seeks the humble and the contrite; he imparts his rich blessings to those who feel that they need them, and who will bless him for them."

3. "Let us remember that, in praising both men and angels, there is a general rule laid down, to extol in them the grace of God; as nothing is at all worthy of praise which did not proceed from Him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The low estate. Not humility of mind, but humility of station, of external condition."
2. "For, behold, from henceforth. In proof that the Lord had thus looked upon her low estate."
