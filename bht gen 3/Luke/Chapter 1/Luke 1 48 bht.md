# Luke 1:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in his divine wisdom, looked upon the humble condition of his handmaid. The choice to raise up someone of low estate to bring forth the Messiah is not arbitrary but a reflection of his purpose to put down the mighty from their seats and exalt them of low degree. Mary's acknowledgment of being called blessed is not an invitation for worship, but an appreciation of the favor bestowed upon her by God. It is vital to recognize that Mary's blessedness is a result of God's grace and not her own status.

1. "In both songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold 'the proud, the mighty, the rich,' passed by, and, in their persons the lowliest chosen to usher in the greatest events, sing of this as no capricious movement, but a great law of the kingdom of God, by which He delights to 'put down the mighty from their seats and exalt them of low degree.'" 
2. "In both songs the strain dies away on CHRIST; in Hannah's under the name of 'Jehovah's King'‚Äîto whom, through all His line, from David onwards to Himself, He will 'give strength'; His 'Anointed,' whose horn He will exalt; in the Virgin's song, it is as the 'Help' promised to Israel by all the prophets."
