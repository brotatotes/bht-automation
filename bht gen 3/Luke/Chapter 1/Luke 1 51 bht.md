### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression in this and the subsequent verses has no particular reference to his mercy to Mary."
2. "This is the nature of true piety. It does not terminate in thinking of God‚Äôs mercy toward ourselves. It thinks of others, and praises God that others also are made partakers of His mercy, and that His goodness is manifested to all His works."
3. "Those who were lifted up or exalted in their own view. Those who 'thought themselves' to be superior to other men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shewed strength [ŒµœÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒøœÇ] . Lit., made strength."
2. "In the imagination [Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±] . The faculty of thought, understanding, especially moral understanding."
3. "Some prefer to render 'by the imagination,' thus making the proud the instrument of their own destruction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Showed strength (ŒµœÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒøœÇ). 'Made might' (Wycliff). A Hebrew conception as in Psalms 118:15."
2. "Plummer notes six aorist indicatives in this sentence (Luke 1:51-63), neither corresponding to our English idiom, which translates here by 'hath' each time."

3. "A virgin betrothed to a carpenter, and her son of that business also, with which both were flouted; and because of this meanness, the Messiah was rejected by them; and thus were they scattered and confounded in their imaginations."

### John Wesley:

2. "She speaks prophetically of those things as already done, which God was about to do by the Messiah."
