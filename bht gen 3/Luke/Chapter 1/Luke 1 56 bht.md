# Luke 1:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary and Elizabeth, two esteemed women chosen by God, found themselves under the same roof for a significant period of time. The miracles surrounding John's birth during their time together served as an extraordinary confirmation of the purpose that awaited him. This period also solidified Mary's faith as she witnessed the fulfillment of the sign given to her by the angel. Mary's subsequent return to her own house led to the events described in Matthew 1:18-24, eventually guiding her to Bethlehem, where another extraordinary miracle would soon take place.
