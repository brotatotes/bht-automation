## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "It has been denied that any such distinction was known to the Jews and New Testament writers."
3. "Hebrews 9:1- :, and other passages, put this beyond all reasonable doubt."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "They were strict, exact, punctual. Yet this, if it had been mere â€˜externalâ€™ observance, might have been no proof of piety."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

2. "The righteousness which is commended in them depends on the gracious forbearance of God, who does not reckon to them their remaining unrighteousness."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "Not as the Pharisees, only righteous before men, but in the sight of God, who sees the heart..."
2. "Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord: this was not the matter of their righteousness before God, but the evidence of it before men..."
3. "They were so in the sight of God; as they were justified by the righteousness of Christ, so they were without fault before the throne, and unreproveable before God..."

### John Wesley:
1. Walking in all the moral commandments, and ceremonial ordinances, blameless â€” How admirable a character! May our behaviour be thus unblamable, and our obedience thus sincere and universal!
