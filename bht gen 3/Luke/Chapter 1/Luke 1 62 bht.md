# Luke 1:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inference is that Zacharias was not only dumb but also deaf, as there would have been no reason for others to make signs if he could hear. They consulted with him through repeated signs, suggesting a loss of hearing. Perhaps his temporary deafness was a punishment to allow for silent reflection. Being the father, it was fitting that he had the authority to name his child in this situation.
