## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Filled with the Holy Ghost - See Luke 1:15."
2. "And prophesied - The word 'prophesy' means..."
3. "This song of Zechariah partakes of all. It is principally employed in the praises of God, but it also predicts the future character and preaching of John."

### John Calvin:
1. "We have lately explained this phrase to mean, that the servants of God received more abundantly the grace of the Spirit, of which, at other times, they were not destitute."
2. "This implies that divine inspiration, at that time, rested upon him in an extraordinary measure, in consequence of which he did not speak like a man or private person, but all that he uttered was heavenly instruction."
3. "This was a remarkable instance of the goodness of God, that not only did Zacharias recover the power of speech, which he had not enjoyed for nine months, but his tongue became the organ of the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The BENEDICTUS presents, therefore, not only the faith of a pious Jewish priest, not only the result of the long months of silent reflection to which Zacharias had been subjected, but also these as guided, moved, and uttered under the immediate influence of the Holy Spirit."
2. "Without inspiration the pious priest would doubtless have adopted the same tone, the same Old Testament phraseology, but his words could not have been prophetic of the coming of the Messiah nor of the part to be taken by his own son."
3. "The hymn may be divided into five stanzas (of three lines each, though some make more). As is natural, the song of Zacharias is more national in its character, the song of Mary more individual. The Benedictus is more priestly, the Magnificat more royal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Prophesied (ŒµœÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒµœÖœÉŒµŒΩ). Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit."
2. "This Benedictus (ŒïœÖŒªŒøŒ≥Œ∑œÑŒøœÇ, Blessed) of Zacharias (Luke 1:68-79) may be what is referred to in verse Luke 1:64 'he began to speak blessing God' (ŒµœÖŒªŒøŒ≥œâŒΩ)."
3. "He, like Mary, was full of the Holy Spirit and had caught the Messianic message in its highest meaning."

### John Gill:
1. "And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost,.... With a spirit of prophecy..." 
2. "and prophesied saying; the following things, relating to the Messiah, his incarnation and redemption by him..."
3. "Whence it appears, that the following song is of divine inspiration; and that Zacharias spake it as he was moved by the Holy Ghost, as the prophets of old did."

### John Wesley:
1. And Zacharias prophesied ‚Äî Of things immediately to follow. But it is observable, he speaks of Christ chiefly; of John only, as it were, incidentally.
