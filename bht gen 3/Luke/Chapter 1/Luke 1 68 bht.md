## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is not a word in this noble burst of divine song about his own child; like Elisabeth losing sight entirely of self, in the glory of a Greater than both."
2. "In the Old Testament, God is said to 'visit' chiefly for judgment, in the New Testament for mercy."
3. "But this Old Testament phraseology, used at first with a lower reference, is, when viewed in the light of a loftier and more comprehensive kingdom of God, equally adapted to express the most spiritual conceptions of the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God 'looked upon' the world - he saw it miserable - he came to relieve it, and brought salvation."
2. "Men are sinners... if anything can be done which will have the same 'good effect' as the punishment of the sinner, or which will be an 'equivalent' for it... God may consistently release him."
3. "The 'blood of Jesus'... constitutes such a ransom. It is in their stead. It is for them. It is equivalent to their punishment."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word ·ºêœÄŒµœÉŒ∫·Ω≥œàŒ±œÑŒø, he hath visited, contains an implied contrast: for the face of God had been turned away for a time from the unhappy children of Abraham."
2. "This visitation of God, which Zacharias mentions, is declared to be the cause and origin of redemption."
3. "The power and efficacy of that redemption, which was once exhibited in Christ, have been the same in all ages."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For he hath visited, etc. The past tenses throughout are used because the eye of prophecy regards these certain future events as having already taken place."
2. "Wrought redemption. This sums up the benefits bestowed by the Messiah, regarding them from the priestly point of view."
3. "His people. Comp, the previous clause: 'the God of Israel.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath visited (ŒµœÄŒµœÉŒ∫ŒµœàŒ±œÑŒø). An old Greek word with a Hebraic colouring to look into with a view to help."
2. "Redemption (ŒªœÖœÑœÅœâœÉŒπŒΩ) here originally referred to political redemption, but with a moral and spiritual basis."
3. "The papyri have plenty of examples of the verb in the sense of inspecting, examining."

### John Gill:
1. "To bless God, is not to invoke a blessing on him... but to praise and glorify him, on account of the perfections of his nature, and the works of his hands." 
2. "The act of 'visiting' them... may include God's look of love upon them from everlasting; his choice of them in Christ unto salvation; the appointment and provision of a Saviour for them; the covenant of grace made with them in Christ."
3. "The 'redemption'... intends the spiritual and eternal redemption of them by the price of his blood, from the slavery of sin, the bondage of the law, and curse of it, and the captivity of Satan, and a deliverance out of the hands of every enemy."
