## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is not a word in this noble burst of divine song about his own child; like Elisabeth losing sight entirely of self, in the glory of a Greater than both."
2. "In the Old Testament, God is said to 'visit' chiefly for judgment, in the New Testament for mercy."
3. "But this Old Testament phraseology, used at first with a lower reference, is, when viewed in the light of a loftier and more comprehensive kingdom of God, equally adapted to express the most spiritual conceptions of the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The enemies of 'man' are his sins, his carnal propensities, his lusts, and the great adversary Satan and his angels, who continually seek to destroy him." 
2. "From 'these' the Messiah came to save us." 
3. "The hand - The power; or to save us from them."

### John Calvin:
1. "Unquestionably, Zacharias was well aware, that the principal war of the church of God is not with flesh and blood, but with Satan and all his armament, by which he labors to accomplish our everlasting ruin."
2. "Our attention is also directed to the miserable condition of men out of Christ, lying prostrate under the tyranny of the devil: otherwise, out of his hand, out of his power, Christ would not deliver his own people."
