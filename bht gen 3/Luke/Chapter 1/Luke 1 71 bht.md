## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is not a word in this noble burst of divine song about his own child; like Elisabeth losing sight entirely of self, in the glory of a Greater than both."
2. "Lord God of Israelâ€”the ancient covenant God of the peculiar people."
3. "In the Old Testament, God is said to 'visit' chiefly for judgment, in the New Testament for mercy. Zacharias would, as yet, have but imperfect views of such 'visiting and redeeming,' 'saving from and delivering out of the hand of enemies'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The enemies of 'man' are his sins, his carnal propensities, his lusts, and the great adversary Satan and his angels, who continually seek to destroy him." 
2. "From 'these' the Messiah came to save us." 
3. "The hand - The power; or to save us from them."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this reason he states more fully the purpose for which the horn of salvation was raised up: that believers may obtain salvation from their enemies."
2. "Though the Church is also attacked by outward foes, and is delivered from them by Christ, yet, as the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, it is chiefly to Satan, the prince of this world, and all his legions, that the present discourse relates."
3. "This passage reminds us that, so long as the Church continues her pilgrimage in the world, she lives amongst her foes, and would be exposed to their violence, if Christ were not always at hand to grant assistance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That political deliverance was in the mind of Zacharias cannot be doubted, but certainly not that alone." 
2. "But he chiefly prizes this political liberation as the means to a higher end, the reformation of Divine worship."
3. "Salvation from our enemies... expresses the same thought."

### John Gill:
1. "That we should be saved from our enemies... that they should be saved by him from their enemies." 
2. "From sin, which wars against the soul, and threatens the destruction of it; from Satan, the avowed and implacable adversary of mankind; from the world, the seed of the serpent, which has always bore an enmity to the seed of the woman; from the law, the killing letter; and from death, the last enemy that is to be destroyed."
3. "And from the hand of all that hate us:... and designs the same as before."
