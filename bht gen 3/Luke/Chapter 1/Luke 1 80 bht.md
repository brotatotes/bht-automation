# Luke 1:80 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John, the son of Zacharias and Elisabeth, dwelt in the deserts, away from the influence of the rabbis and alone with God. In the solitude, he grew in stature of body and increased in wisdom and fortitude in his soul. This temporary retirement was a preparation for his public ministry, a time for calm reflection, rest, and communion with God. When the time came, John presented himself before his nation as the forerunner of the Messiah, opening his official life with strength and spirit. His life, like Moses in the desert, was being educated for his high vocation.
