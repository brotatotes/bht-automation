# Luke 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord, in a lordly act, appointed seventy others to go before Him and proclaim His message, just as the seventy elders of Israel were selected in the wilderness. The purpose of this temporary mission was to prepare the people for His coming and to supplement the work of the Twelve. Jesus Himself would follow after them to investigate the work done and visit the various places. This appointment was not intended to train them like the Twelve, but to be a pioneer ministry, proclaiming the good news of salvation and preparing the way for His final entry into Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the Lordâ€”a becoming title here, as this appointment was an act truly lordly [BENGEL]." 
2. "others (also in number), seventy; probably with allusion to the seventy elders of Israel on whom the Spirit descended in the wilderness (Numbers 11:24; Numbers 11:25)." 
3. "The mission, unlike that of the Twelve, was evidently quite temporary. All the instructions are in keeping with a brief and hasty pioneering mission, intended to supply what of general preparation for coming events the Lord's own visit afterwards to the same 'cities and places' would not, from want of time, now suffice to accomplish."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostles were to be with him; to hear his instructions...that they might 'then' go and proclaim all these things to the world."
2. "The seventy were sent out to preach immediately, and chiefly where he himself was about to come. They were appointed for a temporary object."
3. "Our Lord in this showed the propriety of having 'a religious friend,' who would be a confidant and help. Every Christian, and especially every Christian minister, needs such a friend."

2. "Others were sent in greater numbers, as secondary heralds, to spread universally in every place the report of Christâ€™s coming."
3. "He does not give them authority as judges, but only commands them to go before him, that he may possess the sole power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The chief purpose was not to train them, as in the case of the Twelve, but actually to prepare the people in these places for His coming."
2. "The whole was a final appeal, and also a preparation for the final entry into Jerusalem."
3. "That our Lord should follow and actually visit thirty-five places is not remarkable, in view of His great and constant activity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To show forth, display, proclaim, appoint."
2. "What earthly objection can there be to two similar missions?"

### John Gill:
