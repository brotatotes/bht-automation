## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sodom sank through its vile pollutions: but the doom of otherwise correct persons who, amidst a blaze of light, reject the Saviour, shall be less endurable than that of any of these."
2. "The doom of otherwise correct persons who, amidst a blaze of light, reject the Saviour, shall be less endurable than that of any of these."
3. "The doom of otherwise correct persons who reject the Saviour shall be less endurable than that of any other."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  More tolerable (Œ±ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÑŒøœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ). Comparative of the verbal adjective Œ±ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ from Œ±ŒΩŒµœáŒøŒºŒ±. An old adjective, but only the comparative in the N.T. and in this phrase (Matthew 10:15; Matthew 11:22; Matthew 11:24; Luke 10:12; Luke 10:14). 


### John Gill:
1. "By 'that day' is meant, the famous day to come, the last day; the day of judgment"
2. "Though the iniquities of Sodom and Gomorrha were very great, and their punishment very exemplary; yet, as there will be degrees of torment in hell, the case of such a city, which has been favoured with the Gospel, and has despised and rejected it, will be much worse than the case of those cities, which were devoured by fire from heaven."
3. "The case of such a city... will be much worse than... that of the inhabitants of them in the future judgment, and to all eternity."
