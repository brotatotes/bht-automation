# Luke 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples are overflowing with astonishment and joy as they realize the power they possess through their connection with Christ. They acknowledge that such power was not expressly given to them like the Twelve, surpassing their expectations and filling them with an unimagined superiority to the forces of evil. The demons being subject to them is merely one sign of the conflict between Christ and Satan that every preacher encounters in their work. This extraordinary authority symbolizes the evangelization of every nation on earth, going beyond the restoration of the twelve tribes of Israel.
