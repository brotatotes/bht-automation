## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The same has been said of their occurrence in Matt. xi. 25; and, from no love of harmonizing or escaping difficulties, but from a deep feeling of the inner spirit of both discourses, I am convinced that our Lord did utter, on the two separate occasions, these weighty words."
2. "It was not a rejoicing before (in Matthew), but only a confession: compare the whole discourse and notes."
3. "That the introductory words in that hour, or 'at that time,' may have been introduced from one passage into the other, and perhaps by some one who imagined them the same, I would willingly grant, if needful; not that, in the presence of such truths, such a trifle is worth mention, but that the shallow school of modern critics do mention, and rest upon such."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Rejoice" is too weak a word. It is "exulted in spirit"â€”evidently giving visible expression to His unusual emotions; while, at the same time, the words "in spirit" are meant to convey to the reader the depth of them.
2. This is one of those rare cases in which the veil is lifted from off the Redeemer's inner man, that, angel-like, we may "look into it" for a moment. Let us gaze on it with reverential wonder.
3. as we perceive what it was that produced that mysterious ecstasy, we shall find rising in our hearts a still raptureâ€”"Oh, the depths!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Rejoiced. See on 1 Peter 1:6." 
2. "In spirit. The best texts add tw aJgiw, the holy, and render in the Holy Spirit." 
3. "I thank. See on Matthew 11:25."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The one hour of joy was in sympathy with His faithful preachers."
2. "We have here a remarkable grouping of the Three Persons of the Trinity."
3. "The important truth respecting our Lordâ€™s relation to the Father, here set forth, underlies all the Gospels."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This holy joy of Jesus was directly due to the Holy Spirit. It is joy in the work of his followers, their victories over Satan..."
2. "Intellectual gifts, so far from being necessary, are often a hindrance."

### John Gill:
1. "His heart was filled with joy, not so much at the success of the seventy disciples, and the subjection of the devils to them, as in the view he had of the spread of the Gospel."
2. "Particularly at the sovereign and distinguishing grace of God towards the elect, whose names are written in heaven."
3. "His soul was so affected, that he broke out in, an exulting strain, into thanksgivings to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Lord of heaven and earth â€” In both of which thy kingdom stands, and that of Satan is destroyed."
2. "He rejoiced not in the destruction of the wise and prudent, but in the display of the riches of God's grace to others, in such a manner as reserves to Him the entire glory of our salvation, and hides pride from man."
3. "Matthew 11:25."
