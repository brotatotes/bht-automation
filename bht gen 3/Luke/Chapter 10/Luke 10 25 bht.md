# Luke 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A lawyer stood up and tried to tempt Jesus by asking him how to inherit eternal life. Jesus redirected the lawyer back to the Law, asking him how he interpreted it. The lawyer's motive may not have been hostile, but rather a desire to hear of some grand deed or to see what insight the Galilean teacher had. It seems the lawyer was expecting Jesus to mention something new or great, but Jesus emphasized the need for the lawyer to understand the Law and put it into practice.
