# Luke 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus challenges the lawyer's understanding by asking him how he reads the law, implying that his expertise should inform his answer. By referring to the law, Jesus seeks to reveal the requirements of a righteous life and to show the lawyer the need for a better righteousness. This comparison between our own flawed righteousness and the righteousness of Christ leads us to recognize our need for God's mercy and grace. Thus, our justification is not based on our own works but on the righteousness freely offered by God.
