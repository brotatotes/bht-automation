# Luke 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The answer was correct so far as the words went. Of course, if he kept the law perfectly always, he would inherit eternal life. True in all cases: any one who can and does love God and his neighbor thus, has already begun to live, has an earnest of eternal life. The parable which follows is but an explanation of how much is meant by 'this.' Like the Sermon on the Mount, it is an exposition of the law and a preparation for the gospel, but not the gospel itself.

- Attempt 3 BHT: The answer was correct if one could keep the law perfectly. But no one can. Eternal life is obtained through loving God and one's neighbor, and those who do so have already begun to experience true life. The parable that follows further explains the depth of this love. It is important to understand that the law shows us the righteousness required, but no person can be justified by their works. Ultimately, it is through love for God and others that one will truly live forever.

- Attempt 4 BHT: The lawyer's answer was correct in theory, but the reality is that no one can perfectly keep the law and earn eternal life. The parable following this exchange reveals the depth of what it means to truly love God and one's neighbor. The law serves as a guide, but justification does not come through works alone. It is through genuine love for God and others that true life is found. This love is a central theme throughout the Bible, illustrating that it is through this love that we experience eternal life.

- Attempt 5 BHT: The answer was correct in acknowledging the significance of keeping the law for eternal life. However, it is impossible for humans to fulfill the requirements of the law completely. True life is attained through genuine love for God and one's neighbor, which is exemplified in the parable that follows. The law serves as a guideline, but it is weak due to human limitations. The law teaches how righteousness can be obtained, yet no one is justified by works alone. Eternal life is found in loving God and others sincerely in the present life.
