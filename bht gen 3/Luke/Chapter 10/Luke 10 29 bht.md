# Luke 10:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Questioning with a desire to justify himself, the man asked Jesus, Who is my neighbor? The Jews narrowly interpreted neighbor to exclude Samaritans and Gentiles. Jesus aimed to awaken the man's conscience to his own sinfulness and his departure from the law. While not directly hostile, the man's question revealed a half-awakened conscience and a self-righteous attempt to define neighbor according to his own standards. However, Jesus used a parable in response to challenge this mindset and teach the true meaning of being a neighbor.
