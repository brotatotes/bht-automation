- Attempt 1 BHT: A man who fell victim to robbers, as he traveled from Jerusalem to Jericho‚Äîa dangerous and lawless road known for its infamy‚Äîwas stripped of all he had and left half-dead. It was not until a despised Samaritan, breaking boundaries and defying prejudice, arrived on the scene that kindness and compassion were shown. The priest and Levite, who represented the religious establishment, had failed to extend help to their fellow countryman, while the Samaritan, with no regard for the man's race or condition, proved to be the true neighbor, stepping forward with care and genuine concern. This parable conveys a profound message about the obligation we have as humans to love and assist one another, regardless of social or cultural differences. Our call is to embrace a deep sense of humanity and philanthropy, acknowledging that even the stranger is our neighbor, and that we are all interconnected by a mutual bond of support and compassion.
