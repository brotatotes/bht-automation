3. "The Levite in verse Luke 10:32 behaved precisely as the priest had done and for the same reason."

### John Gill:
1. "Nor was this a chance matter with respect to God, by whose providence all things are ordered, directed, and governed; nor any wonderful thing with respect to men, which fell out in an uncommon way, beyond expectation; the phrase only signifies, that so it came to pass."
2. "when he saw him naked, and in such a bloody condition, he might take him for one really dead, and therefore crossed the way on purpose, lest he should any ways touch him, and be defiled by him, and so break the law, and incur the penalty of it"
3. "or rather, through hardness of heart, and want of compassion."

1. "For if we speak strictly, there is no such thing in the universe as either chance or fortune."
2. "Is it not an emblem of many living characters, perhaps of some who bear the sacred office?"
3. "O house of Levi and of Aaron, is not the day coming, when the virtues of heathens and Samaritans will rise up in judgment against you?"
