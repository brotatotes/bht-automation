# Luke 10:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the road to Jericho, a priest and a Levite both passed by a man who had been robbed and beaten, unwilling to help him. This was not an accident; they deliberately chose to ignore the injured man, demonstrating the misguided prioritization of religious rituals over acts of mercy. They were more concerned with maintaining their ritual cleanliness than with fulfilling the commandment to show compassion to others. Their actions serve as a powerful reminder for us today not to prioritize religious traditions and rules at the expense of showing love and kindness to those in need.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Many priests journeyed this way, for Jericho was a priestly city."
2. "The Law and Prophets enjoined the act of mercy which this priest refused."
3. "He did not even go up to him to examine him, but passed by on the opposite side of the road."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two here mentioned are supposed, apparently, to be returning from temple duties, but they had not learnt what that meaneth, 'I will have mercy and not sacrifice'." 
2. "It was not inadvertently that he acted." 
3. "Although the law expressly required the opposite treatment even of the beast not only of their brethren, but of their enemy."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "When he saw him - He saw him lie, but came not near him."
3. "Passed by on the other side - On the farther side of the way. Did not turn out of his course even to come and see him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By chance [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÉœÖŒ≥Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒ±ŒΩ] . Only here in New Testament. The word means, literally, a coincidence. By coincidence of circumstances."
2. "The Talmudists said that there were almost as many priests at Jericho as at Jerusalem."
3. "Passed by on the other side [Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπœÄŒ±œÅŒ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ]. The verb occurs only here and ver. 32."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The naturalness of the parable is remarkable."
3. "Did not even stop to examine the man‚Äôs condition. In the priest‚Äôs case, pride seems prominent."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By chance (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÉœÖŒ≥Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒ±ŒΩ). Here only in the N.T., meaning rather, 'by way of coincidence.' It is a rare word elsewhere and in late writers like Hippocrates."
2. "Passed by on the other side (Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπœÄŒ±œÅŒ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ). Second aorist active indicative of Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπœÄŒ±œÅŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒ±, a late double compound here (verses Luke 10:31; Luke 10:32) only in the N.T., but in the papyri and late writers."
3. "A vivid and powerful picture of the vice of Jewish ceremonial cleanliness at the cost of moral principle and duty."

### John Gill:
1. "Nor was this a chance matter with respect to God, by whose providence all things are ordered, directed, and governed; nor any wonderful thing with respect to men, which fell out in an uncommon way, beyond expectation; the phrase only signifies, that so it came to pass."
2. "when he saw him naked, and in such a bloody condition, he might take him for one really dead, and therefore crossed the way on purpose, lest he should any ways touch him, and be defiled by him, and so break the law, and incur the penalty of it."
3. "or to shun so horrible a sight; or rather, through hardness of heart, and want of compassion."

### John Wesley:
1. "For if we speak strictly, there is no such thing in the universe as either chance or fortune."
2. "Is it not an emblem of many living characters, perhaps of some who bear the sacred office?"
3. "O house of Levi and of Aaron, is not the day coming, when the virtues of heathens and Samaritans will rise up in judgment against you?"
