# Luke 10:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Levite, an inferior minister of the law, seemed to go even farther than the priest in coming near to the wounded man and observing his condition before passing by. While the priest had specific duties in the temple, the Levite's role was to render assistance to the priests. It is clear that the Levite's actions fell short of showing mercy. This reminds us that under the law, no mercy can be expected, and even under the Gospel, an imperfect obedience cannot justify us in the sight of God.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Levite, an inferior minister of the law, seemed to go even farther than the priest in approaching the wounded man, observing his condition, and then passing by without offering any assistance. While the priest had specific duties in the temple, the Levite's role was to render assistance to the priests in their services. Although some suggest that the Levite looked on the wounded man more attentively but still did nothing to help, it is clear that his actions fell short of showing mercy. This passage reminds us that under the law, no mercy can be expected, and even under the Gospel, an imperfect obedience cannot justify us in the sight of God.
