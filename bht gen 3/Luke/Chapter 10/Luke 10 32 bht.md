# Luke 10:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Levite, an inferior minister of the law, did even worse than the priest as he came and looked at the wounded man but still did nothing to help him. This suggests that the Levite's duty as a helper to the priest did not include showing compassion or providing assistance. The law, represented by the Levite, falls short in offering relief, healing, and life to a wounded and dead soul. It ministers condemnation and death rather than justification, pardon, or atonement for sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### John Gill:
1. "No relief is to be had from thence, for a naked, wounded, and dead man; no robe of righteousness to cover a naked soul."
2. "Nor is there any healing by it to a wounded conscience; there is no pity from it, no justification by it, no pardon through it, no expiation or atonement of sin, by obedience to it."
3. "Much less can it give life to a dead sinner: spiritual life is not communicated by it, nor can eternal life, or any true hope of it, be attained through it; it is so far from it, that it is the killing letter, and the ministration of condemnation and death."
