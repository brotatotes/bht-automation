### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Samaritans were the most inveterate foes of the Jews... It was this fact which rendered the conduct of this good man so striking."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was admirably well judged to represent the distress on the side of the Jew, and the mercy on that of the Samaritan."
2. "Self interest would make the very scribe sensible, how amiable such a conduct was, and would lay him open to our Lord's inference."
