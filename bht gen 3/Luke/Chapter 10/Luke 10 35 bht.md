## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 35. two pence‚Äîequal to two
	day's wages of a laborer, and enough for several days' support.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Two pence - About 27 cents, or 1 shilling, 2d. This may seem a small sum, but we are to remember that that sum was probably ten times as valuable then as now." 
2. "It would purchase ten times as much food and the common necessaries of life as the same sum would now."
3. "It is probable that all the man wanted was 'attention' and kindness, and for all these it was the purpose of the Samaritan to pay when he returned."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Two pence. About thirty - five cents. See on Matthew 20:2. 
I will repay. The I is expressed [ŒµŒ≥œâ] , and is emphatic. Trouble him not for the reckoning; I will repay.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The value of the ‚Äòdenarius‚Äô has been variously estimated, from seven and a half to eight and a half pence English (fifteen to seventeen cents). The sum was sufficient to meet the man‚Äôs necessities for some days at least."
2. "This is emphatic."
3. "It has been inferred from this that the Samaritan was a travelling merchant, who would soon return."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Took out (ŒµŒ∫Œ≤Œ±ŒªœâŒΩ). Second aorist active participle of ŒµŒ∫Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒªœâ. It could mean, 'fling out,' but probably only means 'drew out.' Common verb."
2. "Two pence (Œ¥œÖŒø Œ¥Œ∑ŒΩŒ±œÅŒπŒ±). About thirty-five cents, but worth more in purchasing power."
3. "I will repay (ŒµŒ≥Œø Œ±œÄŒøŒ¥œâœÉœâ). Emphatic. What he had paid was merely by way of pledge. He was a man of his word and known to the innkeeper as reliable."

### John Gill:
1. "leaves him, though in good hands; as Christ does his people, to learn to live by faith upon him."
2. "the gifts and graces of the Spirit of God... are given for the benefit and advantage of the Lord's people, and in an eminent manner by Christ."
3. "faithful ministers spend much, and are at great expense in taking care of the souls of men... and in the loss of reputation and credit, and of health, and sometimes of life itself."
