2. "And as He took on Him the nature of us all, being â€˜not ashamed to call us brethren,â€™ counting us all His kindred,â€”so it is but natural that in holding up a mirror (for such is a parable) of the truth in this matter of duty, we should see in it not only the present and prominent group, but also Himself and His act of mercy behind."
3. "The good Samaritan, Him of whom it was lately said, 'Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?'â€”who came to bind up the broken-hearted, to give them the oil of joy for mourning."

1. "He that showed mercy - His 'Jewish' prejudice would not permit him 'to name' the Samaritan, but there was no impropriety, even in his view, in saying that the man who showed so much mercy was really the neighbor to the afflicted, and not he who 'professed' to be his neighbor, but who would 'do nothing' for his welfare."
