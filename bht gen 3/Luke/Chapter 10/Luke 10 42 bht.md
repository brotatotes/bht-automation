# Luke 10:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary chose the good portion, the one thing needed - to feed on the bread of life through faith. Unlike Martha's restless busyness, Mary humbly sat at Jesus' feet and learned from Him. While an active Christian life is important, it is the excessive pursuit of unnecessary things that is criticized. The good part, Mary's choice, would never be taken away from her, unlike the temporary concerns of this present life. Have you also chosen the good portion of fellowship with Jesus?

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The good portion is the one thing which is needfulâ€”see John vi. 53,â€”the feeding on the bread of life by faith; which faith cometh by hearing, hearing by the word of Christ, which Mary was now receiving into her soul, and which (John vi. 54) shall never be taken away, but result in ever-lasting life."
2. "The two types of character have ever been found in the Church; both, caring for Him, and for love to Him doing what they do: but the one busy and restless, anxious, and stirring; the other quiet and humble, content to sit at His feet and learn."
3. "But on the other hand we must not derive any argument hence against an active Christian life of doing good: this is, in fact, to sit at His feet and learnâ€”to take His yoke on us, and learn of Him. It is the bustling about the many things of which there is no need, which is blamed; not the working out the fruits of the Spirit, which are needful, being parts themselves of the good part."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Short work and little of it suffices for Me" is not so much the lower sense of these weighty words, as supposed in them, as the basis of something far loftier than any precept on economy.
2. "One thing, c." - the littleness both of elaborate preparation for the present life and of that life itself, compared with another.
3. "Mary's choice would be taken from her, for her services would die with her; Mary's never, being spiritual and eternal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Other things are of little importance. This should be secured first, and then all other things will be added."
2. "The cares of this life are dangerous, even when they seem to be most lawful and commendable."
3. "Piety is the chief thing needed. Other things will perish. We shall soon die. All that we can gain we must leave. But the 'soul' will live."

### John Calvin:
1. "In a word, we do but wander to no purpose, if we do not direct all our actions to a fixed object."
2. "Mary is engaged in a holy and profitable employment, in which she ought not to be disturbed."
3. "The good part, or, as he explains it, 'the holy and profitable employment,' shall not be taken from her."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A few authorities omit: â€˜and troubled about many thingsâ€™ and this clause also; a number of others read here: â€˜of few things, or of one.â€™"
2. "For Mary hath chosen the good part, etc. Maryâ€™s choice proved what the â€˜one thingâ€™ was, and that anxiety about the â€˜manyâ€™ others was unnecessary."
3. "The possession of this â€˜partâ€™ is eternal. Both of these women loved the Saviour; Martha is not the type of a worldly woman, nor is the â€˜one thingâ€™ conversion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The best dish on the table, fellowship with Jesus."
2. "Salvation is not 'the good portion' for Martha had that also."
3. "Jesus pointedly takes Mary's side against Martha's fussiness."

### John Gill:
1. "Ordinarily speaking, [hearing the word] is necessary to the knowledge of Christ, and salvation by Him, and to faith in Him." 
2. "Christ's meaning seems plainly to be, that Mary hearing the word from his mouth, and at his feet, was one necessary thing, in opposition to Martha's many unnecessary ones."
3. "The part she chose is, that which shall not be taken away from her; by men or devils: faith which comes by hearing of the word, and so every other grace of the Spirit is what can never be lost."

### John Wesley:
1. Mary hath chosen the good part â€” To save her soul. Reader, hast thou?
