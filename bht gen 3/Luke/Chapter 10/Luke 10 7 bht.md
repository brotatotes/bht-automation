# Luke 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When entering a house, it is important to be cautious about interpreting it as the same house. The disciples should recognize the worth of their work and the reward they receive. They are instructed to remain in the house itself, not going from house to house, to avoid wasting time and seeking better accommodations. Instead, they are to accept what is given to them, sharing the things provided by those they encounter. This is not about accepting different types of food, but rather about embracing the generosity of others without burdening them with constant movement.

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Go not from house to house, i.e., in search of ease and better entertainment, or for gossip‚Äôs sake."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In that same house (ŒµŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒ∑ œÑŒ∑ ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ±). Literally, in the house itself, not 'in the same house' (ŒµŒΩ œÑŒ∑ Œ±œÖœÑŒ∑ ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ±), a different construction." 
2. "Such things as they give (œÑŒ± œÄŒ±œÅ' Œ±œÖœÑœâŒΩ). 'The things from them.'"

### John Gill:
1. "What you eat and drink is your due; what you ought to have; your diet is a debt, and not a gratuity." 
2. "Go not from house to house; as if fickle and inconstant, as if not satisfied with your lodging and entertainment, and as seeking out for other and better, or as if burdensome where they were."
3. "He that goes, 'from house to house', (loses his) shirt, (i.e. comes to distress and poverty,) from place to place (his) life; or he is in great danger of losing his life."

### John Wesley:
