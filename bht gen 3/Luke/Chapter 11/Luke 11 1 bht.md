# Luke 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were intrigued by Jesus' prayers, as they had never heard John teach them to address God as Our Father. Jesus, seeing their curiosity, shared with them the essence of the Model Prayer, though in a shorter form, emphasizing the continuous act of giving. This prayer was not intended to be a ritual, as there is no evidence of Jesus prescribing a specific form. The disciples were likely drawn to Jesus' prayerful habits, possibly on the mountains or the Mount of Olives.
