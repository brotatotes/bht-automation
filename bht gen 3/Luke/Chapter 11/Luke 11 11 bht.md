# Luke 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, it is expected that you would not give him a stone; in the same way, if he asks for a fish, you would not offer him a serpent. This illustration provided by Jesus shows the absurdity and cruelty of a parent who would deny their child's basic needs. It is unthinkable that a loving father would intentionally harm his own child or refuse to provide for them.
