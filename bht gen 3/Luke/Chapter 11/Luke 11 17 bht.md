# Luke 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A house divided against itself falleth, a graphic picture of what happens when a kingdom is divided against itself. Jesus knew that they were trying to tempt him and saw their thoughts, just as Matthew records in his Gospel. The divided kingdom, like a family in which one part is opposed to the other, brings desolation and ruin to everyone involved. Just as one tumbling house knocks down its neighbor, a kingdom divided against itself is brought to ruin and desolation, like the kingdom of Satan would be if there was a division within it.
