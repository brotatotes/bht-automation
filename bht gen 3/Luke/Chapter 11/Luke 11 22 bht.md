# Luke 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ holds a glorious title in relation to Satan as he has gained the victory and regained his lost power by taking away Satan's armor, his tempting arsenal. Neutrality in religion is nonexistent, as the absence of attachment to Christ involves hostility to him. Through his triumph over Satan's cunning tactics, Christ has spoiled Satan's domain, the hearts and souls of humanity, liberating them from his dominion. He has given his people the power to resist and overcome, triumphing over the enemy in the wilderness, on the cross, and in conversion.

2. "He taketh from him all his armour, wherein he trusted; as his temptations, which he himself repelled in the wilderness, and wrenched out of his hands, and made them useless, and he gives power to his people to resist them, and succours them under them, and delivers them out of them."
3. "He spoils his house, the heart of man, from being any longer a palace for him, and his goods, his mind and conscience, which are enlightened and awakened, and purged; or by his spoils are meant, the souls of men; which are taken as a prey out of his hands, and become trophies of victorious grace."
