### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who are not connected to Christ in their religious practices will ultimately come to nothing, as whatever is disconnected from Him lacks true significance. This idea is reinforced by the parallel verse in Matthew 12:30, which states, He that is not with me, is against me. In this context, not being with Christ means being against Him, as those who do not gather with Him scatter. Thus, anyone who hinders others from coming to Christ and participating in His ministry is deemed as working against Him.
