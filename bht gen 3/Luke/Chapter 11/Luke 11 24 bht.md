### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When an unclean spirit is expelled from a person, it wanders aimlessly, searching for a new place to reside. This spirit seeks to bring chaos and destruction, much like the goat-shaped goblins that were worshipped in Egyptian culture. In its wanderings, the unclean spirit finds no rest and decides to return to its previous home. This spirit can be likened to Lilith, the demonic figure who left Adam and became a child-murdering demon haunting deserted areas. Just as a person who has expelled the unclean spirit must be vigilant in preventing its return, so too must one guard against the return of darkness and evil in their life, for once expelled, these forces will seek to re-enter.
