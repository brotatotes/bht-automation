# Luke 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a person is freed from an evil spirit, if that spirit finds no place to rest, it may return with even more wicked spirits and set up residence again. In this way, the last state of that person becomes worse than it was before. This serves as a metaphor for the evil heart of humanity, capable of becoming a dwelling place for devils and foul spirits. Such was the fate of the wicked generation, driven by their own ruin and possessed by legions of devils.
