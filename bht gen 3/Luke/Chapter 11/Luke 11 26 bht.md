- Attempt 1 BHT: When an unclean spirit is cast out of a person, it taketh spirits, seven of them, which not only reveals the increasing wickedness of the spirits, but also implies that they find comfort and settle down in the empty space within the person. The verse suggests that the last state of a person from whom the unclean spirit is cast out can become worse than the initial state, just like the wicked generation that Jesus refers to. It serves as a warning not only to the Jews who rejected Jesus, but also to anyone who apostatizes from the true faith and falls into deeper darkness.
