## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In truth. He does not deny the honour hereby pronounced upon His mother, but beautifully turns it to its true sideâ€”viz. that which was given her long sinceâ€”blessed is she that believed." 
2. "Her blessedness consisted not so much in being His mother, as in her lowly and faithful observance of the word of the Lord spoken to her."
3. "It will be seen that this answer cuts at the root of all worship of Mary, and shews us in what the true honour of that holy woman consisted,â€”in faith and obedience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ground of her blessedness, as in the case of all the human race, unto whom in the highest sense, 'a child is born, a son is given,' is that she too belonged to them that hear the word of God and keep it."
2. "This woman truly represents devout Roman Catholics in their Adoration of the Virgin. The Ave Maria, as they use it, is but a repetition of her words; and their religious enthusiasm too often manifests the same unintelligent wonder, which is here kindly reproved by our Lord."
3. "His answer gives prominence not to His own word, but to 'the word of God;' for though they are the same, the woman was thinking solely of His human birth, and not of His heavenly Father; and this mistake He would correct."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The originality of Christ's reply guarantees its historical character."
2. "Such a comment is beyond the reach of an inventor."

### John Gill:
1. "Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it; intimating, that though his mother was happy in bearing and suckling such a son, yet it was a far greater happiness to hear the word of God."
2. "This is a greater happiness than to be related to Christ in the flesh, though ever so nearly."
3. "Barely to hear the word, and even give an assent to it, will be of little avail, unless what is heard and believed is put in practice."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it." 
2. "For if even she that bare him had not done this, she would have forfeited all her blessedness."
