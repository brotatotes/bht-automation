# Luke 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowds were seeking a sign, just as the people of Nineveh had received a sign through Jonah's preaching.

Luke's account is shorter than Matthew's, but both emphasize the crowd's eagerness for a sign. Jesus warns that this is an evil and adulterous generation that seeks signs beyond what has already been given.
