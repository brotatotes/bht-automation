# Luke 11:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rejection of Christ's preaching of repentance will have more severe consequences than the Jews' failure to appreciate His wisdom. The repentance of the Ninevites at the preaching of Jonah stands as a witness against the Jews' persistent unbelief, despite having the Son of God Himself and His apostles among them. Their condemnation is intensified by their familiarity with religion and their refusal to repent, leading to their eventual destruction after a period of reprieve.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Jonah here is used as equivalent to the sign of Jonah, so that more applies to Him who is the sign to this generation: a sign, greater, both in its actuality, its significance, and its consequences." 
2. "The order, here, seems to be for the sake of climax." 
3. "The rejection of His preaching of repentance will lie heavier on them in the judgment than the undervaluing and not appreciating His wisdom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall rise up...the meaning is, shall appear as witness." 
2. "Hence Rev., stand up."
3. "Preaching...The proclamation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If these Ninevites had not heard of the miracle, the contrast is even stronger. For in that case their repentance was simply at the preaching of Jonah, while the Jews remained unbelieving in the face of Christ‚Äôs resurrection as well as His preaching."
2. "There is a climax in the order of Luke; the greater sin was the rejection of Christ‚Äôs preaching of repentance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "At the preaching of Jonah (ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø Œ∫Œ∑œÅœÖŒ≥ŒºŒ± ŒôœâŒΩŒ±). Note this use of ŒµŒπœÇ as in Matthew 10:41; Matthew 12:41."
2. "Luke inserts the words about the Queen of the South (Luke 11:31) in between the discussion of Jonah (verses Luke 11:29; Luke 11:32)."
3. "Both Œ£ŒøŒªŒøŒºœâŒΩŒøœÇ (Luke 11:31) and ŒôœâŒΩŒ± (verse Luke 11:32) are in the ablative case after the comparative œÄŒªŒµŒπŒøŒΩ (more, something more)."

### John Gill:
1. "For they repented at the preaching of Jonas, and behold a greater than Jonas is here." 
2. "What in this case will aggravate the condemnation of the Jews in the day of judgment is that these men were Heathens, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, and were not used to have prophets sent to them." 
3. "The Jews, who had a better notion of religion, and who, though they had the Son of God himself among them, and preached to them, and that many sermons, and whose ministry was confirmed by miracles, and afterwards his apostles for a course of years, had yet remained impenitent and unbelieving."

### John Wesley:
1. "They repented at the preaching of Jonah ‚Äî But it was only for a season."
2. "Afterward they relapsed into wickedness, till (after about forty years) they were destroyed."
3. "God reprieved the Jews for about forty years; but they still advanced in wickedness, till having filled up their measure, they were destroyed with an utter destruction."
