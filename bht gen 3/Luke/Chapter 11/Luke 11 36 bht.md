# Luke 11:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the soul is single, straight, and single-seeing, without prejudice or selfish lusts, it becomes wholly illuminated by the teachings of God. This illuminating truth is emphasized, comparing it to the bright shining of a candle or a flash of lightning. Only when the whole body is filled with this light can one be in a normal condition of light, with no darkened corners, sin, or folly. In this state, the Gospel brings light and joy to every aspect of one's being, shedding its light into all our powers and faculties.
