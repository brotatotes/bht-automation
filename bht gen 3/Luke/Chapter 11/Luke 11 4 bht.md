# Luke 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the plea for divine forgiveness is emphasized even more strongly than in Matthew. It highlights the importance of forgiveness between individuals, acknowledging that there is no sin but rather the ordinary word of this world. We pray for God to protect us from the power of our own evil desires, to keep us from being drawn away by our own lusts. We seek forgiveness, recognizing that it is not about forgiving sins, but about fulfilling our obligations to one another. It is the removal of the hindrance that would make forgiveness impossible.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "expressed here more strongly than in Matthew, as the plea for the exercise of the divine forgiveness to us" 
2. "there is no sin in this second case, between man and man, only the ordinary business word of this world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God also sends trials to prove and chasten us; but something may change the salutary power of trial into the corrupting power of evil solicitation; and that something, as James tells us (i. 14), is our own evil desire."
2. "We pray, therefore, 'suffer us not to be drawn away by our own lusts: keep us out of the power of our own evil hearts.'"
3. "To pray that God will not bring us within the possibility of temptation, would be to ignore our manhood, or to pray to be taken out of the world. But we may pray, and will surely pray, the more keenly conscious we become of the weakness of our nature, that God will not suffer the trials of life to become temptations to evil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For we ourselves also forgive, 'this is our own practice.' More strongly expressed than in Matthew."
2. "We cannot forgive 'sins,' as such, that belongs to God; but only as obligations from man to man represented by the commercial phrase 'indebted."

### John Gill:
1. "The three first petitions are word for word the same; for though the third petition is different in our translation, it is the same in the original." 
2. "And these verbal variations, though the sense is the same, together with the omission of the doxology, and the word 'Amen', show, that this prayer was not designed to be an exact form, and to be so used, but as a directory of prayer."
3. "To which may be added, that though there is an agreement between the petitions, as used by the Jews, and those our Lord directs to; yet there are some variations and alterations much for the better, which destroy the form of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Forgive us; for we forgive them â€” Not once, but continually."
2. "This does not denote the meritorious cause of our pardon; but the removal of that hinderance which otherwise would render it impossible."
3. "The removal of that hinderance which otherwise would render it impossible."
