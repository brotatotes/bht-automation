# Luke 11:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who made the outside also made the inside, so why focus solely on cleansing the external when the internal also needs to be purified? Simply washing the outer surface of a cup or platter while neglecting to clean the inside would be pointless. It is important to understand that true righteousness goes beyond appearances and rituals. Instead, it involves having a genuine inner transformation and a compassionate spirit towards others. Cleansing must extend to both the outward and inward aspects, for inward righteousness with a brotherly spirit leads to a truly clean and pleasing life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Did not He, who made the outside, make the inside also?"
2. "If His works have become unclean and polluted through sin, what is the use of only partially purging them?"
3. "Must not the cleansing, to be good for anything, extend to the whole?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 40. that which is without,
	&amp;c.â€”that is, He to whom belongs the outer life, and right to
	demand its subjection to Himselfâ€”is the inner man less His?


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye fools - How unwise and wicked is your conduct!"
2. "Your conduct is not merely 'foolish,' but it is a cloak for sin - designed to countenance wickedness."
3. "Did not he ... Did not God, who made the 'body,' make also the 'soul?' You Pharisees take great pains to cleanse the 'body,' under a pretence of pleasing 'God.' Did 'he' not also make the 'mind?' and is it not of as much importance that 'that' should be pure, as that the body should?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such a partial cleansing is no cleansing: all such religious acts are supposed to have reference to God, to holiness before Him."

2. "Have inward righteousness with a brotherly spirit and the outward becomes 'clean'."
3. "Properly understood, this is not irony and is not Ebionism, but good Christianity."

### John Gill:
1. "Whoever washes a cup or platter, but washes and makes clean the inside, as well as the outside?" 
2. "You who are so very careful to have your cups and platters clean, should be as careful what you put in them, that they are clean also."
3. "The purity of the [soul] should be regarded, as well as that of the [body]."
