# Luke 11:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But woe unto you, for ye tithe mint and rue and pass over judgment and the love of God. Our Lord purposely names the most trifling products of the earth, as examples of what they punctiliously exacted the tenth of, while neglecting justice and God's love. The reference is to Micah 6:6-8, where walking humbly with God encompasses both love and faith. The tendency to prioritize lesser duties over greater ones is the characteristic of hypocrites, and our Lord reminds them that they should have done both.
