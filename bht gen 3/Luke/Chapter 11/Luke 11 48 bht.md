## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole saying is a reference to 2 Chron. xxiv. 18‚Äì22, and so marked a one, that I am surprised that no Commentators but Olahausen and Stier should have observed it, and they not thoroughly."
2. "The words in our text are not indeed a citation, but an amplification of ver. 19 there‚Äîa paraphrase of them, giving the true sense of what the wisdom of God intended by them."
3. "Enlarging the mere historical notice which laid hold of God‚Äôs purpose only by one thread let down to the earth, into the divine revelation of the whole purpose of God as the counsel of His will in heaven."

2. "Ye think favorably... along with them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Consent (œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒµŒπœÑŒµ). Double compound (œÉœÖŒΩ, ŒµœÖ, Œ¥ŒøŒ∫Œµœâ), to think well along with others, to give full approval."
