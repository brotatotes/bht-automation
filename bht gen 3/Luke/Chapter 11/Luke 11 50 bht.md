## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As it was only in the last generation of them that "the iniquity of the Amorites was full" and then the abominations of ages were at once completely and awfully avenged, so the iniquity of Israel was allowed to accumulate from age to age till in that generation it came to the full, and the whole collected vengeance of Heaven broke at once over its devoted head."
2. "In the first French Revolution the same awful principle was exemplified, and Christendom has not done with it yet."
3. "prophetsâ€”in the New Testament sense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Divinely ordered sequence, first aorist passive subjunctive of ÎµÎºÎ¶Î·Ï„ÎµÏ‰, a late and rare verb outside of LXX and N.T., requiring as a debt the blood of the prophets."
2. "If the present passive is accepted, it means the blood which is perpetually shed from time to time."
3. "It is a bold metaphor for the purpose of God."

### John Gill:
1. "The blood of all the prophets,.... The same with 'all the righteous blood', or the blood of all the righteous men, in Matthew 23:35, which was shed from the foundation of the world."
2. "Abel, the son of the first man, and who was the first whose blood was shed, was not only a righteous man, but a prophet; for by the sacrifice which he offered up, he gave a prophetical hint of the sacrifice of Christ."
3. "Just as in Babylon will be found, when God makes inquisition for blood, as he sooner or later always does, the blood of the prophets and saints, and of all that are slain upon earth, ever since Rome papal has been in power."

### John Wesley:
1. The blood of all shall be required of this generation â€” That is, shall be visibly and terribly punished upon it.
