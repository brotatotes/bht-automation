# Luke 11:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders of the time took away the key of knowledge, shutting the kingdom of heaven and hindering others from entering. By substituting their wretched traditions for the true understanding of the Law and Prophets, they kept the people in ignorance. Their false interpretations of the Scriptures destroyed the true knowledge and sense of them, leading to a famine of hearing the word. This grave sin of preventing others from knowing the truth obscured and destroyed knowledge of the Messiah and barred them from entering the present kingdom of heaven.
