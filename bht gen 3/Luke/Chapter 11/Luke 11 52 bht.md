# Luke 11:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders had taken away the key of knowledge, which was a right understanding of the Law and Prophets. By substituting their own traditions and false interpretations, they shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. They refused to enter the house of knowledge themselves, locking the door and hiding the key from those who wanted to enter. This is a pitiful picture of blind leaders trying to keep others blind, falling into the pit. The key of knowledge is essential, for it is a right knowledge of God's Word that leads to eternal life.
