# Luke 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Persistence and shamelessness in prayer are highlighted here. The term importunity is considered too weak; it should mean shamelessness. It implies persisting in the face of reasonable refusals and continuing to knock and ask. The parables of Abraham's intercession for Sodom and the Syro-Phoenician woman illustrate importunate prayer. The idea is that through determined perseverance and unwavering persistence, we can move God to answer our prayers, just as a reluctant friend can be compelled to help when persistently asked.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word is too mildly rendered in the A.V. by ‚Äòimportunity.‚Äù"
2. "It should be, as in margin, shamelessness."
3. "It is presupposed here that the postulant goes on knocking and asking."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "importunity‚ÄîThe word is a strong one‚Äî"shamelessness"; persisting in the face of all that seemed reasonable, and refusing to take a denial." (Luke 11:8).
2. "His reluctance once overcome, all the claims of friendship and necessity are felt to the full." (Luke 11:8).
3. "If the churlish and self-indulgent‚Äîdeaf both to friendship and necessity‚Äîcan after a positive refusal, be won over, by sheer persistency, to do all that is needed, how much more may the same determined perseverance in prayer be expected to prevail with Him whose very nature is 'rich unto all that call upon Him'" (Luke 11:8).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Knocking 'once' would not denote 'importunity,' but it was because he 'continued' knocking." 
2. "He often causes his people long to wait. He tries their faith. He leaves them to persevere for months or years, until they 'feel' entirely their dependence on him...until they are 'prepared' to receive it."
3. "Let us first ask aright; let us see that our minds are in a proper state; let us feel our need of the blessing; let us inquire whether God has 'promised such' a blessing, and 'then' let us persevere until God gives it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A very striking word to describe persistence...Lit., shamelessness."
