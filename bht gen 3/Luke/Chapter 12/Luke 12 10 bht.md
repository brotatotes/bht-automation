- Attempt 1 BHT: The sin mentioned in this verse, which is also written about in Matthew 12:31 and Mark 3:28, is the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. It is the sin of attributing the miracles of Jesus to the power of the devil, rather than acknowledging the work of the Holy Spirit. This sin is considered unpardonable, as it rejects and resists the power of the Spirit.
