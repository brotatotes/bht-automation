## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The man was evidently not a disciple, nor preparing to be one, but some hearer in the crowd."
2. "Possibly too he had an idea that the Messias, or the great Rabbi to whom he was listening, was come to set all things right."
3. "With that feeling which we all have of the surpassing injustice of our own wrongs, broke out with this inopportune request."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Great Preacher of righteousness, help there is need of Thee in this rapacious world..."  
2. "Here am I the victim of injustice, and that from my own brother, who withholds from me my rightful share of the inheritance that has fallen to us."  
3. "The man had not the least idea that his case was not of as urgent a nature, and as worthy the attention of our Lord, as anything else He could deal with."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "From the parable which follows, it would appear that he had no 'just' claim on the inheritance, but was influenced by covetousness."
2. "Besides, if he 'had' any just claim, it might have been secured by the laws of the land."
3. "Among the Jews the older brother had two shares, or twice as much as any other child, Deuteronomy 21:17. The remainder was then equally divided among all the children."

2. "This condemns the robbery of the Pope and his clergy, who, while they give themselves out to be pastors of the Church, have dared to usurp an earthly and secular jurisdiction, which is inconsistent with their office." 
3. "Christ does not argue from the nature of the thing itself, but from his own calling. Having been appointed by the Father for a different purpose, he declares that he is not a judge, because he has received no such command."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is no evidence that he wanted more than his legal share, or that he was a younger brother, who was envious of the double portion of the first-born son. His covetousness is evident without any such conjectures."
2. "Brooding on earthly things while our Lord spoke of heavenly things; the only effect was a request for earthly things."

1. "This volunteer from the crowd draws attention to the multitude." 
2. "He wants a decision by Jesus against his brother."
3. "The law was two-thirds to the elder, one-third to the younger."

×‘×›×•×¨, 'the firstborn'; and the other, ×¤×©×•×˜, 'simple'; having no title or character."
3. "But it would be tedious to transcribe all the rules, relating to such cases."
