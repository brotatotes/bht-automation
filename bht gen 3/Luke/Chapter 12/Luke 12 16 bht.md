### John Calvin:
1. "Men do not live by their abundance... Since the life even of the richest men is taken away in a moment, what avails it that they have accumulated great wealth?"
2. "It is therefore necessary that all should immediately arouse themselves, lest, by imagining their happiness to consist in riches, they entangle themselves in the snares of covetousness."
3. "This parable shows us, first, that the present life is short and transitory. Secondly, it points out to us, that riches are of no avail for prolonging life. We must add a third... to ask from the Lord their daily bread, and to rely on his providence alone, whether they are rich or poor."

3. "The word translated 'ground', signifies a 'region', or 'country', which expresses the more, the riches of this man, that he had not a common and ordinary farm, but a whole country as it were; at least a very large part of one, and all this fruitful."
