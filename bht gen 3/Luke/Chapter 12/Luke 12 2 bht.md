# Luke 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No secret sin can remain concealed indefinitely, for everything that is hidden will eventually come to light. Therefore, it is essential to speak the truth openly and fearlessly, without attempting to cover up or hide anything. Even the most carefully concealed sins are known by God, who will bring all things into judgment and reveal the secrets of every heart. Whether in this world or the next, no sin will remain covered up; everything will be exposed.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Tis no use concealing anything, for all will one day come out." 
2. "Give free and fearless utterance then to all the truth." 
3. "For all will one day come out."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Covered up [ÏƒÏ…Î³ÎºÎµÎºÎ±Î»Ï…Î¼Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½] . Only here in New Testament : implying close concealment.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Verses Luke 12:2-9 here are parallel with Matthew 10:26-33 spoken to the Twelve on their tour of Galilee, illustrating again how often Jesus repeated his sayings unless we prefer to say that he never did so and that the Gospels have hopelessly jumbled them as to time and place."
2. "Covered up (ÏƒÏ…Î³ÎºÎµÎºÎ±Î»Ï…Î¼Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½ ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of ÏƒÏ…Î³ÎºÎ±Î»Ï…Ï€Ï„Ï‰, an old verb, but here only in the N.T., to cover up on all sides and so completely."
3. "See the passage in Matthew for discussion of details."

### John Gill:
1. "For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed... if not in this world, which is often the case, yet the last judgment, and in the world to come." 
2. "No sin, be it ever so secret or privately done, as nothing is more covered than hypocrisy, but what shall be detected sooner or later."
3. "How careful soever men may be to hide their vices from others, they are known to God; who will bring every thing into judgment, and make manifest the secrets of all hearts."
