## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By supposing merely a divine decree to be meant, without personal communication, as Grotius, Kuinoel, and Trench do, we lose the impressive part of the parable, where the manâ€™s selfishness and folly is brought into immediate contact with the solemn truth of his approaching death, which certainly our Lord intends us to contemplate."
2. "Thou fool, opposed to his worldly prudence;â€”this night, to the many years;â€”the soul in the one case, at its ease, eating, drinking, and making merry, to the soul in the other, demanded, rendered up, judged."
3. "They require thy soul] Not strictly equivalent to 'Thy soul shall be required,' as A.V.; there are those whose business it is, even the angels, the ministers of the divine purposes: see ch. vi. 38 and note."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This sudden cutting short of his career is designed to express not only the folly of building securely upon the future, but of throwing one's whole soul into what may at any moment be gone."
2. ""Thy soul shall be required of thee" is put in opposition to his own treatment of it, "I will say to my soul, Soul," &c."
3. "Compare Psalms 39:6, 'He heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If there is any supreme folly, it is this. As though riches could prolong life, or avert for a moment the approach of pain and death."
2. "In a single moment all his hopes were blasted, and his soul summoned to the bar of his long-forgotten God."
3. "Whose they may be is of little consequence to the man that lost his soul to gain them; but they are often left to heirs that dissipate them much sooner than the father procured them, and thus they secure 'their' ruin as well as his own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sometimes, also, in the sense of crazed, frantic, but never in New Testament."
2. "Whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? The Greek order puts that first which was uppermost in the rich man's thought - his accumulations."
3. "He is to be dispossessed at once. Plato relates how Pluto complained to Zeus that the souls of the dead found their way to the wrong places, because the judged have their clothes on, and evil souls are clothed in fair bodies..."

### John Calvin:
1. "The design of Christ is simply to show that the life of men, which they imagine to be strongly protected by the fortress of their riches, is every moment taken away."
2. "The rich man is thus convicted of folly, in not knowing that his life depended on another."
3. "The words, they will demand, though in the plural number, are used indefinitely, and mean nothing more than that the life of the rich man, which he imagined to be in his own power, was at the disposal of another."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thou fool, in spite of the sensible, practical thought of Luke 12:18."
2. "Thy soul, which you would have â€˜eat, drink, and be merry,â€™ is summoned where all this ceases, must be conscious of its higher nature, which, alas, now exposes it to judgment."
3. "The things which thou hast prepared, etc. 'Prepared' for thyself, they cannot be thine. Some answer: they will be for my son, my family, but observation proves the answer a folly."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou foolish one... Fool, for lack of sense." 
2. "Is thy soul required of thee. Plural active present, not passive: 'They are demanding thy soul from thee.'" 
3. "The rabbis used 'they' to avoid saying 'God.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The time of a man's death, as well as of his birth, is fixed by God."
2. "The soul...is of more worth than a world, and its loss is irreparable."
3. "He does not know whose [things] they will be, whether the persons he designed them for, or some others whom he abhorred."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou fool â€” To think of satisfying thy soul with earthly goods!"
2. "To depend on living many years! Yea, one day!"
3. "They - The messengers of death, commissioned by God, require thy soul of thee!"
