# Luke 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who is rich for himself, laying up treasure for himself, is by so much robbing his real inward life, his life in and toward God, of its resources. He is stripping the spirit of all its riches, living to amass worldly wealth that terminates on self. The only wealth that matters and lasts is being rich toward God. Such folly leads to a destitute existence, both in this life and ultimately in the eyes of God.
