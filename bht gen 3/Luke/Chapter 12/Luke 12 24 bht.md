# Luke 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the ravens, who are scavengers like vultures and rely on God's provision for their sustenance. The storechamber, a secret chamber, signifies God's hidden resources available to meet their needs. This example from nature demonstrates that God's will guarantees existence more surely than material abundance. Therefore, just as the ravens are provided for by God's providence, there is no reason for humanity, and especially those who belong to God, to doubt His care and provision.
