# Luke 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why worry about the things that are necessary for sustaining and prolonging life? Corroding solicitude will not bring you the least of the things ye fret about but may double the evil of wanting them. The original meaning of the word is time of life, age. Moreover, Christ is speaking of food and clothing, the object of which is to foster and prolong life. Just as you cannot add even the slightest measurement to your own stature, worrying will not add anything to your life. Trust in God's timing and care.
