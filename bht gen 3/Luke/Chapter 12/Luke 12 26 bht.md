# Luke 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we cannot do the very least of things, such as adding a cubit to our stature or prolonging our lives, then why do we worry about greater matters? Our inability to accomplish even the smallest tasks should remind us that our lives are ultimately in God's hands. Instead of being consumed by anxiety and striving to control our destinies, let us trust in God's providence and accept that the length of our days is determined by His divine plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "that thing which is least: this shews the truth of the interpretation age (not 'stature') given in the note on Matthew."
2. "A cubit would be infinitesimally small when compared to his length of life, that life being contemplated as a course, or race, which he may attempt, but ineffectually, to prolong."
3. "a cubit would not be the least of things to add to the stature, but a very large in-crease."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not able to do even that which is least." 
2. "Elative superlative, very small."
3. "The verbs for toil and spin are plural in Matthew and singular here."

### John Gill:
1. "If ye then be not able to do that which is least,.... As to make the smallest addition to a man's stature, or rather to add one moment to his days." 
2. "why take ye thought for the rest? which are much greater, as to preserve the body in its whole bulk, and all its parts, or for the feeding and clothing of it, or rather for the continuation and preservation of life to any length of time"
3. "for if it cannot be by all a man's care and solicitude lengthened out one moment longer than is the pleasure of God, how should it be by such anxiety continued for months and years?"
