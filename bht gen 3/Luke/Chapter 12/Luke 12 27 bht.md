# Luke 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the lilies how they grow, for what is afterwards said is true of any of them, but particularly of the lilies. They toil not, they spin not; they neither labor as men do, and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Their beauty and glory are natural, whereas his was but an artificial imitation of nature.
