# Luke 12:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the lilies in the field, they exist and live there among the grass. Instead of worrying about what you will eat or drink, trust in God's care for the grass and how He clothes it. If God takes such care of the grass, which is more excellent in nature and designed for greater purposes, why should those of little faith worry about their own provision? Have faith in God, for He will surely provide for you.
