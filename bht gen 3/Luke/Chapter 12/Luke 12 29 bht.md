Do not let excessive curiosity lead you to unnecessary uneasiness, making yourselves miserable before the time. Be steadfast in your thoughts and do not be fickle or inconstant. Release yourself from the tormenting and vexatious care, and let your mind find peace from the distractions and hesitations that keep you from true contentment.
