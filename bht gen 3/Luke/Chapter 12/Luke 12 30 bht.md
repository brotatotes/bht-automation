# Luke 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why worry about what you will eat or wear? Such concerns are heathenish and unbecoming of disciples of Christ. Those who do not know God or acknowledge his providence may be anxious, but as followers of Christ, we can trust in his covenant and promises. There is no need to be overly concerned about these things.
