# Luke 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is unnecessary for disciples of Christ to worry about earthly needs, as all these worries are what the nations of the world seek after. Such concerns are heathenish and unbecoming of followers of Christ. Those who do not know God and His providence may find it understandable to be anxious about such things, but for believers, it is needless, for our Father knows that we have need of these things.
