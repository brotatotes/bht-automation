Wherever our treasure is, our hearts will be as well. If our treasure is solely centered on earthly possessions and worldly desires, our hearts will be confined to such finite matters.

This principle is expressed in the Bible, intertwining with similar teachings found in other passages. It underscores the significance of aligning our hearts with eternal treasures rather than fleeting earthly ones.

### John Gill:
1. "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also: the heart is always set upon the treasure."
2. "If his treasure is only here, and he has not the true riches, his heart is only earthly and carnal."
