## BHT:
Be in readiness for the master's return at the wedding feast. Let your loins be girded in preparation, as people in the East would tuck up their long garments for travel or labor. Keep your lamps burning, whether referring to the Scriptures guiding your ministry or the brightness of your profession, shining before others to glorify God. Immerse yourself in the teachings of the Gospel, abiding faithfully and never fading, just as servants carry lights at night weddings.
