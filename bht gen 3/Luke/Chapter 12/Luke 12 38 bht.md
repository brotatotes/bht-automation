# Luke 12:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To find servants ready to receive the Lord at any hour, even when least expected, is a special blessing. While a servant can be faithful despite being caught unawares, the ultimate blessing lies in being so prepared that one can open to their master immediately upon his return. The second and third watches of the night, when people are in their deepest sleep, find these vigilant servants fully ready with their loins girt, lights burning, and eagerly watching for their Lord's coming. Such servants are truly blessed, as they will be treated and used favorably.
