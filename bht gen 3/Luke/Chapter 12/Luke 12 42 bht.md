# Luke 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord does not answer the question directly, but proceeds with His discourse, so as to furnish it with an answer, that in its highest sense it applies to his Apostles and ministers, inasmuch as to them most has been given as the stewards, but that its application is gradationally downwards through all those who know their Master‚Äôs will, even to the lowest, whose measure both of responsibility and of reward is more limited. Fidelity is the first requisite in a servant, wisdom (discretion and judgment in the exercise of his functions), the next.
