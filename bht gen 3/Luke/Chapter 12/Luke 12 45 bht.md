# Luke 12:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Confident in his master's delay, the servant abandons his role and tyrannizes the faithful servants who refuse to partake in his wrongdoings. He indulges in his master's bountiful provisions, fully intending to pretend to be faithful once his master returns. Yet, the servant's focus on the delay reveals his true motives of exploiting his master's absence. This serves as a reminder that mere profession of faith is insufficient; true devotion is demonstrated through obedience to God's will.
