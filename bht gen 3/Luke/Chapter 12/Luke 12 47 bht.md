# Luke 12:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who possess knowledge of God's will and do not live according to it will face greater consequences. Ignorance cannot serve as an excuse, as those who are given more instruction have a higher level of accountability. The punishment for disobedience will be the same for all, but the severity will be greater for those who know better. Therefore, let us not take our knowledge for granted but strive to align our actions with God's will.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The severity of punishment for those who know their master's will and do not perform it is explained in Luke 12:47. Those who have been privileged with knowledge of God's commands and warnings, such as the Twelve disciples and the vast audience, will face far greater punishment than those without such knowledge. This principle applies not only to those who have been taught early on in Sunday schools or by pious parents, but to anyone who knowingly disobeys God's will. It is futile for one to plead ignorance to avoid condemnation, as the more knowledge one possesses, the greater the grounds for punishment if they do not obey. Therefore, it is vital to have a spiritual and saving knowledge that leads to obedience.
