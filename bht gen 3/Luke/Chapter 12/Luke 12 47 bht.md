Our readiness involves not only preparing ourselves, but also fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted to us. Those who possess knowledge yet fail to act accordingly will face severe consequences. Even those with limited knowledge will be held to a certain degree of responsibility. The punishment for disobedience will be the same for both groups, but the severity will vary.
