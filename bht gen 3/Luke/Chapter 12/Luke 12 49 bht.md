## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fire is, the gift of the Holy Spirit,â€”the great crowning result of the sufferings and triumph of the Lord Jesus." 
2. "This fire, in its purifying and separating effects on the mass of mankind, causes the division afterwards spoken of."
3. "What will I? would that it were already kindled!"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To cause this element of life to take up its abode on earth, and wholly to pervade human hearts with its warmth, was the lofty destiny of the Redeemer" [OLSHAUSEN: so CALVIN, STIER, ALFORD, c.].
2. "An obscure expression, uttered under deep and half-smothered emotion. In its general import all are agreed but the nearest to the precise meaning seems to be, 'And what should I have to desire if it were once already kindled?'" [BENGEL and BLOOMFIELD].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He does not mean that he came 'for' that purpose, or that he 'sought' and 'desired' it; but that such was the state of the human heart, and such the opposition of people to the truth, that that would be the 'effect' of his coming."
2. "Fire, here, is the emblem of discord and contention, and consequently of calamities."
3. "Since the greatest blessing which mankind can receive must be attended with such unhappy divisions, I am willing, nay, desirous that they should come."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ has introduced into the world the utmost confusion, as if he had intended to mingle heaven and earth."
2. "The gospel is metaphorically compared to fire, because it violently changes the face of things."
3. "The same fire of doctrine, when it burns on all sides, consumes chaff and straw, but purifies silver and gold."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I came to cast fire upon the earth...The view that the 'fire' means the 'division' itself obscures the whole passage; how could our Lord unconditionally wish for the latter." 
2. "'Cast upon the earth,' refers to the powerful and sudden influence of the day of Pentecost. Others refer the clause to the extraordinary spiritual excitement which His gospel would awaken."
3. "How would I that it were already kindled! Our Lord here expresses a desire for kindling of this 'fire,' but there is much difference of opinion as to the exact meaning of the original."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ came to set the world on fire, and the conflagration had already begun."
2. "The very passion in Christ's heart would set his friends on fire and his foes in opposition."
3. "How I wish that it were already kindled."

### John Gill:
1. "I am come to send fire on the earth... either the Gospel, which is as fire, that gives both light and heat, warms the hearts of God's people, and causes them to burn within them."
2. "Or else zeal for it, and which would be opposed with sharp contentions by others."
3. "Or rather persecution for the sake of the Gospel, called sometimes the fiery trial; which tries men, as gold is tried in the fire, what they are, and what their principles and profession be."

### John Wesley:
1. I am come to send fire â€” To spread the fire of heavenly love over all the earth.
