# Luke 12:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The work of the fire that Jesus brings is not peace, but division, as he himself said, Peace...? Nay, c.â€”the reverse of peace. Loyalty to Christ counts more than all else, and these family feuds are inevitable where only part cleave to Christ. Christ warns his followers to prepare for battle, for they must necessarily fight for the testimony of truth. Universal peace will not be the immediate effect of his coming, for his Gospel is like a sword that divides and separates, even among the closest relationships.
