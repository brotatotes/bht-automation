# Luke 12:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One can test and prove the weather by signs, like the heat brought by the south wind. However, the signs of the times cannot be interpreted in the same way. While the weather can be discerned through tangible signs, the signs of the times require a different kind of discernment that goes beyond the physical manifestations. It is important to interpret the signs of the times with a spiritual understanding, rather than relying solely on tangible proof or interpretation.
