# Luke 12:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When you see the signs of the weather changing and can discern the heat coming, you can test and prove the conditions based on those signs. However, you cannot apply that same level of proof to the signs of the times. Just as you can predict the weather by the south wind blowing and foresee the heat that is to come, it is generally asserted that the signs of the times can also be discerned.
