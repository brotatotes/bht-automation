# Luke 12:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of that time were unable to discern the critical period for the Jewish Church, despite the plain signs of the Messiah's coming. Jesus called them hypocrites for their blindness and ignorance of the signs of the times. They could discern the face of the sky and the earth, yet failed to discern the significance of that moment. This was the time of the Messiah's coming, a season that should have been discerned through the prophecies of the Old Testament.

Even profane authors and the greatest prophets had testified to the expectation of the Messiah's arrival. Jesus called them hypocrites for their blindness and ignorance of the signs of the times.
