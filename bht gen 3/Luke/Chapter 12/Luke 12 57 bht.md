# Luke 12:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why do you not discern of yourselves your true state, your justice as before God? You are traveling with your adversary, the just and holy law of God, before the magistrate Himself, so take pains to be delivered from Him. Otherwise, He may deliver you to the judge, the Son to whom all judgment is committed, and you will be cast into prison. You have enough knowledge to know what is right, even without the presence and teaching of Jesus. So, examine what is right in the presence of God, and let this lead you to immediate discipleship.

1. "From their own observation, as in discerning the signs of the weather; in a rational way, by the light of reason, and according to the dictates of their own consciences; by what they themselves saw and heard; by the signs and wonders which were done, they might have concluded, that now was the time of the Messiah's coming; and that he was come."
 
2. "this was as easy, by observation, to be discerned, as the face of the sky was; even of themselves, without any hints or directions from others"
 
3. "why do ye not of yourselves judge, what is fit and right to be done between man and man, without going to law? and that, in cases which are plain and clear, the consequences of which may be as easily discerned, as what weather it will be by the signs in the heavens"

### John Wesley:
1. Why even of yourselves, without any external sign, judge ye not what is right? - Why do ye not discern and acknowledge the intrinsic excellence of my doctrine?
