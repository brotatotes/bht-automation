# Luke 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This woman, a daughter of Abraham, was afflicted for eighteen years by a spirit of infirmity, causing her to be bowed together and unable to straighten herself. Her protracted infirmity, noted in the physician's narrative, implied a disease beyond ordinary understanding. However, Jesus, with a word of command, healed her, triumphing over the power of Satan. This remarkable miracle served as a testimony to the divine power of Christ and stood as a rebuke to those who make excuses to stay away from the house of God even in times of minor afflictions.
