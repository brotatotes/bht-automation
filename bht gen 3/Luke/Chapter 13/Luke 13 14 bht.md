# Luke 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Filled with indignation, the ruler of the synagogue covertly and cowardly voiced his displeasure to the crowd, seeking to reach Jesus indirectly through them. His false premise was that works of mercy were forbidden on the Sabbath, failing to realize that the one who performed such a miracle couldn't possibly be a violator of God's law. Envy and a desire to hinder the honor that would come to Jesus spurred his anger, as he hypocritically disguised it as concern for Sabbath observance.
