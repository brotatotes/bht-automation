### Albert Barnes:

2. "To her I have done good on the Sabbath; you provide for your cattle, and yet blame me for working a miracle to relieve a sufferer on that day."
3. "Stall - A place where cattle are kept to be fed, and sheltered from the weather."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "If it be lawful on the Sabbath, to perform the offices of humanity to cattle, it is ridiculous to imagine that the due observance of it will prevent assistance from being granted to the children of God."
2. "You, who are so scrupulous about observing the Sabbath, venture to loose oxen and asses, and lead them away to watering. And why may not I be permitted to perform a similar office of kindness to the elect people of God; especially when the necessity is more urgent, when someone is to be delivered from the snares of Satan?"
3. "Christ never performed any work, however illustrious, which wicked men did not seize as an occasion for slander. Nor need we wonder that Satan labored, with incessant zeal and exertions, to subvert the glory of Christ; for he is constantly employed in spreading his clouds, in order to darken the holy actions of believers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord. Perhaps with emphasis; as He had previously proclaimed Himself, â€˜Lord even of the Sabbathâ€™ (chap. Luke 6:5)."
2. "Ye hypocrites. Luke 13:17 shows that other antagonists were present. The plural agrees better with what follows. The hypocrisy is evident from the example our Lord quotes."
3. "Doth not each one of you, etc. This was confessedly permitted. In an important sense works of mercy are works of necessity. The beast tied to the manger aptly represents the case of this poor woman."

2. "These very critics of Jesus cared too much for an ox or an ass to leave it all the Sabbath without water."
3. "The manger where the infant Jesus was placed."

### John Gill:
1. "thou hypocrite; the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read in the plural, 'hypocrites'; as do the Complutensian edition, and four ancient copies of Beza's, and the Alexandrian copy; but the Syriac and Persic versions read in the singular, 'hypocrite'; as this man was, who covered his malice and envy at Christ, with a show of zeal for the sabbath day."
2. "doth not each one of you, on the sabbath day, loose his ox, or his ass, from the stall, or rack, where he is fastened with a rope; and lead him away to watering?"
3. "And therefore very justly does our Lord observe to the ruler of the synagogue their own practices towards a beast, in defence of his works of mercy to men."

### John Wesley:
1. Thou hypocrite â€” For the real motive of his speaking was envy, not (as he pretended) pure zeal for the glory of God.
