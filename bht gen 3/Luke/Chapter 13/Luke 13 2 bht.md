# Luke 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus does not deny that the Galileans who were killed were sinners, but he emphasizes that their fate does not make them particularly wicked. The term sinners above all means that they were placed beside all other sinners but not necessarily above them in wickedness. It is important to avoid labeling every calamity as a judgment from God, as this often stems from a lack of charity and a tendency to harshly judge others. We should humbly acknowledge the mystery of God's ways, as his judgments are beyond our understanding.

- Attempt 1 BHT: It is important to understand that in Luke 13:2, Jesus does not deny that the Galileans who were killed were sinners, but rather emphasizes that their fate does not make them particularly wicked. The term sinners above all means that they were placed beside all other sinners, but not necessarily above them in their level of wickedness. Jesus challenges the common habit of labeling every calamity as a judgment from God, as this often stems from a lack of charity and a tendency to harshly judge others. It is crucial to remember that God's judgments are beyond our understanding, and his providence encompasses both punishment and mercy. Whether someone experiences immediate consequences or is spared for a time does not determine their righteousness or wickedness. Thus, we should avoid being overly severe in our judgments and instead humbly acknowledge the mystery of God's ways.
