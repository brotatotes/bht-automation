## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This notice includes what follows in the cycle of this last journey, but disclaims any definiteness of place or time for it."

2. "The former clause, certainly, appears to describe that course of life which Christ invariably pursued, from the time that he began to discharge the office which had been committed to him by the Father."
