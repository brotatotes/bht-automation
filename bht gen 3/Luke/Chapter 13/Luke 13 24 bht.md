# Luke 13:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus teaches us the importance of striving to enter through the narrow door, representing the challenging path to salvation. We should not rely on mere seeking or desire, but instead make a life-and-death struggle. The word strive conveys the idea of contending for a prize, reflecting the difficulty of being saved. Many will not obtain salvation because they neglected religion in this life. Therefore, we must diligently pursue the narrow gate, seeking it with earnestness, for entering through any other way is morally impossible.
