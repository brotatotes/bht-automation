# Luke 13:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There will come a day when the gate will be shut, and those who have not striven to enter will be left outside. The Master of the house is depicted as calmly looking on to see who will 'strive' while entrance is practicable. However, this opportunity will have an end when the Master Himself rises and shuts the door, after which there will be no admittance. It is a warning that we must strive now while the door is open, for a time will come when it will be altogether impossible to enter.

- Attempt 1 BHT: There will come a day when the gate will be shut, and those who have not striven to enter will be left outside. It is important to understand the spiritual significance of this, as it emphasizes the need for earnest effort in seeking entrance. The Master of the house is depicted in a sitting posture, calmly observing who will strive and who will merely seek. But the time for entrance will eventually end, as the Master Himself rises and shuts the door forever. Those who then cry out, saying Lord, Lord, will be met with the heartbreaking response that they have no relationship with Him. This verse serves as a warning, urging us to take advantage of the opportunity to enter while it is still available.
