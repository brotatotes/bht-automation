# Luke 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day of judgment, those who engage in unrighteousness as workers of iniquity will face their fate. However, this should not concern those who do not belong to that group. Mere external communion with Christ will not be enough to see the Lord; true holiness is essential. Jesus, as the absolute Disposer of eternal destinies, emphasizes the firmness of the sentence. He invites people to participate in joyous feasts, but familiarity with Him in the flesh does not grant entry. It is a mistaken belief that unsaved individuals genuinely desire salvation and holiness in the future.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "workmen of iniquity... persons engaged in the hire and receiving the wages of unrighteousness" 
2. "they shall be MANY‚Äîbut what is that to you, if you be not among them?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No nearness of external communion with Christ will avail at the great day, in place of that holiness without which no man shall see the Lord."
2. "Observe the style which Christ intimates that He will then assume, that of absolute Disposer of men's eternal destinies, and contrast it with His 'despised and rejected' condition at that time."
3. "No man shall see the Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. See the notes at Matthew 7:23.


### Marvin Vincent:

3. "According to the Jewish idea, one of the main elements of the happiness of the Messianic kingdom was the privilege of participating in splendid festive entertainments along with the patriarchs of the nation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The terrible reality set forth is, that many ‚Äòworkers of iniquity‚Äô think they will be saved, and will find out their mistake too late."
2. "This is a motive to ‚Äòstrive‚Äô (Luke 13:24), for now such striving is possible; but a time will come when the striving as well as the entrance will be impossible."
3. "Many, in their thoughts of the future world, make the great mistake of supposing that those unsaved here can really desire salvation there, but no word of our Lord hints at such a desire, involving a desire for holiness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I know not whence ye are. This blunt statement cuts the matter short and sweeps away the flimsy cobwebs."
2. "Acquaintance with Christ in the flesh does not open the door."
3. "Jesus quotes Psalms 8:9...with œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ ŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±œÑŒ± Œ±Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ±œÇ...Œ±œÄŒøœÉœÑŒ∑œÑŒµ (second aorist active imperative) here."

### John Gill:
1. "Be gone from my sight, and be far from my door" - expressing indignation at them, an abhorrence of them, as not being able to bear them in his sight, or near unto him.
2. "I tell you, I know you not whence you are" - repeated, and with a strong asseveration, to denote the certainty of the truth expressed, and to cast off all hope in them, of ever succeeding by their entreaties and importunity.
3. "Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity" - they were deceitful workers, they professed what they did not from the heart believe; they said they were Christians, but were not, and now are found liars.

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 7:23.
