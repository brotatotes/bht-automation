# Luke 13:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By neglecting to enter through the narrow gate and allowing worldly influences to lead you astray, you risk being separated from the community of believers. Christ's warning is clear that those who follow this path will be cast out and shut out from the kingdom of God, having no part with the faithful forefathers. Being born into a religious family does not guarantee a place in eternal glory; genuine regeneration transcends lineage. Let not the allure of the world deceive you, for on the final day, the consequences of our exclusion will be undeniable.
