## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That Jesus in a public discourse uses such an expression of the ruler of his country, is not to be judged of by the manners, and ways of speech, of our times. The free-spokenness of the ancient world, which we meet with especially in the Hebrew prophets, allowed such strong expressions, without any thing peculiarly offensive being found in them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold, I cast out devils and I do cures; Plot on and ply thy wiles; I also have My plans; My works of mercy are nearing completion, but some yet remain." 
2. "I have work for to-day and to-morrow too, and the third day; by that time I shall be where his jurisdiction reaches not; the guilt of My blood shall not lie at his door; that dark deed is reserved for others."
3. "I finish my course, I attain completion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A fox is an emblem of slyness, of cunning, and of artful mischief."
2. "I am not afraid of his art or his enmity. I am engaged in my appropriate work, and shall continue to be as long as is proper, in spite of his arts and his threats."
3. "I shall have ended my course 'here;' I shall have 'perfected' what I purpose to do in Galilee."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That fox. Herod. Describing his cunning and cowardice."
2. "Cures [Î¹Î±ÏƒÎµÎ¹Ï‚]. Used by Luke only."
3. "I shall be perfected [Ï„ÎµÎ»ÎµÎ¹Î¿Ï…Î¼Î±Î¹]. The present tense: 'the present of the certain future' (Meyer)."

### John Calvin:
1. "I do not think that the term, fox, is intended to refer generally to the cunning of his whole life, but rather to the insidious methods by which he labored to undermine the doctrine of the Gospel, when he did not venture to attack it openly."
2. "Christ tells him that, with all his craftiness, he will gain nothing by his schemes."
3. "That we may perceive more clearly the meaning of the words, Christ acknowledges, in the former part of his message, that on the third dayâ€”that is, within a very short timeâ€”he must die; and in this way shows, that he could not be deterred from his duty by any fear of death, to which he advanced boldly, with fixed purpose of mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That fox. A figure of cunning and mischief. Herod deserved the name."
2. "Our Lord mentions His works, because it was these, rather than His words, which had excited Herodâ€™s anxiety."
3. "Today and tomorrow, and the third day come to the end, i.e., of these works in your country (Perea)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The preacher is often put in a tight place by politicians who are quite willing to see him shorn of all real power."
2. "Perfect humanity is a process and Jesus was passing through that, without sin, but not without temptation and suffering."
3. "It is the prophetic present with the sense of the future."

### John Gill:
1. "Go ye and tell that fox, Herod." 
2. "And I do cures today and tomorrow; and so for some time to come."
3. "And the third day I shall be perfected."

### John Wesley:
1. "The meaning of our Lord's answer is, Notwithstanding all that he can do, I shall for the short time I have left, do the works of him that sent me."
2. "Behold, I cast out devils â€” With what majesty does he speak to his enemies! With what tenderness to his friends!"
3. "His extraordinary office justified him in using that severity of language, when speaking of wicked princes, and corrupt teachers, to which we have no call; and by which we should only bring scandal on religion, and ruin on ourselves."
