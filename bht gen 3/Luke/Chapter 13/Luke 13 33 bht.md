# Luke 13:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jerusalem, described as the prophets' slaughter-house, is where Jesus foresees His execution. His ironic remark about King Herod is a severe indictment of the city's history of rejecting and killing God's messengers. While some suggest the Sanhedrim's power might be involved, Jesus emphasizes the fact of perishing rather than legal judgement. His journey in Perea signifies the approaching shadow of the Cross, as He acknowledges that it would be against tradition for a prophet like Him to meet His end anywhere but Jerusalem, known for its monopoly on such martyrdoms.
