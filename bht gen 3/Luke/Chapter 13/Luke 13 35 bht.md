# Luke 13:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, the multitude exclaimed Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. However, there may have been a misunderstanding regarding this declaration's true fulfillment. Rather, it is more likely that Jesus lamented over the impending fate of the holy city. He foretold that their house would be left desolate, signifying its irreversible desolation and impending destruction. In due time, they would no longer see Jesus until their calamities taught them to acknowledge, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

### Henry Alford:
1. "That the very words, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, were used by the multitude at the Lordâ€™s entry into Jerusalem."

3. "Than for a moment suppose, as some have done, that these words found any sufficient fulfilment in that entry."

1. "The word translated â€˜desolateâ€™ is omitted by the best authorities, but â€˜forsakenâ€™ may be supplied to bring out the entire sense of the rest of the clause."
2. "â€˜Henceforth,â€™ which in Matthew marks the beginning of the desolation at that moment, is not found here. These little things show that this was spoken at an earlier time."
