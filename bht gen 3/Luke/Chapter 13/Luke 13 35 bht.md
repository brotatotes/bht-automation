## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word translated â€˜desolateâ€™ is omitted by the best authorities, but â€˜forsakenâ€™ may be supplied to bring out the entire sense of the rest of the clause."
2. "Some belittle the prediction by referring it to our Lordâ€™s triumphal entry just before the Passover, when the people cried, Blessed, etc. The disciples may have misunderstood this prediction, and thought it fulfilled on that occasion, but in fact Jerusalem did not say this, but said â€˜Who is this?â€™"
3. "It is far more natural to suppose that already our Lord mourned over the impending fate of the holy city."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate...."
2. "Ye shall not see me... until the time come..."
3. "When ye shall say, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Your house is left to you desolate â€” Is now irrecoverably consigned to desolation and destruction..."
2. "Verily I say to you, after a very short space, ye shall not see me till the time come, when taught by your calamities, ye shall be ready and disposed to say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
3. "It does not imply, that they should then see Jesus at all; but only that they would earnestly wish for the Messiah, and in their extremity be ready to entertain any who should assume that character."
