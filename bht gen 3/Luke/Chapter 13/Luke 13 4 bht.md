# Luke 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus mentions these incidents to emphasize the accountability of his audience and uses these public events to teach spiritual lessons. While it is incorrect to assume that the victims were greater sinners or that their state was worse, it is important to recognize that all sufferings, whether caused by human actions or accidents, are ultimately under God's control. In Jerusalem, there may have been individuals who appeared religious and pious, but were as sinful, if not more so, than those who suffered in these events.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Both incidents mentioned in this verse serve as reminders of the responsibility everyone bears. It is essential to recognize that all sufferings, whether caused by human action or accidents, are ultimately under the sovereign control of God's hand. This is exemplified by Jesus connecting the tower's collapse in Siloam, which may have been a tower near the pool, and the massacre of the Galileans in Jerusalem. By utilizing these public events, Jesus seeks to teach spiritual lessons and highlight the accountability of his audience. It is imperative not to misconstrue these calamities as indications of greater sinfulness, for Jerusalem itself housed individuals who were just as sinful, if not more so, despite their outward appearances of religious devotion.
