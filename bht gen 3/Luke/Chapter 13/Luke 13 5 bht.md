# Luke 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The intercessory office of the Spirit, represented by Moses, the Prophets, the Baptist, the Lord Himself, and the Apostles, pleads for immediate repentance. The Holy Spirit, as the Intercessor, confronts inveterate obduracy and is often highlighted in Scripture. The interpretation of accidents is challenging, and the moral lesson taught by Jesus is obvious. Heavy judgments in this world do not necessarily indicate the worst sinners, as the most wicked may prosper now, with punishment reserved for the future. The threatened destruction in Jerusalem impacted all, and unless one repents, they will face a similar fate.
