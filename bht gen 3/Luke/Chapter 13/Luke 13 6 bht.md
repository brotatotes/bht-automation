## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "fig treeâ€”Israel, as the visible witness of God in the world, but generally all within the pale of the visible Church of God." 
2. "vineyardâ€”a spot selected for its fertility, separated from the surrounding fields, and cultivated with special care, with a view solely to fruit."
3. "came and sought fruitâ€”a heart turned to God the fruits of righteousness; compare Matthew 21:33; Matthew 21:34; Isaiah 5:2, 'He looked that it should bring forth fruit'; He has a right to it, and will require it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This parable - See the notes at Matthew 13:3."
2. "Vineyard - A place where vines were planted."
3. "It was not common to plant fig-trees in them, but our Lord represents it as having been sometimes done."

### John Calvin:
1. "The wicked flattery, by which hypocrites are hardened, and become more obstinate, arises from this cause, that they do not think of their sins till they are compelled."
2. "Thus they indulge themselves more freely, as if...they had made a covenant with death, and were in friendship with the grave."
3. "A comparison is here drawn between the owner and the vine-dresser: not that Godâ€™s ministers go beyond him in gentleness and forbearance, but because the Lord not only prolongs the life of sinners, but likewise cultivates them in a variety of ways, that they may yield better fruit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 13:6. A fig tree planted in his vineyard. This was not unusual, nor contrary to Deuteronomy 22:9.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Planted (Ï€ÎµÏ†Ï…Ï„ÎµÏ…Î¼ÎµÎ½Î·Î½). Perfect passive participle of Ï†Ï…Ï„ÎµÏ…Ï‰, to plant, an old verb, from Ï†Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½, a plant, and that from Ï†Ï…Ï‰, to grow." 
2. "But this participle with ÎµÎ¹Ï‡ÎµÎ½ (imperfect active of ÎµÏ‡Ï‰) does not make a periphrastic past perfect like our English 'had planted.'"
3. "It means rather, he had a fig tree, one already planted in his vineyard."

### John Gill:
1. "Setting forth the patience of God towards the Jewish nation, their unfruitfulness, and the danger of their being destroyed, in case of non-amendment."
2. "By the 'certain man' may be meant, either God the Father, who is sometimes called an husbandman or rather the Lord Jesus Christ, who is truly man, as well as properly God."
3. "This, if understood of God the Father, designs his coming to the Jewish people by his servants and prophets, time after time, and at last by John the Baptist, and Jesus Christ, and his apostles, seeking and requiring fruits of holiness, righteousness, and judgment, but found instead thereof the wild grapes of wickedness, oppression, and violence."

### John Wesley:
1. "Either we may understand God the Father by him that had the vineyard, and Christ by him that kept it."
2. "Christ himself is he that hath [the fig tree], and his ministers they that keep it."
3. "Psalm 80:8. etc."
