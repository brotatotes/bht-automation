# Luke 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this context, the fig tree's unfruitfulness is highlighted as it not only fails to bear fruit but also impoverishes the soil and renders the neighboring ground useless. The tree's unproductive state is not only useless but also harmful, drawing away resources from other plants and taking up valuable space. With three years indicating a sufficient period of cultivation, the tree's unfruitfulness becomes even more apparent. In response to this, it is justifiable to cut out the tree to prevent further harm and make fertile ground for fruitful growth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I have little doubt that an allusion is intended to the three years of our Lord‚Äôs ministry."
2. "In the individual application, many thousands did bear fruit this very year."
3. "Why, besides bearing no fruit, is it impoverishing the soil‚Äîrendering the neighbouring ground useless?"

3. "Cumbereth‚Äînot only doing no good, but wasting ground."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By taking up the juices of the earth, this useless tree rendered the ground sterile, and prevented the growth of the neighboring vines. It was not merely 'useless,' but was doing mischief, which may be said of all sinners and all hypocritical professors of religion."
2. "God treats sinners in this manner now; that he spares them long; that he gives them opportunities of repentance; that many live but to cumber the ground; that they are not only useless to the church, but pernicious to the world."
3. "In due time, when they are fairly tried, they shall be cut down; and that the universe will bow to the awful decree of God, and say that their damnation is just."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is three years from the time at which I came."
2. "Cut it out from among the other trees and the vines."
3. "Not only is it unfruitful, but it draws away the juices which the vines would extract from the earth, intercepts the sun, and occupies room."

1. "Three years are the time of a full trial, at the end of which the inference of incurable sterility may be drawn." (Godet)
2. "Why is it allowed to impoverish the soil, and interfere with the other products of the vineyard. Barrenness curses others also."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These three years I come (œÑœÅŒπŒ± ŒµœÑŒ∑ Œ±œÜ' ŒøœÖ ŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒ±). Literally, 'three years since (from which time) I come.'"
2. "Cut it down (ŒµŒ∫Œ∫ŒøœàŒøŒΩ). 'Cut it out,' the Greek has it, out of the vineyard."
3. "Doth cumber the ground (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ≥Œ∑ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÅŒ≥Œµ). Makes the ground completely idle, of no use."

### John Gill:
1. "behold, there are three years since I came"; so read the Vulgate Latin and Persic versions, and Beza's most ancient copy.
2. "These trees bear fruit once in three years; they bear fruit indeed every year, but their fruit does not come to maturity till after three years."
3. "unfruitful trees suck up the juices of the earth, and draw away nourishment from other trees that are near them, and so make the earth barren, and not only hurt other trees, but stand in the way and place of fruitful ones."

### John Wesley:
1. "Three years ‚Äî Christ was then in the third year of his ministry. But it may mean only several years; a certain number being put for an uncertain."
2. "Why doth it also cumber the ground? ‚Äî That is, not only bear no fruit itself, but take up the ground of another tree that would."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In this passage, it seems that an allusion is made to the three years of our Lord's ministry, highlighting a sufficient period of cultivation for spiritual fruit. The fig tree not only fails to bear fruit, but it also impoverishes the soil and renders neighboring ground useless.

Ultimately, the tree is to be cut down, for its damnation is just, and the universe will bow to the decree of God.
