# Luke 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vine-dresser tends to the unfruitful fig tree, hoping it will bear fruit in the future. The decision to cut it down or give it another chance lies with the master. The Holy Spirit does not destroy, but gives life, and genuine repentance, even if late, can still save. The final perdition of the fruitless is just. This parable teaches about intercession, accepting the master's judgment, and offering hope and affection to those who have not borne fruit.

- Attempt 1 BHT: After patiently tending to the fig tree that had been unfruitful for so long, the vine-dresser is met with the decision to either cut it down or give it one last chance. However, it is not the Holy Spirit's work to destroy, for He is the Giver of life. Genuine repentance, even if it comes late, can still reap salvation. But if there is no fruit to be seen in the future, the final perdition of those who have been persistently unfruitful will be just. The vine-dresser, recognizing this, passes the responsibility of judgment to the master, saying, Thou shalt cut it down. It is not a matter of I will cut it down, but of accepting the master's decision. In this, there is a lesson on intercession and the hope and affection that should be extended to those who have not yet borne fruit.
