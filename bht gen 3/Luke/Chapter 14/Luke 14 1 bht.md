While they maintained their traditions and held feasts on the Sabbath, it had become an abuse. The Pharisees, with their hostile intentions, used this dinner as a pretext to find fault with Jesus. However, Jesus did not aim to abolish the Sabbath, but rather to emphasize that acts of kindness and the works of God do not violate its true purpose.

2. "He unquestionably could not be present at the table by accident, nor break into a private dwelling without the permission and consent of the owner."
3. "It is therefore probable, that he was placed there with the concealed design of tempting Christ, which, on their part, was as foolish an action as it was wicked."

3. "The Pharisees...were watching if He would do or say anything which would furnish a pretext for opposing Him. The hospitality was hostile."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
