# Luke 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In accordance with our Lord's teachings, it is advisable to choose the lower seat in humility when attending a gathering. This act of modesty is not about seeking higher positions for ourselves, but about allowing the host to invite us to a place of honor. A humble posture leads to respect and honor from those around the table. By humbling ourselves, we find true exaltation and glory, as our Lord has taught us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Friend‚Äîsaid to the modest guest only, not the proud one." 
2. "The whole of this is but a reproduction of Proverbs 25:6; Proverbs 25:7." 
3. "But it was reserved for the matchless Teacher to utter articulately, and apply to the regulation of the minutest features of social life, such great laws of the Kingdom of God, as that of Proverbs 25:7."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The lowest seat at the table; showing that you are not desirous of distinctions, or greedy of that honor which may properly belong to you."
2. "They who are sitting with you shall treat you with respect. They will learn your rank by your being invited nearer to the head of the table, and it will be better to learn it thus than by putting yourself forward."
3. "They will do you honor because you have shown a humble spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sit down [Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÄŒµœÉŒµ] . Lit., lay yourself back.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord does not bid them take a low place, for the purpose of being put higher. That would be false humility." 
2. "There is nothing to warrant the idea that our Lord and His disciples were themselves in the lower places, and ought to have been invited to come up higher."
3. "Such hints about promotion at a Pharisee‚Äôs feast would not come from our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sit down (Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÄŒµœÉŒµ). Second aorist active imperative of Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÄŒπœÄœÑœâ, to fall up or back, to lie back or down."
2. "He that hath bidden thee (Œø Œ∫ŒµŒ∫ŒªŒ∑Œ∫œâœÇ œÉŒµ). Perfect active participle as in verse Luke 14:12 (œÑœâ Œ∫ŒµŒ∫ŒªŒ∑Œ∫ŒøœÑ) with which compare Œø Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒµœÉŒ±œÇ in verse Luke 14:9 (first aorist active participle)."
3. "Go up higher (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≤Œ∑Œ∏). Second aorist active imperative second singular of œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≤Œ±ŒπŒΩœâ, an old double compound verb, but here only in the N.T. Probably, 'Come up higher,' because the call comes from the host and because of œÄœÅŒøœÇ."

### John Gill:
1. "Go and sit down in the lowest room: place thyself at the lower end of the table, or in the most inferior seat; which will show humility and lowliness of mind, and prevent shame and mortification."
2. "Then shalt thou have worship; or glory, as the word signifies; honour and esteem, instead of shame and blushing; not only from the master of the feast, but in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee."
3. "My humiliation is my exaltation, and my exaltation is my humiliation."
