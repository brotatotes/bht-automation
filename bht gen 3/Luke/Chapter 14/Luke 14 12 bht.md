# Luke 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus challenges us to go beyond ordinary fellowship and extend our generosity to the poor and needy. Acts of civility are not proof of true charity, and we should not invite only friends or expect something in return. Instead, we should prioritize those who are less fortunate and show genuine love without seeking personal gain. By inviting the poor and empty souls, we reflect Christ's character and demonstrate selfless and unconditional love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus certainly did not mean us to dispense with the duties of ordinary fellowship, but, remitting these to their proper place, inculcates what is better."
2. "A fear the world is not afflicted with."
3. "The meaning, however, is that no exercise of principle is involved in it, as selfishness itself will suffice to prompt to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He intended, doubtless, to reprove those who sought the society of the wealthy, and particularly rich relatives, and those who claimed to be intimate with the great and honorable." 
2. "The passage means, therefore, call 'not only' your friends, but call also the poor, etc." 
3. "Lest they feel themselves bound to treat you with the same kindness, and, in so doing, neither you nor they will show any kind spirit, or any disposition to do good beyond what is repaid."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Supper [Î´ÎµÎ¹Ï€Î½Î¿Î½] is the principal meal at evening, and corresponding to the modern late dinner." 
2. "Call not thy friends, etc. A striking parallel occurs in Plato's 'Phaedrus,' 233."
3. "And, in general, when you make a feast, invite not your friend, but the beggar and the empty soul, for they will love you, and attend you, and come about your doors, and will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and will invoke blessings on your head."

### John Calvin:
1. "Acts of civility, which are customary among men, are no proof whatever of charity."
2. "To perform any act, in the hope of a reward, to rich men, from whom we expect a similar return, is not generosity, but a system of commercial exchange."
3. "Those who are kind to relatives and friends, but are niggardly towards the poor, are entitled to no commendation; because they do not exercise charity, but consult only their own gain or ambition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Call not thy friends...What is forbidden is the thought that this is hospitality, or in itself praiseworthy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is the exclusive invitation of such guests that Jesus condemns."
2. "There is a striking parallel to this in Plato's Phaedrus 233."
3. "Recompense in the form of a return invitation."

### John Gill:
1. "do not invite thy rich friends, rich brethren, and rich kinsmen, as well as not rich neighbours: not that our Lord's meaning is, that such should not be invited at all; which would be to destroy friendship and sociable conversation among persons in such a relation, and of such rank and fortune"
2. "his sense is, that not these only should be invited, to the neglect of poor friends, poor brethren, poor kinsmen, and poor neighbours; and who, comparatively speaking, should rather be invited than the former"
3. "one feasting bout for another, so that there will be no obligation on either side; and this will be all the advantage that will be gained; the return is made here, and there will be no reward hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "But is it not implied herein, that we should be sparing in entertaining those that need it not, in order to assist those that do need, with all that is saved from those needless entertainments?"
2. "Our Lord leaves these offices of humanity and courtesy as they were, and teaches a higher duty."
3. "This fear is as much unknown to the world, as even the fear of riches."
