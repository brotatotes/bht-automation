# Luke 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When making a feast or holding a reception, it is important to call and invite those who are poor, maimed, lame, and blind. This includes those who are destitute of comfortable food and deprived of any member of their body or the use of them. It is not enough to simply extend a quiet invitation, but rather, to genuinely provide for the needs of these individuals. By doing so, we follow God's own example as He Himself calls the poor to His feast.

2. "The poor, etc. This is to be taken as including all modes of providing for the wants of the classes referred to. There is little danger that it will be understood too literally."
3. "As the same classes are spoken of in the parable (Luke 14:21), it is a fair inference that in so doing we follow Godâ€™s own example."

### John Gill:
1. "But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind; that is, the poor maimed, the poor lame, and the poor blind."
