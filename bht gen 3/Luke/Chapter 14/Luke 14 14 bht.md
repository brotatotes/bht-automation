# Luke 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who show disinterested and god-like compassion for the wretched, without expecting any earthly reward, for they will be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. Their acts of benevolence, done out of love for the Lord Jesus Christ, are like lending to the Lord Himself, who promises to repay their generosity. Earthly recompense and the praise of men amount to nothing, but the reward from God will bring true blessing, both in this life and in the eternal kingdom of God.
