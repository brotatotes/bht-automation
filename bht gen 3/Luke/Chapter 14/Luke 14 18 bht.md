2. "Each differs from the other, and each has its own plausibility, but all come to the same result: 'We have other things to attend to, more pressing just now.'"
3. "Nobody is represented as saying, 'I will not come; nay, all the answers imply that but for certain things they would come, and when these are out of the way they will come."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Gill:
1. "Or, 'they all together', as the Vulgate Latin version, ◊ë◊ê◊ó◊™, 'in one', or 'at once': in Jeremiah 10:8 rendered 'altogether'"
2. "immediately, directly, as soon as ever they were bidden, they began to frame excuses; they at once agreed, as by common consent, to excuse themselves from coming."
3. "these were the principal men among the Jews, the Pharisees and rulers among the people; who were rich and covetous, worldly men; seeking their own worldly advantage more than their spiritual and eternal welfare, or the interest of God and religion."

### John Wesley:
1. "All of them want the holy hatred mentioned Luke 14:26."
2. "All of them perish by things in themselves lawful."
3. "The most urgent worldly affairs frequently fall out just at the time when God makes the freest offers of salvation."
