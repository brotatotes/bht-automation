# Luke 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The three excuses provided illustrate the power of worldly attachments in inhibiting one's commitment to God. Whether entangled in the responsibilities of marriage or consumed by personal pleasures, these excuses prioritize worldly gratification over spiritual connection. Even the seemingly justifiable excuse of a recently married man fails to excuse the absence of social courtesy. These differences between the excuses offered and the real motives behind them reveal the unfortunate truth that many willingly disqualify themselves from experiencing God's kingdom for trivial reasons.
