### Henry Alford:

2. "Is there not here as allusion to Infant Baptism?"
3. "He speaks, with His usual For I say unto you, to the company present: and half continuing the parable, half expounding it, substitutes Himself for the master of the feast, leaving it hardly doubtful who those men which were bidden are."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

1. "Since enough had not been found in the lanes and streets, he commands the servant to go into the roads - the public highways out of the city, as well as to the streets 'in' it - and invite them also."
2. "By his directing them to go first into the streets of the city and then into the highways, we are not to understand our Saviour as referring to different classes of people, but only as denoting the 'earnestness' with which God offers salvation..."
3. "Compel them - That is, urge them, press them earnestly, one and all. Do not hear their excuses on account of their poverty and low rank of life, but urge them so as to overcome their objections and lead them to the feast."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hedges [œÜœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒøœÖœÇ] . See on Matthew 21:33. It may mean either a hedge, or a place enclosed with a hedge. Here the hedges beside which vagrants rest."
2. "Compel. Compare constrained, Matthew 14:22; Acts 26:11; Galatians 6:12. Not to use force, but to constrain them against the reluctance which such poor creatures would feel at accepting the invitation of a great Lord."
3. "May be filled [Œ≥ŒµŒºŒπœÉŒ∏Œ∑] . A very strong word; properly of loading a ship. 'Nature and grace alike abhor a vacuum' (Bengel)."

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ declares that he would rake together all the offscourings of the world, rather than he would ever admit such ungrateful persons to his table."
2. "The allusion appears to be to the manner in which the Gospel invites us; for the grace of God is not merely offered to us, but doctrine is accompanied by exhortations fitted to arouse our minds."
3. "This is a display of the astonishing goodness of God, who, after freely inviting us, and perceiving that we give ourselves up to sleep, addresses our slothfulness by earnest entreaties, and not only arouses us by exhortations, but even compels us by threatenings to draw near to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This refers to the spread of the gospel among the Gentiles." 
2. "Moral constraint alone is meant. True missionary zeal so differs from all other impulse that it may well be spoken of as a ‚Äòconstraining‚Äô of men to enter the kingdom of God."
3. "Guests will be ‚Äòfurnished:‚Äô God‚Äôs purposes of mercy will not fail."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "They were not in God's highway, which is a way of holiness, but in their own highways; either following the various sects of the philosophers, which were vain and foolish; or going into different practices of idolatry, and walking in very sinful and vicious courses; and so were in the broad road and highway to destruction." 
2. "To come and hear the word, and quit their former course of living, and attend the word and worship of God; and upon an evidence of the truth of grace upon their souls, to come into a Gospel church state, and partake of all privileges and ordinances in it; to which they are to be compelled, not by outward force, but by forcible words, by powerful arguments, and by the strength of persuasion."
3. "The earnest desire, and great liberality of Christ, the master of the feast, whose end in it is as follows: that my house may be filled; with men, like a flock, and these with gifts and grace; with such as shall be saved, as with elect Jews, so with the fulness of the Gentiles."

### John Wesley:

2. "Such compulsion...was used by Christ and his apostles."
