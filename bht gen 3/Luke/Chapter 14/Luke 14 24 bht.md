# Luke 14:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord clearly reveals that the parable presented is actually a proclamation of the Supper being His very own. When the final glorification comes, even those who rejected the invitation will desperately long for another chance to taste it, but they will be denied. It is important to note that this parable must not be confused with the parable in Proverbs 1:24-33. These words should not be understood as Jesus permanently shutting the door on the Jews who may turn to Him; rather, He is summing up His reasons as the Master of the feast. The supper in question is known as the eating dread in the kingdom of God, also called my supper given in honor of Jesus. Those who reject Him are ultimately refusing God's invitation.

2. "This is the eating Dread in the kingdom of God, to which you look forward; though it is Godâ€™s feast, to which God has invited, it is â€˜my supper,â€™ given in my honor, though I have come â€˜in the form of a servantâ€™ to invite you."
3. "None of those men.... shall taste of my supper. As if He would say: This is the eating Dread in the kingdom of God, to which you look forward; though it is Godâ€™s feast, to which God has invited, it is â€˜my supper,â€™ given in my honor, though I have come â€˜in the form of a servantâ€™ to invite you; and none of you will enter, because in refusing me, you refuse to obey the second summons of God who has before invited you through His word."
