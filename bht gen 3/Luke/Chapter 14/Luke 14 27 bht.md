# Luke 14:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly be a follower of Jesus, one must bear their own cross. Just as Jesus carried His cross, each disciple has their own unique cross to bear. This idea may have been surprising to the crowd, who may not have expected this aspect of discipleship. However, it is important to note that being a disciple is not just about becoming one, but actively embracing the responsibility of carrying our cross. This means patiently enduring all kinds of trials, reproach, afflictions, persecutions, and even death itself. Those who refuse to bear their cross in this way cannot authentically claim to be disciples of Jesus.
