# Luke 14:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, perceiving the thoughts of those who questioned him, responded to their dilemma with a rhetorical inquiry. He knew that they were watching him closely, so he proposed the question to them in order to redirect the conversation. This unexpected question visibly caught them off guard and left them speechless. Jesus cleverly used this situation to demonstrate his careful consideration of the law and his willingness to provide a valid explanation for his actions. Their silence, however, revealed their ulterior motive of finding fault rather than upholding the law.
