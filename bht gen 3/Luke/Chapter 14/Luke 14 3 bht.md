# Luke 14:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in response to the thoughts of the lawyers and Pharisees, presented a dilemma that left them silent and embarrassed. He knew that they were watching him and attempted to preemptively counter their accusations by proposing a question regarding the lawfulness of healing on the Sabbath. By doing so, Jesus revealed that he did not perform miracles on the Sabbath indiscriminately; he had a reason for his actions. It was clear that their intention was to find fault with him, but Jesus, indifferent to their opinions, focused on the compassion and need for healing in the situation at hand.
