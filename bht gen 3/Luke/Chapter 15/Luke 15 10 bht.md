# Luke 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The joy in the celestial realms is so vast and exuberant that God calls His whole celestial family together, saying, Rejoice WITH ME, for I have found My sheep-My-piece. The recovery of even one outcast is watched with interest and hailed with joy, as the great Shepherd finds and brings it back with joy. The angels, as neighbors of God, catch this flying joy and share in it. If angels rejoice in the restoration, we too should partake in the same joy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "so vast and exuberant is it ( :-), that as if He could not keep it to Himself, He 'calleth His friends and neighbors together'â€”His whole celestial familyâ€”saying, 'Rejoice WITH ME, for I have found My sheep-My-piece,' c." 
2. "In this sublime sense it is 'joy'... they only 'catch the flying joy,' sharing it with Him!"
3. "the recovery of even one such outcast is watched with interest and hailed with joy; nor are they left to come home of themselves or perish; for lo! even now the great Shepherd is going after His lost sheep, and the Owner is making diligent search for the lost property; and He is finding it, too, and bringing it back with joy, and all heaven is full of it."

### John Calvin:
1. "If angels mutually rejoice with each other in heaven, when they see that what had wandered is restored to the fold, we too, who have the same cause in common with them, ought to be partakers of the same joy." 
2. "Though it would be more agreeable to the wishes of angels (as it is also more desirable) that men should always remain in perfect integrity, yet as in the deliverance of a sinner, who had been already devoted to destruction, and had been cut off as a rotten member from the body, the mercy of God shines more brightly."
3. "The word repentance is specially limited to the conversion of those who, having altogether turned aside from God, rise as it were from death to life; for otherwise the exercise of repentance ought to be uninterrupted throughout our whole life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that is faithful, etc. Lest it should seem strange that so much importance is attached to the proper use of perishing and unrighteous wealth, remember the great principle: â€˜He that is faithful,' etc."
2. "That which is least, or 'a very little.' This refers to earthly possessions, and the faithfulness is the wise and prudent conduct suggested by the parable."
3. "In much. In this case this is equivalent to: 'the true riches,' 'your own,' the inheritance and possession of the sons of the light. But the principle is general, and capable of a great variety of applications."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is joy... joy arises." 
2. "The joy of God himself." 
3. "The angels are in a sense the neighbours of God."

### John Gill:
1. "there is joy in the presence of the angels of God" - Luke 15:10.
2. "over one sinner that repenteth" - Luke 15:10.
3. "the reason of this joy is, because there is one rescued out of the hands of Satan and his angels" - Luke 15:10.
