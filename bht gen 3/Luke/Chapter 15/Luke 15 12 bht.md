## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such a request as this is shewn by Orientalists to have been known in the East, though not among the Jews."
2. "The father, as implied in the parable, reserves to himself the power during his life over the portion of the firstborn."
3. "The parable sets before us very strikingly the permission of free will to man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is man impatient of divine control, desiring to be independent of God, seeking to be his own master that 'sin of sins, in which all subsequent sins are included as in their germ, for they are but the unfolding of this one'" [TRENCH].
2. "Thus 'God, when His service no longer appears a perfect freedom, and man promises himself something far better elsewhere, allows him to make the trial and he shall discover, if need be by saddest proof, that to depart from Him is not to throw off the yoke, but to exchange a light yoke for a heavy one, and one gracious Master for a thousand imperious tyrants and lords'" [TRENCH].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Give me the portion - The part. Of goods - Of property. That falleth to me - That is properly my share."
2. "The division of property among the Jews gave the older son twice as much as the younger."
3. "Among the ancient Romans and Syrophoenicians, it was customary, when a son came to the years of maturity, if he demanded his part of the inheritance, for the father to give it to him."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "A man might, during his lifetime, dispose of all his property by gift as he chose."

### John Calvin:
1. "Under this image our Lord unquestionably depicts to us the boundless goodness and inestimable forbearance of God, that no crimes, however aggravated, may deter us from the hope of obtaining pardon." 
2. "Christ here describes what usually happens with young men, when they are carried away by their natural disposition. Destitute of sound judgment, and maddened by passion, they are ill fitted for governing themselves, and are not restrained by fear or shame." 
3. "After having wickedly squandered their means, they are left to pine in hunger, and not having known how to use in moderation an abundant supply of the best bread, they are reduced to eat acorns and husks."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Earthly wealth is held in trust; the true riches are described as your own."
2. "Wealth can never form a part of our being, is never permanently in our possession; we can have the use of it, but in no true sense own it."
3. "But that which God gives to us as true riches will form a part of our eternal being, is our inalienable possession."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The father did not have to abdicate in favour of the sons, but 'this very human parable here depicts the impatience of home restraints and the optimistic ambition of youth' (Ragg)."
2. "And he divided (Œø Œ¥Œµ Œ¥ŒπŒµŒπŒªŒµŒΩ). The second aorist active indicative of Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœâ, an old and common verb to part in two, cut asunder, divide, but in the N.T. only here and 1 Corinthians 12:11."
3. "The elder son got his share also of the 'substance' or property or estate (œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ±œÇ), 'the living' (œÑŒøŒΩ Œ≤ŒπŒøŒΩ) as in Mark 12:44, not 'life' as in Luke 8:14."

### John Gill:
1. "God's chosen ones among the publicans and sinners, are fitly signified by the younger son, since man, as a sinner, is younger than man as righteous."
2. "The younger son...are imprudent and ignorant, without any knowledge of divine and spiritual things, and of themselves, their state and condition, and of Christ, and salvation by him..."
3. "The good things of this world belonged to men by right of creation, and according the laws and dues of it, but have been all forfeited by the sin of man and yet this is a portion, which in the apprehension of men, of right belongs to them; and which suits their nature, which is carnal and worldly."

### John Wesley:
1. Give me the part of goods that falleth to me ‚Äî See the root of all sin! A desire of disposing of ourselves; of independency on God!

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Luke 15:12, the younger son impetuously asks his father for his share of the inheritance, an action known in the East but not among the Jews. This parable illustrates the permissibility of free will and the impatience of man to be independent from God. By requesting his portion, the son symbolizes man's desire to be his own master and to seek fulfillment elsewhere, separated from the divine yoke. However, this departure from God results not in freedom, but in the exchange of a light yoke for a heavy one. The father, according to Jewish law, could distribute his property as he wished, and the younger son's entitlement to his share illustrates the ambition of youth. Ultimately, this parable depicts both the restless spirit of youth and the boundless goodness and forbearance of God, reflected in this father's responses.
