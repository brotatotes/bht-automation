# Luke 15:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prodigal son's venture into a far-off country represents his forgetfulness of God and his incorrigible nature. Intoxicated by his newfound resources, he wasted his substance in riotous living, engaging in sensual activities. By scattering his property, he severed all ties with his father and embraced a life of sinful excess. This cautionary tale reminds us of the consequences of turning away from God and the dangers of pursuing worldly desires, as wealth can enslave individuals to Mammon instead of serving God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The far-off country represents forgetfulness of God."
2. "Profligate: The old English word retchless expresses perhaps best the meaning, which is not ‚Äòunsparing,‚Äô but incorrigible, past hope of reclaim."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "not many days‚Äîintoxicated with his new-found resources, and eager for the luxury of using them at will."
2. "a far country‚Äîbeyond all danger of interference from home."
3. "riotous living‚Äî 'with harlots.' Ah! but this reaches farther than the sensualist; for 'in the deep symbolical language of Scripture fornication is the standing image of idolatry; they are in fact ever spoken of as one and the same sin, considered now in its fleshly, now in its spiritual aspect.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Gathered all together - Collected his property."
2. "Wasted his substance - Spent his property."
3. "By his wandering away - Fall into dissolute and wicked company."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All. Everything was taken out of the father's hands."
2. "Took his journey [Œ±œÄŒµŒ¥Œ∑ŒºŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ]. Answering to our phrase went abroad."
3. "Wasted [Œ¥ŒπŒµœÉŒ∫ŒøœÅœÄŒπœÉŒµŒΩ]. The word used of winnowing grain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since the proper use of wealth is for God, those who do not thus use it are slaves to Mammon."
2. "The last verse implies that wealth is not our own, this implies that when it is used as our own, the presumed owner not only does not own it, but himself belongs to it."
3. "Christianity is the service of God, socialism the service of mammon, judged by its fruits, ‚Äòearthly, sensual‚Äô and devilish."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He burned all his bridges behind him, gathering together all that he had."
2. "More exactly he scattered his property."
3. "He went the limit of sinful excesses."

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as a man has any internal substance, any considerable degree of natural knowledge, he immediately sets out from God, and employs it against him."
2. "As soon as a man has the exercise of his reason, as soon as he can think and speak, nay, as soon as he is born, he goes astray from God, speaking lies."
3. "He is for living independent of God, and his providence; he is for gathering together all for himself, in order to spend it on his lusts, and at a distance from his father."

### John Wesley:
1. He took a journey into a far country ‚Äî Far from God: God was not in all his thoughts: And squandered away his substance - All the grace he had received.
