## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I will arise and go to my FATHER â€”The change has come at last, and what a change!â€”couched in terms of such exquisite simplicity and power as if expressly framed for all heart-broken penitents."
2. "Though 'no more worthy to be called his son,' the prodigal sinner is taught to claim the defiled, but still existing relationship, asking not to be made a servant, but remaining a son to be made 'as a servant,' willing to take the lowest place and do the meanest work."
3. "That is conversionâ€”nothing absolutely new, yet all new old familiar things seen in a new light and for the first time as realities of overwhelming magnitude and power."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If 'God' does not save him he cannot be saved. There is no other being that has an arm strong enough to deliver from sin."
2. "One evidence of the genuineness of repentance is the feeling that our sins have been committed chiefly against 'God.'"
3. "A true penitent will be as ready to 'acknowledge' his offences against his fellow-men as those against his Maker."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Correct reflection led to remembrance of the father, that feeling led to resolve and corresponding action." 
2. "There can be no return to God which does not include the confession of sin."
3. "He alone really confesses his sins, who has regarded them mainly as sins against God, against a higher, heavenly order of things; and this is the best sign that a sinner has come to himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I will arise and go. This determination is the act of the will after he comes to himself and sees his real condition."
2. "I did sin. That is the hard word to say and he will say it first. The word means to miss the mark."
3. "I shot my bolt and I missed my aim."

### John Gill:

2. "I have sinned against heaven; by preferring earthly things to heavenly ones; and have sinned openly in the face of the heavens, who were witnesses against him; and against God, who dwells in heaven." 
3. "Sin may be committed against a man, and not before him, or he not know it; but whatever is committed against God, is before him, it is in his sight, he knows it."

### John Wesley:
1. I will arise and go to my father â€” How accurately are the first steps of true repentance here pointed out! Against Heaven - Against God.
