## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The change has come at last, and what a change!‚Äîcouched in terms of such exquisite simplicity and power as if expressly framed for all heart-broken penitents."
2. "Father, c.‚ÄîMark the term. Though 'no more worthy to be called his son,' the prodigal sinner is taught to claim the defiled, but still existing relationship, asking not to be made a servant, but remaining a son to be made 'as a servant,' willing to take the lowest place and do the meanest work."
3. "That is conversion‚Äînothing absolutely new, yet all new old familiar things seen in a new light and for the first time as realities of overwhelming magnitude and power."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He has nowhere else to go but to 'God.' He has offended him, but he may trust in his kindness. If 'God' does not save him he cannot be saved."
2. "It is also to be observed that one evidence of the genuineness of repentance is the feeling that our sins have been committed chiefly against 'God.'"
3. "A true penitent will be as ready to 'acknowledge' his offenses against his fellow-men as those against his Maker."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Correct reflection led to remembrance of the father, that feeling led to resolve and corresponding action." 
2. "There can be no return to God which does not include the confession of sin."
3. "He alone really confesses his sins, who has regarded them mainly as sins against God, against a higher, heavenly order of things."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I will arise and go (Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ±œÇ œÄœÅŒøœÅŒµœÖœÉŒøŒºŒ±). This determination is the act of the will after he comes to himself and sees his real condition."
2. "I did sin (Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒøŒΩ). That is the hard word to say and he will say it first. The word means to miss the mark."
3. "I shot my bolt and I missed my aim (compare the high-handed demand in verse Luke 15:12)."

### John Gill:
1. "He determines to quit the country, and his companions; he had left his harlots, and his old course of living before, but was in the same country still; for this a man may do, and yet remain unregenerate: but he is now for leaving the country itself, and his new acquaintance; he is now determined to drop his legal preacher, to be gone out of his fields, and from under his ministry, and to leave his swine and husks." 
2. "Not to his old companions in debauchery and sin; nor to his elder brother, the Pharisees; he had made trial of both these to his cost already; nor to his father's servants, but to his father himself; to which he was moved and encouraged, from his being ready to perish, from the fulness of bread in his father's house and from the relation he stood in to him; notwithstanding, all that had passed, he was his father, and a kind and merciful one."
3. "Sin may be committed against a man, and not before him, or he not know it; but whatever is committed against God, is before him, it is in his sight, he knows it: he is God omniscient, though sinners take no notice of this perfection of his, but go on in sin, as if it was not seen, known, and observed by God."

### John Wesley:
1. I will arise and go to my father ‚Äî How accurately are the first steps of true repentance here pointed out! Against Heaven - Against God.
