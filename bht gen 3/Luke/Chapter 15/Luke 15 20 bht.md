## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What he has resolved, he does: a figure not of the usual, but of the proper course of such a state of mind."
2. "Who can say whether this itself was not a seeking? whether his courage would have held out to the meeting?"
3. "On what follows, see especially Jer. iii. 12; James iv. 8; Gen. xlvi. 29; 2 Sam. xiv. 33."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "our Father who art in heaven," is this Thy portraiture? It is even so
3. "And because it is so, I wonder not that such incomparable teaching hath made the world new."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not 'run,' but came driven by his wants, and, as we may suppose, filled with shame, and even with some doubts whether his father would receive him."
2. "The beauty of the picture is greatly heightened by these circumstances. The son came slowly - the father 'ran.' The love and joy of the old man were so great that he hastened to meet him and welcome him to his home."
3. "In this verse of inimitable beauty is contained the point of the parable, which was uttered by the Saviour to vindicate 'his own conduct' in receiving sinners kindly. Who could 'blame' this father for thus receiving his repenting son?"

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "If men, who are by nature prone to revenge, and too tenacious of their own rights, are moved by fatherly love kindly to forgive their children, and freely to bring them back, when they are sunk in wretchedness, God, whose boundless goodness exceeds all the affection of parents, will not treat us more harshly."
2. "As this father, therefore, is not merely pacified by the entreaties of his son, but meets him when he is coming, and before he has heard a word, embraces him, filthy and ugly as he is, so God does not wait for a long prayer, but of his own free will meets the sinner as soon as he proposes to confess his fault."
3. "It is wretched sophistry to infer from this, that the grace of God is not exhibited to sinners until they anticipate it by their repentance. It is, no doubt, true that, in order to his obtaining pardon, the sinner is required to have grief of conscience, and to be dissatisfied with himself; but it is wrong to infer from this, that repentance, which is the gift of God, is yielded by men from their own movement of their heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The father seems to have expected him; God certainly expects the penitent sinner."
2. "The fatherâ€™s conduct is itself a seeking of the lost son. God is waiting to be gracious; He comes to meet us in His mercy; He manifests it before our penitent utterances."
3. "The token and seal of love. â€˜The Saviour and mediator is concealed in the kissâ€™ (Riggenbach)."

### John Wesley:

2. "Returning, starved, naked."
3. "While he was yet a great way off, his father saw him."
