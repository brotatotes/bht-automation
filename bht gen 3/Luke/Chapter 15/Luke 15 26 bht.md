# Luke 15:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant eagerly and repeatedly inquired about what these things might be, as he stood outside, feeling offended and jealous of the joy he was excluded from. This servant, not a bondslave, expressed his curiosity, while the Scribes and Pharisees, being self-righteous, lacked understanding of the Gospel and were ignorant of their own lost state and the deliverance available to them. Their joy was confined to themselves and their own works, leaving them unaware of the deeper spiritual joy they were missing out on.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Inquired [ÎµÏ€Ï…Î½Î¸Î±Î½ÎµÏ„Î¿] . Imperfect. Began to inquire.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "One of the servants. Not the same word as in Luke 15:22; probably an inferior domestic in the permanent employ of the householder, but now standing without."
2. "What these things might be. Offended that this should take place without his knowledge; jealous of the joy in which he would not share."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Servants (Ï€Î±Î¹Î´Ï‰Î½). Not Î´Î¿Ï…Î»Î¿ (bondslaves) as in verse Luke 15:22. The Greeks often used Ï€Î±Î¹Ï‚ for servant like the Latin puer." 
2. "He inquired (ÎµÏ€Ï…Î½Î¸Î±Î½ÎµÏ„Î¿). Imperfect middle, inquired repeatedly and eagerly." 
3. "What these things might be (Ï„ Î±Î½ ÎµÎ¹Î· Ï„Î±Ï…Ï„Î±). Not 'poor' Greek as Easton holds, but simply the form of the direct question retained in the indirect."

### John Gill:
1. "For self-righteous persons, as these Scribes and Pharisees were, are ignorant of the truths of the Gospel."
2. "They are strangers to themselves, their lost state and condition, and a deliverance out of it."
3. "The rejoicing of such persons is only in themselves, and in their own works and duties; but as for true solid spiritual joy, they intermeddle not with it, nor know they what it means."

His curiosity was fueled by the offense and jealousy he felt for being left out of the joyous celebration. The self-righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees blinded them to the truths of the Gospel. They were strangers to their own lost state and condition, lacking understanding of deliverance.
