# Luke 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as a father pities his children, the Lord also pities those who fear Him. The elder brother's deep-seated wrath and refusal to join the celebration display his long-standing resentment and suspicion of his father's favor towards his wayward sibling. Despite the anger, the father continues to entreat the elder brother, urging him to come inside. Through this parable, Jesus highlights the injustice of questioning another's forgiveness and complaining about their brother receiving mercy. This challenges the self-righteous and their rejection of grace and salvation.
