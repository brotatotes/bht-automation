## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I will not count such an impure person my brother."
2. "A charitable addition on the part of the elder brother, such as those represented by him always take care to make under similar circumstances."
3. "Thou hast not only made him equal to me, but hast received him into superior favour."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This thy son - This son of 'thine.' This is an expression of great contempt."
2. "Never was there a more striking instance of petty malice, or more unjustifiable disregard of a fatherâ€™s conduct and will."
3. "It was true that the younger son had been guilty, and foolish, and ungrateful; but he was penitent, and 'that' was of more consequence to the father than all his property."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This thy son. Not my brother, but with the bitterest sarcasm."
2. "Was come [Î·Î»Î¸ÎµÎ½]. He says came, as of a stranger. Not returned."
3. "Devoured [ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Ï†Î±Î³Ï‰Î½]. We say 'eat up;' the Greek said 'eat down' [ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±]. The word is suggested, no doubt, by the mention of the calf, the kid, and the feasting."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Came (Î·Î»Î¸ÎµÎ½). He does not even say, came back or came home." 
3. "Devoured (ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Ï†Î±Î³Ï‰Î½). We say, 'eaten up,' but the Greek has, 'eaten down' (perfective use of ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±-). Suggested by the feasting going on."

### John Gill:
1. "The elder brother would have had another method taken with this younger son: he would have had him soundly whipped with the rod of the law, for his former sins; and sent into the fields along with him to work out his salvation; and not to have a rag put upon him, or a shoe on his foot, or a morsel of bread given him, till he had earned them..." 
2. "But instead of this, to be received and entertained in the manner he was, and so soon, highly provoked him: for he thought such a conduct was unbecoming God, and his moral perfections; and what his brother was undeserving of; and opened a door to, licentiousness; and highly reflected on his services, as of no value and regard."
3. "Thou hast killed for him the fatted calf."
