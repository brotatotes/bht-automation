## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Father still asserts the restored sonship of his returned prodigalâ€”this thy brother."
2. "The difficulties which have been found in the latter part of the parable [...] are considerably lightened by the consideration."
3. "We are all in turn examples of the cases of both these brothers, containing the seeds of both evil courses in our hearts: but, thanks be to God, under that grace, which is sufficient and willing to seek and save us from both."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The deeper sunk and the longer estranged any sinner is, the more exuberant is the joy which his recovery occasions."
2. "Such joy is not the portion of those whose whole lives have been spent in the service of their Father in heaven."
3. "Instead of grudging the want of this, they should deem it the highest testimony to their lifelong fidelity, that something better is reserved for themâ€”the deep, abiding complacency of their Father in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The claim rested upon a correct principle: â€˜the doers of the law shall be justifiedâ€™ (Romans 2:13), but the character of the elder son is so portrayed as to indicate that he failed to stand on that principle." 
2. "The New Testament loses no opportunity for prophesying the ultimate salvation of Israel, and such a prediction would least of all fail in a parable where love and forbearance alone are depicted."
3. "All of us, in whom sin remains, are represented by one or the other of those two sons. Both were offenders, yet the Father calls both sons, and would save both lasses of sinners here depicted."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A real father could do no less."
2. "Luke was called a painter by the ancients. Certainly he has produced a graphic pen picture here of God's love for the lost that justifies forever the coming of Christ to the world to seek and to save the lost."
3. "It glorifies also soul-saving on the part of his followers who are willing to go with Jesus after the lost in city and country, in every land and of every race."

### John Gill:
1. "It was meet that we should make merry... and this elder brother also, because of the relation he stood in to him." 
2. "If he had had the same spiritual affection the apostle had for his brethren and kinsmen... he would have rejoiced at the conversion and return of sinners by repentance." 
3. "For this thy brother... was dead, and is alive again, and was lost, and is found."

### John Wesley:
1. "Amazing intimation, that the best of men ought to account the worst sinners their brethren still; and should especially remember this relation, when they show any inclination to return."
2. "Our Lord in this whole parable shows, not only that the Jews had no cause to murmur at the reception of the Gentiles, but that if the Pharisees were indeed as good as they fancied themselves to be, still they had no reason to murmur at the kind treatment of any sincere penitent."
3. "Let no elder brother murmur at this indulgence, but rather welcome the prodigal back into the family. And let those who have been thus received, wander no more, but emulate the strictest piety of those who for many years have served their heavenly Father, and not transgressed his commandments."
