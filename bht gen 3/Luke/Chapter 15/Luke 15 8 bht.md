1. "Ten pieces of silver (Œ¥œÅŒ±œáŒºŒ±œÇ Œ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±). The only instance in the N.T. of this old word for a coin of 65.5 grains about the value of the common Œ¥Œ∑ŒΩŒ±œÅŒπœÖœÇ (about eighteen cents), a quarter of a Jewish shekel."

2. "By this candle is meant, the Gospel itself; which, like a candle, is lighted up in the evening of the world; and may be removed, as it sometimes is, from place to place; and where it is set, and blessed, it gives light, and is useful both to work and walk by."
3. "The diligence, care, and circumspection of Christ, to find out lost sinners, while the Gospel is preaching, are here signified: it is not the preacher that looks out for them, though he that is a faithful minister of the word performs his office diligently and carefully, and he desires nothing more earnestly than the conversion of sinners; but then he knows not who are, and who are not the elect of God, and is ignorant of what Christ is doing, whilst he is preaching."
