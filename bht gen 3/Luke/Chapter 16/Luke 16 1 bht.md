# Luke 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As stewards entrusted with God's property, we each have a varying degree of responsibility to carry out. The real guilt lies in wasting our Heavenly Father's goods, which can be seen as spiritually guilty. Just as the steward in this parable was accused of wasting his master's goods, we too may be accused by the analogy of 'the Accuser of the brethren.' This parable exposes the faults of the Pharisees and warns against trying to serve both God and mammon, as it will only lead to difficulty and sin.

2. "This parable has given great perplexity, and many ways have been devised to explain it. The above solution is the most simple of any; and if these plain principles are kept in view, it will not be difficult to give a consistent explanation of its particular parts."
3. "It should be borne in mind, however, that in this, as well as in other parables, we are not to endeavor to spiritualize every circumstance or allusion. We are to keep in view the great moral truth taught in it, that we cannot serve God and mammon, and that all attempts to do this will involve us in difficulty and sin."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ does not advise us to purchase by large donations the forgiveness of fraud, and of extortion, and of wasteful expenditure, and of the other crimes associated with unfaithful administration."
2. "They who imagine that alms are a sufficient compensation for sensuality and debauchery, do not sufficiently consider, that the first injunction given us is, to live in sobriety and temperance."
3. "...our Lord now lays down a method of procedure, which will protect us against being treated with rigor when we come to render our account."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The three preceding parables in chapter 15 exposed the special faults of the Pharisees, 'their hard exclusiveness, self-righteousness, and contempt for others' (Plummer)."
2. "It is a hard parable to explain, but Jesus opens the door by the key in verse Luke 16:9."

### John Gill:
1. "God is meant, who is rich in the perfections of his nature, in the works of his hands, in his government, and the administration of it, in providential goodness, and in the large revenues of glory due to him from his creatures; for all temporal riches are from him; and so are all the riches of mercy, grace, and glory."
2. "The Pharisees are meant: for these are taken notice of as gravelled at this parable... and to them agrees the character of the men of this world, who were worldly wise men; as also that of a steward; these are the tutors and governors mentioned in Galatians 4:2..."
3. "And the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods; put false glosses upon the Scriptures; fed the family with bad and unwholesome food, the traditions of the elders, called the leaven of the Pharisees: made havoc of the souls of men; and made the hearts of the righteous sad: and hardened sinners in their wicked ways..."
