# Luke 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wealth of this world is another manâ€™sâ€” forfeited by sinâ€” only put into our hands to try us and to be rendered an account of. Here all we have is on trust as stewards, who have an account to render. Riches are not ours, but given us in trust. Earthly wealth is ours as a loan, a trust, withdrawn at any moment. If you did not prove faithful in this, who will give you what is really yours forever? Our true possession lies in the eternal blessings of heaven, bestowed upon us if we are faithful stewards.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The wealth of this world is not truly ours, but rather a temporary possession granted to us to test our faithfulness. As stewards, we are reminded that we have an obligation to give an account of how we have used our resources. We should neither idolize nor despise money, but rather use it for God's glory. Earthly riches are merely a loan, a trust that can be withdrawn at any moment. Our true wealth lies in being rich towards God and possessing our eternal inheritance, where we will have secure and everlasting possession and enjoyment of all that is graciously bestowed upon us.
