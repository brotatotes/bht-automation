## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The significant name Lazarus and Eleazarus, the same as Eleazar,‚Äîand meaning, God is my help, should have prevented the expositors from imagining this to be a true history."
2. "Perhaps by this name our Lord may have intended to fill in the character of the poor man, which indeed must otherwise be understood to be that of one who feared God."
3. "He was, or had been‚Äîcast down, i.e. was placed there on purpose to get what he could of alms."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 20, 21. laid‚Äîhaving to be
	carried and put down. 
	
full of sores‚Äîopen,
	running, "not closed, nor bound up, nor mollified with ointment"
	(Isaiah 1:6).


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is a striking evidence of the deep impression which this parable has made on the mind of Christendom, that the term lazar should have passed into so many languages as it has, losing altogether its signification as a proper name."
2. "Was laid [ŒµŒ≤ŒµŒ≤ŒªŒ∑œÑŒø] . Lit., was thrown: cast carelessly down by his bearers and left there."
3. "The gateway, often separated from the house or temple. In Matthew 26:71, it is rendered porch."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The significant name is mentioned in this case. It means ‚ÄòGod a help,‚Äô not, as some suppose, ‚Äòhelpless.‚Äô"
2. "The beggar was one who feared God."
3. "Covered with them. They might have been the result of insufficient food."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The name Lazarus is from ŒïŒªŒµŒ±Œ∂Œ±œÅŒøœÇ, 'God a help,' and was a common one."
2. "He had been flung there and was still there, 'as if contemptuous roughness is implied.'"
3. "Full of sores (ŒµŒπŒªŒ∫œâŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ). Perfect passive participle of ŒµŒªŒ∫Œøœâ, to make sore, to ulcerate, from ŒµŒªŒ∫ŒøœÇ, ulcer."

### John Gill:
1. "And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus..."
2. "...the mean and despicable condition of Christ in this world..."
3. "...the exaltation of Christ hereafter, when they would be in the utmost distress..."

### John Wesley:
1. "By his name it may be conjectured, he was of no mean family, though it was thus reduced."
2. "Theophylact observes, from the tradition of the Hebrews, that he lived at Jerusalem."
3. "It seems this circumstance is recorded to show that all his ulcers lay bare, and were not closed or bound up."
