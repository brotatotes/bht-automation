# Luke 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this poignant depiction, we witness the striking contrast between the rich man's indifference and Lazarus's dire circumstances. Even though Lazarus longed for the crumbs from the rich man's table, his only companions were dogs who graciously licked his sores. This scene showcases a heartless disregard for one of God's most impoverished and suffering individuals. It remains unclear whether the licking of Lazarus's sores by the dogs added to his misery or offered a degree of solace in his helpless condition. Nonetheless, the rich man's failure to extend compassion is powerfully condemned.

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "his desire was towards them from everlasting, when he asked them of his Father, and they were given to him; and it was not only after their persons, but after their salvation, and that both in eternity and in time; and which he signified by various words and actions."
