## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Though it is unnatural to suppose that our Lord would in such a parable formally reveal any new truth respecting the state of the dead,â€”yet, in conforming himself to the ordinary language current on these subjects, it is impossible to suppose that He, whose essence is Truth, could have assumed as existing any thing which does not exist."
2. "The expression Abraham's bosom signified the happy side of HadÃ«s, where all the Fathers were conceived as resting in bliss."
3. "The death of the rich man last should be remarked; Lazarus was taken soon from his sufferings; Dives was left longer, that he might have space to repent."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His burial was too unimportant to mention; while 'the rich man died and was buried'â€”his carcass carried in pomp to its earthly resting-place."
2. "As if seen reclining next to Him at the heavenly feast."
3. "His burial was too unimportant to mention; while 'the rich man died and was buried'â€”his carcass carried in pomp to its earthly resting-place."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews held the opinion that the spirits of the righteous were conveyed by angels to heaven at their death."
2. "Angels are ministering spirits sent forth to minister to those who are heirs of salvation."
3. "To say that Lazarus was in [Abraham's] bosom was... to say that he was admitted to heaven and made happy there."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Abraham 's bosom. A Rabbinical phrase, equivalent to being with Abraham in Paradise. "To the Israelite Abraham seems the personal center and meeting - point of Paradise" (Goebel).


### John Calvin:
1. "In the person of Lazarus there is held out to us a striking proof that we ought not to pronounce men to be accursed by God, because they drag out, in incessant pain, a life which is full of distresses."
2. "The rich man, on the other hand, buried magnificently according to his wealth, still retains some remnant of his former pride."
3. "As the grace of God is more clearly revealed to us in the Gospel, and as Christ himself, the Sun of Righteousness, has brought to us that salvation, which the fathers were formerly permitted to behold at a distance and under dark shadows, so there cannot be a doubt that believers, when they die, make a nearer approach to the enjoyment of the heavenly life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And was borne away. His soul is meant (so the Rabbins taught) in contrast to the burial of the body of the rich man."
2. "By the angels. To be taken literally. The implied contrast is with the pall-bearers at the rich manâ€™s funeral."
3. "Into Abrahamâ€™s bosom. This was, among the Jews, a metaphorical expression for the state of blessedness after death. It is not exactly equivalent to â€˜heaven,â€™ but rather to â€˜Paradiseâ€™ (Luke 23:43), the happy side of the state of the dead."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To be in Abraham's bosom is to the Jew to be in Paradise."
2. "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are in heaven and welcome those who come."
3. "The beloved disciple reclined on the bosom of Jesus at the last passover and this fact indicates special favor."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ died not merely as an example to them, or only to confirm his doctrines; but as a substitute, in the room and stead of his people; to atone for their sins, and satisfy divine justice; to procure the pardon of them in a way of justice; to take them away, and utterly abolish them; to bring in an everlasting righteousness; to obtain eternal redemption, and bring such nigh to God who were afar off." 
2. "Abraham's bosom came to signify the near and intimate enjoyment of happiness with him in the other world."
3. "The reason is, because Christ lay so short a time in the grave, and he was not left there, nor did he see corruption but in a very little while was raised from the dead, and delivered from the power of the grave; when, after some stay on earth, he was attended by angels to the highest heavens."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the beggar â€” Worn out with hunger, and pain, and want of all things, died: and was carried by angels (amazing change of the scene!) into Abraham's bosom." 
2. "So the Jews styled paradise; the place where the souls of good men remain from death to the resurrection."
3. "That stupid, senseless pageantry, that shocking insult on a poor, putrefying carcass, was reserved for our enlightened age!"
