# Luke 16:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The steward finds himself faced with the harsh reality of poverty due to his life of luxury and inability to perform honest work. The mention of digging and begging serves as an introduction to the scheme that follows, without any deeper meaning. His dismissal is impending, but his pampered existence has made him ill-suited for manual labor. His guilty conscience over embezzlement drives his desperate actions as he seeks to secure his own survival, even if it means resorting to actions he would normally find shameful.

2. "Nothing was meaner among the Jews than husbandry."
3. "To ask anything at the throne of grace, in a way of mere grace and favour, and not merit: or to beg anything at the hands of Christ, as life, righteousness, pardon, cleansing, healing, food, &c. they were ashamed of, and cared not for."
