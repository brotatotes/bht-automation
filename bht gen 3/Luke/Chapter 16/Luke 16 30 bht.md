# Luke 16:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This plea reveals the ineffectiveness of relying on miracles alone to convince those determined not to believe. Genuine repentance is what truly matters, not wealth, poverty, alms, or influence. The hardened hearts of the Pharisees, unswayed even by the resurrection of Lazarus, illustrate the need for a true change of heart. Repentance is not something to be reserved for others; it is the essential lacking element in every person. Therefore, the focus should be on embracing repentance and heeding the word of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nayâ€”not, â€˜they will not hear them:â€™ he could not tell that, and besides, it would have taken away much of the ground of the answer of Abraham."
2. "The word deprecates leaving their salvation in such uncertainty, as the chance of their hearing Moses and the prophets seems to him to imply."
3. "Leave it not so, when it might be at once and for ever done by sending them one from the dead."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nayâ€”giving the lie to Abraham."
2. "The greatest miracle will have no effect on those who are determined not to believe."
3. "A real Lazarus soon 'rose from the dead,' but the sight of him by crowds of people, inclined thereby to Christ, only crowned the unbelief and hastened the murderous plots of the Pharisees against the Lord of glory; nor has His own resurrection, far more overpowering, yet won over that 'crooked and perverse nation.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They have heard them so long in vain, that there is no prospect now that they will attend to the message."
2. "But if one should go to them directly from the eternal world they would hear him."
3. "The novelty of the message would attract their attention, and they would listen to what he would say."

### John Calvin:
1. "The doctrine of the Law is little esteemed by the world, the Prophets are neglected, and no man submits to hear God speaking in his own manner."
2. "Faith does not depend on miracles, or any extraordinary sign, but is the peculiar gift of the Spirit, and is produced by means of the word."
3. "There is not the slightest reason, therefore, to expect that those means, which withdraw us from obedience to the word, will be of any service to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nay, father Abraham. This scarcely means: they will not hear them, but rather, Nay, but make the matter more sure."
2. "The advocate of more decided 'spiritual manifestations' is a lost and still impenitent soul."
3. "Without real discernment as to the best means of grace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is not wealth, not poverty, not alms, not influence, but repentance that is needed."
2. "He had thought repentance was for others, not for all."
3. "Repentance is the one thing lacking."

### John Gill:
1. "This way he suggests, was not so right, and would not succeed; for he knew his brethren were a rebellious, and stiffnecked people, and would not hear Moses and the prophets, notwithstanding all their outward boast of them, and pretensions of regard to them." 
2. "but alas! repentance is not of man's will, but a gift of God's grace; nor could these men repent, because in a judicial way their eyes were shut, their ears were stopped, and their hearts were hardened."
3. "though Christ came in person to them, and preached, as never man did, with power and authority, and confirmed his doctrine with miracles, yet they repented not, nor did they when he arose from the dead."
