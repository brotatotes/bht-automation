## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Take thy bill...sit down is graphic." 
2. "Quickly implies the hurry with which the furtive business is transacted."
3. "The debtors seem to be all together, that all may be implicated and none may tell of the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A hundred measures - The measure here mentioned is the 'bath' which contained, according to Dr. Arbuthnot's tables, 7 12 gallons, or, according to the marginal note, about 9 gallons and 3 quarts."
2. "Thy bill - The contract, obligation, or 'lease.' It was probably written as a 'promise' by the debtor and signed by the steward, and thus became binding. Thus he had power to alter it, without supposing that his master would detect it. The bill or contract was in the hands of the steward, and he gave it back to him to write a new one."
3. "Quickly - He supposed that his master would soon remove him, and he was, therefore, in haste to have all things secure beforehand. It is worthy of remark, also, that 'all' this was wrong. His master had called for the account: but, instead of rendering it, he engaged in other business, disobeyed his lord still, and, in contempt of his commands, sought his own interest. All sinners would be slow to give in their account to God if they could do it; and it is only because, when God calls them by death, they 'cannot but go,' that they do not engage still in their own business and disobey him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The bath was a Hebrew measure, but the amount is uncertain, since, according to Edersheim, there were three kinds of measurement in use in Palestine."
2. "The bill is the bond which the buyer has given, and which is in the steward's keeping. He gives it back to the debtor for him to alter the figures."
3. "It was a secret transaction, to be hurried through."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Measures (Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøœÖœÇ). Transliterated word for Hebrew bath, between eight and nine gallons." 
2. "Thy bond (œÉŒøœÖ œÑŒ± Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒ±). Thy writings, thy contracts, thy note." 
3. "Quickly (œÑŒ±œáŒµœâœÇ). It was a secret arrangement and speed was essential."

### John Gill:
1. "And he said an hundred measures of oil....which illustrates the above observation, that they were for the temple service..." 
2. "Take thy bill, or 'writing'; which showed the bargain made for so many measures; and which acknowledged the receipt of them, and promised payment..." 
3. "and write fifty; just half; that it might appear he had bought but fifty, and was accountable for no more."
