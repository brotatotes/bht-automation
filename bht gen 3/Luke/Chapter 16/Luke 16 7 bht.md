# Luke 16:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The varying deductions from the debts of different debtors in this context may not hold any significant meaning but rather reflect their unique circumstances. The term cors refers to a Hebrew measure, potentially for dry goods, equivalent to approximately ten bushels. The mention of the bill symbolizes the insufficiency of the Jews in adhering to the law, which is seen as a mere letter lacking strength and direction. This suggests that the Pharisees and teachers may have compromised by teaching that imperfect righteousness is acceptable.
