# Luke 16:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The varying amounts deducted from the debts of the different debtors reflect their different circumstances. The use of measures such as cors or kor refers to a unit of measurement in the ancient Jewish culture. The mention of oil and wheat may allude to the observance of the ceremonial law and the Jews' deficiency in meeting its requirements. The bill mentioned could refer to the law itself, which is a mere letter giving instructions without the power to fulfill them. This highlights the danger of teaching that an imperfect righteousness suffices, dishonoring God's justice and holiness.

3. "We may easily conceive a reason, if we will, in the different circumstances of the debtors."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Inasmuch now as oil and wheat were things expended in the observance of the ceremonial law, and these men's debts lay in them, it may have regard to the deficiency of the Jews in those things."
2. "Wherefore by 'the bill' may be meant the law; and which is sometimes called by the same name as here, Œ≥œÅŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ±, the 'writing', or 'letter', 2 Corinthians 3:6 and is so called, not merely because it was written in letters; but because it is a mere letter, showing only what is to be done and avoided, without giving strength to perform, or pointing where it is to be had."
3. "They compounded the matter with the people, as some men do now, and taught them, that an imperfect righteousness would do in the room of a perfect one: a doctrine very pleasing to men, and which never fails of gaining an access into the hearts and houses of carnal men; though very injurious to God, and to his divine perfections, particularly his justice and holiness."
