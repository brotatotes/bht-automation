## BHT:
It is inadmissible for offenses not to come, possibly due to the departure of the Pharisees and their conduct. This was concerning because it may have negatively influenced the new disciples. The impossibility of these offenses not happening is due to the decree of God, the work of Satan, the wickedness of men, and the corruption of their principles and practices. However, woe is unto those who cause these stumbling blocks.
