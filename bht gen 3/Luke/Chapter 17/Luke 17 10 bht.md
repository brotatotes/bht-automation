# Luke 17:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In serving God, we must remember that we cannot claim any merit or profit for ourselves. Our duty as servants is to fulfill what is expected of us, without expecting repayment. While our service is not useless, we should not imagine that we have benefited God or laid Him under any obligation. Rather, it is by His grace that our good works hold any value and merit an eternal reward.

- Attempt 3 BHT: We, as servants of God, must recognize that our service to Him is not a means to earn favor or benefit God in any way. Instead, we are called to go above and beyond our obligations, going beyond mere commands and responding to the demands that arise out of special emergencies. Our goal should not be to gain merit or credit, for we have already been given grace and salvation through Christ. In serving God, we acknowledge that we owe Him everything, and it is through His grace that our works hold any value and lead to an eternal reward. Thus, we must humbly see ourselves as unprofitable servants, finding happiness in our willingness to acknowledge our dependence on God rather than seeking validation or reward.
