## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  15.] The words here set before us something immediate, and, I should be inclined to think, witnessed by the narrator.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is uncertain if he returned when they were halfway, and Lukeâ€™s words appear to imply this; but I think it more probable, that it was not till he had heard the decision of the priests that he returned to give thanks." 
2. "Some will perhaps be better pleased with a different conjecture, that as soon as he saw that he was cleansed, and before he applied to the priests for a testimony, he was seized with a devout and holy zeal, and returned to the Author of the cure, so as to commence his sacrifice with thanksgiving."
3. "The words of Christ contain an expostulation with the whole nation; for it is by way of reproach that he draws a comparison between one stranger and many Jews, because it was customary with them to swallow up Godâ€™s favors without any feeling of piety."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The description is graphic, the healing took place immediately."
2. "They were still on their way to the priests."
3. "Glorifying God and love to Jesus Christ are closely joined."

### John Gill:
1. "gratitude is a rare thing, it is found but in few; unthankfulness cleaves to most persons; it is the general character of men to be unthankful and unholy"
2. "no man will seek after a cure, till he sees, or is sensible of his sickness and his wound; and when he does, he will inquire after, and make use of the proper means of healing"
3. "it becomes such who are cured of the leprosy of sin, to glorify God; not only with their mouths, by bringing their offering and sacrifice of praise to him... but by deeds also, with their bodies, and with their spirits"
