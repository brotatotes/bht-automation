# Luke 17:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the story of the ten cleansed lepers, Jesus' omniscience is evident as he asks about the nine who did not return to express gratitude. This incident reflects the reception that Christ would receive from the Jews and Gentiles. While the nine fulfilled their duty as Jews by going to the priest, their lack of personal gratitude is apparent. Only the Samaritan leper demonstrated genuine gratitude by returning to acknowledge the grace of Christ. This story serves as a reminder than while many claim to be cleansed by Christ, true gratitude is rare.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17, 18. Were there not ten
	cleansedâ€”rather, were not the ten cleansed? that is, the
	whole of themâ€”an example (by the way) of Christ's omniscience
	[BENGEL].


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The incident is prophetic of the reception accorded to Christ by the Jews and heathen respectively."
2. "Where are the nine? They had doubtless gone to the priest, feeling that this was their chief duty as Jews, and been declared clean. Some gratitude they had, but the personal gratitude which takes the form of lave they lacked."
3. "They had enough of faith to receive bodily healing, but it is left uncertain whether they received any spiritual benefit."

### John Gill:
1. "They are many, that are cleansed by the blood of Christ; his blood was shed for many, for the remission of sins; and by his righteousness, he justifies many; at least there are many who profess themselves to be cleansed by him, and yet there are but few that glorify him."
2. "Christ's flock, which is separated from the world, and walks in Gospel order, within the inclosures of it, is but a little flock; they are but a few names in Sardis, who have not defiled themselves, with corruptions in doctrine and discipline."
3. "Ingratitude is a crime many are guilty of, and it is highly resented by Christ; instances of gratitude are few, but as one in ten; now and then a single Samaritan, a stranger, one that has been a vile sinner, comes and acknowledges the grace of Christ in cleansing him."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The story of the ten cleansed lepers in Luke 17:17 is not only a display of Jesus' omniscience, but also a foreshadowing of the reception he would receive from the Jews and the Gentiles. While nine of the lepers went to the priest for their cleansing, lacking personal gratitude, only one Samaritan returned to express his love and thanks to Jesus. This incident reminds us that many may receive physical healing or claim to be cleansed by Christ, but few truly glorify him and display genuine gratitude. Ingratitude is a widespread sin, and only a few, like the single Samaritan, humble themselves to acknowledge the grace of Christ.
