## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17, 18. Were there not ten
	cleansedâ€”rather, were not the ten cleansed? that is, the
	whole of themâ€”an example (by the way) of Christ's omniscience
	[BENGEL].


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The incident is prophetic of the reception accorded to Christ by the Jews and heathen respectively."
2. "Where are the nine? They had doubtless gone to the priest, feeling that this was their chief duty as Jews, and been declared clean. Some gratitude they had, but the personal gratitude which takes the form of lave they lacked."
3. "They had enough of faith to receive bodily healing, but it is left uncertain whether they received any spiritual benefit."

### John Gill:
1. "They are many, that are cleansed by the blood of Christ; his blood was shed for many, for the remission of sins; and by his righteousness, he justifies many; at least there are many who profess themselves to be cleansed by him, and yet there are but few that glorify him."
2. "Christ's flock, which is separated from the world, and walks in Gospel order, within the inclosures of it, is but a little flock; they are but a few names in Sardis, who have not defiled themselves, with corruptions in doctrine and discipline."
3. "Ingratitude is a crime many are guilty of, and it is highly resented by Christ; instances of gratitude are few, but as one in ten; now and then a single Samaritan, a stranger, one that has been a vile sinner, comes and acknowledges the grace of Christ in cleansing him."

This incident not only foreshadows the reception that Christ would later receive from Jews and Gentiles, but it also serves as a powerful reminder of the lack of personal gratitude exhibited by the nine who failed to express their thanks to Jesus. Though they were physically healed, it remains uncertain whether they received any spiritual benefit from their encounter with Christ. This reflection on ingratitude highlights the reality that while many may claim to be cleansed by Christ, few actually glorify Him and express gratitude for His grace and forgiveness.

- Attempt 5 BHT: The story of the ten cleansed lepers in Luke 17:17 showcases the omniscience of Christ. While all ten were cleansed, only one returned to express gratitude and give thanks.

The other nine, focusing on their duty as Jews, lacked personal gratitude and failed to understand the deeper spiritual benefit of their healing. This demonstrates the unfortunate reality that though many are cleansed by Christ's blood, few truly glorify Him in return.
