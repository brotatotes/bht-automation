## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Samaritans were Gentiles;—not a mixed race, as is sometimes erroneously supposed."
2. "There may have been a reason for the nine Jews not returning,—that they held the ceremonial duty imposed on them to be paramount, which the Samaritan might not rate so highly."
3. "That he was going to Mount Gerizim does not appear: from his being found with Jews, he probably would act as a Jew."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 18. this stranger—"this
	alien" (literally, "of another race"). The language is
	that of wonder and admiration, as is expressly said of another
	exhibition of Gentile faith ( :-).


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The nine were Jews, and yet put the ceremonial requirement above gratitude to their own countryman who had healed them."
2. "Save this stranger, or ‘alien,’ not of Jewish extraction."
3. "The stranger came, though the Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Save this stranger (ε μη ο αλλογενης)."
2. "The old word was αλλοφυλος (Acts 10:28), but αλλογενης occurs in the LXX, Josephus, and inscriptions."
3. "Let no foreigner enter within the screen and enclosure surrounding the sanctuary (Μηθενα αλλογενη εισπορευεσθα εντος του περ το ιερον τρυφακτου κα περιβολου)."

### John Gill:
1. "They did not return to give thanks to Christ, and acknowledge him the author of their cure and cleansing they did not give glory to God."
2. "But this must be understood of them in times past, before they were found out to be idolaters."
3. "That tradition of the Jews requires some notice and consideration: all are defiled with leprosies, except strangers, and the proselyte of the gate."
