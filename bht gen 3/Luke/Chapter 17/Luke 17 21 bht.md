## BHT:
The kingdom of God comes gradually and without external markers, making it unobservable to men. It is not confined to specific locations or visible manifestations, but has an internal and spiritual nature. Jesus tells the Pharisees that they should seek the kingdom within themselves, rather than in external signs. The reign of God is not about external control, but about inner transformation and obedience to Christ. In fact, the kingdom is already present among them, with the King himself actively working. It is a hidden and powerful work within the hearts of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Its coming shall be so gradual and unobserved, that none during its waxing onward shall be able to point here or there for a proof of its coming." 
2. "The kingdom of God was begun among them, and continues thus making its way in the world, without observation of men." 
3. "Thus we see that every such marked event in the history of the Church is by Godâ€™s own hand as it were blotted and marred, so as not to deceive us into thinking that the kingdom has come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lo here! . . . lo there!â€”shut up within this or that sharply defined and visible geographical or ecclesiastical limit."
2. "within youâ€”is of an internal and spiritual character (as contrasted with their outside views of it)."
3. "But it has its external side too."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The inquiry is, Where is he? which way will he go? and it is a matter of important 'news' to be able to say where he is. Jesus says that the Messiah would not come in that manner. It would not be with such pomp and public attention."
2. "The reign of God is 'in the heart.' It does not come with pomp and splendor, like the reign of temporal kings, merely to control the external 'actions' and strike the senses of people with awe, but it reigns in the heart by the law of God; it sets up its dominion over the passions, and brings every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ."
3. "It may mean the new dispensation is 'even now among you.' The Messiah has come. John has ushered in the kingdom of God, and you are not to expect the appearance of the Messiah with great pomp and splendor, for he is now among you."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The whole language of the kingdom of heaven being within men, rather than men being within the kingdom, is modern."
2. "You refers to the Pharisees, in whose hearts nothing certainly found a place less than did the ethical kingdom of God."
3. "Jesus is not speaking of the inwardness of the kingdom, but of its presence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Men have no right to point to anything as a proof of the speedy coming of this kingdom."
2. "The kingdom of God is within you, or, 'in the midst of you.'"
3. "The kingdom of God was already among them, for the King was present and working among them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What Jesus says to the Pharisees is that they, as others, are to look for the kingdom of God within themselves, not in outward displays and supernatural manifestations."
2. "It is not a localized display 'Here' or 'There.'"
3. "The kingdom of heaven is within you."

### John Gill:
1. "No such thing will fall under the observations of man, not but that this would be said, and was said by some persons, as it is suggested it should."
2. "The work of grace is an internal thing; it is wrought in the hearts of men; it has its seat in the inward parts, and is therefore called the inner, and the hidden man."
3. "It is a kingdom which cannot be moved; and as it is glorious in itself, it makes such glorious who are partakers of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there â€” This shall not be the language of those who are, or shall be sent by me, to declare the coming of my kingdom."
2. "For behold the kingdom of God is within or among you â€” Look not for it in distant times or remote places: it is now in the midst of you: it is come: it is present in the soul of every true believer."
3. "It is a spiritual kingdom, an internal principle. Wherever it exists, it exists in the heart."
