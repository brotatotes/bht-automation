# Luke 17:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The events preceding the coming of Christ emphasize the sufferings and rejection He would endure. This prediction redirects His disciples' focus, cautioning them against immediate triumph and a temporal kingdom. The rejection includes cruel mockings, spitting, buffeting, scourging, and death on the cross, all necessary for God's plan, Christ's covenant, and Old Testament prophecies. This rejection signifies the utmost contempt and scorn from this generation, giving no indication of the time or place of His coming but rather reminding them of the need for patience until His return.
