### John Gill:
1. "The Hebrew word, ◊í◊§◊®◊ô◊™, used in Genesis 19:24 though it is rendered in the Targum of Jonathan, ◊õ◊ë◊®◊ô◊™◊ê, and by the Septuagint, Œ∏ŒµŒπŒøŒΩ; both which words signify 'sulphur', or brimstone; and which last word is used here, following the Greek version; yet it is observed, by some learned men, that it rather signifies 'pitch', or 'rosin', which proceeds from some sort of trees..."
2. "...by its derivation, it seems to signify something belonging to or that comes out of the wood of Gopher, of which the ark was made, Genesis 6:14 which some think to be the pine tree, from whence comes pitch."
3. "A shower of neither [pitch or brimstone], can be accounted for in an ordinary way, but must be extraordinary and miraculous."
