# Luke 17:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love begins with speaking truth. In the Church, the love of many being weak and cold is the reason for offenses. Take heed to yourselves, for as new converts are enthusiastic, they may stumble themselves and others. Be cautious in your spirits, doctrines, walk, and conversation, so as not to give offense or be stumbled by others. When your brother sins, lay his sin before him with gentleness and respect, dropping all resentment and anger. This should be done immediately, as soon as a person repents.
