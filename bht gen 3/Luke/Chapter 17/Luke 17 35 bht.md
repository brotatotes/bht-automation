### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Two women shall be grinding together, in the same place near each other, with one hand mill; and at one and the same mill, one shall be taken and the other left. The Roman soldiers will enter the mill and lay hold on one, carrying her away while leaving the other behind. The reason for this distinction cannot be found in any specific fault or merit on the part of the women, but rather in the sovereign will and providence of God, which directs the actions of these men.

- Attempt 4 BHT: Two women grinding together at the same mill is the subject of Luke 17:35.

In this verse, one woman will be taken and the other left, perhaps by Roman soldiers who will choose to take one woman and leave the other. Such actions can only be attributed to the sovereign will and providence of God, as no other reason can explain their choices.
