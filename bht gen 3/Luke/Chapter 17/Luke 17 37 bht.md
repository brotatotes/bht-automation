# Luke 17:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wherever there is a mass of incurable moral and spiritual corruption, the ministers of divine judgment will be seen alighting like birds of prey scenting out carrion. This terrifying proverb has been verified throughout history, particularly during the destruction of Jerusalem and will be most fully realized on the world's final day. The eagles, or vultures, in this proverb are attracted to the carcass, symbolizing the judgment that comes to places of great wickedness. While some see a reference to the destruction of Jerusalem, the focus here is on the second coming of Christ alone.
