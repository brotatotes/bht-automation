- Attempt 3 BHT: To truly embrace a forgiving spirit, we must be willing to forgive, not just once or twice, but even seven times in one day. Such a measure of forgiveness requires sincerity in seeking forgiveness from the one who was wronged. Confession and rebuke go hand in hand in the Christian life, and confession should not be taken lightly. We should strive to forgive as soon as someone repents, for a quick willingness to forgive is commendable. In fact, receiving the offender as if they had never sinned against us is the kind of forgiveness we are called to demonstrate. Yet, it is worth noting that this kind of forgiveness should be reserved for those who truly repent. In a broader sense, we are still called to forgive all, whether they repent or not, over and over again.

- Attempt 4 BHT: To embody a truly forgiving spirit, we are called not just to forgive once, or even twice, but even up to seven times within a single day. However, this forgiveness must come from a place of sincerity, where the offender genuinely seeks forgiveness. Confession plays a crucial role in the Christian journey, as does the willingness to offer forgiveness swiftly to the penitent. In fact, we should receive those who ask for forgiveness as if they had never wronged us. Nevertheless, it is important to discern genuine repentance when practicing such forgiveness. Nonetheless, on a broader scale, we are called to forgive everyone, regardless of their repentance, repeatedly.

- Attempt 5 BHT: True forgiveness extends beyond mere lip service. In Luke 17:4, we are urged to forgive not just once or twice, but even seven times in a day, emphasizing the significance of sincere repentance. The act of confession, rarely practiced, is as essential as offering rebuke. A prompt and willing attitude to forgive demonstrates praiseworthy character. When we forgive, it is crucial to receive the offender as if they had never transgressed against us. However, this forgiveness is not indiscriminate; it is reserved for those who show genuine penitence. In a broader sense, we are still obliged to forgive all, both penitent and impenitent, not merely seven times, but seventy times seven.
