# Luke 17:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you had faith as small as a mustard seed, you could command even a seemingly immovable tree like the sycamine to be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey you. The sycamine tree, though not commonly found in Palestine, is distinguishable from the fig-mulberry tree. This promise goes beyond the miracles of power; it speaks to the limitless potential of faith. Even the smallest measure of true faith can enable you to do what seems impossible in the natural and spiritual realms.
