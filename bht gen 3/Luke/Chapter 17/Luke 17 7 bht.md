# Luke 17:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When your faith has been so increased to avoid and forgive offenses, and do things impossible to all but faith, do not be puffed up as though you had laid the Lord under obligations to you. Go directly to what is commanded without expecting rewards. Be wary of thinking you have merit in the great results accomplished by faith. Remember, the kindness and liberality God exercises should not give you foolish confidence but deeper obligations to Him.
