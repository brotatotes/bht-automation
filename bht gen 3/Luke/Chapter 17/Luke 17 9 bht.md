# Luke 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus is not providing guidelines for the behavior of earthly masters and servants, but rather highlighting the appropriate relationship between us and God. He emphasizes that God is not obliged to thank us, as an earthly master might, for fulfilling our duties. Rather, as servants, it is our duty to obey Him. This parable challenges us to not settle for a mere servant relationship with God, but to strive for a deeper connection as His children. While commendation may be given for our service, we should not expect gratitude from God.
