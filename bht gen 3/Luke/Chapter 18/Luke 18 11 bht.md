# Luke 18:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisee in this scene arrogantly separated himself from the rest of mankind, disregarding his own sins or spiritual needs. He proudly boasted about fulfilling his duty to an extreme degree, going above and beyond in fasting and tithing. However, his prayer lacked genuine gratitude to God and instead focused on his own righteousness. His self-centered attitude and disdainful view towards others overshadowed any true humility or recognition of God's grace in his life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Pharisee stood (in the ordinary place) and prayed thus with himself:‚Äîsuch a prayer he would not dare to put up aloud."
2. "The Church has admirably fitted to this parable the declaration of thankfulness in 1 Cor. xv. 9, 10, also made by a Pharisee, and also on the ground ‚Äòthat he was not as other men:'‚Äîbut how different in its whole spirit and effect!"
3. "There, in the deepest humility, he ascribes it to the grace of God that he laboured more abundantly than they all;‚Äîyet not I, but the grace of God that was with me."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To have been kept from gross iniquities was undoubtedly a just cause of thankfulness to God but instead of the devoutly humble, admiring frame which this should inspire, the Pharisee arrogantly severs himself from the rest of mankind, as quite above them."
2. "Not confining himself to the one divinely prescribed annual fast, he was not behind the most rigid, who fasted on the second and fifth days of every week, and gave the tenth not only of what the law laid under tithing, but of 'all his gains.'"
3. "Thus, besides doing all his duty, he did works of supererogation; while sins to confess and spiritual wants to be supplied he seems to have felt none."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hypocrites are often the most orthodox in opinion of any class of people. They know the truth, and admit it. They use it frequently in their prayers and conversation."
2. "We are not to judge of the 'piety' of people by the fact that they admit the truth, or even that they use it often in their prayers."
3. "It is, however, not wrong to thank God that he has kept us from the gross sins which other people commit; but it should not be done in an ostentatious manner, nor should it be done forgetting still that we are great sinners and need pardon."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Stood [œÉŒ±œÑŒ∏ŒµŒπœÇ] . Lit., having been placed. Took his stand. It implies taking up his position ostentatiously; striking an attitude. But no necessarily in a bad sense." 
2. "Prayed [œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∑œÖœáŒµœÑŒø] . Imperfect : began to pray, or proceeded to pray."
3. "A Jewish saying is quoted that a true Rabbin ought to thank God every day of his life; 1, that he was not created a Gentile; 2, that he was not a plebeian; 3, that he was not born a woman."

### John Calvin:
1. "Men are not truly and properly humbled, though they are convinced that they can do nothing, unless they likewise distrust the merits of works, and learn to place their salvation in the undeserved goodness of God, so as to rest upon it all their confidence."
2. "Christ goes farther, not only ascribing to the grace of the Spirit the power of acting aright, but stripping us of all confidence in works."
3. "Though he did not proclaim aloud the honor of his own righteousness, his internal pride was abominable in the sight of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisee stood...the word here used implies that the Pharisee took a position of confidence, a conspicuous one at all events."
2. "He did not thank God, but boasted. It is possible to thank God for what we do and become more than others, but such a thanksgiving springs out of the most profound humility."
3. "The thanksgiving was not for freedom from these sins, but for his superiority to sinners; and he introduces the concrete and actual sinner (the publican)."

### John Gill:
1. "he thanked God for the good things which he had received from him, or which by his assistance he had done; but nothing of this kind is said by him: he thanks God, in order to exalt himself, and places his righteousness in his own works, and treats all other men in a censorious and disdainful manner."
2. "his own self, and the commendation of himself, were the subject of his prayer: his whole dependence in it was on himself; and he was only seeking by it his own glory"
3. "he prayed only with respect to himself; he was wholly intent upon himself."
