# Luke 18:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To seek justification before God, we must approach Him with humility rather than self-righteousness. The parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector illustrates this truth: the exalted Pharisee was not justified, while the humble publican was exalted through the answer to his prayer for justification. Our fundamental preparation for receiving God's grace and comfort lies in being self-emptied and mourning our need for righteousness. It is those who recognize their need and truly hunger and thirst for righteousness that will be justified by God.

2. "God will not be pacified towards us, unless we distrust works, and pray that we may be freely reconciled."
3. "Our faith needs no other support than this, that God has accepted us, not because we deserved it, but because he does not impute our sins."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord implies that the publican‚Äôs prayer was answered, that God was merciful to this sinner, and this is precisely what is meant by justification, namely, God‚Äôs forgiving our sins and accepting us as righteous."
2. "But He certainly means that the latter was not justified, for he had not asked for this."
3. "The Pharisee, though previously a more moral man than the other, failed to be justified, not because he was more moral, but because he was self-righteous; the publican, the worse man of the two, was justified, not because he was worse, but because he was a humble penitent."

2. "Rather than the other (œÄŒ±œÅ' ŒµŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩŒøŒΩ). In comparison with (placed beside) that one. A neat Greek idiom after the perfect passive participle Œ¥ŒµŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ."
3. "For (ŒøœÑ). This moral maxim Christ had already used in Luke 14:11. Plummer pertinently asks: 'Why is it assumed that Jesus did not repeat his sayings?'"

3. "Whosoever humbleth himself, the holy blessed God will lift him up."
