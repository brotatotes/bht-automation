## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What words are these from the lips of Christ! The price of them is above rubies." 
2. "It is surely not to be conceived that all our Lord meant was to inform us, that seeing grown people must become childlike in order to be capable of the Kingdom of God, therefore they should not hinder infants from coming to Him, and therefore He took up and blessed the infants themselves."
3. "This case presents some remarkable points. (1) The man was of irreproachable moral character... (2) But restless notwithstanding, his heart craves eternal life. (3) Unlike the 'rulers,' to whose class he belonged, he so far believed in Jesus as to be persuaded He could authoritatively direct him on this vital point."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Suffer. See on Matthew 19:14. Only Mark notes the taking in his arms. 
18 - 30. Compare Matthew 19:16-30; Luke 20:1-16; Mark 10:17-31.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The plea of Jesus that children be allowed to come to him is one that many parents need to heed."
2. "It is a tragedy to think of parents 'forbidding' their children or of preachers doing the same or of both being stumbling-blocks to children."
3. "The language of Jesus is precisely that of Mark 10:14 which see, and nearly that of Matthew 19:14 which see also."

### John Gill:
1. "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not." 
2. "For of such is the kingdom of God." 
3. "The kingdom of God belongs to such, 'who are as these'; or, 'like to these'."

### John Wesley:
1. Calling them â€” Those that brought the children: of such is the kingdom of God - Such are subjects of the Messiah's kingdom. And such as these it properly belongs to.
