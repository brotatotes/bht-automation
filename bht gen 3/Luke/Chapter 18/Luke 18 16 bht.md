# Luke 18:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What words are these from the lips of Christ! The price of them is above rubies. It is surely not to be conceived that all our Lord meant was to inform us, that seeing grown people must become childlike in order to be capable of the Kingdom of God, therefore they should not hinder infants from coming to Him, and therefore He took up and blessed the infants themselves. The plea of Jesus that children be allowed to come to him is one that many parents need to heed.
