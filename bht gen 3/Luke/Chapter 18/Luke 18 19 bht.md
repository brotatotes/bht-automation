# Luke 18:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' response to the youth offered more than just a mere objection; it aimed to elevate His status above other good masters. By refusing the title of good in isolation, Jesus implied His divine nature, surpassing human teachers. This undercurrent in His words rebuffs the beliefs of Socinianism, leaving them perplexed. Indeed, Jesus questioned the youth's address as good since it was unusual to use such a term when addressing men, reserving it exclusively for the one true God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Unless therefore we are to ascribe captiousness to our Lord, He could have had but one objectâ€”to raise the youth's ideas of Himself, as not to be classed merely with other 'good masters', and declining to receive this title apart from the 'One' who is essentially and only 'good.'" 
2. "This indeed is but distantly hinted; but unless this is seen in the background of our Lord's words, nothing worthy of Him can be made out of them."
3. "Hence, Socinianism, instead of having any support here, is only baffled by it."

### John Gill:
1. "Why callest thou me good? it being unusual to address men, even their Rabbins, under such a title."
2. "None is good, save one, [that is], God: or 'but God alone.'"
3. "But the one God."

- Attempt 1 BHT: To truly understand the meaning behind this verse, we must recognize that Jesus was not being captious; rather, he was attempting to elevate the youth's perception of Him. Our Lord did not wish to be grouped together with other good masters, but desired to be acknowledged as the one and only truly good. Though not overtly stated, this background knowledge is crucial to truly grasp the significance of His words. Therefore, the teachings of Socinianism are ultimately confounded by this verse. Jesus questions the youth's declaration of Him as good because it was uncommon to address men with such a title, reserving it instead for God alone.
