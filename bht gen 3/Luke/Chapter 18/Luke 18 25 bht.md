# Luke 18:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This proverbial expression suggests that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. The choice of using the term belonh for the surgical needle instead of the term œÅŒ±œÜŒπœÇ is notable, as the latter is regarded as barbarous. It is likely that this saying was well-known during that time, as it appears in the Talmud concerning an elephant passing through the eye of a needle. Ultimately, this serves to highlight the challenges that wealth can present in attaining salvation.
