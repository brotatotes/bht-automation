# Luke 18:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Luke 18:32, there is a significant omission when compared to Matthew's account. Not only is the betrayal left out, but this is also the first announcement of the crucifixion. This omission can be seen as intentional, as a similar omission is found in another chapter. However, in other passages, we learn that Jesus will be delivered to the Gentiles, mocked, spitefully treated, and even spat upon. These injuries and abuses, both verbal and physical, were inflicted upon him by both the officers in the high priest's palace and the Roman soldiers in Pilate's hall.
