# Luke 18:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were unaware of what Jesus had plainly spoken to them, as if the meaning had been completely hidden from their understanding. Their lack of perception and comprehension is emphasized, as they failed to grasp the significance of His words. Their preconceived ideas and expectations hindered them from comprehending the prophecies and spiritual truths. It is remarkable how they remained in ignorance, unable to reconcile Jesus' teachings with their limited understanding of the Messiah's kingdom.
