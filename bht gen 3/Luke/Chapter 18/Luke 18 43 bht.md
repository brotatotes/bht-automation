## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Peculiar (except followed him, which three relate) to St. Luke;â€”his usual way of terminating such narrations." 
2. "It certainly was the result of such a miracleâ€”see ch. xiii. 17; ix. 48; v. 26."
3. "He, of the three evangelists, takes most notice of the glory given to God on account of the miraculous acts of the Lord Jesus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 18:43. Glorifying God. Peculiar to Luke, and a phrase frequently used by him. This miracle would make the prediction of Luke 18:31-33 the more incomprehensible to the disciples.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Followed (Î·ÎºÎ¿Î»Î¿Ï…Î¸Îµ). Imperfect active as in Mark 10:52. Either inchoative he began to follow, or descriptive, he was following. 


### John Gill:
1. "As soon as ever the word was gone out of Christ's mouth, virtue went forth from him, and cured the man of his blindness; his eyes were at once opened, and he saw as other men."
2. "His kind benefactor, with a grateful sense of his goodness, with strong affection for him, and faith in him."
3. "They ascribed the glory to God, and praised his name, that he had raised up the Messiah among them; of which this was a clear proof, inasmuch as the eyes of the blind were opened."
