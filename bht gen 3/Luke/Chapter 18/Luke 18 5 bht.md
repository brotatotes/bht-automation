## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word rendered weary is a remarkable one. It properly signifies to smite in the face;‚Äîand proverbially, to mortify or incessantly annoy."
2. "It is the same verb as that in 1 Cor. ix. 27 rendered 'keep under.'"
3. "Meyer interprets it literally‚Äî'lest at last she should become desperate, and come and strike me in the face.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 5. continual coming‚Äîcoming for
	ever.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lest at last she come and assault me."
2. "Lest at the last she, coming, strangle me."
3. "Lest at the last she come and rail on me."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is willing to give justice, though for a very unjust reason."
2. "Even from such a man importunity can gain its end."
3. "This is to be taken, not literally, but figuratively, as setting forth the troublesome effects of a woman's incessant demands."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Yet (Œ≥Œµ). Delicate intensive particle of deep feeling as here."
2. "Because this widow troubleth me (Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÑŒø œÄŒ±œÅŒµœáŒµŒπŒΩ ŒºŒø Œ∫ŒøœÄŒøŒΩ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œáŒ∑œÅŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒ±œÖœÑŒ∑ŒΩ). Literally, because of the furnishing me trouble as to this widow (accusative of general reference with the articular infinitive)."
3. "Lest she wear me out (ŒπŒΩŒ± ŒºŒ∑ œÖœÄœâœÄŒπŒ±Œ∂Œ∑ ŒºŒµ). Some take it that the judge is actually afraid that the widow may come and assault him, literally beat him under the eye. That idea would be best expressed here by the aorist tense."

### John Gill:
1. "I will avenge her; I will hear her cause, do her justice, and deliver her from her troublesome adversary."
2. "so that it was not from a conscience of duty in him, as a judge, or from a commiseration of the poor widow's case; but from a selfish end, for his own ease, in perfect agreement to his character"
3. "the intention of the parable being only to show the force, efficacy, and usefulness of importunity in prayer"
