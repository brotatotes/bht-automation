## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. And Jesus entered ... - See the notes at Matthew 20:29. This means, perhaps, ‚Äúhe was passing‚Äù through Jericho when Zacchaeus saw him. His house was ‚Äúin‚Äù Jericho.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jericho. The city was close to the fords of the Jordan, on the frontier of Peraea, and on the richest plain of Palestine, abounding most in the choicest productions, especially balsam..." (Luke 19:1)
2. "an appropriate seat for an officer of superior rank to preside over the collection of revenues" (Luke 19:1)
3. "See on Matthew 9:9; Luke 3:12." (Luke 19:1)

### John Calvin:
1. "It is possible, indeed, that others entertained the same wish, but this man was most properly singled out by Luke, both on account of his rank, and on account of his wonderful conversion, which took place suddenly."
2. "For it was an evidence of intense desire that he climbed up a tree; since rich men are, for the most part, haughty, and plume themselves on affected gravity."
3. "In this manner, before revealing himself to men, the Lord frequently communicates to them a secret desire, by which they are led to Him, while he is still concealed and unknown; and, though they have no fixed object in view, He does not disappoint them, but manifests himself in due time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He had not yet passed entirely through, when He met Zaccheus."
2. "Hence it is not necessary to suppose that the house of Zaccheus was outside the city, on the way to Jerusalem."
3. "On Jericho, see Matthew 20:29."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Was passing through (Œ¥ŒπŒ∑œÅœáŒµœÑŒø). Imperfect middle. Now Jesus was inside the Roman Jericho with the procession. 


### John Gill:
1. "Though the word 'Jesus' is not in the original text it is rightly supplied in our version." 
2. "He entered into it, but made no stay in it, passed through it at once without stopping."
3. "Here he had no work, either to perform miracles, or to convert sinners."
