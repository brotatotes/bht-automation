# Luke 19:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the greater sinner that Zacchaeus may have been, the more does he come under the description of those whom the good Shepherd came to seek and save. This parable is different from the one of the Talents, as the intended lesson is different - different degrees of improvement of the same opportunities. Yet, with all this difference, the parables are remarkably similar. Zacchaeus, as one of the lost, acknowledged himself as such and received the Master who was seeking him. (Matthew 18:11)
