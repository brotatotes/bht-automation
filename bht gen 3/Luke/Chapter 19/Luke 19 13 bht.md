# Luke 19:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, Jesus gave each servant a small sum of money to test their faithfulness. The amount may seem insignificant, but the emphasis is on the relationship between faithfulness in the least and the reward that awaits. Just as the servants were commanded to trade and occupy with their resources, we are called to use and invest the talents and gifts bestowed upon us for the purpose of advancing the kingdom. God distributes His gifts according to His will, and we are accountable for how we steward them until His return.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The giving the mina to each, is a totally different thing from giving to one five, to another two, and to a third one talent." 
2. "The sums given are here all the same, and all very small."
3. "Here he makes trial of them with these small sums ( 'a very little,' see ver. 17)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 13. Occupy‚Äî"negotiate,"
	"do business," with the resources entrusted.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "In general, by these servants our Saviour denotes his disciples, and intends to teach us that talents are given us to be improved, for which we must give an account at his return."
2. "The pounds here denote the talents which God has given to his servants on earth to improve, and for which they must give all account in the day of judgment."
3. "The direction was to use this money so as to gain 'more' against his return. So Jesus commands his disciples to 'improve' their talents; to make the most of them; to increase their capability of doing good, and to do it 'until' he comes to call us hence, by death, to meet him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The small sum astonishes us. Compare, on the other hand, the talents (Matthew 25:0). But in Matthew, the Lord transfers to his servant his whole property; here he has only devoted a definite sum of money to the purpose of putting his servants to the proof therewith; and the smallness of the amount corresponds to what is so carefully emphasized in our parable, viz., the relation of faithfulness in the least to its great recompense (ver. 17); which relation is less regarded in the parable in Matthew."
2. "The word occupy has lost the sense which it conveyed to the makers of the A. V. - that of using or laying out what is possessed. An occupier formerly meant a trader."
3. "It is strange that the Rev. follows this reading without comment, while the Reviser's text takes no notice whatever of the reading of four of the leading manuscripts, which is adopted by both Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort; ejn w= ercomai, 'while I come,' a condensed form of expression for while I go and return."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ does not lay on all an equal charge of trafficking, but commits to one a small, and to another a larger sum of money."
2. "Till the last day of the resurrection Christ, in some respects, goes to a distance from his people, but yet that it would be highly improper for them to sit down in idleness and do no good."
3. "Let us know that the Lord does not bestow on all indiscriminately the same measure of gifts, but distributes them variously as he thinks proper, so that some excel others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Attic mina, which is probably meant, was the sixtieth part of a talent, and = $15-$17."
2. "The one equal official gift seems to be referred to here, not the spiritual ‚Äòtalents‚Äô which differ in extent."
3. "Trade herewith till I come, i.e., while I go and return."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Trade ye herewith till I come." 
2. "œÄœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒµœÖœÉŒ±œÉŒ∏Œµ ŒµŒΩ œâ ŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒ±. First aorist middle imperative of œÄœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒµœÖŒøŒºŒ±, an old verb from œÄœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±, business."
3. "While I am coming is what ŒµŒΩ œâ ŒµœÅœáŒøŒºŒ± really means."

### John Gill:
1. "The call of these by their Lord, is not to be understood of the call of them by his grace, but of a call of them to the office and work of the ministry."
2. "And by these pounds are designed, not special grace; for they intend not any thing wrought in these servants, but something delivered to them, and what might be taken away again, which cannot be said of special grace; and besides, it is certain, that one of these servants that had the pound, was destitute of that."
3. "but ministerial gifts, which are the greatest in the church, and are therefore signified by pounds and are what may be improved or neglected, and be lost or taken away; and for which those that have them, are accountable."

### John Wesley:
1. Trade till I come ‚Äî To visit the nation, to destroy Jerusalem, to judge the world: or, in a more particular sense, to require thy soul of thee.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The parable in Luke 19:13 teaches that all believers are given resources to use and invest in the kingdom of God. The small sums of money given to each servant represent the different gifts and talents that God has entrusted to His people. These gifts may vary in size and importance, but every believer is expected to faithfully use and develop them until Christ returns. Just as the servants were instructed to trade and occupy with the resources given to them, we are called to be diligent and active in using our gifts for the expansion of God's Kingdom. We must understand that God distributes His gifts according to His sovereign will, and it is our responsibility to maximize the potential of what has been given to us. We are accountable for how we steward these resources, using them wisely for the glory of God and the advancement of His Kingdom.
