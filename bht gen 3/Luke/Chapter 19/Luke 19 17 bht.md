# Luke 19:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Keep on having authority, signifying that the servant had well done and approved himself to be an honest and diligent servant. Because he had been faithful in a very little, preaching the pure Gospel of Christ and seeking to please the Lord only, he performed a faithful part to Christ. The reward corresponds with the kingly dignity of the returned Lord, but it is important to note that there is no proportion between what the servant does and what he shall have, emphasizing that it is not of merit but of grace.

2. "Because thou hast been faithful in a very little; had preached the pure Gospel of Christ, and the whole of it, and sought not to please men, but the Lord only; not his own glory, but Christ's; abode by him and his interest, notwithstanding all reproaches and persecutions, and so acted a faithful part to Christ."
