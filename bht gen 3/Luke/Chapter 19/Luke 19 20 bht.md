### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The servant in the parable of Luke 19:20 is described as keeping his pound wrapped in a napkin or sudarium, a cloth used for wiping off sweat. This implies that the servant had not wasted or carelessly thrown away his talent, but had been very careful with it, preserving it while his master was away. However, the napkin also symbolizes idleness and lack of use, as the servant did not put the talent to work or use it for the Lord's service. This reflects the danger of not utilizing the gifts and resources that God has given us, as they become dormant and unexercised, of no benefit to Christ or others.
