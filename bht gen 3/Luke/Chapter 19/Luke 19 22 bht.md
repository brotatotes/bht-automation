# Luke 19:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Did you really think I wouldn't know? You claimed to know my character and what I expected of you, so you should have been faithful. Your own words have turned against you, leading to your own condemnation. This principle applies not only to this particular slave, but also to all people who will face God's judgment. We cannot complain if God holds us accountable according to our own knowledge and understanding of Him.
