# Luke 19:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Did you know? Then, for that reason, you should have been more faithful. By your own statement or your own views of my character, you knew that I would be rigid, firm, and even severe. As you knew my character beforehand and were well acquainted with the fact that I should demand a strict compliance with your obligation, you have no right to complain if you are condemned accordingly. Out of your own mouth, your words are turned against you and you are judged accordingly.
