The Lord wept audibly, expressing a fruitless wish as those who lament often break off their sayings due to the intensity of their affection. It was His desire, marked by the construction of a trench, but the city rejected Him, missing the signs of the times. The city's disdain for heavenly grace, despite its remarkable privilege, warrants a heavier punishment. If only the city had recognized its true interest in this day of visitation, it could have embraced the things that lead to peace.
