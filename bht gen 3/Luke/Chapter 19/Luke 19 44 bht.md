# Luke 19:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The impending destruction of Jerusalem is described in Luke 19:44, as Jesus foretells the city's buildings being leveled, with not one stone left upon another. This devastating prophecy is a consequence of Jerusalem's failure to recognize the time of Jesus' visitation, which could have sparked mercy instead of judgment. The rejection of Jesus as the Messiah is identified as the true cause of Jerusalem's ruin, despite the Jews' attempts to shift blame elsewhere. The wrathful consequences will extend to all, including the inhabitants and children within Jerusalem.
