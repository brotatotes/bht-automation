# Luke 19:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus arrived in the city, He immediately went to the temple, His rightful domain where He had important tasks to fulfill before His imminent death. He wasted no time addressing the corrupt practices there, calling the merchants a 'den of thieves' solely concerned with selfish gain. This was not the first instance of Jesus cleansing the temple; He had done so at the beginning of His ministry as well. The reoccurrence of abuses over the course of three years prompted Jesus to cast out those who were selling and buying, even overturning tables and seats. This act of cleansing demonstrated Jesus's authority and determination in purifying His Father's dwelling place.
