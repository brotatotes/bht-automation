# Luke 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time when Caesar Augustus was the Roman emperor, a decree went forth for the entire Roman Empire to be enrolled or registered. This enrollment, debated to be for taxation or population purposes, was confirmed by recent archeological findings. It is worth noting that it was a census, not just a taxing, and God's providence used this seemingly tyrannical decree to lead Mary away from her home to fulfill prophetic plans for the birth of Jesus.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That all the world - There has been much difficulty respecting this passage, from the fact that no such taxing of 'all the world' is mentioned by ancient writers."
2. "The 'whole land' is mentioned to show that it was not 'Judea' only, but that it included also 'Galilee,' the place where Joseph and Mary dwelt."
3. "Our word 'tax' means to levy and raise money for the use of the government. This is not the meaning of the original word here. It means rather to 'enroll,' or take a 'list' of the citizens, with their employments, the amount of their property, etc., equivalent to what was meant by census."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Decree. Wyc., mandment. From dokew, to think. Hence, strictly, a personal opinion; and, as the opinion of one who can impose his opinion authoritatively on others, a decree."
2. "The world [œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ] . Lit., the inhabited (land). The phrase was originally used by the Greek s to denote the land inhabited by themselves, in contrast with barbarian countries; afterward, when the Greek s became subject to the Romans, the entire Roman world; still later, for the whole inhabited world."
3. "Be taxed [Œ±œÄŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ] . The word means properly to register or enter in a list. Commentators are divided as to whether it refers to an enrollment for taxation, or for ascertaining the population."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus we see that the holy servants of God, even though they wander from their design, unconscious where they are going, still keep the right path, because God directs their steps." 
2. "Nor is the Providence of God less wonderful in employing the mandate of a tyrant to draw Mary from home, that the prophecy may be fulfilled."
3. "God had marked out by his prophet ‚Äî as we shall afterwards see ‚Äî the place where he determined that his Son should be born. If Mary had not been constrained to do otherwise, she would have chosen to bring forth her child at home."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In those days. Indefinite; about the time of the birth of John the Baptist."
2. "All the world, i.e., the Roman world. We should not, to avoid difficulty, limit it to Palestine."
3. "If we accept the enrolment as resembling a modern census, all difficulty vanishes, for Augustus ordered such an enrolment at least three times during his reign."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No such decree was given by Greek or Roman historians and it was for long assumed by many scholars that Luke was in error."
2. "But papyri and inscriptions have confirmed Luke on every point in these crucial verses Luke 2:1-7."
