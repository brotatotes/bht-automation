# Luke 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The shepherds, entrusted with the sacred task of taking care of sacrificial flocks, were the first evangelists, joyfully proclaiming the Messiah's arrival at the temple. They wasted no time in making known the marvelous news they had heard from the angels, sharing the saying concerning the child with others. Their testimony provided evidence that what the angels had said was true, and they became the first preachers of the gospel. Just as the shepherds delighted in spreading the good news, we too, as newly converted believers, should eagerly share with others what we have experienced and seen.
