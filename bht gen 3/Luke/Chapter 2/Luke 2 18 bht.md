# Luke 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were amazed but their wonder was fleeting, unlike the lasting impact it had on Mary. Most likely, the story was forgotten by many before Jesus started His ministry, which ultimately failed to convince most Jews. They couldn't fathom the idea of the Messiah being born in such a humble manner and were unsure how to respond. This mirrored the crowd's reaction to Jesus' ministry, astonished yet doubtful due to His modest upbringing and education.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "With this natural, and probably transient, wonder of those who heard the story, the narrative contrasts the more abiding effect upon Mary."
2. "Before Jesus appeared as a teacher, thirty years afterwards, the story was probably forgotten by all but a few earnest souls."
3. "If His words and works did not prevent the mass of the Jews from rejecting Him, how little influence would this story have."

### John Gill:
1. "They did not imagine that he would be born of such mean parents, and appear in such mean circumstances, and in so contemptible a place."
2. "They knew not what to say to it, neither to deny, nor believe it."
3. "Just as Christ's hearers were...who wondered at his ministry, and the manner of it, and yet objected the meanness of his parentage and education."
