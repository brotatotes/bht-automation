## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "With this natural, and probably transient, wonder of those who heard the story, the narrative contrasts the more abiding effect upon Mary."
2. "Before Jesus appeared as a teacher, thirty years afterwards, the story was probably forgotten by all but a few earnest souls."
3. "If His words and works did not prevent the mass of the Jews from rejecting Him, how little influence would this story have."

### John Gill:
1. "they did not imagine that he would be born of such mean parents, and appear in such mean circumstances, and in so contemptible a place"
2. "the account which these shepherds...was very surprising; so that they knew not what to say to it, neither to deny, nor believe it"
3. "just as Christ's hearers were in Luke 4:22 who wondered at his ministry, and the manner of it, and yet objected the meanness of his parentage and education"
