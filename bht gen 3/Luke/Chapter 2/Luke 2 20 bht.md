# Luke 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The shepherds, having witnessed the birth of Jesus, returned to their flocks, glorifying and praising God. Their songs, perhaps canticles from the Psalms, expressed the overwhelming emotions in their hearts. Through Jesus' circumcision, He was named Savior, symbolizing His purpose to redeem those under the law. This act also represented His pledge to be obedient, even to the point of death on the cross. Just as the shepherds lifted their voices in adoration, may we too be inspired to honor and exalt God for His astonishing grace and the fulfillment of His promises.
