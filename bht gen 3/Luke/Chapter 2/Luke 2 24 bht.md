# Luke 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The days of purification after childbirth required a lamb for a burnt offering and a pigeon for a sin offering, unless the parents were too poor, then it was two pigeons. It is important not to assume extreme poverty for Jesus' family because there is no evidence of that in the Gospel history. By bringing Jesus to the temple and offering two pigeons, Mary and Joseph demonstrated their obedient fulfillment of the law. This offering, though inexpensive, carried great symbolic weight, pointing to Jesus' ultimate sacrifice and redemption through His precious blood.

3. By that Babe, in due time, we were to be redeemed, "not with corruptible things as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ" and the consuming of the mother's burnt offering, and the sprinkling of her with the blood of her sin offering, were to find their abiding realization in the "living sacrifice" of the Christian mother herself.

2. "We must not imagine that they had such abundance of gold as to raise them suddenly from poverty to wealth. It is more probable that it was some small present, which they had brought solely as a mark of respect."
3. "There would be no impropriety in saying, that Joseph and Mary gave as much as their circumstances allowed, though they reserved a little money to defray the expenses of their journey and of their household."
