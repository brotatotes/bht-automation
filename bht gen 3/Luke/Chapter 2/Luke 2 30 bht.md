## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Many saw this child, nay, the full-grown 'man, Christ Jesus,' who never saw in Him 'God's Salvation.' This estimate of an object of sight, an unconscious, helpless babe, was pure faith."
2. "He 'beheld His glory.'"
3. "In another view, it was prior faith rewarded by present sight."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Thy salvation - Him who is to procure salvation for his people; or, the Saviour.


### John Calvin:
1. "By saving I understand the matter of salvation: for in Christ are hid all the parts of salvation and of a happy life."
2. "Now if the sight of Christ, while he was yet a child, had so powerful an effect on Simeon, that he approached death with cheerfulness and composure; how much more abundant materials of lasting peace are now furnished to us."
3. "If such a sight does not bring peace to our minds, and make us go cheerfully to death, we are highly ungrateful to God, and hold the honor, which he has bestowed upon us, in little estimation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He sees the worldâ€™s salvation, while beholding the form of a helpless child."
2. "The prominence given by Simeon to 'salvation' rather than to the person of the child confirms the early date of the song."
3. "All peoples, both Jews and Gentiles, as the next verse shows."

### John Gill:
1. "He goes by the name of 'salvation', because the salvation of God's elect is put into his hands, and he has undertook it."
2. "He is called 'God's salvation' because he is a Saviour of his choosing, calling, and constituting; whom he promised under the Old Testament dispensation and in the fulness of time sent."
3. "They see him in the glory of his person, the fulness of his grace, the suitableness and excellency of his righteousness, the efficacy of his blood, and the perfection of his sacrifice; and as an able, willing, complete, and only Saviour."

### John Wesley:
1. Thy salvation â€” Thy Christ, thy Saviour.
