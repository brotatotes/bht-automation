# Luke 2:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the approaching times when God was poised to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, there was a prophetess known as Anna. Despite the captivity-diminished tribal divisions, her Asherite lineage remained well-known. At an advanced age, potentially surpassing a hundred and three years, Anna's beauty stood out, making her suitable for marriage to high priests or kings. She was among the few who still possessed the Spirit of prophecy, acting as a witness to the Jewish religion and proclaiming the good news of grace and redemption through Christ.
