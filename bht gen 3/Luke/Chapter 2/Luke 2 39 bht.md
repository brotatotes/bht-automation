# Luke 2:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the accounts of the Conception and Nativity, Matthew and Luke provide different details, and while some aspects may seem contradictory, they actually complement each other. Though the exact order and locations may be unclear, it is evident that Bethlehem was their native city, and Nazareth was their own city. Luke's omission of events like the flight into Egypt and the visit of the wise men is not a denial but rather a supplement to Matthew's account, creating a fuller picture when the two Gospels are considered together.

3. "The two Gospels supplement each other."

### John Gill:
1. "And when they had performed all things...according to the law of the Lord..."
2. "nor did they go now directly to Galilee; or, if they did, they soon came back again to Bethlehem..."
3. "Bethlehem was their native city, the place of their birth, at least of their family; and Nazareth was the city of their habitation."
