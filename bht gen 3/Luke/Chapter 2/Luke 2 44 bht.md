# Luke 2:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the company from Nazareth journeyed together, Mary and Joseph assumed that Jesus was among their relatives and acquaintances. They were accustomed to His thoughtfulness and obedience and felt no anxiety until they discovered He was not in their company. They diligently searched, but in vain. It was not until they laid up for the night that they missed Him, as at that time they would naturally expect His return.
