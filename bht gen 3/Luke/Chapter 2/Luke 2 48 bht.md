# Luke 2:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Joseph was no longer called the father by the holy Child Himself after this incident. Mary intentionally did not use we while searching for Jesus, emphasizing the contrast that followed. Mary was amazed, just as the Greek word suggests, as she recalled the process of their search. Witnessing Jesus' actions and hearing His words left them astonished. Even His own parents had not fully realized the power within this remarkable boy. This reminds us that parents often fail to fully grasp the potential in their own children. Jesus' response assumes a prior knowledge of His heavenly Father, perhaps indicating that Mary had not previously shared the remarkable circumstances of His birth. The purpose is not to give undue honor to Mary but to provide insights into Jesus' unique relationship with His parents.

2. "Such words are not chance."
3. "Had Mary said 'we,' the strong contrast with what follows could not have been brought out."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why hast thou thus dealt with us? - Why hast thou given us all this trouble and anxiety, in going so far and returning with so much solicitude?"
2. "Thy father - Joseph was not the 'real' father of Jesus, but he was 'legally' so; and as the secret of his birth was not commonly known, he was called his father. Mary, in accordance with that usage, also called him so."
3. "Sorrowing - Anxious, lest in the multitude he might not be found, or lest some accident might have happened to him."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Son [Ï„ÎµÎºÎ½Î¿Î½] . Lit., child."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a tone of reproach in the question, and also a hint that Jesus had never before grieved the motherâ€™s heart. This separates Him at once from all other boys."
2. "This form of speech was required by usage. It may, however, imply that Mary had never told her son of the remarkable circumstances of His birth, and then His answer, assuming a knowledge of His Father, would be the more remarkable."
3. "This indicates that there was a special reason for her speaking rather than Joseph. But the answer shows that these chapters were not written to unduly exalt Mary."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They were struck out by what they saw and heard."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: From that moment on, Joseph was no longer addressed as the father by the holy Child Himself, but rather as Father. The significance of this change in language is not random. Mary, with intention, did not say we when she and Joseph were seeking for Jesus, emphasizing the contrast that follows. Mary was in a state of amazement, just as the Greek word implies, as she went through the process of searching for Jesus. The sight and words of Jesus left them astonished, revealing that even His own parents had not fully grasped the power within this remarkable boy. This serves as a reminder that parents often fail to fully understand the potential within their own children. In response to Mary's complaint, Jesus' answer assumes a prior knowledge of His heavenly Father, which could be significant if Mary had not previously revealed the remarkable circumstances surrounding His birth. Such details, however, do not aim to overly exalt Mary but rather to provide insights into the unique nature of Jesus' relationship with His parents.
