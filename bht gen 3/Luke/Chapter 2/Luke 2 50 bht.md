# Luke 2:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even Mary, who had been prepared and guided for this moment, did not fully comprehend the significance of Jesus referring to God as his Father. Joseph's absence from the narrative after this event suggests that he may have passed away, leaving Mary and Jesus as the main figures. It is striking how the people around Jesus, including his parents, were still slow to fully grasp his divine nature and purpose. This lack of understanding highlights the profound mystery and depth of Scripture. We too, like Mary and Joseph, may not fully comprehend the magnitude of Jesus' words and actions.
