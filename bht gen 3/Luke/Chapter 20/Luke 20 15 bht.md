# Luke 20:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They cast him out of the vineyard, much like how Hebrews 13:11-13 depicts the casting out of Jesus outside the camp. This rejection of Jesus as the Messiah is akin to denying his Jewish heritage, going so far as to claim he was a Samaritan. This act of killing the Prince of life and the Lord of glory, who was the rightful heir of all things, must have deeply incensed and provoked God, who had his own Son's life taken away.

- Attempt 4 BHT: They cast him out of the vineyard, just as Hebrews 13:11-13 illustrates the expulsion of Jesus outside the camp. This rejection, denying his Jewish lineage, even claiming him to be a Samaritan, led to his delivery to the Gentiles. The profound offense committed by killing the Prince of life, the Lord of glory and rightful heir, inevitably provoked and angered God. This act of taking away the life of his own Son would certainly have stirred great indignation.

The gravity of the situation cannot be understated â€” the killing of the Prince of life, the Lord of glory, and the rightful heir of all things would have surely provoked and incensed God.
