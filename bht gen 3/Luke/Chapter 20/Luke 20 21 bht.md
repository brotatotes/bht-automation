	flattery to throw Him off His guard.


### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rightly (ŒøœÅŒ∏œâœÇ). Matthew (Matthew 22:16) notes that these 'spies' were 'disciples' (students) of the Pharisees and Mark (Mark 12:13) adds that the Herodians are also involved in the plot. These bright theologues are full of palaver and flattery and openly endorse the teaching of Jesus as part of their scheme."
2. "Acceptest not the person of any (ŒøœÖ ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒµŒπœÇ œÄœÅŒøœÉœâœÄŒøŒΩ). Dost not take the face (or personal appearance) as the test. It is a Hebraism from which the word œÄœÅŒøœÉœâœÄŒøŒªŒµŒºœàŒπŒ± (James 2:1) comes."
3. "Originally it meant to lift the face, to lift the countenance, to regard the face, to accept the face value."

2. "neither acceptest thou the person of any... [Christ] looked upon the heart, and knew what was in it, and respected sincerity and uprightness wherever he found it"
3. "but teachest the way of God truly the way of worshipping God, and of enjoying him, both in this world, and in that to come"

### John Wesley:
1. Thou speakest ‚Äî In private, and teachest - In public.
