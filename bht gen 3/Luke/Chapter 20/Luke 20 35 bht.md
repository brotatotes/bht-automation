# Luke 20:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In that future state, those who are deemed worthy to attain the resurrection from the dead will no longer be subject to the institution of marriage, as they will no longer experience death. The purpose of marriage, which is to perpetuate life through succession and renewal, will no longer be necessary for them. Instead, they will enter into a new state of life and resurrection, where marriage holds no significance. This state refers to the first resurrection, which only the dead in Christ will have access to.
