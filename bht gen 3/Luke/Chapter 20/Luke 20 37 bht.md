# Luke 20:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even Moses, whom you have quoted to establish the opposite view, actually supports the doctrine of the resurrection through his words in Exodus 3:6. When Moses saw the burning bush and heard God declare, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, he implied that these patriarchs are not totally perished, but still exist in some way. Jesus skillfully uses this to confirm the reality of the resurrection, refuting the Sadducees' denial and connecting the existence of souls with the resurrection of the dead.
