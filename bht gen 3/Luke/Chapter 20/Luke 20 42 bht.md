# Luke 20:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If Jesus' words were inaccurately reported, our dependence on the Gospel's accuracy would be in question. The inspiration and Messianic character of Psalm 110 is confirmed in all three Synoptic Gospels, leaving little room to deny its Davidic authorship. Thus, it is reasonable to accept the natural implication of Jesus' words, acknowledging that David himself spoke of the Lord saying to his Lord, Sit at my right hand.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This might be well, did the words occur in the Evangelist's narrative: but surely not, when they are in a discourse of our Lord." 
2. "If His words were so loosely reported as this, where is any dependence on the accuracy of the Evangelists?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The inspiration of this Psalm is expressly stated...and the Messianic character of the Psalm in all three Synoptics."
2. "Modern criticism that denies the Davidic authorship of this Psalm has to say either that Jesus was ignorant...or that he declined to disturb the current acceptation of the Davidic authorship."
3. "Meanwhile one can certainly be excused for accepting the natural implication of the words of Jesus here, 'David himself.'"

### John Gill:
1. "the Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand; which words were delivered by David, as inspired by the Spirit of God"
2. "and contain a speech of God the Father to his son Jesus Christ, upon his ascension to heaven, after his sufferings, death, and resurrection from the dead"
3. "when he was bid to sit down in human nature, at the right hand of God, in token of having done his work on earth to full satisfaction"

### John Wesley:
1.  Psalm 110:1.

- Attempt 1 BHT: It is important to consider the accuracy of the words reported in this discourse of Jesus. The first-tier commentary suggests that if the words were reported so loosely, then the reliability of the Gospel accounts comes into question. However, the Messianic character of Psalm 110 in all three Synoptic Gospels, coupled with the explicit statement of its inspiration, supports the natural implication of Jesus' words in Luke 20:42: David himself was the author. This Psalm is seen as a speech of God the Father to His Son Jesus Christ, affirming His place at the right hand of God after His sufferings, death, and resurrection.
