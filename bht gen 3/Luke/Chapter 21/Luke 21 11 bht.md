### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Earthquakes. See on Matthew 13:8."
2. "Famines and pestilences [ŒªŒπŒºŒøŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒªŒøŒπŒºŒøŒπ]. Some texts reverse the order of the words. A paronomasia or combination of like-sounding words: limoi, loimoi."
3. "Fearful sights [œÜŒøŒ≤Œ∑œÑœÅŒ±]. Only here in New Testament, and rare in classical Greek. In Septuagint, Isaiah 19:17. Not confined to sights, but fearful things. Rev., better, terrors."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Famines and pestilences (ŒªŒøŒπŒºŒø Œ∫Œ± ŒªŒπŒºŒø). Play on the two words pronounced just alike in the Koine (itacism)."
2. "And terrors (œÜŒøŒ≤Œ∑Œ∏œÅŒ± œÑŒµ). The use of œÑŒµ ... œÑŒµ in this verse groups the two kinds of woes."
3. "This rare word œÜŒøŒ≤Œ∑Œ∏œÅŒ± is only here in the N.T. It is from œÜŒøŒ≤Œµœâ, to frighten, and occurs only in the plural as here."

### John Gill:
1. "And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines and pestilences... and fearful sights; or 'terrible things'; whether heard, or seen..."
2. "...flaming sword, or a comet like one, hanging over Jerusalem, and armies in the air engaged against each other..."
3. "...very long and cold; and so the Persic version, 'and winter, and cold, shall be protracted'."

### John Wesley:
