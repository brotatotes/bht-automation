# Luke 21:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the end, there will be certain signs and events that will occur. These signs, known as the beginning of the actual pangs, will serve as a warning of what is to come. One of these signs is being brought before authorities, both religious and secular, and facing persecution for the sake of Christ's name. This can involve being brought before synagogues, being delivered up to prisons, and even being brought before kings and rulers. These events were not only prophesied by Jesus Himself, but they are also confirmed in the book of Acts. So, when we see these things happening, we can be assured that we are approaching the end times.
