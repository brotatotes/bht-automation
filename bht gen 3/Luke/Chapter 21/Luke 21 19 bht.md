# Luke 21:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the endurance of trials and tribulations, we must remain steadfast, for it is through this patient endurance that we shall win our souls. This winning or acquiring of our souls is not about possessing them in a material sense, but rather about finding and saving our true life. These afflictions should not be seen as obstacles to our salvation, but as the very means by which our souls are secured. Let us, therefore, be masters of ourselves, calm and serene, possessing an unshakable peace and joy in our souls that cannot be taken away by the world.
