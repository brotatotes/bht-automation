# Luke 21:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The times of the Gentiles mark the end of their dispensation, just as the destruction of Jerusalem marked the end of the Jewish Dispensation. When the Gentile rejection of the Lord is complete, Jerusalem will cease to be trodden down by the Gentiles. The punishment of the Jews has a limit, and once fulfilled, the Jews will be restored, leading to the establishment of a unified Church comprising Jews and Gentiles. The fulfillment of this prophecy is truly astounding, as witnessed by the overwhelming devastation and captivity during the siege of Jerusalem.
