## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "It seems undeniable that its immediate reference was to the destruction of Jerusalem, though its ultimate reference beyond doubt is to Christ's final coming."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Distress [συνοχη] . Only here and 2 Corinthians 2:4. Kindred with sunecomenh, taken (ch. 4 38), on which see note. The original idea of the word is being held in a tight grasp."
2. "With perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring. The A. V. follows the reading hjcoushv, the participle, roaring. The proper reading is hjcouv, the noun, the roaring. Render perplexity for the roaring of the sea, etc."
3. "Waves [σαλου] . Only here in New Testament. The radical notion of the word is unsteady motion, especially the rolling swell of the sea. Rev., better, billows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Distress (συνοχη). From συνεχω. In the N.T. only here and 2 Corinthians 2:4. Anguish."
2. "In perplexity (εν απορια). State of one who is απορος, who has lost his way (α privative and πορος). Here only in the N.T. though an old and common word."
3. "For the roaring of the sea (ηχους θαλασσης). Our word echo (Latin echo) is this word ηχος, a reverberating sound. Sense of rumour in Luke 4:37."

### John Gill:
1. "They shall fall from heaven, as in Matthew 24:29 and so the Ethiopic version reads here: all which, as it may be understood in a literal sense, so it may likewise in figurative and mystical one."
2. "By the 'sun' they understand the kingdom of the house of David; by 'the light', the law; by 'the moon', the sanhedrim; and by the stars, the Rabbins; and the same seem to be designed by the stars here."
3. "the sea and the waves roaring; which design some unusual and extraordinary storms and tempests, and inundations in the sea of Galilee, or Tiberias, which would be so very terrible, as to cause great uneasiness, distress, and perplexity."

### John Wesley:
1. And there shall be — Before the great day, which was typified by the destruction of Jerusalem: signs - Different from those mentioned Luke 21:11, etc. Matthew 24:29; Mark 13:24.
