## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Failing [αποψυχοντων]. Only here in New Testament. The word originally means to leave off breathing; to swoon."
2. "So also Sophocles, of Hector dragged behind Achilles' chariot: 'He breathed out his life [απεψυξεν βιον].' Ajax, 1031."
3. "Shall be shaken [σαλευθησονται]. Compare Matthew 11:7; Luke 6:38; Acts 4:31; Hebrews 12:26, Hebrews 12:27. The root of the verb is the same as that of billows, ver 25."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Men fainting (αποψυχοντων ανθρωπων). Genitive absolute of αποψυχω, to expire, to breathe off or out." 
2. "Expectation (προσδοκιας). Old word from προσδοκαω, to look for or towards. In the N.T. only here and Acts 12:11."
3. "The world (τη οικουμενη). Dative case, 'the inhabited' (earth, γη)."

### John Gill:
1. "Men's hearts failing them for fear...".
2. "For looking after those things which are coming on the earth..."
3. "For the powers of heaven shall be shaken."
