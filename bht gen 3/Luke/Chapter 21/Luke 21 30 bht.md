# Luke 21:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By carefully observing the progress of the season, we can perceive the signs of summer. When the plants shoot forth their buds, branches, and leaves, we know that summer is near. These signs are so plain and obvious that we can recognize them without any guidance from others. So, when we see these signs, we can confidently say that summer is now nigh at hand.
