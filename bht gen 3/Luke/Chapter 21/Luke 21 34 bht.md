# Luke 21:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of being weighed down by the cares of this life and the excesses of worldly pleasures; they quench spirituality and hinder reflection on our highest interests. Surfeiting, drunkenness, and the worries of this present life distract and make us unfit for spiritual exercises. That day will come suddenly, like a snare, upon those who are overcharged with these matters. Even strong Christians must take heed, for no sin is beyond our reach. Be vigilant and prepared, lest that day catch you unawares.
