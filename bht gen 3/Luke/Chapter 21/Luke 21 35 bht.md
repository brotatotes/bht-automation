# Luke 21:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The impending judgment will come suddenly, like a snare that entraps unsuspecting prey. It will affect all who dwell on the face of the whole earth, including the land of Judea. The destruction of the Jewish nation will be swift, unavoidable, and universal. The judgment will catch those who are sitting securely off guard, revealing their carelessness and sense of ease. Just as a bird is suddenly trapped in a snare and unable to escape, so will be the fate of those facing the impending judgment.
