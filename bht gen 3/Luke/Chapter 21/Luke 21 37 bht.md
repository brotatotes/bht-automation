# Luke 21:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the last week of His life, Jesus spent His days teaching in the temple, openly preaching the Gospel to the people. At night, He would retreat to the Mount of Olives, likely to pray for Himself and His disciples, as His time with them was growing short. This pattern of teaching in the temple during the day and lodging on the Mount of Olives at night was His constant method each day of that fateful week. While Matthew and Mark mention Bethany as His place of lodging, Luke includes the Mount of Olives as part of this abode.
