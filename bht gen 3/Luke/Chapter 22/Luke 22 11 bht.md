### Henry Alford:
1. "The 'goodman of the house' was a man of some wealth, and could not be identical with the water-carrier."
2. "The Greek word rendered guestchamber is not here, as in ch. ii. 7, an inn, but a room set apart at this season of the feast, by residents in Jerusalem, in which parties coming from the country might eat the Passover."
3. "The question therefore would be well understood;â€”and the room being spread, and as Mark adds, 'prepared,' would be no matter of surprise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Guest - chamber. See on Mark 14:14.
