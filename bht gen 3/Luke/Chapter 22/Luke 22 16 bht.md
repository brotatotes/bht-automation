Jesus alludes to this fulfillment again in the gospel, and the hour of the Passover was around six P.M, when the lamb was traditionally killed. Jesus states that he will not eat of this Passover again until it is fulfilled, likely referring to a future Messianic banquet. This points to his return rather than the Christian dispensation as the ultimate fulfillment of the Passover.
