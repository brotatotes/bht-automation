# Luke 22:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The loaf of bread, given for us and not broken for us, carries significance in its use of the word 'broken'. This instruction to keep on partaking in the breaking of bread highlights its continuous nature. The bread symbolizes the body of Christ, a voluntary and substitutionary sacrifice. Through contemplation of this sacrifice, we are nourished by Christ's flesh. The Lord's Supper is a commemoration, not a repetition, of his sacrifice. Therefore, we must understand the bread as symbolizing his body figuratively, similar to the paschal lamb.
