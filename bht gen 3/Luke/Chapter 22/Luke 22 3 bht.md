# Luke 22:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus entrusted Judas with the responsibility of overseeing the finances, Satan took advantage of this position to gain influence and control over him. Initially, the thought of betraying Jesus was suggested to Judas, but it took hold of him during the paschal supper when Satan entered into him. Although Judas willingly allowed Satan in, he cannot be relieved of his moral responsibility. It is a stark reminder that even in the midst of Jesus' ultimate victory over Satan, the consequences of allowing the adversary to enter our hearts can be dire.
