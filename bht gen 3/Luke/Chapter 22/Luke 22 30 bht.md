# Luke 22:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To those who have been with Jesus through trials and temptations, He appoints a kingdom as their way to it is His way. The promise of honor awaits the loyal, who will eat, drink, and enjoy their reign with Him in the appointed kingdom. They will sit on thrones, not necessarily twelve, and their enjoyment is a direct promise. This picture of honor and dignity is applicable not only to the twelve apostles, but also to all of Christ's servants and disciples, who will experience spiritual powers, honors, and delights.
