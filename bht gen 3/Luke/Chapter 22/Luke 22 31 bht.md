# Luke 22:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Satan desired to sift the disciples as wheat, not to separate the chaff from the wheat, but to cover the wheat of grace with the chaff of sin and corruption. Jesus, foreseeing the danger that Peter and the other disciples would face, forewarned them about the impending trials. The metaphor of sifting accurately portrays the severe shaking and tossing they would endure, as Satan continually goes about, seeking to devour and test believers. However, through these trials, the disciples would be refined and strengthened, ultimately fulfilling their calling to serve as His witnesses.
