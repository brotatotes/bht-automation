# Luke 22:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord's prayer was not unanswered because Peter's faith failed; the word fail implies a total extinction, but Peter's faith did not suffer that. Even an Apostle's faith can completely fail. Jesus had been praying already. Though Peter's faith partially failed, Jesus urges him to use his bitter experience to strengthen his tempted brethren. The word converted means to turn around, away from sin. Jesus prays for Peter's faith to not utterly fail. This text is misused to support papal infallibility, but it speaks to personal trust in our Lord, not a system of doctrine.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It must not be supposed that our Lord‚Äôs prayer was not heard, because Peter‚Äôs faith did fail, in his denial; this word fail here implies a total extinction, which Peter's faith did not suffer." 
2. "We may notice here, that our Lord speaks of the total failure of even an Apostle‚Äôs faith, as possible."
3. "The use of this word, and the cognate substantive, thrice by St. Peter in his two epistles... and in the first passage in a connexion with the mention of Satan‚Äôs temptations, is remarkable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But I have prayed‚Äîhave been doing it already." 
2. "Fail not‚Äîthat is, entirely; for partially it did fail." 
3. "Make use of thy bitter experience for the fortifying of thy tempted brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That thy faith fail not - The word 'faith,' here, seems to be used in the sense of religion, or attachment to Christ, and the words 'fail not' mean 'utterly fail' or fail altogether - that is, apostatize."
2. "It is true that the 'courage' of Peter failed; it is true that he had not that immediate confidence in Jesus and reliance on him which he had before had; but the prayer of Jesus was that he might not altogether apostatize from the faith."
3. "A man may be 'converted or turned' from any sin, or any evil course. He is 'regenerated' but once - at the beginning of his Christian life; he may be 'converted' as often as he falls into sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prayed [ŒµŒ¥ŒµŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑ŒΩ] . See on prayers, ch. 5 33." 
2. "Art converted [ŒµœÄŒπœÉœÑœÅŒµœàŒ±œÇ] . Converted is simply the Latinized rendering of the word to turn round [œáŒøŒΩœÇŒµœÅœÑŒµœÅŒµ] . Rev. renders the aorist participle, denoting a definite act, by once : 'when once thou hast turned again.'"
3. "Strengthen [œÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπœÉŒøŒΩ] . See on ch. Luke 16:25, and 1 Peter 5:10. Rev., stablish, which is much better. Strengthen may denote only a temporary effect. The word implies fixedness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I. Emphatic. In the consciousness of greater power than that of Satan and greater faithfulness than that of Peter."
2. "That thy faith fail not, i.e., cease altogether. Our Lord prays, not that Peter be not tried, but that his faith should not utterly fail. It was only through this prayer that Peter‚Äôs faith did not fail altogether."
3. "This is the one and only proof text for the Vatican dogma of papal infallibility (1870), on the assumption that the promise given to Peter applies to all the popes as his successors. But (1) this assumption can never be proved; (2) ‚Äòfaith‚Äô here as usual means personal trust in our Lord, not a system of doctrine to be believed; (3) if the passage proves anything for the popes, it would prove also that they deny their Lord, need conversion, and must strengthen their brethren which is much more than history warrants and papal infallibilists would be willing to admit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But he could and did pray for Peter's faith and his praying won in the end, though Peter stumbled and fell."
2. "The words single out Peter sharply."
3. "But the use of this word implied that Peter would fall though he would come back and 'strengthen thy brethren.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Satan in his temptations strikes principally at the faith of God's people; that being a grace which gives much glory to God, and in the exercise of which believers have much peace, joy, and comfort."
2. "Though, through the power of sin, and the force of temptation, [faith] may fail as to some degree of the steadfastness of it, as to the acting and exercise of it, and as to the sense believers may have of it; yet never as to its principle."
3. "Christ is the advocate of his people; he prays that they might have faith, and then he prays, that it may not fail; and it shall not, notwithstanding all the opposition of hell, and earth, unto it."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I have prayed for thee ‚Äî Who wilt be in the greatest danger of all: that thy faith fail not - Altogether..."
2. "...and when thou art returned - From thy flight, strengthen thy brethren - All that are weak in faith..."
3. "...perhaps scandalized at thy fall."
