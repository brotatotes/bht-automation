# Luke 22:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus forewarns the apostles about the dangers they will face in their mission, emphasizing the need for earthly resources and even the use of the sword for defense. The apostles misunderstand and show Him the two swords they have. Jesus specifically addresses Peter, as He knows him well and what lies ahead. He predicts that Peter will deny knowing Him three times, a warning echoed in all four Gospels. The rooster will crow twice, signifying Peter's denial, which will occur before the next cock crow in the early morning.
