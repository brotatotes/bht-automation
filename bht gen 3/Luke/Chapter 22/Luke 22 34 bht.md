# Luke 22:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This is the only place in the Gospels where our Lord addresses Peter by the name Peter, forewarning the Apostles of the dangers they will face in their mission. Unlike before, they must now rely on common resources and even use the sword for defense. This warning is repeated in all four Gospels, emphasizing the significance of Peter's denial. The name Peter, signifying steadfastness, contrasts sharply with his conduct. The cock will not crow until Peter has thrice denied knowing Jesus, showing that this denial will happen before the usual time of cock crowing in the morning.
