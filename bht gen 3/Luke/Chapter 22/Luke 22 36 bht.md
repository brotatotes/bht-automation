2. "He tells them of those dangers - of the necessity of being prepared in the usual way to meet them."

1. "He that hath not, i.e., purse or wallet, let him sell his cloke (â€˜outer garmentâ€™), necessary as that is, and buy a sword, which is now more indispensable than clothing."
2. "This is not to be taken literally, nor yet allegorically, as though the purse, wallet, and sword had each a spiritual signification; but the whole is a figurative setting forth of the fact that henceforth self-defence would be their chief necessity, in view of the outward perils which would come upon them."

2. "Christ here uses the common dialect of the nation...if a man had not any thing to eat, but what he had by alms, he must beg, or 'sell his garment', and take oil, and lamps, and light them."
3. "his meaning is, that wherever they came, and a door was opened for the preaching of the Gospel, they would have many adversaries, and these powerful, and would be used with great violence, and be followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need of swords to defend them."

### John Wesley:
