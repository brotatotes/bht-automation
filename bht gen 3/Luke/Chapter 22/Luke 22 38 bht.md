## BHT:
Two disciples, either from excess of zeal to defend Him or for the purpose of cutting up the Paschal lamb, showed Jesus two swords.

The disciples failed to recognize the deeper meaning behind Jesus' message, emphasizing the inadequacy of physical weapons in the spiritual conflict before him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Two of them were armed,â€”either from excess of zeal to defend Him, excited by His announcement of His sufferings during this feast,â€”or, perhaps because they had brought their weapons from Galilee as protection by the way."
2. "Chrysostom gives a curious explanation of the two swords,â€”that it was probable they had knives to cut up the Paschal lamb. This certainly agrees with the number of the disciples sent to get ready the Passover: but it has nothing else to recommend it."
3. "Our Lord breaks off the matter with It is enough,â€”not â€˜they are sufficient;â€™â€”but, It is well,â€”we are sufficiently providedâ€” â€˜it was not to this that My words referred.â€™"

### Albert Barnes:

2. "It is difficult to understand this... 'You are bravely armed indeed, with two swords among twelve men, and to meet such a host!'"
3. "It is to be observed that he did not say 'the two swords are enough,' but 'it is enough; perhaps meaning simply, enough has been said."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was truly shameful and stupid ignorance, that the disciples, after having been so often informed about bearing the cross, imagine that they must fight with swords of iron."
2. "As to the inference which the Doctors of Canon Law draw from these words â€” that their mitered bishops have a double jurisdiction â€” it is not only an offensive allegory, but a detestable mockery, by which they ridicule the word of God."
3. "And it was necessary that the slaves of Antichrist should fall into such madness, of openly trampling under feet, by sacrilegious contempt, the sacred oracles of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Galileans often travelled armed, and possibly two of the disciples had thus provided themselves because they expected danger that night."
2. "The reference is not to the sufficiency of the weapons, but a mild turning away from further explanation in view of their failure to understand."
3. "'Two swords' were of no avail in the spiritual conflict before Him; of this He had just spoken, but they failed to recognize His meaning."

1. "And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords,.... That is, the disciples said so, as the Persic version expresses it; for they understood Christ's words literally; and two swords being among them, and which they might bring with them from Galilee, to defend themselves from thieves, and robbers, which infested the roads between that country and Jerusalem..."
2. "and one of these, as appears afterwards, belonged to Peter; they mention them with a desire of knowing they were sufficient, or whether they must provide themselves with more..."
3. "or this was a short way of speaking, suggesting their stupidity and ignorance: it is enough, it is very well, I perceive you do not understand my meaning, and I shall say no more at present."

### John Wesley:
1. "Many of Galilee carried them when they travelled, to defend themselves against robbers and assassins." 
2. "But did the apostles need to seek such defence?" 
3. "It is enough - I did not mean literally, that every one of you must have a sword."
