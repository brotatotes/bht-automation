## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He bade nine of the Twelve remain 'here' while He went and prayed 'yonder.' He 'took the other three, Peter, James, and John, and began to be sore amazed [appalled], sorrowful, and very heavy [oppressed], and said, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death'‚Äî'I feel as if nature would sink under this load, as if life were ebbing out, and death coming before its time'‚Äî'tarry ye here, and watch with Me'; not, 'Witness for Me,' but, 'Bear Me company.' It did Him good, it seems, to have them beside Him."
2. "By signifying how it felt in the one view, He shows His beautiful oneness with ourselves in nature and feeling; by expressing how He regarded it in the other light, He reveals His absolute obediential subjection to His Father."
3. "It was just the internal struggle, apparently hushing itself before, but now swelling up again, convulsing His whole inner man, and this so affecting His animal nature that the sweat oozed out from every pore in thick drops of blood, falling to the ground. It was just shuddering nature and indomitable will struggling together."
