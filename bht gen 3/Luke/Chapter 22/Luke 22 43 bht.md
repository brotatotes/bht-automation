## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The strengthening by means of the angel is physicalâ€”and the appearance likewise."
2. "It is strange how Olshausen can have so far deceived himself as to imagine that appeared unto him can imply a merely inward and spiritual accession of strength from above."
3. "This strengthening probably took place between the first and the second prayer;â€”and the effect of it is, that He prayed more earnestly, ver. 44, and arrived at the entire resignation expressed in the second and third Payer of St. Matthewâ€™s narrative."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There appeared [Ï‰Ï†Î¸Î·] . The word most commonly used in the New Testament of seeing visions." 
2. "Strengthening [ÎµÎ½Î¹ÏƒÏ‡Ï…Ï‰Î½] . Only here and Acts 9:19. See on was not able, ch. 14 30; and cannot, ch. 16 3." 
3. "Used transitively only by Hippocrates and Luke."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An actual coming of an angel, not merely a spiritual accession of strength."
2. "Some think it was a physical strengthening, the imparting to His body, so overwhelmed in this conflict, new power to endure, to drink the cup which would not be removed."
3. "Others again prefer that the holy soul of our Lord, now seized by the intensest feeling of suffering, was strengthened by the brightening prospect of future joy, presented to Him in some way more vividly by the coming of the angel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  An angel (Î±Î³Î³ÎµÎ»Î¿Ï‚). The angels visited Jesus at the close of the three temptations at the beginning of his ministry (Matthew 4:11). Here the angel comes during the conflict. 


### John Gill:
1. "It is certain, it was a good angel: 'an angel of God', as the Ethiopic version reads; since he came from heaven, and was one of the angels of heaven, sent by God on this occasion."
2. "But the human nature was to be brought into so low a condition, and to be left to itself, as to stand in need of the assistance of an angel."
3. "This shows not only the ministration of angels to Christ, as man, but that he was at this present time made a little lower than the angels, who was the Creator and Lord of them."
