## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The intention of the Evangelist seems clearly to be, to convey the idea that the sweat was (not fell like, but was) like drops of blood." 
2. "Aristotle, speaking of certain morbid states of the blood, says, 'when the blood is watery, grievous disease ensues: for it becomes serous and milky, to such an extent that some have been known to perspire a bloody sweat.'" 
3. "We must not forget, in asking on what testimony this rests, that the marks of such drops would be visible after the termination of the agony."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Literally, though very awkwardly, it is, having become in an agony: having progressed from the first prayer into an intense struggle of prayer and sorrow."
2. "Agony occurs only here. It is used by medical writers, and the fact of a sweat accompanying an agony is also mentioned by them."
3. "Great drops [Œ∏œÅŒøŒºŒ≤ŒøŒπ]: Only here in New Testament: gouts or clots. Very common in medical language."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first result of the strengthening was that He prayed more earnestly, the final result was complete resignation and victorious waiting for the betrayer."
2. "The easy and natural explanation is, that as the result of the agony His sweat became colored with blood (not pure blood, hence ‚Äòas it were‚Äô), and fell in great clots to the ground."
3. "Instances of bloody sweat have occurred since. Every other view fails to give a sufficient climax to Luke‚Äôs description and seems to fall below the dignity of the conflict there endured for us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Satan pressed Jesus harder than ever before."
2. "Thick, clotted blood."
3. "Aristotle speaks of a bloody sweat as does Theophrastus."

### John Gill:
1. "And being in an agony... after his temptations in the wilderness Satan left him for a season, till another opportunity should offer; and now it did; now the prince of this world came to him; see Luke 4:13 and attacked him in a garden, where the first onset on human nature was made: and now began the battle between the two combatants, the serpent, and the seed of the woman; which issued in the destruction of Satan, and thee recovery of mankind." 
2. "This bloody sweat did not arise from a cachexy, or ill state of body, which has sometimes been the cause of it, as Aristotle observes, who says that the blood sometimes becomes sanious, and so serous, insomuch that some have been covered with a 'bloody sweat' [...] Christ's walk from Jerusalem to the garden was but a short one; and it was in the night when he had this sweat, and a cold night too." 
3. "And the same author relates of a young man of Florence, who being, by the order of Pope Sixtus the Fifth, condemned, as he was led along to be executed, through the vehemence of his grief discharged blood instead of sweat, all over his body: and Maldonate, upon this passage, reports, that he had heard it from some who saw, or knew it, that at Paris, a man, robust, and in good health, hearing that a capital sentence was pronounced upon him, was, at once, all over in a bloody sweat."

### John Wesley:
1. "Feeling the weight of the wrath of God, and at the same time surrounded with a mighty host of devils, who exercised all their force and malice to persecute and distract his wounded spirit."
2. "Even with stronger cries and tars: and his sweat - As cold as the weather was, was as it were great drops of blood."
3. "Which, by the vehement distress of his soul, were forced out of the pores, in so great a quantity as afterward united in large, thick, grumous drops, and even fell to the ground."
