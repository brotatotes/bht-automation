# Luke 22:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were found sleeping for sorrow, their drowsiness stemming from their overwhelmed hearts and their misunderstanding of the events taking place. Jesus' warning about his betrayal and suffering did not fully register with them, leading to confusion and the question about using the sword. Their grief filled their hearts, resulting in a heaviness that induced sleep. Nonetheless, Jesus remained resolute in fulfilling the prophecies, regardless of the disciples' sorrow and lack of comprehension.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words may possibly express an inference of the Evangelist: but I would rather understand them as exactly describing the cause of their sleeping."
2. "The first of these is the address to Judas, ver. 48, calling the traitor by name, and setting before him the whole magnitude of his crime in the very words in which the treason had lately been announced."
3. "Another is in ver. 49, where the disciples, seeing what would follow, ask, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? which question refers to, and is the filling up of their misunderstanding."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. For sorrow. The mention of the cause of the drowsiness is characteristic.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Sleeping for sorrow (ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î¼Ï‰Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï…Ï‚ Î±Ï€Î¿ Ï„Î·Ï‚ Î»Ï…Ï€Î·Ï‚). Luke does not tell of the three turnings of Jesus to the trusted three for human sympathy. 


### John Gill:

2. "...he had given them some intimations of his being to be betrayed by one of them, and of his sufferings and death, and speedy departure from them..."
