# Luke 22:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the moment Jesus is being held, He speaks the words Suffer ye thus far, possibly implying permission to touch the wounded person's ear. The accuracy of the narrative is strengthened by the absence of the initial laying hold of Jesus in Luke, but mentioned in Matthew and Mark. Only Luke documents this remarkable surgical miracle, revealing Jesus' compassion and underscoring the importance of practicing goodness towards adversaries. Whether Jesus picks up the ear remains uncertain, as His ability to heal transcends physical restoration. This incident serves as a reminder to endure violence for the sake of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Suffer ye thus far I understand as addressed [...] to those who were holding Him;â€”His hands were held,â€”and He says, Suffer, permit me, thus far: i.e. to touch the ear of the wounded person." 
2. "If this interpretation be correct, it furnishes an additional token of the truthfulness of our narrative; for the previous laying hold of Jesus has not been mentioned here, but in Matthew (ver. 50) and Mark (ver. 46)."
3. "His hands were held,â€”and He says, Suffer, permit me, thus far: i.e. to touch the ear of the wounded person."
