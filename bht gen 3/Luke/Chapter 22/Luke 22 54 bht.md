Although this house is distinguished from the high priest's own dwelling, it serves as the backdrop for Peter's denial, as confirmed by the other Gospel writers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 22:54. The high-priestâ€™s home. Undoubtedly Caiaphas is meant, since the other Evangelists agree in making his house the scene of Peterâ€™s denial.
