After a little while, another person, not just a maid but another man, accused Peter of being one of Jesus's followers. It seems that several people joined in accusing Peter, with a general accusation beginning at the fire and continuing as Peter withdrew to the porch. There, he was questioned both by a maid and a man, to which Peter bluntly replied, I am not. This denial came after Peter had mused upon his previous denials but lacked the courage to withstand the temptation.
