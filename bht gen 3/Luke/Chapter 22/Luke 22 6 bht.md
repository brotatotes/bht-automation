### Marvin Vincent:
1. Promised [εξωμολογησεν] . See on Matthew 3:6; Matthew 11:25. The idea is that of an open and fair consent or pledge.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Consented (εξωμολογησεν). Old verb, but the ancients usually used the simple form for promise or consent rather than the compound. This is the only instance of this sense in the N.T." 
2. "Opportunity (ευκαριαν). From ευκαιρος (ευ, καιρος), a good chance. Old word, but in the N.T. only here and parallel passage Matthew 26:16."
3. "In the absence of the multitude (ατερ οχλου). Ατερ is an old preposition, common in the poets, but rare in prose. Also in verse Luke 22:35. It means "without," "apart from," like χωρις. The point of Judas was just this. He would get Jesus into the hands of the Sanhedrin during the feast in spite of the crowd."

### John Gill:
1. "And he promised,.... He undertook to deliver him into their hands; he laid himself under obligation to do it; he faithfully promised he would."
2. "The Arabic version renders it, he gave thanks; for the money he received, being well pleased he had made such a bargain; and so the word here used sometimes signifies; and indeed commonly either to confess; or to give thanks."
3. "but found no opportunity of doing it this way, which they had agreed upon with him, and he had promised, until the night of the passover, when he was alone in the garden with his disciples."
