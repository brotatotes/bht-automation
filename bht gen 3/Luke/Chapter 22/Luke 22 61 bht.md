1. "And the Lord turned,.... Himself, his back being to Peter, whilst he was examining before the high priest; but he knew full well what was doing, what had been said to Peter, and how often he had denied him: and looked upon Peter; with his bodily eyes, with great earnestness, expressing in his looks concern and pity for him..." 
2. "for it was a look, not of wrath and resentment, but of love and mercy, and power went along with it; it was not only a signal to Peter, to put him in remembrance of what he had said, but it was a melting look to him, and a means of convincing and humbling him, and of bringing him to repentance."
3. "and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, before the cock crow, thou shall deny me thrice."
