### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Our passage in Luke leaves it undecided who the high priest was, with Annas and Caiaphas mentioned as high priests earlier. However, the Gospel of John clarifies that it was Annas who initially questioned Jesus before sending Him to Caiaphas for trial. Luke's account omits the trial altogether, perhaps summarizing it in the later description of the Sanhedrin assembly. It is noteworthy that the act of blindfolding Jesus is a unique detail found only in Luke and Mark's Gospels. Mark 14:65 and Matthew 26:67 provide further insight into this event.

- Attempt 5 BHT: The identity of the high priest during this event remains uncertain since Annas and Caiaphas are mentioned as high priests. It was Annas who questioned Jesus first, as mentioned in John's Gospel, before sending Him to Caiaphas for trial. The trial is not explicitly described by Luke, potentially summarized in the account of the Sanhedrin assembly. Notably, blindfolding Jesus is mentioned solely in Luke and Mark. Additional insight can be found in Mark 14:65 and Matthew 26:67.
