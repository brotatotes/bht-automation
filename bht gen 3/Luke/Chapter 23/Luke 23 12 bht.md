### Albert Barnes:

2. "When wicked men on both sides deliver up the children of God to death, it is not by what they consider to be a valuable price that they purchase mutual friendship, but what appears to them to be of no value whatever they not unwillingly surrender, just as if a person were to throw a crust of bread to a dog."
3. "Having first been reconciled to God, we ought to assist each other, by a devout and holy agreement, to follow righteousness, and to labor to discharge the duties of brotherly affection and of mutual humanity."

2. "A periphrastic imperfect of the double compound œÄœÅŒøœÖœÄŒµœÅœáœâ, an old verb, to exist (œÖœÄŒ±œÅœáœâ) previously (œÄœÅŒø-), here alone in the N.T., with ŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ (participle of ŒµŒπŒº) added."

### John Gill:
1. "For it pleased Herod, that Pilate should show such a regard to his authority and power, as to send one that belonged to his jurisdiction to take cognizance of his case."
2. "Pilate, on the other hand, was pleased with Herod, that though he was one that was under his jurisdiction, and so had a right of trying the cause, and either absolve or condemn, yet chose not to use this his power, but referred the case to the Roman governor."
3. "But now matters were made up by this step of Pilate's, in sending Christ to him, supposed to be a Galilean, and so of Herod's jurisdiction; which was tacitly acknowledging his former conduct to be wrong, and showed a regard to Herod's authority."
