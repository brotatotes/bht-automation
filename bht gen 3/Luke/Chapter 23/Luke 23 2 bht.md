## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words themselves which they use are not so false, as the spirit, and impression which they convey."
2. "The forbidden to give tribute to cÃ¦sar was, however, false entirely (see ch. xx. 22 ff.); and is just one of those instances where those who are determined to effect their purpose by falsehood, do so, in spite of the fact having been precisely the contrary to that which they assert."
3. "They falsely allege it before Pilate, knowing that it was the point on which his judgment was likely to be most severe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'fellow' is not in the original. It conveys a notion of 'contempt'... which is not proper should be expressed in the translation." 
2. "This was a mere wanton accusation, but it was plausible before a Roman magistrate."
3. "They did not say that he 'taught' that people should not give tribute - that would have been too gross a charge... They 'inferred,' therefore, if 'he' was 'a king,' that he must hold that it was not right to acknowledge allegiance to any foreign prince."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. We found. In a judicial sense : as the result of their examination before the council.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "We found. This implies investigation they had never made."
2. "Perverting, giving a false direction to, our nation. They thus represent themselves as genuine friends of the people."
3. "And saying, etc. This involved what was true. But from this single element of truth they deduced certain political results, which had never occurred, and by putting these false inferences in the foreground sought to obtain sentence of death against our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They had indulged their hatred in doing it, but they no longer have the power of life and death."
2. "Probably they mean that they had caught Jesus in the act of doing these things rather than discovery by formal trial."
3. "Jesus did claim to be the Christ and the king of the kingdom of God. But the Sanhedrin wanted Pilate to think that he set himself up as a rival to Caesar."

### John Gill:
1. "By spreading among them new notions, and false principles of religion; whereby he was a troubler of God's Israel."
2. "Charge of heresy, or innovation in religion against Christ."
3. "He taught the true doctrine, and right way of worship, and refuted the false glosses of the Pharisees, and opposed the vain traditions of the elders, by which both were corrupted."
