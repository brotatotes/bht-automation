# Luke 23:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why, what evil?, Pilate asked, dropping the speech-making tone and simply questioning the accusation. This use of Œ≥Œ±œÅ (explanatory and argumentative combined) reflects Pilate's confusion about the charges brought against Jesus. In fact, Pilate found no cause of death in him, declaring him innocent. Though being a heathen, Pilate honored Christ by acknowledging his innocence, while even Peter, a disciple, dishonored him by denying him thrice. In this exchange, Pilate seems inclined to chastise Jesus and let him go, recognizing that crucifixion was a punishment reserved for slaves and the vilest of men.
