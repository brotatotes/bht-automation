# Luke 23:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
His sacred sufferings were not a tragedy to be mourned, but a path to be embraced with joy. He tells the daughters of Jerusalem not to weep for Him, but for themselves and their children, who will soon face great miseries. With noble compassion, He turns towards them, urging them to consider their own sins and the impending judgment. His death is an expiation for the sins of the world, so there is no need to weep for Him. Instead, their sorrow should be directed towards their own spiritual state and the consequences to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His future course was not one to be bewailed‚Äîsee especially on this saying, Heb. xii. 2,‚Äî 'who for the Joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame.'" 
2. "Nor again were His sacred sufferings a mere popular tragedy for street-bewailing; the sinners should weep for themselves, not for Him."
3. "Those who now were young wives, would not be more than sixty when (A. D. 70) the city was taken. But to their children more especially belonged the miseries of which the Lord here speaks."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Noble spirit of compassion, rising above His own dread endurances..."
2. "...in tender commiseration of sufferings yet in the distance and far lighter..."
3. "...but without His supports and consolations!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Daughters of Jerusalem - Women of Jerusalem. This was a common mode of speaking among the Hebrews."
2. "Weep for yourselves ... - This refers to the calamities that were about to come upon them in the desolation of their city by the Romans."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ does not simply reprove them, as if it were improperly and without cause that they were weeping, but warns them that there will be far greater reason for weeping on account of the dreadful judgment of God which hangs over them."
2. "For, from the punishment which immediately followed, it was manifest that the life of Christ was dear to God the Father, at the time when all imagined that he had been wholly forsaken and cast off."
3. "Let us learn from this to rise to meditation on the cause of the death of Christ; for since God revenged it with such severity, he would never have permitted his Son to endure it, unless he had intended that it should be an expiation for the sins of the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He not only endures the cross, but forgets His sorrows, so heavy, to tell the truth to those who manifested for Him only a human sympathy."
2. "But weep for yourselves. Appropriate words for those who even now make of the crucifixion a mere popular tragedy."
3. "The catastrophe was to fall most directly upon their children: and for your children."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Turning (œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÜŒµŒπœÇ). Luke is fond of this second aorist passive participle of œÉœÑœÅŒµœÜœâ (Luke 7:9; Luke 7:44; Luke 7:55; Luke 10:23). If he had been still carrying the Cross, he could not have made this dramatic gesture."
2. "Weep not (ŒºŒ∑ Œ∫ŒªŒ±ŒπŒµœÑŒµ). Present active imperative with ŒºŒ∑, Stop weeping."

### John Gill:
1. "Weep not for me; signifying, that they need not be under any concern on his account, for he was very willing to die; he desired nothing more; this was that he came into the world about; nor was he afraid to die." 
2. "Christ's meaning is, that when things were rightly considered, there would be great reason to assuage their grief, on this account, and rather express it on another." 
3. "Weep for yourselves, and for your children; not themselves personally, but their nation and posterity; and either for sin, their own, and others; the sins of professors, and of the profane; particularly the sin of crucifying him, which would be more injurious to that people than to him, and do them more hurt than him."
