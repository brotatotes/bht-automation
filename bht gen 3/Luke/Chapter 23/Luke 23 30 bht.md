# Luke 23:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gravity of these words should not be overlooked, as they point to the impending destruction of Jerusalem. The imagery of mountains and hills seeking shelter portrays the desperate attempts to escape the coming judgment. This serves as a foreshadowing of the even more dreadful cries that will accompany the day of God's wrath. While primarily referencing the siege of Jerusalem, this prophecy also alludes to a future and more severe day of judgment. In the midst of such tribulation, some choose to be buried under the mountains and hills rather than face their enemies (Hosea 10:8).
