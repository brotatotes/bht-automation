# Luke 23:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If they can put Jesus to death, being who he is, what will happen to Jerusalem when its day of judgment comes? The proverb here plainly means: If such sufferings alight upon the innocent One, the very Lamb of God, what must be in store for those who are provoking the flames? The sufferings of the Saviour, as compared with the sufferings of the guilty, were like the burning of a green tree as compared with the burning of one that is dry.

2. "To which may be added, that he was forsaken by his God, and Father, and his wrath was poured out upon him, as he sustained the persons, and bore the sins of his people; the curse of the law was executed on him: and justice drew its sword, and sheathed it in him."
