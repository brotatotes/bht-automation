# Luke 23:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At Calvary, they crucified Jesus between two robbers on the very cross intended for Barabbas. The location was called Calvary or Golgotha, likely because it resembled a skull. This starkly contrasts Jesus, the innocent one, with the two robbers. While there is a tradition suggesting that Adam's skull was buried here, it is not widely accepted. Crucifixions were commonly conducted on elevated places, but the term Mount Calvary is inaccurate for this location.
