# Luke 23:36 Commentary Help Text

Around midday, the soldiers, yielding to the spell of the crucifixion, acted like boys in their jeers, offering Jesus their posca or sour wine. This incident was not as bitter or persistent as the one mentioned by other Gospel writers, and the soldiers came up close to the cross, coming to Jesus and mockingly holding out the vinegar, which was what was a part of their allowance and drink.
