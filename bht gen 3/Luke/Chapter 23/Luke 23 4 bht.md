## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We may remark...that Pilate must have known well that a man who had really done that, whereof Jesus was accused, would be no such object of hatred to the Sanhedrim."
2. "This knowledge was doubtless accompanied...with a previous acquaintance with some of the sayings and doings of Jesus, from which Pilate had probably formed his own opinion that He was no such King as His foes would represent Him."
3. "This is now confirmed by His own words (as related by St. John); and Pilate wishes to dismiss Him, finding no fault in Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I find no fault - I see no evidence that he is guilty of what you charge him with."
2. "This was after Pilate had taken Jesus into the judgment-hall by himself and examined him 'privately,' and had been satisfied in regard to the nature of his kingdom."
3. "He was 'then' satisfied that though he claimed to be 'a king,' yet his kingdom was not of this world, and that 'his' claims did not interfere with those of Caesar."

### John Calvin:
1. "As Christ was come to bear the punishment of our sins, it was proper that he should first be condemned by the mouth of his judge..."
2. "...it might afterwards be evident that he was condemned for the sake of others, and not for his own."
3. "This Herod was he who bears the surname of Antipas to whom was left the tetrarchy of Galilee...his design was not so much to obtain Herodâ€™s favor, as to get quit of a disagreeable affair under an honorable excuse, and thus to avoid the necessity of condemning Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I find no fault in this man." 
2. "Pilate speaks as a judge." 
3. "He examines our Lord and satisfies himself that no such political crime was involved in His claim to be King of the Jews."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The procession of the Sanhedrin would draw a crowd...and some may have come to ask for the release of a prisoner."
2. "There was need of haste if the condemnation went through before friends of Jesus came."
3. "Luke does not give the explanation of this sudden decision of Pilate that Jesus is innocent. Evidently he held a careful examination before he delivered his judgment on the case."

### John Gill:
1. "I find no fault in this man; no cause, or reason, why any punishment should be inflicted on him." 
2. "The man is an harmless and innocent man, that has done nothing against Caesar, or the government." 
3. "and therefore is not worthy of death, or of stripes, but should be discharged."

### John Wesley:
1. "I find no fault in this man - I do not find that he either asserts or attempts any thing seditious or injurious to Cesar."
