## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is nothing so astounding in this manâ€™s faith dogmatically considered, as has been thought; he merely joins the common belief of the Jews of a Messianic Kingdom, in which the ancient Fathers were to rise...with the conviction, that Jesus is the Messiah."
2. "What is really astounding, is the power and strength of that faith, which, amidst shame and pain and mockery, could thus lift itself to the apprehension of the Crucified as this King."
3. "It is remarkable how, in three following sayings, the Lord appears as Prophet, Priest, and King: as Prophet, to the daughters of Jerusalem;â€”as Priest, interceding for forgiveness;â€”as King, acknowledged by the penitent thief, and answering his prayer."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'kingdom' referred to was one beyond the grave...He does not presume to ask a place in that kingdom, though that is what he means, but with a humility quite affecting, just says, 'Lord, remember me when,' &c."
2. "If Christ will but 'think upon him' at that august moment when He 'cometh into His kingdom,' it will do... 'Only assure me that then Thou wilt not forget such a wretch as I, that once hung by Thy side, and I am content.'"
3. "Now contrast with this bright act of faith the darkness even of the apostles' minds... Consider, too, the man's previous disadvantages and bad life. And then mark how his faith comes out... he just says, 'Lord, remember me when Thou comest,' &c."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Remember me - This is a phrase praying for favor, or asking him to grant him an 'interest' in his kingdom, or to acknowledge him as one of his followers."
2. "While he might have been doing this, one of the malefactors may have continued to rail on him while the other became truly penitent."
3. "It is impossible now to fix the precise idea which this robber had of Christ's coming... All that we know is, that he fully believed him to be the Messiah, and that he desired to obtain an interest in that kingdom which he knew he would establish."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Into thy kingdom. Some texts read eijv, into, ejn, in. So Rev. In that case we must understand, "in thy kingly glory."


### John Calvin:
1. "A robber, who not only had not been educated in the school of Christ, but, by giving himself up to execrable murders, had endeavored to extinguish all sense of what was right, suddenly rises higher than all the apostles and the other disciples whom the Lord himself had taken so much pains to instruct."
2. "But that a person, ignorant and uneducated, and whose mind was altogether corrupted, should all at once, on receiving his earliest instructions, perceive salvation and heavenly glory in the accursed cross, was truly astonishing."
3. "Now if a robber, by his faith, elevated Christâ€”while hanging on the cross, and, as it were, overwhelmed with cursingâ€”to a heavenly throne, woe to our sloth (276), if we do not behold him with reverence while sitting at the right hand of God; if we do not fix our hope of life on his resurrection; if our aim is not towards heaven where he has entered."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He does not ask liberation from the cross, but is satisfied to cast himself on the personal love and care of the Being hanging in torture beside him."
2. "The man's faith recognized Jesus, not as one who would become King, but who was King, and as such would appear again, not as now, but in His royal dignity."
3. "But whatever his belief about the kingdom, his faith in the King was implicit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In thy kingdom... He refers to the Messianic rule of Jesus and begs that Jesus will remember him." 
2. "It is not clear whether he hopes for immediate blessing or only at the judgment."

### John Gill:
1. "Acknowledging him to be the Messiah, the King of kings, and Lord of lords."
2. "He not only was without all doubt, or scruple, about Christ's entering into his kingdom and glory after death, but he had knowledge of, and faith in his second coming."
3. "This was great faith indeed to be exercised on Christ at such a time as this, when he was under the greatest reproach and ignominy."

### John Wesley:
1. "Remember me when thou comest â€” From heaven, in thy kingdom."
2. "He acknowledges him a king, and such a king, as after he is dead, can profit the dead."
3. "The apostles themselves had not then so clear conceptions of the kingdom of Christ."
