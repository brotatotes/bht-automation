2. "By the death of Christ only was Paradise first, opened, in the true sense of the word."
3. "We know...that our Lord went down into the depths of death...and in that moment...they perhaps were in the Paradise of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus told him that his prayer would be answered that very day, implying, evidently, that it would be 'immediately' at death."
2. "Paradise - This is a word of 'Persian' origin, and means 'a garden,' particularly a garden of pleasure, filled with trees, and shrubs, and fountains, and flowers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In Paradise [œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒµŒπœÉœâ]. Originally an enclosed park, or pleasure-ground. Xenophon uses it of the parks of the Persian kings and nobles."
2. "In the Jewish theology, the department of Hades where the blessed souls await the resurrection; and therefore equivalent to Abraham's bosom."

2. "But if a robber found the entrance into heaven so easy, because, while he beheld on all sides ground for total despair, he relied on the grace of Christ, much more will Christ, who has now vanquished death, stretch out his hand to us from his throne, to admit us to be partakers of life."
3. "We ought likewise to observe by what keys the gate of heaven was opened to the robber; for neither papal confession nor satisfactions are here taken into account, but Christ is satisfied with repentance and faith, so as to receive him willingly when he comes to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise implies first of all that both should die that day, instead of lingering long, as was often the case, and then that both should that day pass to the same place: shalt thou be with me in Paradise." 
2. "The man‚Äôs faith was in Christ as a Person, and Christ‚Äôs promise was of personal association with Himself."
3. "The Jews thus termed that part of the world of disembodied spirits which is opposed to Gehenna (or Hell); the happy side of the state of the dead."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He promises him immediate and conscious fellowship after death with Christ in Paradise which is a Persian word and is used here not for any supposed intermediate state; but the very bliss of heaven itself."
2. "The word occurs in two other passages in the N.T. (2 Corinthians 12:4; Revelation 2:7), in both of which the reference is plainly to heaven."
3. "Some Jews did use the word for the abode of the pious dead till the resurrection, interpreting 'Abraham's bosom' (Luke 16:22) in this sense also. But the evidence for such an intermediate state is too weak to warrant belief in it."

### John Gill:
1. "In the salvation of one of the thieves @vital@ @theology finds one of its finest demonstrations."
2. "The dogma of purgatory was refuted, for this vile sinner was instantly transformed into a saint and made fit for paradise apart from his personal expiation of a single sin."
3. "The teaching of universalism was refuted, for only one was saved of all who might have been saved. Jesus did not say, 'Today shall ye be with me in paradise,' but 'Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "In paradise ‚Äî The place where the souls of the righteous remain from death till the resurrection."
2. "As if he had said, I will not only remember thee then, but this very day."
