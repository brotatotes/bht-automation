# Luke 23:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the crucifixion, a significant darkness fell over the land, with the sun being darkened. This darkness may have been meant to add solemnity to the event. Some speculate that the sun became dark after the darkness had already fallen, but it is more likely that the darkness caused the sun's light to fail. The mention of the temple veil being torn fits with the darkness occurring in the midst. This darkness, whether natural or supernatural, fulfilled a prophecy.
