## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was His own act...a determinate delivering up of His spirit to the Father." 
2. "None of the Evangelists say 'He died.'...but it is, 'yielded up His spirit,'"
3. "The spirit here is the Personality‚Äîthe human soul informed by the Spirit, in union..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I commend [œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ∏ŒµŒºŒ±Œπ] . See on ch. Luke 9:16. 
Gave up the ghost [ŒµŒæŒµœÄŒΩŒµœÖœÉŒµŒΩ] . Lit., breathed out (his life). Wyc., sent out the spirit. See on Matthew 27:50. 
47 - 49. Compare Matthew 27:51-56; Mark 14:38-41.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. Our Lord dies with Scriptural words on His lips (Psalms 31:5). The whole Psalm is not necessarily Messianic, for, by saying ‚ÄòFather,‚Äô our lord gives the whole its higher meaning for this hour." 
2. "‚ÄòSpirit‚Äô here means the immaterial part of Him who was dying. It is idle to say that the soul went to Hades and the spirit to His Father, for He had told the robber that He, the Personal object of His faith, would be in Paradise that day (Luke 23:43)." 
3. "In this prayer which came after the sixth word ('It is finished'), with its announcement of the completed work, our Lord freely gives up His spirit to the Father. The dying would indeed come in the course of nature, but this represents it as the supreme act of love and obedience."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus dies with the words of Psalms 31:5 on his lips."
2. "There is no special reason for retaining 'ghost' in the English as both Matthew 27:50 (yielded up his spirit, Œ±œÜŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ œÑŒø œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±) and John 19:30 (gave up his spirit, œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ¥œâŒ∫ŒµŒΩ œÑŒø œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±) use œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±."
3. "ŒµŒæŒµœÄŒΩŒµœÖœÉŒµŒΩ: First aorist active indicative of ŒµŒ∫œÄŒΩŒµœâ, to breathe out, to expire, old word, but in the N.T. only here and Mark 15:37; Mark 15:39."

### John Gill:
1. "Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit; not the Holy Spirit, nor his divine nature, but his human soul."
2. "Just as he was expiring, as he made his soul an offering for sin, and which he offered unto God, he committed it to his divine care and protection."
3. "And having said thus, he gave up the ghost; breathed out his soul dismissed his spirit, laid down his life, freely and voluntarily."

### John Wesley:
1. Father, into thy hands ‚Äî The Father receives the Spirit of Jesus: Jesus himself the spirits of the faithful.
