## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The things which came to pass are the darkness and other prodigies, after which we have no more raillery:‚Äîmen‚Äôs tempers are changed, and we here see the result."
2. "Smote their breasts... a sign of self-accusation, at least for 'the time,‚Äîwhich is renewed on the preaching of Peter, Acts ii. 37."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No mention is made of the rulers. Jerusalem was crowded, and the 'multitudes' were great. This sight, or 'spectacle.'" 
2. "The things which were done. These put an end to mockery."
3. "Returned smiting their breasts. In self-reproach, for they had cried out for His crucifixion. Luke alone speaks of this, but it is not implied that the people had taken no part in the previous mockery."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Certainly (ŒøŒΩœÑœâœÇ). Really, old adverb from the participle ŒøŒΩ from ŒµŒπŒº, to be. Used also in Luke 24:34 of the resurrection of Jesus."
2. "A righteous man (Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÇ). Mark 15:39 (Matthew 27:54) which see, represents the centurion as saying Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ œÖŒπŒøœÇ (God's Son) which may mean to him little more than 'righteous man.'"
3. "Returned (œÖœÄŒµœÉœÑœÅŒµœÜŒøŒΩ). Imperfect active of œÖœÄŒøœÉœÑœÅŒµœÜœâ. See them slowly wending their way back to the city from this Tragedy of the Ages which they had witnessed in awe."

### John Gill:
1. "beholding the things which were done... smote their breasts as conscious of guilt."
2. "as fearing some dreadful judgment would fall upon them."
3. "and returned; to the city, and to their own houses, where they might more seriously, and with the greater composure of mind, reflect on these things."

### John Wesley:
1. All the people ‚Äî Who had not been actors therein, returned smiting their breasts - In testimony of sorrow.
