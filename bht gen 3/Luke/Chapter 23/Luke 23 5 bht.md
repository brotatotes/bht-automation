## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Possibly they thought of the matter mentioned ch. xiii. 1, in introducing Galilee into their charge." 
2. "The opening words may mean, they strengthened, redoubled, the charge—or perhaps, they became urgent, they were the more fierce."
3. "They were the more fierce, as in text."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The more fierce - The more urgent and pressing."
2. "Stirreth up the people - Excites them to tumult and sedition."
3. "From Galilee to this place - To Jerusalem - that is, throughout the whole country."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They were more energetic and emphatic."
2. "The increased urgency is shown by the use of a stronger word."
3. "They were more fierce and stirreth up."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And they were the more argent."
2. "They strengthened their charge, urging anew the charge of perverting the people: He stirreth up the people, etc."
3. "But they were disappointed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But they were the more urgent (ο δε επισχυον). Imperfect active of επισχυω, to give added (επ) strength (ισχυω). And they kept insisting. Evidently Pilate had taken the thing too lightly."
2. "He stirred up the people (ανασειε τον λαον). This compound is rare, though old (Thucydides), to shake up (back and forth). This is a more vigorous repetition of the first charge (verse Luke 23:2, 'perverting our nation')."
3. "Beginning from Galilee (αρξαμενος απο της Γαλιλαιας). These very words occur in the address of Peter to the group in the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:37). The idiomatic use of αρξαμενος appears also in Acts 1:22. Galilee (Grote) was the mother of seditious men (see Josephus)."

### John Gill:
1. "They cried out louder, and exerted themselves with great fury and violence, and added strength to their clamour, and increased their charges."
2. "He stirreth up the people; to sedition and rebellion."
3. "He taught seditious principles not only in Galilee, but all the way from thence throughout Judea, and even in their chief city, and had drawn many disciples after him every where."

### John Wesley:
1. He stirreth up the people, beginning from Galilee — Probably they mentioned Galilee to alarm Pilate, because the Galileans were notorious for sedition and rebellion.
