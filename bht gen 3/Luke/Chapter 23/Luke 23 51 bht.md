# Luke 23:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Joseph of Arimathea was a member of the council that condemned Jesus, he did not agree with their decision or give his consent. Unlike the others, he had not participated in their determination against Jesus. He had not approved of their counsel and deed. In fact, it is quite clear that Joseph and Nicodemus were suspected of sympathy with Jesus and were not even invited to his trial. It is evident that Joseph's allegiance was to God's kingdom rather than the schemes of men.
