# Luke 23:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, in his attempt to evade the difficult decision of either unjustly condemning Jesus or releasing him against popular demand, sent him to Herod, following the regular practice of sending criminals to the ruler or judge of the district. This move also respected the jurisdiction and prerogative of Herod, who had authority over Galilee where Jesus had spent most of his life. However, it is worth noting that Pilate was also in Jerusalem at that time, likely hoping to gain more knowledge and possibly get rid of this troublesome case.
