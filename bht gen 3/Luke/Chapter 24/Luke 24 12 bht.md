# Luke 24:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon arriving at the tomb, Peter noticed the linen clothes laid by themselves, signifying a shared origin with another similar account. Peter's mention alone seems incongruous, while the term clothes specifically refers to the linen bandages utilized for wrapping the body. Stooping down and peering inside, Peter observed that the body was absent, yet the clothes were left behind. This enigmatic circumstance perplexed him, leaving him unable to make sense of it - the missing body alongside the presence of the clothes was a puzzling conundrum.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The similarity in diction to John xx. 5, 10‚Äî ( 'stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves,' and 'went away home,' being common to the two passages) indicates a common origin."
2. "The only reason for the insertion would be, to tally with ver. 24, and in that case it certainly would not mention Peter alone."
3. "That Cleopas bak ver. 24, certain of them that were with us went,&c. must not be pressed too much, although it does certainly look as if he knew of more than one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 12. Peter, &amp;c.‚Äî(See on :-). 
	
 :-. CHRIST
	APPEARS TO THE TWO
	GOING TO EMMAUS.


### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The best texts omit this verse." 
3. "Clothes. Not garments, but the linen bandages in which the body had been rolled."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke here inverts the order of the narrative, as may be readily inferred from the words of John."
2. "The word ran (·ºîŒ¥œÅŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩ) might justly be rendered as a pluperfect tense, had run."
3. "Luke mentions this circumstance for the purpose of showing more strongly the obstinacy of the apostles ill despising the words of the women."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The details agree so closely with John's account that we must suppose the two Evangelists speak of the same visit."
3. "It is his habit to go on with one line of thought, and afterwards to insert an omitted detail, in logical, rather than chronological, connection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stooping and looking in (œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫œÖœàŒ±œÇ). First aorist active participle of œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫œÖœÄœÑœâ, to stoop besides and peer into."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When Peter arrived at the tomb, he stooped down and saw the linen clothes laid by themselves. The mention of Peter alone in the verse is unlikely, and it seems to be connected to John's account. The linen bandages, not garments, were left behind. Peter stooped and peered into the tomb, where the body was not present but the clothes remained. This inversion of the narrative in Luke serves to highlight the apostles' disbelief in the women's words. Peter couldn't make sense of the situation. The body was not stolen, but neither could he account for its removal or the presence of the clothes. It was a perplexing mystery.
