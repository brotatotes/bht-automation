# Luke 24:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On their way to Emmaus, about seven and a half miles from Jerusalem, two disciples engaged in a conversation about Jesus. While one of the disciples was identified as Cleopas, the other person remains a subject of conjecture. Discouraged and unable to comprehend the recent events, they arrived at the conclusion that Jesus was not the Messiah. Despite the insignificance of Emmaus, its mention adds certainty to the narrative. This Emmaus was approximately seven miles away from Jerusalem, and the disciples reached it by early evening.
