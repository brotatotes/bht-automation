### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: As they journeyed, their hearts heavy with confusion and doubt, the two disciples exchanged views and feelings, weighing afresh all the facts that had transpired. Little did they know that the one who drew near to them was the risen Christ himself, but their eyes were held and they were blinded to his true form. Their conversation, like preaching in the early days of the Church, was largely conversational, as they sought to make sense of the events that had unfolded. They spoke of the ignominious treatment Jesus had endured, and of the reports they had heard from the women who claimed he had risen. It was a proof of their godliness that, though their faith was small and weak, they endeavored to cherish it and use it as a shield against the offense of the cross. In their desire to embrace the truth submissively, their holy desire to obey God found favor in his sight.
