# Luke 24:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their eyes were held from recognizing him, from knowing him fully. Christ Himself prevented their knowing Him, concealing only to reveal more fully. Immediate recognition would have filled them with a tumult of joy, fear, and doubt. We often fail to recognize Christ when He is nearest to us, but if He holds our eyes, it is to bless us more. Their eyes were held downwards, a posture suitable to their melancholy spirits, so they did not look up to Christ, their fellow traveler.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their eyes were holden - This expression is used merely to denote that they did not 'know' who he was."
2. "It does not appear that there was anything supernatural or miraculous in it, or that God used any power to blind them."
3. "It may easily be accounted for without any such supposition."

### John Calvin:
1. "But hence we learn how great is the weakness of all our senses, since neither eyes nor ears discharge their office, unless so far as power is incessantly communicated to them from heaven."
2. "I readily acknowledge that our senses are not frequently held in the same manner as happened at that time, so as to make so gross a mistake about an object presented to us; but by a single example God shows that it is in his power to direct the faculties which he has bestowed, so as to assure us that nature is subject to his will."
3. "The proper discrimination between truth and falsehood, therefore, does not arise from the sagacity of our own mind, but comes to us from the Spirit of wisdom."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Immediate recognition would have filled them with a tumult of joy, fear, and doubt."
3. "We often fail to recognize Christ when He is nearest to us; if He holds our eyes, as He sometimes does, it is to bless us more; if we hold our own eyes, then we are in danger of never recognizing Him at all."

3. "And this was so ordered, that they should not know him; that so they might not be surprised at once, as they would have been, had they looked at him, and discerned who he was."
