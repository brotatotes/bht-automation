# Luke 24:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The stone at the sepulchre was definitely rolled away, as mentioned in the more detailed accounts in Mark and Matthew, though not exactly as described for the two women named Mary. The stone was not just moved, but rather rolled away according to the perfect passive participle of the verb αποκυλιω. This was a significant fact discovered by the women when they reached the sepulchre, as it had great implications and revealed divine intervention, possibly involving an angel.
