# Luke 24:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their hope of redemption wavered, a weakened trust that hesitated to acknowledge their true belief. The promise of deliverance, encompassing both spiritual and political liberation, seemed shattered with His death and the passing days. Their doleful tale revealed profound despondency, their words filled with particles expressing deep emotion. We were hoping, they lamented, their faint hope fading further with each day that passed, until the third day arrived without the fulfillment of the promise. Yet, still, they clung to their flickering hope, holding on to the memory of His word.
