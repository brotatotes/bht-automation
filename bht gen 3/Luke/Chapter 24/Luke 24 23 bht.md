# Luke 24:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The women came proclaiming that they had seen a vision of angels, which reiterated their previous statement about not finding the body of Jesus. However, Cleopas and his companion, who were absorbed in their own story, were uncertain and skeptical because the women's testimony seemed too indirect and uncertain, involving women and angels. While the women's account was clear and well-attested, the disciples struggled to believe it, caught between hope and fear. It was not merely a deception of their sight - they had truly seen both Christ and the angels.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This agrees exactly with St. Luke‚Äôs own narrative, but not with St. Matthew‚Äôs, in which they had seen the Lord Himself."

3. "In the 'him they saw not,' said below of the 'certain of them which were with us.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They came saying that they have seen a vision of angels which say."
2. "Cleopas, absorbed in his story, throws himself back to the time of his interview with the women."
3. "Lit., 'They came saying that they have seen'."

 That they had also seen. Not finding what they sought, they had ‚Äòalso‚Äô seen what they did not seek, and heard what they could scarcely believe. 


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But all this was too indirect and uncertain (women and angels) for Cleopas and his companion."

3. "Same construction for Œ∂Œ∑ŒπŒΩ after ŒªŒµŒ≥ŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ."

### John Gill:

2. "So that it was not a deception of their sight, they certainly saw both Christ and the angels."
3. "Now, though this was so clear a point, and so well attested, the disciples knew not how to believe it; they were perplexed about it; they could neither receive it, nor discredit it; they hoped it might be so, but feared it was not."
