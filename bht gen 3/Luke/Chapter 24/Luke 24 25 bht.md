# Luke 24:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ reproached His disciples for their lack of understanding and slow hearts in believing the prophecies about His suffering and resurrection. They were thoughtless and did not properly attend to the evidence that He must die and rise again. Despite His clear predictions and teachings, they remained dull of perception, influenced by their own prejudices and ignorance of the Scriptures. Christ aimed to awaken and teach them, as those who are slow to believe the Old Testament prophecies have difficulty discovering their Messianic meaning.

1. "He reproached them for not seeing what he had himself so clearly predicted, and what had been foretold by the prophets."
2. "The word used in the original does not imply as much 'reproach' as the word 'fool' does among us. It was not an expression of 'contempt;' it was an expression denoting merely that they were 'thoughtless,' and that they did not properly 'attend to' the evidence that he must die and rise again."
3. "Slow of heart to believe - Not quick to perceive. Dull of learning. They had suffered their previous opinions and prejudices to prevent their seeing the evidence that he must die and rise from the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Nor does he only reprove them because, while they had the best Teacher, they were dull and slow to learn, but because they had not attended to the instructions of the Prophets."
3. "But let us observe that Christ, perceiving that his disciples are excessively sluggish; commences with reproof, in order to arouse them; for this is the way in which we must subdue those whom we have found to be hardened or indolent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He answers, not in a tone of pity, but of rebuke, as one competent to teach them."
2. "O foolish men, without understanding, unreceptive intellectually, and slow of heart, sluggish in the entire disposition."
