# Luke 24:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our blessed Saviour pretended that He would pass forth beyond Emmaus, but if He intended not to do it, yet He did no injury to the two disciples. In the nature of the thing, it is proper and natural, by an offer, to give an occasion to another to do a good action. But for this, the whole design of the interview had been lost but it was not to be lost, for He who only wished to be constrained had kindled a longing in the hearts of His travelling companions which was not to be so easily put off.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Our blessed Saviour appeared as if He would continue on beyond Emmaus, but this was not a deception or a breach of trust. He simply wanted to give the two disciples an opportunity to invite Him in, to allow them the chance to extend their hospitality. The longing of their hearts compelled them to constrain Him, to plead with Him to abide with them. And isn't this still repeated in the encounters between Christ and His loving disciples? We, too, yearn for His presence, uttering the words, Abide with me. The day is almost over, and the disciples were desperate for Jesus to stay. They were so determined and earnest that He could not resist their importunity. So, in response to their pressing entreaties and the deep longing within their hearts, Jesus joined them, and the design of the encounter could not be lost.
