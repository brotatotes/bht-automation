# Luke 24:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples entered the sepulchre, they were surprised by the absence of Jesus' body. The Western family of documents omits the phrase the Lord Jesus, pointing to a shorter Western text present in multiple instances throughout this chapter. This entrance could potentially be the same as the one referred to in Mark 16:5, where the women entered and found an empty tomb.
