2. "The Lord at their meal takes on Him the office of the master of the house...and as the Jewish rule was, that 'three eating together were bound to give thanks,' He fulfils this duty."
3. "In doing so, perhaps the well-known manner of His taking bread, &c., perhaps the marks of the nails in His hands, then first noticed, or these together, as secondary means,â€”but certainly His own will and permission to be seen by them, opened their eyes to know Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
