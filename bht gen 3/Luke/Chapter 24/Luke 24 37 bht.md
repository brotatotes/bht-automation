## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On account of His sudden appearance, and the likeness to one whom they knew to have been dead."
2. "A spirit is a ghost or spectreâ€”an appearance of the dead to the living."
3. "Not exactly as 'a phantasm,' Matt. xiv. 26, which might have been any appearance of a supernatural kind."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A spiritâ€”the ghost of their dead Lord, but not Himself in the body."
2. "Thoughtsâ€”rather, 'reasonings'; that is, whether He were risen or no, and whether this was His very self."
3. "Whether He were risen or no, and whether this was His very self."

### John Calvin:
1. "But a little ago, they had come to the conclusion that the Lord was risen, and had spoken of it unhesitatingly as a matter fully ascertained; and now, when they behold him with their eyes, their senses are struck with astonishment, so that they think he is a spirit."
2. "Though this error, which arose from weakness, was not free from blame, still they did not so far forget themselves as to be afraid of enchantments."
3. "So then they did not suspect that this was a vision intended to deceive them, as if it had been an idle phantom, but, seized with fear, they thought only that there was exhibited to them in spirit what was actually placed before their eyes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Terrified and affrighted. Johnâ€™s account also implies this. It was now, not hopelessness, but terror in fear of the sudden appearance, at night too."
2. "If we bear in mind the command to go into Galilee (Matthew, Mark), we shall conclude that it was utterly unexpected."
3. "A ghost, a departed spirit, returned in the semblance of a body. This assumes, and our Lordâ€™s words (Luke 24:39) teach, that there are disembodied spirits."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Terrified (Ï€Ï„Î¿Î·Î¸ÎµÎ½Ï„ÎµÏ‚). First aorist passive participle of Ï€Ï„Î¿ÎµÏ‰, old verb and in the N.T. only here and Luke 21:9 which see."
2. "Affrighted (ÎµÎ¼Ï†Î¿Î²Î¿ Î³ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿). Late adjective from ÎµÎ½ and Ï†Î¿Î²Î¿Ï‚ (fear). Both these terms of fear are strong."
3. "Supposed (ÎµÎ´Î¿ÎºÎ¿Ï…Î½). Imperfect active of Î´Î¿ÎºÎµÏ‰, kept on thinking so."

### John Gill:
1. "But they were terrified and affrighted... at his sudden appearance among them, without being heard, or seen before, and the doors shut and bolted."
2. "...they could not tell how to account for it, that it should be Jesus himself risen from the dead in his own body..."
3. "...supposed that they had seen a spirit; that what they saw was a phantom, or apparition, or a spirit, that had assumed, and appeared in, the shape of Jesus, and was not he himself."
