## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sight of the Hands and Feet, which they recognized as His, might at once convince them of the reality the appearance, and the identity of the Person."
2. "He declares to us the truth, that those appearances to which He was now likened by the disciples, and spirits in general, have not flesh and bones."
3. "Observe flesh and bonesâ€”but not blood. This the resurrection Body probably had not,â€”as being the animal life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "a spirit hath notâ€”an important statement regarding 'spirits.'"
3. "flesh and bonesâ€”He says not 'flesh and blood' for the blood is the life of the animal and corruptible body, which 'cannot inherit the kingdom of God'; but 'flesh and bones,' implying the identity, but with diversity of laws, of the resurrection body."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Handle. ... It never expresses the so handling an object as to exercise a moulding, modifying influence upon it, but at most a feeling of its surface; this, it may be, with the intention of learning its composition."
2. "Used of groping in the dark, Job 5:14; of the blind, Isaiah 49:10; Deuteronomy 28:29; Jude 1:16:26."

3. "As to the wounds, we ought to look upon this as a proof by which it was intended to prove to us all, that Christ rose rather for us them for himself; since, after having vanquished death, and obtained a blessed and heavenly immortality, yet, on our account, he continued for a time to bear some remaining marks of the cross."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Handle me and see; or know by feeling, as well as by sight; so that if the one was not sufficient, the other might confirm."
3. "A spirit hath not flesh and bones; nothing but appearance, or air at most; no solid substance to be felt and handled."
