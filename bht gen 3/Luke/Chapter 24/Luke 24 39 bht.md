3. "As to the wounds, we ought to look upon this as a proof by which it was intended to prove to us all, that Christ rose rather for us them for himself... But it was a foolish and an old wifeâ€™s dream, to imagine that he will still continue to bear the marks of the wounds, when he shall come to judge the world."
