# Luke 24:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The women were perplexed when the angels suddenly appeared to them in bright and dazzling garments. This was unexpected, as they had not anticipated a resurrection. The angels, who took the form of men, stood close and demonstrated their glory through their gleaming attire, resembling lightning. These celestial beings had previously disappeared when Mary had seen them earlier at the sepulchre, but they made a reappearance to bring comfort and deliver the news of Christ's resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The narrative does not... determine the position of the angels."
2. "It says merely that they came upon them, or that they appeared to them."
3. "The Evangelist does not mean that they were such, as clearly appears from what follows."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Shining [αστραπτουσαις] . Only here and ch. 17 24. Akin to ajstraph, lightning. See on bright shining, ch. 11 36; and compare ch. 17 24.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Perplexed thereabout. A natural state of mind, even if they had some hope of His rising, for now He seemed lost to them."
2. "Two men. This was the form of the angelic appearance."
3. "In shining garments. The word used implies that the brilliancy was like that of lightning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "While they were perplexed thereabout (εν τω απορεισθα αυτας περ τουτου). Luke's common Hebraistic idiom, εν with the articular infinitive (present passive απορεισθα from απορεω, to lose one's way) and the accusative of general reference."
2. "Stood by (επεστησαν). Second aorist active indicative of εφιστημ. This common verb usually means to step up suddenly, to burst upon one."
3. "In dazzling apparel (εν εσθητ αστραπτουση). This is the correct text. This common simplex verb occurs only twice in the N.T., here and Luke 17:24 (the Transfiguration). It has the same root as αστραπη (lightning). The 'men' had the garments of 'angels'."

### John Gill:
1. "For they had no thought, nor expectation of a resurrection."
2. "They were risen up, and stood close by them, on a sudden, at an unawares, being arrayed in white raiment."
3. "Their garments were bright and glittering like lightning, to set forth the glory and majesty of these celestial spirits."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold two — Angels in the form of men."
2. "Mary had seen them a little before."
3. "They had disappeared on these women's coming to the sepulchre, but now appeared again."
