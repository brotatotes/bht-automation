### John Calvin:

2. "Let us therefore observe with what suspicion we ought to regard the vehemence of our feelings, which, though it may have good beginnings, hurries us out of the right path."
3. "We are also reminded how earnestly we ought to struggle against everything that retards faith, since the joy which sprung up in the minds of the apostles from the presence of Christ was the cause of their unbelief."

### John Gill:
1. "Though they had been prepared for the belief of resurrection, by the report of the women, the relation of Simon Peter, and the account of the two disciples that came from Emmaus; yet such was the joy they were transported with, upon the evidence of it, the news was so good, and the favour and benefit so great, that they could scarcely believe their own senses of seeing and feeling."
2. "The thing was marvellous in their eyes, and was a wonderful confirmation of the truth of his deity, sonship, and Messiahship."
3. "not that he needed any, or was hungry and desirous of some to satisfy, or gratify his appetite, but to give them a further proof that he was not a spirit; and that he was risen from the dead in a true and real body, which was capable of eating and drinking."

### John Wesley:
1. While they believed not for joy ‚Äî They did in some sense believe: otherwise they would not have rejoiced. But their excess of joy prevented a clear, rational belief.
