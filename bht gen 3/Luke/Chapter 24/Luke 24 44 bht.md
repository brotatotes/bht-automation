# Luke 24:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While I was yet with you, I spoke about the Son of man being put to death and rising again, even though it may have seemed unclear at the time. The Old Testament Scriptures, divided into the Law, Prophets, and Psalms, contained prophecies and types that pointed towards my purpose and the fulfillment of what was written. This fulfillment was not an unexpected event but rather a realization of the words I had previously spoken. It is important to remember and embrace these words as a unified message from God.
