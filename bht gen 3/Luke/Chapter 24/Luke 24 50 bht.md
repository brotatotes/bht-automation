# Luke 24:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus spoke His final words, there seems to be uncertainty about the exact sequence of events regarding His Ascension. If we only had the Gospel of Luke, we would conclude that Jesus ascended after appearing to the Apostles and others. He led them out of the city and up to the brow of the Mount of Olives, facing Bethany and Jerusalem. In that moment, Jesus lifted up His hands in the gesture of blessing, granting His disciples larger measures of the Spirit, grace, and understanding into the Scriptures. This significant event took place within the boundaries of Bethany.

- Attempt 1 BHT: After Jesus spoke His final words to His disciples, there seems to be some uncertainty about the exact sequence of events surrounding His Ascension. If we only had the Gospel of Luke, we would conclude that Jesus ascended after appearing to the Apostles and others on the evening of His resurrection. He led them out of the city and up to the brow of the Mount of Olives, facing Bethany and Jerusalem. It is important to note that this Bethany refers to the district, not the town itself. As He ascended, Jesus lifted up His hands in the gesture of blessing, just as Melchizedek blessed Abraham and the perpetual law in Numbers 6:23 lays down.

This momentous event took place within the boundaries of Bethany on the Mount of Olives.
