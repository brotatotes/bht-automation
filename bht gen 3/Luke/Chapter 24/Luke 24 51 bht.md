# Luke 24:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus ascended into heaven, he went away in benedictions, leaving his disciples in awe. Their spiritual and mystical union remained, and while he physically departed, their separation was only temporary. His ascent into heaven was a fitting conclusion to his earthly journey, affirming his resurrection and proving his triumphant victory over death. Although some texts omit the mention of him being carried into heaven, we know from Acts 1:9 that Jesus ascended on a cloud, accompanied by the angels, to his rightful place as the King of glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We need not understand, 'by an angel,' or 'by a cloud;' the absolute passive is best."
2. "The tense is imperfect, signifying the continuance of the going up during the 'worshipping' of the next verse."
3. "That account is in perfect accordance with this, but supplementary to it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Incarnate Love, Crucified Love, Risen Love, now on the wing for heaven, waiting only those odorous gales which were to waft Him to the skies, goes away in benedictions, that in the character of Glorified, Enthroned Love, He might continue His benedictions, but in yet higher form, until He come again!"
2. "And oh, if angels were so transported at His birth into this scene of tears and death, what must have been their ecstasy as they welcomed and attended Him 'far above all heavens' into the presence-chamber, and conducted Him to the right hand of the Majesty on High!"
3. "Thou hast an everlasting right, O my Saviour, to that august place. The brightness of the Father's glory, enshrined in our nature, hath won it well for He poured out His soul unto death, and led captivity captive, receiving gifts for men, yea for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them. Thou art the King of glory, O Christ."
