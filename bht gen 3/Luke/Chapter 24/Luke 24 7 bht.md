How remarkable to hear angels quoting Christ's words to remind the disciples, wondering why the words weren't fresh in their memory. The angels even mentioned where the words were spoken.

Jesus was handed over to men with swords and staves, treated like a thief. The necessity of these events was decreed by God. Being among sinful men, it must've been disagreeable for the holy Lamb of God.
