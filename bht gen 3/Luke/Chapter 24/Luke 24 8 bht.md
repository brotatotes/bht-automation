# Luke 24:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And they remembered his words; by which we are taught that, though they had made little proficiency in the doctrine of Christ, still it was not lost, but was choked up, until in due time it yielded fruit. Saints are sometimes apt to forget even the gracious promises of God, but the word, or words, on which they have been caused to hope, are not lost. It may seem to be choked up, but in due time, the Spirit of God, who is their best remembrancer, will put them in mind of them and bring them to fruition.
