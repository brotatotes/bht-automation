## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Who these were, we have no means of determining. Certainly not soldiers of the army which Herod Antipas sent against Aretas, his father-in-law." 
2. "The way in which soldiers would be likely to act the part of informers, would be by laying vexatious charges of disaffection against persons."
3. "Soldiersâ€”properly, men on march: not this need not be pressed, only that they were soldiers serving in an army."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word signifies to 'shake thoroughly,' and so to 'intimidate,' probably in order to extort money or other property."
2. "acting as informers vexatiously, on frivolous or false grounds."
3. "We may take this as a warning against mutiny, which the officers attempted to suppress by largesses and donations."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do not take the property of any by unlawful force, or do not use unjust force against the person or property of any individual."
2. "It is probable that when they wished the property of others and could not obtain it by violence, or when there was no pretext for violence, they often attempted the same thing in another way, and falsely accused the persons of crime."
3. "It is lawful to defend oneself, oneâ€™s family, or oneâ€™s country, and hence, it is lawful to be a soldier."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word in this passage of Luke has the later, secondary meaning, to extort; and therefore the American Revisers rightly insist on, extort from no man by violence."
2. "Whatever explanation we may accept, it is evident that the word had some original connection with figs, and that it came to mean to slander or accuse falsely."
3. "Hence ojywnion is primarily provision money, and so used of supplies and pay for an army. With this understanding the use of the word at Romans 6:23, 'the wages of sin,' becomes highly suggestive."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do violence to no one. The verb first means â€˜to shake violently,â€™ then to oppress, vex, lay under contribution, etc."
2. "Neither accuse any wrongfully. Lit., neither be sycophants, i.e., play the spy, be informers, slander, etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Might does not make right with Jesus."
2. "These soldiers were tempted to obtain money by informing against the rich, blackmail again."
3. "Discontent with wages was a complaint of mercenary soldiers."

### John Gill:
1. "Do violence to no man; or 'shake' him, or put him, into bodily fear, by threatening, hectoring, and bullying him, and drawing the sword upon him, which is usual, upon the least offence, for such persons to do." 
2. "Neither accuse any falsely, or play the sycophant; who, in order to flatter some, bring malicious accusations against others."
3. "Be content with your wages; allowed by the government, and do not seek to increase them by any unlawful methods, as by mutiny and sedition, by rebelling against your officers, or by ill usage of the people."
