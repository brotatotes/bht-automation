- Attempt 1 BHT: It is emphasized that Herod in Luke 3:19 was not only someone who had done evil things in general, but also someone who had done many evil things (œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅœâŒΩ) actively and continuously. The phrase the evil one (ŒøJ œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅŒøœÇ) is associated with Satan and highlights the active and working nature of evil. The mention of an evil eye in Mark 7:22 reinforces this idea of an eye that brings harm or mischief. Herod's response to John the Baptist's reproof demonstrates how rare it is for someone to accept and bear reproof, particularly when it is severe. Nevertheless, John displayed moral courage by fearlessly reproving the powerful, even if it meant incurring their wrath. Herod's reaction is a reflection of the extreme malice and desperation of a sinner who refuses correction and seeks vengeance on his adviser. Overall, this passage serves as a reminder of the importance of faithful ministers of truth who are willing to confront and reprove evil, regardless of the potential consequences.
