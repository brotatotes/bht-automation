## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "At this age the priests entered on their office."
2. "Those who take the latter
	opinion, that we have here the line of Mary, as in Matthew
	that of Joseph‚Äîhere His real, there His reputed
	line‚Äîexplain the statement about Joseph, that he was 'the
	son of Hell,' to mean that he was his son-in-law, as
	the husband of his daughter Mary."
3. "On comparing the two
	genealogies, it will be found that Matthew, writing more immediately
	for Jews, deemed it enough to show that the Saviour was sprung
	from Abraham and David; whereas Luke, writing more immediately for
	Gentiles, traces the descent back to Adam, the parent stock of
	the whole human family."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was the age at which the priests entered on their office [...] but it is not evident that Jesus had any reference to that in delaying his work to his thirtieth year."
2. "He was not subjected to the Levitical law in regard to the priesthood, and it does not appear that prophets and teachers did not commence their work before that age."
3. "As was supposed - As was commonly thought, or perhaps being legally reckoned as his son."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Began to be about thirty years of age [Œ∑ŒΩ Œ±œÅœáŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ œâœÉŒµŒπ ŒµœÑœâŒΩ œÑœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±]. Peculiar to Luke. A. V. is wrong. It should be as Rev., when he began (to teach) was about thirty years of age." 
2. "CHAPTER IV 1 - 13. Compare Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13."

### John Calvin:
1. "When Christ was preparing to preach the Gospel, he was introduced by Baptism into his office; and at the same time was endued with the Holy Spirit."
2. "On account of this mildness of Christ, by which he kindly and gently called, and every day invites, sinners to the hope of salvation, the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the appearance of a dove."
3. "Though the words of Luke seem to intimate that it was not the substance of a body, but only a bodily appearance; yet, lest I should afford to any man an occasion of wrangling, I leave the matter unsettled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‚ÄòAbout,‚Äô indefinite, but probably over that age. The Levites did not enter upon their public duties under that age, and it is improbable that He would deviate from the usage." 
2. "The words, ‚Äòas was supposed,‚Äô would be a curious introduction to a genealogy of Joseph. We therefore prefer to explain this, ‚Äòbeing the son, as was supposed, of Joseph,‚Äô but in reality through his mother, ‚Äòof Heli,‚Äô the father of Mary, and His nearest male ancestor."
3. "It is precisely in this Gospel, that we would look for her genealogy, since she has been the principal figure thus far."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke does not commit himself definitely to precisely thirty years as the age of Christ."
2. "His own narrative in Luke 1:26-38 has shown that Joseph was not the actual father of Jesus."
3. "It is in harmony with Pauline universality (Plummer) that Luke carries the genealogy back to Adam and does not stop with Abraham."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus, when he was baptized and began his public ministry, was about thirty years of age: an age at which the priests, under the law, who were typical of Christ, entered on their work."
2. "Joseph might very rightly be called, as he was supposed to be, the father of Jesus, by a rule which obtains with the Jews that he 'that brings up, and not be begets, is called the father.'"
3. "Jesus was the son of Eli; and which must be understood, and carried through the whole genealogy, as thus; Jesus the son of Matthat, Jesus the son of Levi, Jesus the son of Melchi, till you come to Jesus the son of Adam, and Jesus the Son of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our great Master attained not, as it seems, to the conclusion of his thirty-fourth year. Yet what glorious achievements did he accomplish within those narrow limits of time!" 
2. "Happy that servant, who, with any proportionable zeal, despatches the great business of life; and so much the more happy, if his sun go down at noon."
3. "For the space that is taken from the labours of time, shall be added to the rewards of eternity."
