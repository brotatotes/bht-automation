# Luke 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salathiel in Luke's genealogy is linked to Jeconias in Matthew's genealogy. The possibility of a Levirate marriage or Salathiel marrying Neri's daughter may explain the difference in genealogies. While the two genealogies may not coincide, these variations make sense during the beginning of the captivity. Furthermore, some scholars suggest that Salathiel is the same person as Shealthiel.
