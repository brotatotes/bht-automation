# Luke 3:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The genealogical list in question has a unique variation wherein Cainan is inserted between Salah and Arphaxad, a discrepancy only found in the Greek version of the Old Testament. This insertion has sparked discussions regarding the corruption of the Hebrew text by the Jews, the possibility of inaccuracy in the Greek version, or even the accidental insertion by a transcriber that made its way into the Greek text. The resolution to this discrepancy hinges on how one interprets the wider differences between the chronological records of the Hebrew Bible and the Greek version.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only variation is the insertion here of Cainan (Luke 3:36), between â€˜Salahâ€™ (1 Chronicles 1:18: â€˜Shelahâ€™) and â€˜Arphaxad.â€™ This agrees with the LXX. (Genesis), but with no other Old Testament record." (Quote 1)
2. "Explanations: 1. That the Jews corrupted the Hebrew in these chronological passages; 2. That the LXX. is incorrect, though followed here; 3. Less probably that the transcriber inserted it here by mistake, and from this passage it got into the LXX." (Quote 2)
3. "Whether (1.) or (2.) be adopted must depend upon the view taken of the whole chronological difference between the Hebrew Bible and the Greek version." (Quote 3)
