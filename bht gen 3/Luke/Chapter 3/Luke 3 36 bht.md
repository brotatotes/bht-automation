# Luke 3:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This mentions a person named Cainam, whose name does not exist in the original Hebrew text but appears in the Greek translation of the Old Testament. There are two possible explanations for this: either the Hebrew text has been corrupted in these chronological passages or the Greek translation is incorrect. Some scholars lean towards the former, while others think the latter is more likely. It is unclear why this second Cainam appears in the lineage of Jesus, but it is noteworthy that he is not mentioned in the earliest Hebrew copies or other versions of the Old Testament.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Cainam] This name does not exist in our present Hebrew text, but in the LXX, Gen. x. 24; xi. 12, 13, and furnishes a curious instance of one of two thingsâ€”either (1) the corruption of our present Hebrew text in these chronological passages; or (2) the incorrectness of the LXX, and notwithstanding that, the high reputation which it had obtained in so short a time."
2. "Lightfoot holds the latter alternative: but I own I think the former more probable."
3. "See on the whole question of the appearance of this second Cainam (n) among the ancestors of our Lord, Lord A. Herveyâ€™s work above cited, ch. viii., in which, with much research and acuteness, he has endeavored to show that the name was probably interpolated here, and got from hence into the LXX. Certainly it appears not to have existed in the earliest copies of that version."

### John Gill:
1. "This Cainan is not mentioned by Moses in Genesis 11:12 nor has he ever appeared in any Hebrew copy of the Old Testament, nor in the Samaritan version, nor in the Targum."
2. "It indeed stands in the present copies of the Septuagint, but was not originally there; and therefore could not be taken by Luke from thence, but seems to be owing to some early negligent transcriber of Luke's Gospel..."
3. "For certain it is, there never was such a Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, for Salah was his son."
