# Luke 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every obstruction shall be so removed as to reveal to the whole world the Salvation of God in Him whose name is the 'Saviour'. The idea is that every obstruction shall be so removed as to reveal to the whole world the Salvation of God. This phrase aptly describes Luke's Gospel which has in mind the message of Christ for all men. That salvation will not be at all obscure, or experienced by a small number of persons, but will strike every eye, and will be common to all. It is the universal Gospel, the Messiah, the Saviour of God's appointing and sending, whom not only God's elect among them, but also all of them among the Gentiles, should behold with an eye of faith, for themselves, as their Saviour and Redeemer.
