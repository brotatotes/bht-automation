He used to say to those who were coming out, to the crowds of people which kept pouring out successively, warning them secretly, 'O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?'

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He said, the imperfect, and came forth, the present participle; both denoting action in progress, or customary action; so that the sense is, he kept saying, or he used to say to those who were coming out, to the crowds of people which kept pouring out successively."
2. "Generation [Î³ÎµÎ½Î½Î·Î¼Î±Ï„Î±] . Lit., births. Rev., better, offspring. It has been observed that John's figurative language is altogether the language of the desert."
3. "Warned [Ï…Ï€ÎµÎ´ÎµÎ¹Î¾ÎµÎ½] . From upo, under, and deiknumi, to shew. Hence, literally, to shew secretly. The word implies a private or confidential hint or reminder."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is probable, therefore, that John publicly attacked the Pharisees, for the benefit of the whole church of God, that they might no longer dazzle the eyes of simple men by empty show, or hold the body of the people under oppression by wicked tyranny."
2. "If John, the organ of the Holy Spirit, employed such severity of language in his opening address to those who voluntarily came to be baptized, and to make a public profession of the gospel; how ought we now to act towards the avowed enemies of Christ?"
3. "Those, whose ears are so delicate, that they cannot endure to have any bitter thing said against the Pope, must argue, not with us, but with the Spirit of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The present participle also notes the repetition of the crowds as does ÎµÎ»ÎµÎ³ÎµÎ½ (imperfect), he used to say."
2. "To be baptized of him (Î²Î±Ï€Ï„Î¹ÏƒÎ¸Î·Î½Î± Ï…Ï€' Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï…). This is the purpose of their coming."
3. "The verb is like our 'suggest' by proof to eye, ear, or brain (Luke 6:47; Luke 12:5; Acts 9:16; Acts 20:35; Matthew 3:7)."

### John Gill:
1. "O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
2. "They came with a view of being baptized, were it thought fit and proper they should."
3. "They desired to be admitted to his baptism."
