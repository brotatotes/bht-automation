### John Gill:
1. "It is an observation made long ago by Jerom, on Psalms 91:11 that Satan, in citing this text, has left out the middle clause, to keep thee in all thy ways, which he knew was against him, and has only taken that which made for him."
2. "Supposing the clause omitted was added, he asks of what advantage it would be? since the two verses being connected together as they are, the sense with respect to God's providence and preservation, is clear enough and complete."
3. "I am still of opinion, that the passage is applicable to Christ, as to any holy good man, yet it appears that Satan failed not, neither in the manner of citing it, nor in the application of it to Christ; but by wresting it to a wicked purpose."
