### Henry Alford:
1. "in the power of that full anointing of the Spirit for His holy office, which He had received at His baptism"
2. "A fair comparison of our vv. 16â€“24 with Matt. xiii. 53â€“58, Mark vi. 1â€“6, entered on without bias, and conducted solely from the narratives themselves, surely can hardly fail to convince us of their identity."
3. "That two such visits should have happened, is of itself not impossible; though (with the sole exception of Jerusalem for obvious reasons) our Lord did not ordinarily revisit the places where He had been rejected as in our vv. 28, 29."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With the victory over Satan new spiritual power is contrasted."
2. "A fame, etc. In consequence of His teaching or His miracles."
3. "The brief narrative implies many things not mentioned here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke often notes the power of the Holy Spirit in the work of Christ. Our word dynamite is this same word Î´Ï…Î½Î±Î¼Î¹Ï‚ (power)."
2. "A fame (Ï†Î·Î¼Î·). An old Greek word found in the N.T. only here and Matthew 9:26. It is from Ï†Î·Î¼, to say. Talk ran rapidly in every direction."
3. "Luke in these two verses (Luke 4:14; Luke 4:15) gives a description of the Galilean Ministry with three marked characteristics (Plummer): the power of the spirit, rapid spread of Christ's fame, use of the Jewish synagogues."
