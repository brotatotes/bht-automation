# Luke 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this instance, our Lord presents cases where the two greatest prophets in Israel weren't directed to act according to the proverb, 'Physician, heal thyself'. The three-year and six-month period of famine and temple desolation under Antiochus was a significant and ominous time in Jewish history. Our Lord, like the prophets, focused on feeding the poor and cleansing lepers, emphasizing acts of mercy rather than judgment. This period of drought, lasting three and a half years, is attested to by James and is not contradicted in the historical record.
