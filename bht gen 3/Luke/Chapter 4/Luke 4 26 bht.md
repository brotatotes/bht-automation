# Luke 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus uses the example of the widow of Zarephath to illustrate how God's favors are sometimes bestowed in unlikely ways. This woman, a Gentile from the land of Sidon, was chosen by God during a time of famine, while many widows in Israel were overlooked. It serves as a reminder that God's blessings are not limited to a specific people or place, and His miracles can happen outside our expectations. This story parallels other instances where Jesus worked in unexpected places and highlights the divine procedure in such cases.

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Luke 4:26, Jesus refers to the story of Elijah and the widow of Zarephath as an example of how God's favors are often bestowed in unexpected ways. This heathen woman from the land of Sidon, Sarepta, is a clear parallel to the Syro-Phoenician woman and the ruler's son at Capernaum.
