# Luke 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the time of Elisha, there were many lepers in Israel, yet none of them were cleansed except for Naaman, the Syrian. Naaman, a heathen, was the lone leper who was healed by Elisha. He followed the prophet's instructions to dip himself seven times in the Jordan River and was miraculously cured of his leprosy. This story of Naaman's healing finds a parallel in the miracles performed by Jesus, such as the healing of the Syro-Phoenician woman and the ruler's son at Capernaum.
