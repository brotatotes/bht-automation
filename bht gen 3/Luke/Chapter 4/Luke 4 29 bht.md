## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This whole occurrence, whenever it happened in our Lordâ€™s ministry, was but a foreshadowing of His treatment afterwards from the nation of the Jewsâ€”a foretaste of 'He came unto his own, and his own received him snot' (John i. 11)."
2. "The modern Nazareth is at a distance of about two English miles from what is called the Mount of Precipitation; nor is it built literally on the brow of that mount or hill."
3. "But (1) neither does the narrative preclude a considerable distance having been traversed, during which they had our Lord in their custody, and were hurrying with him to the edge of the ravine; nor (2) is it at all necessary to suppose the city built on the brow, but only on the mountain, or range of hills, of which the brow forms a partâ€”which it is."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "rose upâ€”broke up the service irreverently and rushed forth."
2. "thrust himâ€”with violence, as a prisoner in their hands."
3. "brow, c.â€”Nazareth, though not built on the ridge of a hill, is in part surrounded by one to the west, having several such precipices."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The place to which they led the Saviour is still shown, and is called the 'Mount of Precipitation.'" 
2. "It is at a short distance to the south of Nazareth."
3. "The whole transaction shows..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is used in medical language both of the eyebrows and of other projections of the body." 
2. "Most readers probably from these words imagine a town built on the summit of a mountain, from which summit the intended precipitation was to take place. This is not the situation of Nazareth; yet its position is still in accordance with the narrative."
3. "Cast him down headlong."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And they rose up, tumultuously from their seats in the synagogue."
2. "Cast him forth. Forced Him out, expelled Him."
3. "Throw him down head-long. Compare the Tarpeian rock at Rome, from which the Roman mob cast unpopular persons."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A movement towards lynching Jesus." 
2. "The infinitive alone can convey the same meaning." 
3. "Murder was in the hearts of the people."

### John Gill:
1. "And rose up,.... In great wrath, and, in a noisy and tumultuous manner, before the service was well over, and without being regularly dismissed..."
2. "...as if he had done something deserving of death; and therefore to be punished as a malefactor without the city..."
3. "...these men, without any regard to the place where they were, and the worship they were concerned in, and the day of the sabbath which then was, rise up in great wrath and fury, and without any show of justice, and in the most brutish and barbarous manner attempt to take away the life of Christ."
