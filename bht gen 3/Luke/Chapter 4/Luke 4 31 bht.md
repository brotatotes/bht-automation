# Luke 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus came down from Nazareth to Capernaum, which was situated by the lake. This transfer was not due to the events that occurred in Nazareth, but rather a intentional change of habitation. Capernaum, being on the Sea of Galilee, was now the headquarters of Jesus' ministry since Nazareth had rejected Him. There, Jesus taught the people in the synagogue on the Sabbath days, continuing His habit of teaching and focusing on a particular occasion. This was the first recorded miracle that Jesus performed in Capernaum, illustrating His authority and the power behind His teaching.
