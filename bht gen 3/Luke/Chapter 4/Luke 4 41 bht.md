## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Lord ever refused testimony from devils, for the very reason why they were eager to give it, because He and they would thus seem to be one interest, as His enemies actually alleged." (Luke 4:41)
2. "JESUS SOUGHT OUT AT MORNING PRAYER, AND ENTREATED TO STAY, DECLINES FROM THE URGENCY OF HIS WORK." (Acts 16:16-44.16.18-)
3. "See on Acts 16:16-44.16.18-:, where we learn how early He retired, and how He was engaged in solitude when they came seeking Him." (Acts 16:16-44.16.18-)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The medical bias of Luke may be seen from the words he abstains from using as well as from those he does use in respect of disease."
2. "He never uses malakia for sickness, as Matthew does, since this word is never so used in medical language, but is confined to the meaning of delicacy, effeminacy."
3. "So, too, he never uses basanizein, to torment, of sickness, as Matthew does, as it is never so used in medical language, the word there meaning to examine some part of the body or some medical question."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou art the Son of God. More definite statement of the deity of Jesus than the witness of the demoniac in the synagogue."

3. "Because they knew. Causal, not declarative. Past perfect of the second perfect Î¿Î¹Î´Î±. That he was the Christ. Infinitive in indirect assertion with the accusative of general reference."

### John Gill:
1. "Not willingly, nor of themselves, but at the word and command of Christ, who ordered them to depart."
2. "Thou art Christ; the true Messiah, that was of old promised and prophesied of, and has been long expected to come."
