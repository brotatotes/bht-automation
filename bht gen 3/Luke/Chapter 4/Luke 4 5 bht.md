# Luke 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The order of the temptations should be followed as presented in Matthew, with the mountain temptation being last. While Luke's account lacks a clear sequence, some believe the inversion was made for probability. The phrase in a moment of time is unique to Luke and signifies a mental feat of imagination, with the devil presenting a swift mental movie of all the kingdoms and their glory. It was a deceptive display meant to impress, but Jesus, as the creator and ruler, had no need for the devil's representation of the world's kingdoms.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There can be little doubt that the order in Matthew, in which this temptation is placed last, is to be adhered to in our expositions of the Temptation."
2. "No definite notes of succession are given in our text, but they are by Matthew: see notes there."
3. "Some suppose that the inversion has been made as suiting better the requirements of probability: it seeming; more natural that our Lord should be first taken to the mountain and then to Jerusalem, than the converse."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In a moment of time [ŒµŒΩ œÉœÑŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ∑ œáœÅŒøŒΩŒøœÖ]. Peculiar to Luke. Stigmh is literally a mark made by a pointed instrument, a dot: hence a point of time." 
2. "Stigmh is literally a mark made by a pointed instrument, a dot: hence a point of time."
3. "Only here in New Testament. Comapre stigmata, brand - marks, Galatians 6:17."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No definite mark of time, hence we think this temptation was the third (as in Matthew)."
2. "The words: 'into' a high mountain, are to be omitted."
3. "A supernatural extension of vision is possibly implied."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This panorama of all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them in a moment of time was mental, a great feat of the imagination (a mental satanic "movie" performance)."
2. "In a moment of time (ŒµŒΩ œÉœÑŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ∑ œáœÅŒøŒΩŒøœÖ). Only in Luke and the word œÉœÑŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ∑ nowhere else in the N.T. (from œÉœÑŒπŒ∂œâ, to prick, or puncture), a point or dot. Like our 'second' of time or tick of the clock."
3. "This second temptation in Luke is the third in Matthew's order. Luke's order is geographical (wilderness, mountain, Jerusalem). Matthew's is climacteric (hunger, nervous dread, ambition). There is a climax in Luke's order also (sense, man, God). There is no way to tell the actual order."

### John Gill:
1. "The devil having taken him from the pinnacle of the temple, and carried him to some high mountain, as Lebanon, or Pisgah, or some other near Jerusalem, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world not of the Roman empire only, though that consisted of many kingdoms, and is called the whole world, Luke 2:1 where the same word is used, as here; but of the whole universe, every kingdom that was under the heavens."
2. "He represented to Christ, not in a map, since the glory of them could not be described in that way: for he showed him all the glory of them, as Matthew adds; and for this a mountain was no more a proper place than any other."
3. "This was a mere phantasm, a deception of sight, with which he endeavoured to impose on Christ, but could not; nor did Christ, who is the maker of the world, and the governor among the nations, need any representation of the kingdoms of the world from him, Luke 2:1-."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The order of the temptations in Matthew, where the mountain temptation is last, should be adhered to when interpreting Luke 4:5. However, Luke's account does not provide a clear sequence of events. Some suggest that the inversion was made for the sake of plausibility. The phrase in a moment of time is unique to Luke and implies a mental feat of the imagination, as if the devil presented a rapid mental movie of all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. This temptation challenged Jesus with an impressive display, but it was a mere deception that did not deceive Him. Jesus, as the creator and ruler of all, did not need the devil's representation of the world's kingdoms.

This deceptive display sought to impress Jesus, yet as the creator and ruler, He did not require the devil's representation of the world's kingdoms.
