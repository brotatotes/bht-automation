### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He charged [œÄŒ±œÅŒ∑Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒπŒªŒµŒΩ] . A strong word, often, of military orders. Aristotle uses it of a physician: to prescribe."
2. "No one [ŒºŒ∑Œ¥ŒµŒΩŒπ] . The conditional negative: no one that he might chance to meet."
3. "Go, shew thyself. A lively change from the narrative to direct address."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To tell no man...Here in the direct form he follows Mark 1:43; Matthew 8:4. See discussion there about the direction to go to the priest to receive a certificate showing his cleansing, like our release from quarantine."
2. "The use of Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒπœÇ (them) here is 'according to sense,' as we say, for it has no antecedent in the context, just to people in general."
3. "But this identical phrase with absence of direct reference occurs in Mark and Matthew, pretty good proof of the use of one by the other. Both Matthew 8:4; Luke 5:14 follow Mark 1:44."

### John Gill:
1. "And he charged him to tell no man.... but go show thyself to the priest." 
2. "To the priests: and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses has commanded, for a testimony unto them."
3. "For a testimony unto them."

### John Wesley:
