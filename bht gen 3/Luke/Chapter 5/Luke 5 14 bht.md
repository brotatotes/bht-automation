### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To tell no man (ŒºŒ∑Œ¥ŒµŒΩ ŒµŒπœÄŒµŒπŒΩ). This is an indirect command after the verb 'charged' (œÄŒ±œÅŒ∑Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒπŒªŒµŒΩ)."
2. "But Luke changes (constructio variata) to the direct quotation, a common idiom in Greek and often in Luke."
3. "For a testimony unto them (ŒµŒπœÇ ŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒπŒøŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒπœÇ). The use of Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒπœÇ (them) here is 'according to sense,' as we say, for it has no antecedent in the context, just to people in general."
