## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The incongruities mentioned in Luke 5:36-38 were intended to illustrate the difference between the genius of the old and new economies, and the danger of mixing up the one with the other."
2. "The 'new wine' seems plainly to be the evangelical freedom which Christ was introducing; and the old, the opposite spirit of Judaism: men long accustomed to the latter could not be expected 'straightway'â€”all at onceâ€”to take a liking for the former."
3. "What lessons does this teach, on the one hand, to those who unreasonably cling to what is getting antiquated; and, on the other, to hasty reformers who have no patience with the timidity of their weaker brethren!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Why do ye eat, etc. Matthew and Mark represent the objection as raised against the conduct of our Lord." 
2. "But the disciples also ate with the publicans and sinners."
3. "The result would be a protest from the Pharisees against both the Master and His disciples."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is only the Pharisees who find fault here."
2. "Murmured (ÎµÎ³Î¿Î³Î³Ï…Î¶Î¿Î½). Imperfect active. Picturesque onomatopoetic word that sounds like its meaning."
3. "The crowd was so large that the feast may have been served out in the open court at Levi's house, a sort of reclining garden party."

### John Gill:
1. "They either murmured at the publicans and sinners sitting down at meat; or 'against him', as the Ethiopic version reads: either against Matthew for inviting them; or rather against Christ for sitting down with them."
2. "The other evangelists represent these as saying, why does he, or your master, eat with such? doubtless, they included both Christ, and his disciples; though they chiefly designed him, and to bring an accusation against him, and fix a charge upon him, in order to render him odious to the people."
3. "That is, they either murmured at the publicans and sinners sitting down at meat; or 'against him', as the Ethiopic version reads: either against Matthew for inviting them; or rather against Christ for sitting down with them."
