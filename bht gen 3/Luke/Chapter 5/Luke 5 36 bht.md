## BHT:
When Jesus cautioned against tearing a piece from a new garment to patch an old one, he emphasized the risk of merging incompatible systems. Mixing the old with the new results in the loss of completeness for the new and inconsistency for the old.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The latter part of this verse is peculiar, and is to be understood as in the margin, â€˜if he does, he both will rend the new garment' (by taking out of it the piece), 'and the piece from the new garment will not agree with the old.'"
2. "Our text is very significant, and represents to us the spoiling of both systems by an attempt to engraft the new upon the old: the new loses its completeness: the old, its consistency."
3. "The new loses its completeness: the old, its consistency."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No man having rent a piece from a new garment, putteth it, etc." 
2. "The new will rend the new." 
3. "He will not agree."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This part of the verse differs from the parallel passages, in representing a double disadvantage."
2. "Our text is very significant, and represents to us the spoiling of born systems by the attempt to engraft the new upon the old: the new loses its completeness; the old, its consistency."
3. "The new loses its completeness; the old, its consistency."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They are not called parables save here, but they are parables and Luke's language means that."
2. "The word for 'piece' or 'patch' in all the three Gospels is from the verb to clap on."
3. "Instead of this phrase in Luke, Mark 2:21; Matthew 9:16 have 'a worse rent'."

### John Gill:
1. "To join these together, in order to patch up a garment of righteousness, to appear in before God, was equally as weak and ridiculous, as to put a piece of new and undressed cloth into a garment that was old, and wore threadbare."
2. "By this Christ intimates, that the Jews, by being directed to the observance of the traditions of the elders, were drawn off from a regard to the commandments of God; so that instead of having a better righteousness, they had one much the worse, a ragged, and a rent one."
3. "The statutes of men, and the ordinances of God, or the traditions of the elders, and the commands of God, are no more like one another, than the piece of a new and an old garment, and as unlike is obedience to the one, and to the other."

### John Wesley:
1. He spake also a parable â€” Taken from clothes and wine; therefore peculiarly proper at a feast.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When Jesus spoke about not tearing a piece from a new garment to patch an old one, he was warning against the danger of trying to mix the old and the new systems. By attempting to engraft the new onto the old, both systems are spoiled. The new loses its completeness, while the old loses its consistency. The Jews, in their observance of the traditions of the elders, were drawn away from God's commandments, resulting in a worse righteousness. This parable reminds us that the statutes of men and the ordinances of God are completely different and obedience to one should not be mistaken for obedience to the other.
