## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Must be put (Î²Î»Î·Ï„ÎµÎ¿Î½). This verbal adjective in -Ï„ÎµÎ¿Ï‚ rather than -Ï„Î¿Ï‚ appears here alone in the N.T.â€¦ It is a survival of the literary style." 
2. "This is the impersonal use and is transitive in sense here and governs the accusative 'new wine' (Î¿Î¹Î½Î¿Î½ Î½ÎµÎ¿Î½)." 
3. "Though the agent is not expressed."

### John Gill:
1. "But new wine must be put into new bottles...." 
2. "...filled with spiritual joy and comfort, as with new wine..."
3. "And both are preserved...the grace that is put into them, which is a well of living water..."
