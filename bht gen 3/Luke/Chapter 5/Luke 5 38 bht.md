New wine must be put into fresh wineskins, which is a literary style surviving from Attic Greek.

The disciples of Christ and sinners called to repentance are like new wine, renewed by the Spirit and grace of God, filled with spiritual joy and comfort. They are preserved along with the grace put into them, which is a well of living water springing up to everlasting life, just like the Gospel and its blessings.
