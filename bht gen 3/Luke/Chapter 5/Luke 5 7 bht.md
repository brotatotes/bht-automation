## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They beckoned, on account of the distance."
2. "Not being able to speak from their amazement and fear."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Perhaps they were at a considerable distance, so that they could not be easily heard."
2. "It was with some one of this sort, I suppose, that Simon had toiled all night without catching anything, but which, when let down at the command of Jesus, inclosed so great a multitude that the net broke, and they filled two ships with the fish until they began to sink."
3. "Indeed, every kind of fishing is uncertain. A dozen times the angler jerks out a naked hook; the hand-net closes down on nothing; the drag-net brings in only weeds; the bag comes up empty. And then again, every throw is successful - every net is full."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They made signs because of the distance of the other boat; hardly, as has been suggested, because they were too much amazed to speak."
2. "Help [ÏƒÏ…Î»Î»Î±Î²ÎµÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹]. Lit., take hold with. Compare Philippians 4:3."
3. "Began to sink [Î²Ï…Î¸Î¹Î¶Ï‰ÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹]. Only here and 1 Timothy 6:9, of drowning men in destruction. From buqov, the depth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fishermenâ€™s signals require little explanation."
2. "Their fellows, i.e., the sons of Zebedee (Luke 5:10). Not necessarily â€˜partners.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Simon alone had been ordered to put out into the deep. So they used signs."
2. "Î¼ÎµÏ„Î¿Ï‡Î¿Ï‚, from Î¼ÎµÏ„ÎµÏ‡Ï‰, to have with, means participation with one in common blessings."
3. "Consecutive use of Ï‰ÏƒÏ„Îµ and the infinitive (present tense, inchoative use, beginning to sink)."

### John Gill:
1. "And they beckoned unto their partners... who were at some distance from them, probably lay at anchor near the shore, not having put out to sea when the other vessel did, and so were not within call..."
2. "that they should come and help them; take up the net, and take the fish out of it..."
3. "so that they began to sink; or 'were almost immersed'... the vessels were so heavy laden, with the vast quantity of fish that was taken, that they were just ready to sink with their burden."
