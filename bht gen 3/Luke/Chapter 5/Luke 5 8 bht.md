# Luke 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the presence of the Divine Power, there is a recognition of our unworthiness and sinfulness. Peter, overwhelmed by the greatness of Jesus' miracle, fell down on his knees and confessed his sinfulness, acknowledging that he was not fit to be in the company of the Lord. Like Peter, we should humbly throw ourselves at Jesus' feet, acknowledging our unworthiness and the need for his grace and salvation. We should approach him with reverence and humility, knowing that he offers a way for us to bridge the deep gulf that separates us from God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This sense of unworthiness and self-loathing is ever the effect, in the depths of a heart not utterly hardened, of the Divine Power and presence."
2. "Below this, is the utterly profane state, in which there is no contrast, no contradiction felt, between the holy and the unholy, between God and man."
3. "Above it, is the state of grace, in which the contradiction is felt, between the deep gulf perceived, which divides between sinful man and a holy God - yet it is felt that this gulf is bridged over."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It was rather, Woe is me, Lord! How shall I abide this blaze of glory?" 
2. "A sinner such as I am is not fit company for Thee." 
3. "His all was wrapped up in Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had no doubt now of the power and knowledge of Jesus. In amazement, wonder, and gratitude, and not doubting that he was in the presence of some divine being, he prostrated himself to the earth, trembling and afraid." 
2. "So should sinful people 'always' throw themselves at the feet of Jesus at the proofs of his power; so should they humble themselves before him at the manifestations of his goodness." 
3. "We 'are' not worthy to be with him, to be reckoned among his friends, or to dwell in heaven with him; but he came to seek the lost and to save the impure."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Zeus from the dark depths thundered, and the girls Heard it, and shuddering, at their father's knees Falling, they wept."

### John Calvin:
1. "Although men are earnest in seeking the presence of God, yet, as soon as God appears, they must be struck with terror, and almost rendered lifeless by dread and alarm, until he administers consolation."
2. "In this manner, Peter views Christ with reverence in the miracle, and yet is so overawed by his majesty, that he does all he can to avoid his presence."
3. "Hence we see, that it is natural to all men to tremble at the presence of God. And this is of advantage to us, in order to humble any foolish confidence or pride that may be in us, provided it is immediately followed by soothing consolation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fell down, etc. Not an act of worship, but a recognition of Godâ€™s power in Jesus."
2. "Depart from me. Go out from me, i.e., from my boat. This is like Peter. This miracle took place not only in his presence, but in his boat, his net, his fishing."
3. "For I am a sinful man. It was not superstition, but a sense of unworthiness. In Jesus he recognized to some extent the holiness as well as the power of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Just like Peter, from extreme self-confidence and pride to abject humiliation."
2. "His impulse here was right and sincere."
3. "His confession was true. He was a sinful man."

### John Gill:
1. "He fell on his knees before him, and threw himself prostrate at his feet, as a worshipper of him, and a supplicant unto him."
2. "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord; this he said, not as though the presence of Christ was burdensome, or disagreeable to him; but as one amazed at the greatness of the miracle wrought...and with the greatness of his majesty so near him."
3. "He had much the same sense of things as the centurion had...and when it is considered how gracious persons have been struck with awe and fear, and a consciousness of sin, weakness, and unworthiness, at the appearance of an angel...it need not be wondered at, that Peter should so express himself, in these circumstances."

### John Wesley:
1. Depart from me, for I am a sinful man â€” And therefore not worthy to be in thy presence.
