1. "The most natural and easy explanation is that proposed by Scaliger. The 'second day' of the Passover was a great festival, on which the wave-sheaf was offered, Leviticus 23:11. From 'that day' they reckoned 'seven weeks,' or seven 'Sabbaths,' to the day of Pentecost. The 'first' Sabbath after that 'second day' was called the 'second first,' or the first from the second day of the feast."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is beyond all question that this Sabbath belonged to some one of the festival-days which the Law enjoined to be observed once every year."
2. "I am more inclined to favor those who understand by it the second festivity in the year; and this agrees exceedingly well with the name given to it, the second-first Sabbath."

2. "Whether wheat or barley, we do not know, not our 'corn' (maize)."
3. "These Pharisees were straining out gnats and swallowing camels!"

### John Gill:
1. "Others have been of opinion, that as the Jews had two beginnings of their year, the one on civil accounts in Tisri, the other on ecclesiastical accounts in Nisan; so the first sabbath in Tisri was called the first first sabbath, and that in Nisan, which was this, the second first sabbath."
2. "After they had plucked them they rubbed them in their hands to get clean off the husk or beard, that were on them, and then ate the grains."
3. "But the disciples both plucked them, and rubbed them, and blew away the chaff from them on the sabbath day, and therefore were complained of by the Pharisees."
