## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Thy hand. The arm was not withered.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He looked round about on them all (περιβλεψαμενος). First aorist middle participle as in Mark 3:5, the middle voice giving a personal touch to it all." 
2. "Stretch forth thy hand (εξτεινον την χειρα σου). First aorist active imperative. Stretch out , clean out, full length."
3. "All three Gospels also have the first aorist passive indicative απεκατεσταθη with the double augment of the double compound verb αποκαθιστημ. As in Greek writers, so here the double compound means complete restoration to the former state."

### John Gill:
1. "Stretch forth thy hand, and he did so; he stretched it out, as the Syriac and Persic versions render it, which he was not able to do before."
2. "And certain it is, that his withered hand was restored sound and well as the other, directly."
3. "His hand was restored well as the other; the phrase, 'well as the other', is left out in one copy, and in the Vulgate Latin version; and so is the word 'well' in the Syriac and Arabic versions; and the word 'immediately' is added in the Ethiopic version."
