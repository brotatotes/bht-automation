1. "I believe it to be a form of acknowledgment on the part of the Evangelist, that he did not determine exactly into what part of this period to bring the incident so introduced."
2. "The whole of this paragraph is of a supplementary and indefinite character, serving more as a preface to the discourse which follows."
3. "This is the right rendering. The fancy that by the words rendered 'in his prayer to God' is meant in a house of prayer, is quite baseless."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The work with which the next day began shows what had been the burden of this night's devotions."
