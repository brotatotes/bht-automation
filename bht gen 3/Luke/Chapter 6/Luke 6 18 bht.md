## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Vexed - The word 'vex' with us means to provoke, or irritate by petty provocations. Here it means, however, to 'afflict,' to 'torment' - denoting deep and heavy trials."
2. "Unclean spirits - Demons that were impure and unholy, having a delight in tormenting, and in inflicting painful and loathsome diseases."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vexed [ŒøœáŒªŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπ] . The best texts read ejnocloumenoi, occurring only here and Hebrews 12:15. From oclov, a crowd or mob, with the idea of want of arrangement and discipline, and therefore of confusion and tumult." 
2. "Hence it is applied to the noise and tumult of a crowd, and so passes into the sense of the trouble and annoyance caused by these, and of trouble generally, like the Latin turbae." 
3. "Frequent in medical language. Thus Hippocrates, 'troubled [ŒµŒΩŒøœáŒªŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩœâ] with a spasm or tetanus.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The healings were repeated as often as they came."
2. "Note here both verbs, ŒπŒ±ŒøŒºŒ± and Œ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖœâ, used of the miraculous cures of Jesus."
3. "ŒòŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖœâ is the verb more commonly employed of regular professional cures, but no such distinction is made here."

### John Gill:
1. And they that were vexed with unclean spirits,.... Were possessed with devils, and sadly tormented and afflicted by them:
and they were healed: both such that had bodily diseases, and were under diabolical possessions.
