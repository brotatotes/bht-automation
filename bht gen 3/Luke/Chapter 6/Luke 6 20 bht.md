## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the Sermon on the Mount the benediction is pronounced upon the 'poor in spirit' and those who 'hunger and thirst after righteousness'." 
2. "Here it is simply on the 'poor' and the 'hungry now.'"
3. "Our Lord seems to have had in view 'the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love Him'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The kingdom of God is, essentially, the absolute dominion of God in the universe, both in a physical and a spiritual sense."
2. "The ultimate idea of the kingdom is that of 'a redeemed humanity, with its divinely revealed destiny manifesting itself in a religious communion, or the Church; a social communion, or the state; and an aesthetic communion, expressing itself in forms of knowledge and art.'"
3. "The kingdom of God in its present development is not identical with the Church. The Church is identified with the kingdom to the degree in which it is under the power of the spirit of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The discourse was spoken to the disciples generally, to the Twelve particularly, to the people prospectively."
2. "To refer this only to literal poverty, etc., and to limit the blessings to the temporal recompense in the Messiahâ€™s kingdom, is forbidden by the context no less than by the account in Matthew."
3. "An appeal on the part of our Lord to the prejudices of the poor and miserable, like a modern demagogue, is as contrary to His character as to the effect of His teaching."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "One can only say that neither professes to give a complete report of the sermon. There is no evidence to show that either saw the report of the other. They may have used a common source like Q (the Logia of Jesus) or they may have had separate sources."
3. "The kingdom of God... is the favourite word of Jesus for the rule of God in the heart here and now. It is both present and future and will reach a glorious consummation."

### John Gill:
1. "Blessed be ye poor; not only in the things of this world, having left all for Christ, but poor in Spirit..." 
2. "for yours is the kingdom of God; or heaven..."


### John Wesley:
1. "Prosperity is a sweet poison, and affliction a healing, though bitter medicine."
2. "Let the thought reconcile us to adversity, and awaken our caution when the world smiles upon us."
3. "Happy are ye poor â€” The word seems here to be taken literally: ye who have left all for me."
