# Luke 6:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you face expulsion or excommunication from society or the Church due to your faith, take heart, for you are blessed. This rejection and separation, whether from the congregation or social circles, might be difficult, but it is for the sake of righteousness and for the Son of man. Identifying as a Christian, disciple, or Nazarene may invite contempt and stigma, but remember that Jesus himself frequently referred to himself as the Son of man. Persevere through hatred and persecution, for that is when the blessing is promised.
