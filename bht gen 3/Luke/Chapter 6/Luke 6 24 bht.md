# Luke 6:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Woe to those who are rich, who have received their consolation in perishable objects and are consumed by their worldly possessions. This contrast serves both as a warning to the ungodly and a wake-up call to believers, reminding them not to be deceived by the allurements of the world. While riches themselves do not exclude one from the kingdom of heaven, those who place their hope in material wealth will find no true comfort except in Christ and his righteousness.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Woe to those who are rich, who have all their good things and joyous feelings here and now, in perishable objects. They have received their consolation, their inward craving still strong but the materials of satisfaction forever gone. The contrast between the rich and the poor not only strikes terror into the ungodly, but also serves as a wake-up call for believers, so that they may not be deceived by the allurements of the world. This curse is pronounced on those who are so completely occupied with their worldly possessions that they forget about the life to come, but it does not exclude all the rich from the kingdom of heaven as long as they do not make riches their idol.
