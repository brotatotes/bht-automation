# Luke 6:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To speak well of one, to have all men applauding, may seem flattering, but for the disciples of Jesus, it can be a warning. Seeking universal praise and gaining favor from the world may lead to suspicion of unfaithfulness, characterlessness, or the desire to please. As the salt of the earth, disciples should not prioritize the applause of the wicked, but instead focus on preaching sound doctrine and receiving commendation from the righteous.
