Endure violence with patience, refraining from retaliating in contempt. Offer the other cheek when struck, and allow your valuable garment to be taken without hindrance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The blow intended is not, therefore, a mere slap, but a heavy blow; an act of violence rather than of contempt."
2. "Lit., taketh up, lifteth."
3. "See on Matthew 5:40."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "On the cheek (ÎµÏ€ Ï„Î·Î½ ÏƒÎ¹Î±Î³Î¿Î½Î±). Matthew 5:39 has 'right.' Old word meaning jaw or jawbone, but in the N.T. only here and Matthew 5:39, which see for discussion. It seems an act of violence rather than contempt." 
2. "Thy cloke (Ï„Î¿ Î¹Î¼Î±Ï„Î¹Î¿Î½), thy coat (Ï„Î¿Î½ Ï‡Î¹Ï„Ï‰Î½Î±). Here the upper and more valuable garment (Î¹Î¼Î±Ï„Î¹Î¿Î½) is first taken, the under and less valuable Ï‡Î¹Ï„Ï‰Î½ last. In Matthew 5:40 the process (apparently a legal one) is reversed." 
3. "Withhold not (Î¼Î· ÎºÏ‰Î»Ï…ÏƒÎ·Î¹Ï‚). Aorist subjunctive in prohibition against committing an act. Do not hinder him in his robbing. It is usually useless anyhow with modern armed bandits."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ teaches patience in bearing injuries and affronts, and not to seek private revenge..." 
2. "...rather, suffer more, than indulge such a temper..."
3. "...for the same purpose is what follows urged."

### John Wesley:
1. "To him that smiteth thee on the cheek â€” Taketh away thy cloak - These seem to be proverbial expressions, to signify an invasion of the tenderest points of honour and property."
2. "Offer the other â€” Forbid not thy coat - That is, rather yield to his repeating the affront or injury, than gratify resentment in righting yourself; in any method not becoming Christian love."
3. "Matthew 5:39."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When someone strikes you with a heavy blow, do not retaliate out of contempt. Instead, turn the other cheek and endure the violence with patience. The act of taking away your upper and more valuable garment and then your lower and less valuable one is not something to hinder or prevent. Rather, bear witness to Jesus' teaching of patience in the face of injuries and affronts, and do not seek revenge. Offer yourself willingly to further mistreatment, for it is better to suffer more than to indulge in an un-Christian temper of retaliation. (Luke 6:29)
