# Luke 6:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What grace or gratitude is there to you? This is no fruit, nor evidence of grace, nor any exercise of the true grace of love. It is greatly observable that our Lord has so little regard for one of the highest instances of natural virtue, namely, the returning love for love, that he does not account it even to deserve thanks. For even sinners love those who love them, so what reward can be expected for such treatment?

Even sinners can do the same, so it is not a distinguishing quality of a believer. Our Lord does not hold the returning love for love in high regard, as even sinners can do it. This is something anyone can do, whether they have taken steps in Christianity or not.

- Attempt 5 BHT: What grace is there to you? This verse challenges us to consider the quality of our gratitude and love, rather than merely seeking reward. Loving those who love us is expected, even among sinners who lack the grace of God. Our Lord emphasizes that returning love for love does not even merit thanks, as it is a basic display of natural virtue. It is important to recognize that such actions can be done by those who have not yet embraced Christianity.
