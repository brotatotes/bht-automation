# Luke 6:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As sons and daughters of the Most High, we are called to emulate God's kindness and compassion. When we engage in acts of goodness and lend a helping hand, we should do so without expecting anything in return. Our hope should not hinge on receiving repayment but rather on being a source of hope and assistance to those in need. Just as God shows kindness to the ungrateful and the wicked, we are called to love even our enemies. Our reward comes from God, who sees and blesses our selfless acts of love and generosity.
