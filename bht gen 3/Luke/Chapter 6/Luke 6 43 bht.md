A corrupt life cannot bear good fruit nor can a good tree bear rotten fruit. Our opinion of others should be based on the fruit they bear.

Likewise, faithful ministers of the Gospel do not promote false teachings. Although believers are not without sin, a life marked by sin is not characteristic of a true follower of Christ.
