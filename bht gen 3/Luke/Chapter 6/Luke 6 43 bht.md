# Luke 6:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If our lives are marred by corruption, it is in vain to pretend to teach others. Just as a good tree cannot bring forth rotten fruit, those who are busy finding fault in others without recognizing their own wrongdoing cannot be considered good or faithful. Good and faithful ministers of the Gospel cannot bring forth false doctrines, just as true believers do not bring forth the evil fruit of sin as a common practice. It is by the fruits of their lives that we can form an opinion of every person's character and true teaching ability.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  43.] The corrupt fruit answers to the ‚Äúbeam in the eye.‚Äù if thy life is evil, it is in the vain to pretend to teach others.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is no good tree that bringeth corrupt fruit."

### John Calvin:
1. "By the fruits our opinion of every man ought to be formed, in the same manner as a tree is known by its fruit."
2. "The illative particle Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ, for, appears to connect these two sentences."
3. "I attach no great importance to the word for, which in other passages is often superfluous, and appears obviously to be so from the concluding statement."

### John Gill:
1. "For as that cannot be called a good tree, which brings forth bad fruit; so such men cannot be accounted good men, let them make ever so large pretensions to such a character, who are very busy in espying, discovering, and censuring the faults of their brethren; when they take no notice of, nor refrain from, nor relinquish their own."
2. "Good and faithful ministers of the Gospel cannot, and do not bring forth, and publish corrupt notions, and false doctrines, usually and knowingly; even usual, nor can it be, that a good tree should bring forth corrupt fruit."
3. "True believers...do not bring forth the evil fruit of sin, as the common and constant course of their lives and conversations; for that they never commit sin, or are entirely without it, cannot be said; but sin is not their usual and common practice, or they do not live in sin."
