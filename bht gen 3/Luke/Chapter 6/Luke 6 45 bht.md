# Luke 6:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Considering the close connection between the mouth and heart, it is vital to acknowledge that our Lord frequently reiterated essential teachings and did not solely speak each saying once. While natural individuals speak from the heart, there are instances where the mouth professes what the heart does not genuinely feel. Thus, it is crucial for believers to examine the doctrine proclaimed by those who claim to be servants of God, as titles lack significance without substantiating evidence. The tongue serves as a reflection of the mind, accurately expressing the abundance of the heart.
