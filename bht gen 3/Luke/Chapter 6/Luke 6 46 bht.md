# Luke 6:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crux of the matter lies in not just talking the talk but walking the walk. The subsequent parables serve to illustrate the significance of this point. By declaring Jesus as our Lord and acknowledging his dominion, we are called to not only pay lip service but to also carry out his instructions. Mere words without corresponding actions hold no weight. It is only when we faithfully adhere to his teachings and put them into practice that our professed allegiance to our Lord is truly meaningful.
