# Luke 6:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Two men faced the same choice of where to build their houses, each selecting a spot where sand covered the rock. One man built directly on the sand, while the other dug through to the rock. When the storm hit, the house built on the sand fell together, collapsed with a great crash that echoed like a mighty oak falling in the forest. This vivid imagery illustrates the consequences of merely hearing Christ's teachings without putting them into practice. It emphasizes the necessity of building our lives on a solid foundation by both hearing and doing what Jesus says.
