## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There can hardly be a doubt that in St. Matthewâ€™s narrative the two occurrences are blended: and this may have taken place from the very circumstance of the question about an animal having been asked on both occasions." 
2. "St. Luke omitting it here, because he reports it thereâ€”St. Matthew joining to it the question asked there, because he was not aware of another similar incident." 
3. "Right hand is a mark of accuracy, and from an eye-witness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His right hand. A very precise mode of statement. Lit., his hand the right one. Luke only specifies which hand was withered. This accuracy is professional."
2. "Ancient medical writers always state whether the right or the left member is affected."
3. "Withered. See on Mark 3:1."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On another sabbath. Probably the next one. This seems more likely than that the next day was observed as a Sabbath."
2. "Right hand. Specified by Luke only."
3. "Luke 6:7-10 agree closely with Markâ€™s account. Matthew inserts in this connection a thought mentioned by Luke as uttered on a similar occasion (chap. Luke 14:1-5), but there is no reason for inferring a confusion in the statements."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "On another sabbath (...). This incident is given by all three synoptics (Mark 3:1-6; Matthew 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11)."
2. "Only Luke notes that it was on a sabbath."
3. "Right hand (Î· Î´ÎµÎ¾Î¹Î±). This alone in Luke, the physician's eye for particulars."

### John Gill:
1. "Whether the following sabbath, or some time after, is not certain." 
2. "The Arabic version reads, 'into their synagogue'." 
3. "He explained the Scriptures to the people and instructed them in the doctrines of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 12:9; Mark 3:1.
