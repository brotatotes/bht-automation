## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Man, as a conscious being, can never be a mere means to an end." 
2. "The hidden intent was probably the spiritual awakening of the youth." 
3. "Make her joy to be a true and abiding one."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sat up [Î±Î½ÎµÎºÎ±Î¸Î¹ÏƒÎµÎ½] . Compare Acts 9:40. In this intransitive sense the word is used mostly by medical writers."
2. "Delivered [ÎµÎ´Ï‰ÎºÎµÎ½] . Rev., gave. 'For he had already ceased to belong to his mother' (Bengel)."


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The commanding word wrought its proper effect. Not only life, but health and strength had returned."
2. "The compassion completes its work. This act of love fulfils all that was implied in the consoling word: â€˜Weep not.â€™"
3. "The sublime simplicity of Luke should guard against a too sentimental representation... purely human, fanciful, and dramatic additions may call forth tears, without leading any nearer to the Giver of eternal Life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sat up (Î±Î½ÎµÎºÎ±Î¸Î¹ÏƒÎµÎ½). First aorist active indicative. The verb in the N.T. only here and Acts 9:40. Medical writers often used it of the sick sitting up in bed (Hobart, Med. Lang. of St. Luke, p. 11)."
2. "It is objected that the symmetry of these cases (daughter of Jairus raised from the death-bed, this widow's son raised from the bier, Lazarus raised from the tomb) is suspicious, but no one Gospel gives all three (Plummer)."
3. "Tender way of putting it. 'For he had already ceased to belong to his mother' (Bengel). So in Luke 9:42."

### John Gill:
1. "And he that was dead,.... That had been dead, (for he was now alive,) as it was a clear case to all his relations and friends, or they would never have brought him out to bury him..."
2. "...his sitting up and speaking, were plain proofs of his being brought to life..."
3. "...as Christ showed his power in raising the dead man, he discovered great humanity, kindness, and tenderness, in delivering him alive to his mother..."
