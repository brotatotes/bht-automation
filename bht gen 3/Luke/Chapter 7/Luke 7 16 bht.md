### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was no doubt that he was dead. There could be no delusion, and no agreement to impose on the people."
2. "The evidence that he came to life was decisive. He sat up, he spoke, and 'all' were impressed with the full assurance that God had raised him to life."
3. "He also has power to raise sinners, dead in trespasses and sins, to life. He can speak the word, and, though in their death of sin they are borne along toward ruin, he can open their eyes, and raise them up, and restore them revived to real life or to their friends."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. There came a fear on all [ÎµÎ»Î±Î²ÎµÎ½ Î´Îµ Ï†Î¿Î²Î¿Ï‚ Î±Ï€Î±Î½Ï„Î±Ï‚] . Lit., as Rev., fear took hold on all.


### John Calvin:
1. "Fear, therefore, is here taken in a good sense, because they gave the honor which was due to the power of God which they had beheld, and rendered to God not only homage, but thanksgiving."
2. "Not only were the affairs of Judea in a depressed state, but they had sunk under a wretched and frightful slavery, as if God were not looking at them. The only remaining hope was, that God had promised to be their Redeemer, after they had endured very heavy calamities."
3. "Though they acknowledge and celebrate the unwonted grace of God in this respect, that a great Prophet hath risen up among us, yet this eulogium comes very far short of the dignity and glory of the promised Messiah. Hence it appears that the faith of that people was, at this time, exceedingly confused, and involved in many unfounded imaginations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fear' was the natural result, but the word is used in the Old Testament sense. Not terror, but not yet the loving faith of the New Testament."
2. "Only the greatest prophets (Elijah and Elisha) had raised the dead, and the other saying indicates that they thought of the great prophet who was to come."
3. "Notice how the effect of this miracle was an exaltation of Jesus as a Person in the minds of those who witnessed it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
