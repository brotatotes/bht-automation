# Luke 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples of John came to him, sharing news about the works of Christ, particularly highlighting the remarkable miracle in Nain. These reports reached John while he was imprisoned, resulting in an exchange between Luke 7:18-35 and Matthew 11:2-19, representing a portion of non-Marcan material known as Q. It is apparent that the disciples, feeling envious and dissatisfied, did not commend Christ for these miracles, but rather conveyed their grievance that John, their esteemed teacher, was being overshadowed by Jesus, seeking greater recognition for him.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The disciples of John came to him and shared all these things, which could encompass a wide range of works performed by Christ, similar to what is described in Matthew. It is likely that these disciples, aware of John's imprisonment, brought these reports to him, particularly highlighting the most recent and notable miracle in Nain. The parallel account of Luke 7:18-35 in Matthew 11:2-19 is part of Q, the non-Marcan portion of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. It seems that John's disciples mentioned these events with a mix of envy, grief, and complaint, as they saw the attention and glory being directed towards Jesus instead of their own revered master.
