- Attempt 4 BHT: The expression the dead are raised in this verse does not necessarily signify that more than one resurrection had occurred, but rather encompasses the concept that some individuals from this group were brought back to life. Similarly, when Jesus declares that the blind receive, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the present tense indicates that these miracles were happening in real-time as Jesus spoke. These extraordinary works, such as restoring sight to the blind and enabling the lame to walk, were prophesied of the Messiah and are now being fulfilled by Jesus. Furthermore, the preaching of the Gospel to the poor is deemed the greatest mercy and miracle of all.
