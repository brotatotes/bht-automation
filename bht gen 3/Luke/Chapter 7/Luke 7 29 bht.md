## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It has been imagined that these words are a continuation of our Lordâ€™s discourse, but surely they would thus be most unnatural."
2. "They are evidently a parenthetical insertion of the Evangelist, expressive not of what had taken place during Johnâ€™s baptism, but of the present effect of our Lordâ€™s discourse on the then assembled multitude."
3. "Their whole diction and form is historical, not belonging to discourse."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They acknowledged the divine wisdom of such a preparatory ministry as John's, in leading them to Him who now spake to them."
2. "The publicansâ€”a striking clause."
3. "The Pharisees and lawyers, true to themselves in refusing the baptism of John, set at naught also the merciful design of God in the Saviour Himself, to their own destruction."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Justified God. Declaring, by being baptized, that God 's will concerning John's baptism was right.


### John Calvin:
1. "And all the people hearing... gave glory to God; while the Scribes... cared little for what Christ said." 
2. "The Lord intended... that neither... age, nor even posterity, might judge of the Gospel by the approbation of men." 
3. "Those who respectfully embrace the Son of God... are said to ascribe righteousness to God... The word justify... conveys the idea, that God is beheld with approbation, and crowned with glory, by the people who embrace that doctrine of which He is the author."

### John Gill:
1. "The publicans justified God; even those wicked men, who were before profligate and abandoned sinners, when they came under John's ministry, were so wrought upon by the power and grace of God through it, that they approved of, and applauded the wisdom, goodness, and grace of God..."
2. "...their approbation of the divine conduct, and their thankfulness for the same, they testified by their being baptized with the baptism of John..."
3. "...they hereby signified, that they thought that it was agreeable to the nature of God, who is holy, just, and good, suitable to the Gospel dispensation, and very fit and proper for them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Justified God - Owned his wisdom and mercy in thus calling them to repentance, and preparing them for Him that was to come."
2. "Our Lord continues his discourse: justified God - Owned his wisdom and mercy in thus calling them to repentance, and preparing them for Him that was to come."
3. "Preparing them for Him that was to come."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The words in Luke 7:29 are not a continuation of Jesus' discourse, but rather a parenthetical insertion by the Evangelist to express the effect of Jesus' words on the crowd. The people acknowledged the wisdom of John the Baptist's ministry in leading them to Jesus, while the Pharisees and lawyers rejected both John's baptism and the merciful design of God in the Savior. The publicans, surprising enough, also acknowledged God's righteousness by submitting to John's baptism. This recognition of God's wisdom and mercy in preparing them for Jesus is evident in their baptism. It is remarkable that Jesus interjects such a long comment, but it is perfectly appropriate.
