# Luke 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The elders, not from the synagogue but of the people, heard about Jesus in Capernaum and besought him most earnestly to come to the house of the centurion and cure his servant who was paralyzed. Their request reflects their belief in Jesus' ability to heal, as they had heard of his miracles and his arrival in Capernaum. Luke's account provides more details about these elders, distinguishing them from the elders of the synagogue and suggesting that they may have been principal officers or members of the sanhedrin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  3.] Elders—not elders of the synagogue (who in Luke are rulers of the synagogue, “archisynagogi,” Acts xiii. 15), but of the people.

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 7:3. Heard concerning Jesus, as he naturally would in Capernaum.
	
 Elders of the Jews. Not elders of the synagogue, but of the people. Here Luke is more accurate than Matthew.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One possible solution is that Luke tells the story as it happened with the details, whereas Matthew simply presents a summary statement without the details."
2. "This is not a Hebraism or an Aramaism, but is a common meaning of the verb in the papyri."
3. "Διασωση is effective aorist active subjunctive, to bring safe through as in a storm."

### John Gill:
1. "These elders he sent, were not the more ancient inhabitants of the city, called זקני עם הארץ, 'the elders of, or among the common people', as distinguished from זקני תורה, 'the elders of the law', or those that were old in knowledge."
2. "But these were either some principal officers of the city, called the elders of the people elsewhere; particularly, who were members of the sanhedrim."
3. "He besought him most earnestly by these messengers, that he would come to his house, and cure his servant of the palsy, by laying his hands on him, or commanding the distemper off, by a word speaking; or in what way he should think fit, for he made no doubt that he was able to heal him."

### John Wesley:
1. Hearing of Jesus — Of his miracles, and of his arrival at Capernaum.
