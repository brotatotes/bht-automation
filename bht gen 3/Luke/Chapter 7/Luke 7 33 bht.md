# Luke 7:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Critics wrongly suggest that Jesus associated with sinners because he condoned their ways, but this accusation was made by the Pharisees and lawyers to justify their rejection of Jesus. Luke alone mentions bread and wine in this context. Jesus deliberately varied his approach to convict unbelievers of their obstinacy, leaving them no excuse. His solemn preaching, austere lifestyle, and avoidance of festivals and socializing clashed with expectations, and this was also true for John the Baptist.
