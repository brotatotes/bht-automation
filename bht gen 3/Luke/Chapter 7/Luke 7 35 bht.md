## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "However wicked and depraved her children may be, Wisdom remains entire, and the malice of those who wickedly and malignantly slander her takes nothing from her authority."
2. "Let those who haughtily boast of being the children of Wisdom proceed in their obstinacy: she will, notwithstanding, retain the praise and support of her own children."
3. "Although many apostates may revolt from the Church of God, yet, among all the elect, who truly belong to the flock, the faith of the Gospel will always remain uninjured."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Of all her children (Œ±œÄŒø œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÑœâŒΩ œÑŒµŒ∫ŒΩœâŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒ∑œÇ). Here Matthew 11:19 has "by her works" (Œ±œÄŒø œÑœâŒΩ ŒµœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒ∑œÇ). Aleph has ŒµœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ here. The use of "children" personifies wisdom as in Luke 7:8; Luke 7:9. 


### John Gill:
1. "Christ, who is the wisdom of God, ... called them to repentance, converted and saved them: and these are his children." 
2. "These justify him from all such scandalous imputations, and by their lives and conversations show, that the doctrine of Christ is not a licentious one." 
3. "The universal sense and practice of all the real offspring of Christ, the sons of wisdom, who are wise to do good."
