# Luke 7:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The repentant woman, likely a prostitute, had heard Jesus's teachings and was awakened to her need for forgiveness. She anointed Jesus's feet with ointment, which had previously been an accessory to her sinful work, as a way to express her gratitude for being rescued. Jesus welcomed her without rejecting or spurning her, proving that he accepts all sinners. Although she had repented, her past reputation still clung to her, causing some, like Simon the Pharisee, to misunderstand Jesus's discernment.
