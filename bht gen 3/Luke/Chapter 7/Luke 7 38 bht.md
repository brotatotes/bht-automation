## BHT:
Overwhelmed by gratitude and a sense of forgiveness, a woman approached Jesus and knelt down to embrace and kiss His feet, an act of deep reverence.

Her selfless act demonstrated her immense love for Jesus, willing to sacrifice her pride and reputation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "She seems to have embraced His feet (see Matt. xxviii. 9), as it was also the Jewsâ€™ custom to do by way of honour and affection to their Rabbis (see Wetstein on this passage), and kissed them, and in doing so to have shed abundant tears, which, falling on them, she wiped off with her hair." 
2. "From the form of expression in the original (see in my Greek Test.), it does not appear that this latter was an intentional part of her honouring our Lord. It was the tears, implied in the word weeping,â€”the tears which she shed,â€”not â€˜her tears,â€™ which would be otherwise expressed."
3. "The ointment here has a peculiar interest, as being the offering by a penitent of that which had been an accessory in her unhallowed work of sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The tears, which were quite involuntary, poured down in a flood upon His naked feet, as she bent down to kiss them and deeming them rather fouled than washed by this, she hastened to wipe them off with the only towel she had, the long tresses of her own hair, 'with which slaves were wont to wash their masters' feet'." 
2. "The word signifies 'to kiss fondly, to caress,' or to 'kiss again and again,' which shows is meant here. What prompted this? Much love, springing from a sense of much forgiveness."
3. "No personal interview had up to this time taken place between them but she could keep her feelings no longer to herself, and having found her way to Him, they burst forth in this surpassing yet most artless style, as if her whole soul would go out to Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "She began to show her love for the Saviour, and at the same time her humility and penitence, by pouring forth a flood of tears, and washing his feet in the manner of a servant."
2. "There could be few expressions of penitence more deep and tender than were these. A sense of all her sins rushed over her mind; her heart burst at the remembrance of them, and at the presence of the pure Redeemer; with deep sorrow she humbled herself and sought forgiveness."
3. "In this way we should all come, embracing him as the loved Redeemer, humbled at his feet, and offering all we have - all that we have gained in lives of sin, in our professions, by merchandise and toil, while we were sinners - offering 'all' to his service."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The body of the guest rested on the couch; the feet were turned from the table toward the walls." 
2. "Wash more literally and better, as Rev., wet, as with rain." 
3. "Wiped. See on ch. Luke 5:2."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Genuine emotion is not intentional; only unbidden tears are precious."
2. "Her unbidden tears outran the prepared ointment; and were more precious in the sight of the Lord."
3. "Her tears dropped on his feet. That she intended to do this is unlikely."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "She was drawn irresistibly by gratitude to Jesus and is overcome with emotion before she can use the ointment; her tears take the place of the ointment."
2. "Among the Jews it was a shameful thing for a woman to let down her hair in public; but she makes this sacrifice."
3. "Kissing the feet was a common mark of deep reverence, especially to leading rabbis."

### John Gill:
1. "Her tears she used instead of water; for it was the custom first to wash the feet before they were anointed with oil, which she intended to do."
2. "That which was her ornament and pride, and which she took great care of to nourish and put in proper form, to render her desirable, she uses instead of a towel to wipe her Lord's feet, and her tears off of them."
3. "This custom was also used by the Greeks and Romans among their civilities, and in their salutations."
