# Luke 7:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The depth of meaning in these words shines through when we realize who said them and the means by which forgiveness was achieved. The parable illustrates the contrasting attitudes of the two debtors towards the lender who forgave them both. Grateful love does not pay the debt, but the forgiveness given is genuine and personal. It is a forgiveness bestowed freely by God, regardless of any merits or conditions on the part of the debtors. This shows that the love of a reclaimed sinner, though intense, is not as complete as a life fully dedicated to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What depth of meaning there is in these words, if we reflect WHO said them, and by what means this forgiveness was to be wrought!"
2. "The more sin, the more love: let us then sin, that we may love the more."
3. "The love of the reclaimed profligate may be and is intense of its kind, yet that kind is not so high nor complete as the sacrifice of the whole life‚Äîto His service to whom we were in baptism dedicated."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If it was a mere 'debt' which we owed to God, he might forgive, as this creditor did, without an equivalent. But it is 'crime' which he forgives."
2. "A parent might forgive a 'debt' without any equivalent; but he cannot pardon an offending child without regarding his own 'character' as a parent, the 'truth' of his threatenings, the good order of his house, and the maintenance of his authority."
3. "So our sins against God, though they are called 'debts,' are called so 'figuratively.' It is not an affair of 'money,' and God cannot forgive us without maintaining his word, the honor of his government, and law - in other words, without an 'atonement.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Frankly forgave [ŒµœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉŒ±œÑŒø] . Rev. omits frankly, which is implied in the verb. See on ver. 21.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Grateful love does not pay any part of the debt, according to the parable."
2. "The forgiveness was real and personal."
3. "The fact, not the ground, of forgiveness is here brought."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Strictly, comparative more, œÄŒªŒµŒπŒøŒΩ, not superlative œÄŒªŒµŒπœÉœÑŒ±, but most suits the English idiom best, even between two."
2. "Superlative forms are vanishing before the comparative in the Koine."
3. "This is the point of the parable, the attitude of the two debtors toward the lender who forgave both of them."

### John Gill:
1. "Man has run out his whole stock, which the God of nature gave him, in his original creation and primitive state; and is become a bankrupt and a beggar, is poor, wretched, and miserable."
2. "Sin being committed against an infinite being, is in some sense an infinite debt, and requires an infinite satisfaction, which a finite creature can never give."
3. "The creditor (God) frankly forgave them both: their whole debts, without regard to any merits of theirs, which they could not have, or any motives in them, or any conditions to be performed by them, but purely of his sovereign will, free grace, and rich mercy."
