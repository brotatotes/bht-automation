# Luke 7:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon and the woman in this scenario provide a vivid contrast. Simon, as the host, overlooked customary acts of hospitality by failing to provide water for foot washing. On the other hand, the woman, with tears in her eyes, used them as a bath for Jesus' feet. She then wiped them with her hair, a gesture that surpassed the ordinary customs. Her actions signify her profound gratitude and recognition of her great indebtedness to God. Although we may not copy her exact acts, her attitude of humility, gratitude, and extravagant love is worth emulating.

3. "Every one of these things it is our duty to imitate; but the pouring of the ointment was an extraordinary act, which it would be improper to consider as a rule."

1.

2. "but she hath washed my feet with tears. The Persic version reads, 'with the tears of her eyes'; which made a bath for his feet;"

- Attempt 1 BHT: This verse presents a striking contrast between the actions of Simon and the woman who entered the house. Simon, as the host, had failed to extend the customary acts of hospitality and love towards Jesus. He neglected to provide water for Jesus to wash his feet, a common courtesy in that culture. In stark contrast, the woman, with tears streaming down her face, washed Jesus' feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. She went above and beyond, showing extravagant love and gratitude towards Jesus. This woman's actions demonstrate her acknowledgment of her immense need for forgiveness and her deep gratitude for the forgiveness she had received. While not all of her actions can be taken as a direct command for us to follow, her overall attitude of humility, gratitude, and extravagant love are traits that we should seek to emulate in our own lives.
