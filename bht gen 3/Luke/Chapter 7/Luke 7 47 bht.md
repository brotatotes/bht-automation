## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "She is no longer uncleanâ€”her many sins are forgiven: for (thou seest that) she loved much: her conduct towards Me shews that love, which is a token that her sins are forgiven." 
2. "The remission of sins, not imagined by Simon, is proved by its fruit, ver. 42, which latter is evident and meets the eye, whereas the other is hidden from us."
3. "The sense of forgiveness of sin is not altogether correspondent to the sense of forgiveness of a debt. The latter must be altogether past, and a back on, to awaken, gratitude: the former, by no means so."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Her sins which are many... now proclaims in naked terms the forgiveness of her guilt."
2. "Not because, as if love were the cause of forgiveness, but 'inasmuch as,' or 'in proof of which.'"
3. "Delicately ironical intimation of no love and no forgiveness in the present case."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Grant that she has been as great a sinner as you affirm, and even grant that if she had 'continued so' it might be improper to suffer her to touch me, yet 'her conduct' shows that her sins have been forgiven."
2. "That her sins, so many and aggravated, have been forgiven - that she is no longer such a sinner as you suppose, is manifest from her conduct. She shows deep gratitude, penitence, love. Her conduct is the 'proper expression' of that love."
3. "A man's love to God will be in proportion to the obligation he 'feels' to him for forgiveness. They who feel - as Christians do - that they are the 'chief of sinners,' will feel under infinite obligation to love God and their Redeemer, and that no 'expression' of attachment to him can be 'beyond' what is due."

### John Calvin:
1. "They who perceive the display of deep piety in the woman form an erroneous judgment, if they do not conclude that God is already reconciled to her; so that the free pardon of sins comes first in order."
2. "Christ does not inquire at what price men may purchase the favor of God, but argues that God has already forgiven this wretched sinner, and that, therefore, a mortal man ought not to treat her with severity."
3. "It is not here said that the loving, or the love of men towards God, is the cause of the forgiveness of sins."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, 'have been and are forgiven.'"
2. "The clause is to be explained: 'since she loved much,' i.e., Her sins which are many are forgiven (as you may conclude according to your own judgment, that much forgiveness produces much love), since she loved much (as these manifestations indicate)."
3. "Little is forgiven, etc. One who feels little need of forgiveness is meant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Her sins had been already forgiven and remained forgiven."
2. "Illustration or proof, not reason for the forgiveness."
3. "This explanation proves that the meaning of Î¿Ï„ preceding is proof, not cause."

### John Gill:
1. "Though she had been a great sinner, yet she was now not such an one as he took her to be; she was a pardoned sinner, and not that guilty and filthy creature he imagined."
2. "Her great love was not the cause of the remission of her sins, but the full and free remission of her many sins, which had been manifested to her, was the cause of her great love."
3. "According to our Lord's sense, and even Simon's opinion of the case, forgiveness is the cause, and love the effect; and that according as the forgiveness is of more or less, love is proportionate."

### John Wesley:
1. "The fruit of her having had much forgiven."
2. "Her love is mentioned as the effect and evidence, not the cause of her pardon."
3. "She knew that much had been forgiven her, and therefore she loved much."
