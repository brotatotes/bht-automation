# Luke 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus was on His way, the centurion sent messengers to meet Him, saying, Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed and in terrible agony. Though the centurion recognized that he himself was not worthy for Jesus to enter his house, he did not let this stop him from seeking help. He acknowledged his own unworthiness, believing it to be too great of an honor for Christ to come to his house. Yet, without hesitation, Jesus went with the messengers, not allowing the centurion's sense of unworthiness to hinder His compassion and desire to bring healing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The imperfect tense is explained by what follows. He was going, was on the way, when he was met by the second messenger from the centurion."
2. "Trouble [œÉŒ∫œÖŒªŒªŒøœÖ] . Lit., worry."
3. "Worthy [ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒøœÇ] . Lit., sufficient."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Went with them. There was no delay as in the case of the Syro-Phenician woman, because there was not the same necessity either for bringing out the faith of the person who asked the favor, or for thus giving a lesson to the disciples, to remove prejudice."
2. "Friends. 'A very delicate and thoroughly natural touch - no intercessors, for these he needed no longer, but intimate friends of his family, who can in some measure take his place in greeting the highly honored Guest.'" (Van Oosterzee.)
3. "On the message itself, and the subsequent words of our Lord, see Matthew 8:8-13."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He started to go along with them." 
2. "Trouble not thyself. (ŒúŒ∑ œÉŒ∫œÖŒªŒªŒøœÖ). Present middle (direct use) imperative of œÉŒ∫œÖŒªŒªœâ, old verb originally meaning to skin, to mangle, and then in later Greek to vex, trouble, annoy."
3. "For I am not worthy that (ŒøœÖ Œ≥Œ±œÅ ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒøœÇ ŒµŒπŒº ŒπŒΩŒ±). The same word ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒøœÇ, not Œ±ŒæŒπŒøœÇ, as in Matthew 8:8, which see for discussion, from ŒπŒ∫œâ, ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒΩœâ, to fit, to reach, be adequate for."

### John Gill:
