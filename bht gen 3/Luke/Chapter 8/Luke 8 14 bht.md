# Luke 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have heard the word but allow the cares, riches, and pleasures of this life to consume them will find themselves choked, as if by diphtheria. This choking both strangles and hinders them from bringing their lives to full fruition. Just as a plant cannot bring its fruit to completion when choked by thorns, these hearers are hindered from bringing their lives to full fruition.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who have heard the word but allow the cares, riches, and pleasures of this life to consume them will find themselves choked. This metaphor suggests the idea of being strangled, as if by diphtheria, in order to emphasize the destructive nature of these worldly distractions. The consequences of this choking are twofold: the potential for growth and fruitfulness is stunted, and the promise of a flourishing life is withered away. Just as a plant cannot bring its fruit to completion when choked by thorns, these hearers are hindered from bringing their lives to full fruition.

- Attempt 3 BHT: These hearers, represented by the seed that fell among thorns or on thorny ground, have heard the word but are choked by the cares, riches, and pleasures of this life.

Their pursuit of worldly satisfaction strangles and chokes the potential fruitfulness of the word in their lives.
