# Luke 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest. Whatever was then wrapped up in parables and dark sayings will be made known to others hereafter. Nothing can remain concealed indefinitely, as everything hidden will eventually be brought to light and made known. With this understanding, it is imperative not to try to conceal anything, as nothing can be hidden for long. Strive to live in transparency, for all secrets will be revealed.
