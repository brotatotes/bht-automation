# Luke 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed, for the weighty precept of how we hear is crucial. Our manner of listening is supremely important. Some things should not be heard, while others should be treasured and put into practice. Self-deception is a common complaint, so we must be cautious. We must acquire knowledge and understanding carefully, for if what we have seems to be knowledge but is not rooted in the truth of the Gospel, even that which we seem to have will be taken away from us.
