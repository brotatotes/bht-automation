## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The incident is introduced here without any precise note of sequence... we must conclude therefore that they have it in the exact place, and that St. Luke only inserts it among the events of this series of discourses" (Luke 8:19).
2. "His account is abridged, and without marks of an eyewitness, which the others have" (Luke 8:19).
3. "St. Luke only inserts it among the events of this series of discourses, as indeed it was, but without fixing its place" (Luke 8:19).

### John Calvin:
1. "All the three Evangelists agree in stating, that while Christ was discoursing in the midst of a crowd of people, his mother and brethren came to him."
2. "The reason must have been either that they were anxious about him, or that they were desirous of instruction; for it is not without some good reason that they endeavor to approach him."
3. "The warmth of natural affection may have carried them beyond the bounds of propriety: this I do not deny, but I have no doubt that they were led by pious zeal to seek his society."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "At first the brothers of Jesus (younger sons of Joseph and Mary, I take the words to mean, there being sisters also) were not unfriendly to the work of Jesus..." 
2. "But as Jesus went on with his work and was rejected at Nazareth, there developed an evident disbelief in his claims on the part of the brothers who ridiculed him six months before the end." 
3. "Certainly the mother of Jesus could give no credence to that slander. But she herself was deeply concerned and wanted to help him if possible."

### John Gill:
1. "These brethren of his were relations according to the flesh, either by Joseph, or his mother's side: who they were, cannot be said with certainty." 
2. "It may be they were Joses and Simon; for as for James and Judas, they were among the twelve apostles." 
3. "They could not come at him for the press; the multitude of people that were about him, who were so thick, that there was no coming near him."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 12:46; Mark 3:31.
