# Luke 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed Saviour! It melts us to see Thee living upon the love of Thy ransomed people. The presence of seven demons in one person indicates special malignity, and it is not known where Magdala was, whence Mary came. It is a great wrong to this honored woman to identify her with the once profligate woman; the mistake has arisen from confounding unhappy demoniacal possession with the conscious entertainment of diabolic impurity. These women all had personal grounds of gratitude to Jesus; Christianity has done much to correct low views of woman's virtue.
