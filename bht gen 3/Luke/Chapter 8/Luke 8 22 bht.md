# Luke 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On a certain day, Jesus and his disciples embarked on a boat to cross over to the other side of the lake. This event signifies that St. Luke lacked the information that could have allowed him to accurately indicate what followed if he had access to the Gospel of St. Mark. Luke's use of the term launched forth suggests that they set sail and moved into the high sea, leaving the shore behind, a phrasing uniquely employed by Luke in his writings, particularly in the Acts of the Apostles.
