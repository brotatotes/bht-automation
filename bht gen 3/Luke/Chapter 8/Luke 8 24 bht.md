# Luke 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a raging storm, the disciples, consumed by fear, woke Jesus from his sleep, urgently crying out, Master, Master, we perish! Jesus, fully aware of the chaotic situation, rose and rebuked the wind and the violent water. Instantly, the storm ceased, replaced by a profound calm. The repetition of their desperate pleas and the vivid description of the storm reveal the disciples' anxiety and their limited comprehension of Jesus' authority over nature's forces.
