## BHT:
The legion of demons, encompassing a multitude of evil spirits, entreated Jesus not to consign them to the abyss, the bottomless place of confinement and suffering. Aware of His absolute authority over them, the demons sought to avoid being sent to hell. Instead, they desired to roam the earth or be in any other place apart from their dreadful abode. Despite their temporary refuge in the swine, Jesus forcefully commanded them to depart from the afflicted man and enter the herd.
