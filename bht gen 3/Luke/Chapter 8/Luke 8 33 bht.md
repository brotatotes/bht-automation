## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rushed down the steep (œâœÅŒºŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫œÅŒ∑ŒºŒΩŒøœÖ). Ablative with Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± as in Mark 5:13; Matthew 8:32 and the same vivid verb in each account, to hurl impetuously, to rush."
2. "Were choked (Œ±œÄŒµœÄŒΩŒπŒ≥Œ∑). Second aorist (constative) passive indicative third singular (collective singular) where Mark 5:13 has the picturesque imperfect ŒµœÄŒΩŒπŒ≥ŒøŒΩœÑŒø."
