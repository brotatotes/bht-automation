## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The crowd seems to have followed to see what would happen at Jaeirus’s house: see Luke 8:54."
3. "ἀπέθν ., was dying. In Matt. she is represented as already dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Thronged [συνεπνιγον] . With the idea of pressing together [συν] upon him : stifling. The simple verb is that rendered choke, as in vv. 8, 33.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An only daughter (θυγατηρ μονογενης). The same adjective used of the widow's son (Luke 7:12) and the epileptic boy (Luke 9:38) and of Jesus (John 1:18; John 3:16)."
2. "She lay a dying (απεθνησκεν). Imperfect active, she was dying. Matthew 9:18 has it that she has just died."
3. "Thronged (συνεπνιγον). Imperfect active of συμπνιγω, to press together, the verb used of the thorns choking the growing grain (Luke 8:14). It was a jam."

### John Gill:
1. "She lay a dying, or 'was near death', as the Syriac and Persian versions; or 'was just ready to die', as the Ethiopic version."
2. "The Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions render it, 'she was dead', or 'now dead', and which agrees with Matthew 9:18."
3. "The people thronged him; such a vast multitude followed him to see the cure, that he was even crowded, and so pressed on all sides, that it was difficult to walk along."
