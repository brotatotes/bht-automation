## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is not aware of the subsequent message to Jairus, and narrates concisely and generally."
2. "The crowd seems to have followed to see what would happen at Jairus‚Äôs house."
3. "The affectionate diminutive of Mark."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Thronged [œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÄŒΩŒπŒ≥ŒøŒΩ] . With the idea of pressing together [œÉœÖŒΩ] upon him : stifling. The simple verb is that rendered choke, as in vv. 8, 33.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An only daughter (Œ∏œÖŒ≥Œ±œÑŒ∑œÅ ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒ∑œÇ)...The same adjective used of the widow's son (Luke 7:12) and the epileptic boy (Luke 9:38) and of Jesus (John 1:18; John 3:16)." 
2. "She lay a dying (Œ±œÄŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒ∑œÉŒ∫ŒµŒΩ). Imperfect active, she was dying. Matthew 9:18 has it that she has just died." 
3. "Thronged (œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÄŒΩŒπŒ≥ŒøŒΩ). Imperfect active of œÉœÖŒºœÄŒΩŒπŒ≥œâ, to press together, the verb used of the thorns choking the growing grain (Luke 8:14). It was a jam."

### John Gill:
1. "And she lay a dying, or 'was near death', as the Syriac and Persic versions; or 'was just ready to die', as the Ethiopic version."
2. "The Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions render it, 'she was dead', or 'now dead', and which agrees with Matthew 9:18."
3. "the people thronged him; such a vast multitude followed him to see the cure, that he was even crowded, and so pressed on all sides, that it was difficult to walk along."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: A woman who had been suffering for twelve years with a hemorrhage approached Jesus in a crowd as he was on his way to heal Jairus' daughter. Unaware of the urgency of Jairus' request, Luke narrates briefly, mentioning the crowd's curiosity about what would happen at Jairus' house. The woman, described affectionately as Jairus did in Mark's account, pressed upon Jesus, stifling him with the weight of the multitude. Jairus' daughter, an only child, was near death, and the throng of people made it difficult for Jesus to walk. Though not explicitly stated in Luke's account, Matthew's Gospel tells us that the girl had already passed away.
