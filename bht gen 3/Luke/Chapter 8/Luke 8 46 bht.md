### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When reading Luke 8:46, we see that while Jesus was being thronged by a multitude, there was someone who touched Him with a conscious and dependent touch of faith. It is important to note that many may come close to Christ in various ways, but without a living contact of faith, there is no virtue drawn from Him. Jesus himself perceived the touch and felt the power already gone from Him. This understanding helps us recognize the significance of intentional, faith-driven encounters with Christ, wherein His power is accessed and experienced.
