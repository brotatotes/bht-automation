# Luke 8:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people around the maiden knew that she was dead, and thus the words of Jesus saying she is not dead but sleepeth did not give them any hope. Instead, they laughed at him in derision, not understanding the deeper meaning behind his words. Despite their mocking, Jesus knew the truth - that not even death could separate him from his power to bring the dead back to life.
