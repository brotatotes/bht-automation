# Luke 8:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The command to give her to eat after being raised from the dead indicates that she was truly restored to life with all its needs and weaknesses. The narrative leaves no doubt that this was a raising from the dead in the strictest sense. Her spirit returned, and the first command to give her meat is an indirect command, while the second command to eat is given to explain that her resurrected life required sustenance. This miracle serves as a pledge of the immortality of the soul and reveals that she was raised to an animate, mortal life.

The narrative leaves no doubt that this was a raising from the dead in the strictest sense. Her spirit returned and she was immediately able to walk.
