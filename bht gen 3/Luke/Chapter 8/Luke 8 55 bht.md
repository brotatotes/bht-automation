# Luke 8:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The command to give her to eat after being restored to life indicates that her resurrection was not a mere paroxysm but a true raising from the dead. Her spirit immediately returned, and she was given food to eat to support her animate and mortal life. This account serves as a powerful proof of the immortality of the soul, demonstrating that it exists separately from the body after death and will be reunited with it in the resurrection. The fact that she arose and walked further confirms her restored and healthy state of being.
