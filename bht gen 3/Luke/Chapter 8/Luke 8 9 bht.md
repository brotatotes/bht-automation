# Luke 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples eagerly and repeatedly asked Jesus about the meaning of the parable, perhaps sensing that there might be a reflection on their own growth. The optative form used in their question does not change the meaning but simply represents the indirect discourse. They were not asking about the identity of the parable, but rather about its sense and meaning.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The optative ÎµÎ¹Î· is merely due to indirect discourse, changing the indicative ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½ (is) of the direct question to the optative ÎµÎ¹Î· of the indirect, a change entirely with the writer or speaker and without any change of meaning."
2. "Both the tense and the use of ÎµÏ€ indicate eager and repeated questions on the part of the disciples, perhaps dimly perceiving a possible reflection on their own growth."
3. "A mistranslation, What this parable was (or meant)."

### John Gill:
1. "And his disciples asked him, saying, what might this parable be?" 
2. "what is the sense and meaning of it?" 
3. "According to Matthew, they asked why he spake in parables to the people; and to such a question the following words are a proper answer."
