## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. As he was praying. Peculiar to Luke.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As he was praying (εν τω εινα αυτον προσευχομενον). Common Lukan idiom of εν with the articular infinitive for a temporal clause."
2. "Alone (κατα μονας). In the N.T. only here and Mark 4:10. Perhaps χωρας (places) is to be supplied with μονας (lonely places)."
3. "This seems like a contradiction unless 'alone' is to be taken with συνησαν. Westcott and Hort put συνηντησαν in the margin. This would mean that as Jesus was praying alone, the disciples fell in with him."

### John Gill:
1. "The place where he now retired for private devotion, was somewhere in the coasts of Caesarea Philippi."
2. "The meaning is, that he was retired from the multitude, but not from his disciples."
3. "Whom say the people that I am? what are the sentiments of the common people, or of the people in general concerning me?"

### John Wesley:
1. Apart — From the multitude.
And he asked them — When he had done praying, during which they probably stayed at a distance. Matthew 14:13; Mark 8:27.
