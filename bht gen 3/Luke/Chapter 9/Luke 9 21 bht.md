# Luke 9:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus sternly charged his disciples to keep quiet about his true identity as the Messiah, laying a penalty upon them if they were to disobey. He specifically commanded them to tell no one about it, as its implications could lead to political unrest among the Jews. This prohibition on openly proclaiming his Messiahship was necessary, as seen in the aftermath of the feeding of the five thousand, when the people sought to make Jesus their earthly king. Jesus recognized that such a declaration by his disciples would spark a revolution, which was not the purpose of his ministry on earth.
