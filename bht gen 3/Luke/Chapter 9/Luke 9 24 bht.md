# Luke 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The essence of this teaching lies in the dual meaning of 'life' - the natural and the spiritual, the temporal and the eternal. To safeguard the higher life, one must be willing to offer a complete sacrifice of the lower life. Those who are unable to let go of one in favor of the other will ultimately forfeit both. The phrase 'will save' underscores the significance of this sacrifice. This principle is also echoed in other passages such as Matthew 16:25, Mark 8:35, and John 12:25.
