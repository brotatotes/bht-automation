# Luke 9:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are ashamed of Christ and his words may be tempted to prioritize the opinions of others rather than standing firmly in their faith. However, being ashamed of Christ carries eternal consequences, as he will disown those who disowned him before the Father and the holy angels. On the other hand, those who are unashamed of Christ, like Paul and Onesiphorus, demonstrate their unwavering commitment to him. It is crucial to remember that our allegiance to Christ should outweigh any fear or shame we may face in this world.
