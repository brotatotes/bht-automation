## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Peter, James, and John‚Äîpartners before in secular business; now sole witnesses of the resurrection of Jairus' daughter, the transfiguration, and the agony in the garden."
3. "But who can adequately translate those 'strong cryings and tears?' Methinks, as I steal by His side, I hear from Him these plaintive sounds, 'Lord, who hath believed Our report? I am come unto Mine own and Mine own receive Me not... Show Me a token for good: Father, glorify Thy name.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
