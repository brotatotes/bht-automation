# Luke 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus instructed his disciples to take [lift] staves and two coats [apiece] with them on their journey. There seems to be a contradiction when compared to the account in Mark, but this can be understood by considering the Greek words used and the specific details mentioned in each gospel. The disciples were not forbidden to have two coats among them, but rather not to have two coats apiece. This may have been to teach them dependency on God and to travel lightly.
