# Luke 9:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses and Elijah, representing the law and the prophets respectively, appeared with Jesus, testifying to the unity of the Old Testament scriptures and the Old Testament saints' witness to Christ. Their presence was not confined to the pages of a book, but manifested in the form of living men, speaking audibly. This vision was so remarkable that it was necessary to include the human names of these renowned figures, otherwise one might mistake them for angels. As the vision unfolded, Moses and Elijah were seen engaged in conversation, as if discussing the divine mission of Jesus.
