## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "The Cross to Him is the Crown to us, that that 'decease' is all our salvation and all our desire."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Decease [ÎµÎ¾Î¿Î´Î¿Î½] . The Rev. retains the word of the A. V., though it has, to modern ears, a somewhat formal sound. No word, however, could more accurately represent the original, which is compounded of ejx, out of, and oJdov, a journeying; and thus corresponds to the Latin decessus, a going away, whence the word decease." 
2. "The Greek word is familiar to us as exodus, applied principally to the migration of the Hebrews from Egypt, and thus used at Hebrews 11:22, departing."
3. "In the mouth of Christ it covers the ideas both of death and ascension."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The purpose of the Transfiguration was to strengthen the heart of Jesus as he was praying long about his approaching death."
3. "No one on earth understood the heart of Jesus and so Moses and Elijah came."

### John Gill:
1. "Death is a departure out of this world, and goes by this name, 2 Peter 1:15 and so here it signifies Christ's death, or exit, which he was to make at Jerusalem; and Moses and Elias talk with him about this; the nature, manner, use, and near approach of it; and to which they might encourage him, as man."
2. "The sufferings and death of Christ were what Moses and the prophets had foretold; and these two speak of the same things now; and which must serve to confirm what Christ a few days ago had showed his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and there suffer and die."
3. "Some render this word, 'Expedition', and think it refers to the whole affair of the redemption of Christ's people by him, from the bondage of sin, Satan, and the law, by his sufferings and death; of which the deliverance of the people of Israel out of Egypt was a lively representation."

### John Wesley:
1. In glory â€” Like Christ with whom they talked.
