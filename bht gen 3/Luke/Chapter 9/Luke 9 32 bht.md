# Luke 9:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As they climbed the mountain during the night, the disciples were overcome with drowsiness due to their simple habits, the late hour, and the physical exertion. However, it is important to note that they did not fall asleep, but rather kept awake through the whole experience. This was not a half-awake vision, but a real and tangible encounter. When they were fully alert, they witnessed the glory of Jesus, radiating an incredible splendor that awed them out of their sleep. This encounter would qualify them to become firsthand witnesses of His majesty, just as Jesus had intended.

### Marvin Vincent:
