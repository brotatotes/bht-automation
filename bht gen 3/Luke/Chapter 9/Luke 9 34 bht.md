# Luke 9:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the disciples entered into a cloud, a symbol of the divine presence, they were filled with fear. Peter, James, and John became afraid as they witnessed the voice of God and the magnificent glory surrounding Moses and Elijah. They entered the cloud, and it is worth noting the rapid formation and disappearance of clouds on the summit of Hermon, akin to the extraordinary cloud that appeared on this occasion. The disciples' fear intensified, beginning with the sight of the company, growing as they entered the cloud, and peaking with the hearing of the voice.
