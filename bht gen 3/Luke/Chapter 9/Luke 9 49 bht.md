# Luke 9:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus reminds us that someone who performs miracles in His name cannot speak evil of Him. We should not jump to conclude that someone who is not part of our group is against us, for they may still be working in His name. It's important to seek visible unity in the Church, but we must not let it hinder our recognition of the work being done by others in Jesus' name. Let us guard against narrow-mindedness and pride, even within the close circle of disciples.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: It is important to recognize that just because someone may not be directly associated with a particular group or organization, it does not mean that they are against it. In fact, Jesus Himself acknowledges that if someone is performing miracles in His name, they cannot speak evil of Him. This is a reminder that visible unity in the Church is important, but it should not be the sole determining factor of someone's allegiance to Christ. We should be cautious of falling into the trap of partisan narrowness and pride, as even one of the close disciples, the Beloved Disciple, was guilty of this. Instead, we should focus on the work being done in Jesus' name and the power of His name, rather than getting caught up in external affiliations.
