## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "It must have been to announce the coming of Jesus as the Messiah, which He did not conceal in Samaria as in JudÃ¦a and Galilee."
3. "They expected that the Messiah would have confirmed their anti-Jewish rites and Gerizim temple, instead of going up solemnly to Jerusalem."

2. "messengers before his face...to make ready for him..."
3. "all now hastening to maturity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the original the word is 'angels;' and the use of that word here shows that the word 'angel' in the Bible does not always mean heavenly beings."
2. "He had no reason to expect that he would experience any kind treatment from the Samaritans if he came suddenly among them, and if they saw that he was going to Jerusalem."
3. "He therefore made provision beforehand, and thus has shown us that it is not 'improper' to look out beforehand for the supply of our wants, and to guard against want and poverty."

### John Gill:
1. "And sent messengers before his face... who very likely were his two disciples, James and John, since they so highly resented the ill treatment their master met with from the Samaritans." 
2. "To make ready for him; to prepare a lodging, and proper food for him and his disciples, as they passed on in their journey, for his intention was not to make any stay there."
3. "The disciples had been forbid to enter... in order to preach."
