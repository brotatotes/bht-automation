# Luke 9:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, known as 'sons of thunder,' were deeply devoted to Jesus and reacted strongly when they witnessed an insult or refusal towards Him. Their impulsive desire to call down fire from heaven, like Elijah, reflected their zeal but also a lack of discernment. Jesus, however, did not grant their request, highlighting that vengeance should be left to God. This incident served as a lesson for them to carefully consider their own intemperate zeal and to align themselves with God's calling.

Ultimately, their request to call down fire was not fulfilled by Jesus, indicating that their judgment was misguided.
