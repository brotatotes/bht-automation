In situations where duty to family conflicts with the call to preach, Jesus will help clarify what is truly needed for the advancement of His kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

Preach [Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒªŒµ] . Publish abroad, as Rev. dia, throughout all regions.

### John Calvin:
1. "Had he remained in a private station, there would have been no absolute necessity for leaving his father, provided he did not forsake the Gospel on his father‚Äôs account."
2. "But the preaching of the Gospel does not allow him to remain at home, and therefore Christ properly takes him away from his father."
3. "While the amazing goodness of Christ appears in bestowing so honorable an office on a man who was still so weak, it deserves our notice, that the fault which still cleaved to him is corrected, and is not overlooked and encouraged."

2. "The harshness of this proverb to the scribe probably is due to the fact that he was manifestly using his aged father as an excuse for not giving Christ active service."
