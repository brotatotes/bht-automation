The second disciple, like the first, faced a difficulty, but the different treatment by Jesus reveals their contrasting spirits.

Yet, Jesus's strong reproval suggests that delaying to attend to worldly matters can be a form of turning away from Him. The example of Elisha bidding farewell before following Elijah is brought up to highlight the difference between the cases.

However, Jesus's reproval of the disciple indicates that, by delaying to attend to his worldly business, he was turning his back on Christ.
