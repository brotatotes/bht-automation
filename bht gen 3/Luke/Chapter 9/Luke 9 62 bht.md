# Luke 9:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as a ploughman needs to focus on the furrow being made rather than looking back, the ministry of the Gospel requires undivided service. This doesn't solely apply to ministers, but to every Christian who has work to do for God's kingdom. Divided attention and a reluctance to fully break away from the world will hinder our progress. It is crucial to sacrifice everything for the cause of God and have an unwavering commitment to Christ, as conditional following is impossible.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The saying itself is to be explained simply from agricultural operationsâ€”for he who has his hand on the plough, guiding it, must look on the furrow which his share is makingâ€”if he look behind, his work will be marred."
2. "The sense is more immediately applicable to the ministry of the Gospel of Christ, which will least of all things bear a divided service and backward looks."
3. "But of course affects also every private Christian, inasmuch as he too has a work to doâ€”ground to break, and a harvest to reap."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No man...will they come short of salvation who prosecute the work of God with a distracted attention, a divided heart." 
2. "It is not actual return to the world, but a reluctance to break with it." 
3. "Though the reference seems chiefly to ministers, the application is general."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that comes still loving the world - still looking with regret on its pleasures, its wealth, and its honors - that has not 'wholly' forsaken them as his portion, cannot be a Christian." 
2. "How searching is this test to those who profess to be Christians!"
3. "Religion is everything or nothing. He that is not willing to sacrifice 'everything' for the cause of God, is really willing to sacrifice nothing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The figure is that of a man who, while engaged in labor, instead of keeping his eye on the furrow which he is drawing, looks behind at some object which attracts his interest." 
2. "He is only half at work, and half - work only will be the result." 
3. "Lit., well-placed: adjusted."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who, after having put his hand to the plough, shall look back, is unfit for the kingdom of God." 
2. "They are said to look back, who become involved in the cares of the world, so as to allow themselves to be withdrawn from the right path."
3. "particularly, when they plunge themselves into those employments which disqualify them to follow Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such labor, with divided service and longing looks backward will be profitless and doubly toilsome."

3. "These conversations have one common lesson: conditional following of Christ is impossible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The ploughman who does not bend attentively to his work goes crooked."
2. "Looking to the things behind. To do that is fatal as any ploughman knows."
3. "The first case is that of inconsiderate impulse, the second that of conflicting duties, the third that of a divided mind."

### John Gill:
1. "The ploughman ought to look before him, on his plough, and the ground he is ploughing, or he is not fit to be a ploughman."
2. "He that enters upon the ministerial work, and looks back, and engages himself in the affairs of the world, sets his heart on them, and spends his time in them."
3. "He cannot serve God and mammon, his own interest, and the interest of Christ; he cannot rightly perform the work of the ministry, whilst his thoughts and time are taken up in the affairs of the world."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Agriculturally speaking, a ploughman must focus on the furrow being made rather than looking behind, or else the work will be ruined. Similarly, the ministry of the Gospel of Christ cannot endure divided service and backward looks. This applies not only to ministers, but to every Christian who has work to do in breaking ground and reaping a harvest. Those who are distracted or have a divided heart in pursuing the work of God will ultimately fall short of salvation. It is not a complete return to the world, but a reluctance to fully break away from it that hinders the progress. The figure of the ploughman illustrates the danger in not giving our full attention to the task at hand. While the consequences are especially profound for ministers, this lesson applies to all who profess to be Christians. The verse serves as a test to determine whether we are willing to sacrifice everything for the cause of God or whether we are still attached to the pleasures and possessions of the world. Ultimately, conditional following of Christ is impossible; it is either everything or nothing.
