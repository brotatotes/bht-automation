## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is probably a title to what follows...and not connected with ver. 4, nor with ver. 2." 
2. "It is simpler, and gives more majesty to the opening, to put a period at the end of ver. 1, and make the citation from the prophet a new and confirmatory title."
3. "Here probably it is the latter: and so will mean, the glad tidings concerning Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What strikes every one is, that though the briefest of all the Gospels, this is in some of the principal scenes of our Lord's history the fullest." 
2. "But what is not so obvious is, that wherever the finer and subtler feelings of humanity, or the deeper and more peculiar hues of our Lord's character were brought out, these, though they should be lightly passed over by all the other Evangelists, are sure to be found here, and in touches of such quiet delicacy and power."
3. "These few opening words of the Second Gospel are enough to show, that though it was the purpose of this Evangelist to record chiefly the outward and palpable facts of our Lord's public life, he recognized in Him, in common with the Fourth Evangelist, the glory of the Only-begotten of the Father."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'gospel' here has reference rather to the preaching of John, an account of which immediately follows, and means the beginning of the good news, or annunciation respecting the Messiah."
2. "It was very customary thus to prefix a title to a book."
3. "The Son of God... It does not recount the deeds of man - of a hero or a philosopher - but the doctrines and doings of the Son of God. The history, therefore, 'commands' respect."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beginning (√°Ãì√±√∑√ßÃÄ)... It is 'the beginning, not of his book, but of the facts of the Gospel." 
2. "He shows from the prophets that the Gospel was to begin by the sending forth of a forerunner."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the Law and the Prophets then came to an end... 'The Law and the Prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached.'" 
2. "The Gospel was not an inferior appendage to the Law, but a new form of instruction, by which the former was set aside." 
3. "The abrogation of the Law, and the beginning of the Gospel, strictly speaking, took place when John began to preach."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The beginning of the gospel. This is regarded by some as the title of the whole book: here begins the Gospel." 
2. "The Son of God. Matthew (Matthew 1:1), writing for the Jews, says: 'the Son of David, the Son of Abraham;' but Mark, writing for Gentile Christians, adds the title."
3. "The beginning, etc., as it is written. Others again, with Mark 1:4: The beginning of the gospel (was this), John did baptize, etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The beginning (Œ±œÅœáŒ∑). There is no article in the Greek."
2. "And then the Gospel of Jesus Christ means the Message about Jesus Christ (objective genitive)."
3. "If Mark wrote the words, there is no reason to doubt the genuineness since he uses the phrase elsewhere."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel began with the ministry of John the Baptist, and of Christ; which was a Gospel one, and was the beginning of the Gospel dispensation, in distinction from the legal one."
2. "The design of this evangelist, is not to give an account of the genealogy of Christ, of his conception and birth, of what befell him in his infancy, or of any actions and sayings of his from thence, to his appearance in Israel; but to give an account of his ministry and miracles, sufferings and death."
3. "Mark begins his account of the Gospel, and which he calls the beginning of it, with the same article of the divine sonship of Christ, as the Apostle Paul began his ministry with."

### John Wesley:
1. "The beginning of the Gospel is in the account of John the Baptist." 
2. "The Gospel itself in the rest of the book."
3. "The evangelist speaks with strict propriety."
