## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Perhaps the being with the beasts may point to one form of temptation, viz. that of terror, which was practiced on Himâ€” but of the inward trials, who may speak?" 
2. "There is nothing here to contradict the fast spoken of in Matthew and Luke, as some have maintained."
3. "No apportionment of these details to the various successive parts of the temptation is given by our Evangelist. They are simply stated to have happened, compendiously."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. With the wild beasts
Peculiar to Mark. The region just alluded to abounds in boars, jackals, wolves, foxes, leopards, hyenas, etc.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Satan, the prince of darkness, was personally engaged."
2. "Christ was probably threatened with physical danger from the wild beasts. Scarcely a figurative expression of His loneliness and helplessness."
3. "Ministered. Probably with food. The fasting, though not mentioned, is thus implied."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was the haunt at night of the wolf, the boar, the hyena, the jackal, the leopard."
2. "The angels did come and minister, kept it up till he was cheered and strengthened."
3. "But we are all tempted of the devil in the city even worse than in the desert."

### John Gill:
1. "and where only the most fierce and most savage of creatures dwelt; and yet was as secure and unhurt by them, being the Lord of them, as Adam in Eden's garden, or Daniel in the lions' den."
2. "his being not hurt by them, may declare, partly his innocence, as man, being as pure and holy as the first man was in his state of integrity, when all creatures were brought before him, to give them names."
3. "And the angels ministered unto him; after the temptations were over... serving him as their great Lord and master."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he was there forty days, tempted by Satanâ€”Invisibly."
2. "And he was with the wild beastsâ€”Though they had no power to hurt him."
3. "St. Mark not only gives us a compendium of St. Matthew's Gospel, but likewise several valuable particulars, which the other evangelists have omitted."
