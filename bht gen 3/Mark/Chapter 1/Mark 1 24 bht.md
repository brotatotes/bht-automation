2. "Jesus, Nazarene!" an epithet originally given to express contempt. 
3. "Conscious, too, that their power was but permitted and temporary, and perceiving in Him, perhaps, the woman's Seed that was to bruise the head and destroy the works of the devil, they regard His approach to them on this occasion as a signal to let go their grasp of this miserable victim."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Us
The Holy One of God


### Philip Schaff:
1. "What have we in common; comp. Matthew 8:29."
2. "The destruction referred to includes banishment to torment (comp. Matthew 8:29), and also the destruction of the empire of Satan in the world, signified and begun in such expulsions as these."
3. "An acknowledgment of His Messiahship, but not necessarily of His Divinity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "'What have we to do with thee?'" - They had nothing to do with Christ, as a Savior; they had no interest in him, nor in his redemption, but he had something to do with them, to show his power over them, and to deliver men out of their hands.
2. "'Art thou come to destroy us?'" - Not to annihilate them, but either to turn them out of the bodies of men, which to them was a sort of destruction of them, or to shut them up in the prison of hell, and inflict that full punishment on them, which is in reserve for them.
3. "'I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.'" - The devil knew from his wonderful incarnation, by the voice from heaven at his baptism, from the conquest over him in the wilderness, and by the miracles he had already wrought, that Jesus is the Holy One of God.
