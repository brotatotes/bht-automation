# Mark 1:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mention of four specific witnesses in this passageâ€”the first of many instances where Peter's hand is believed to be involvedâ€”highlights the trio of Peter, James, and John as a threefold cord of testimony. It is worth noting that Andrew, present in his own house, was married prior to following Jesus. Each Gospel adds its own unique details to the narrative, and this tender scene sets the stage for Christ's private and familiar illustration of his grace to his disciples. This miracle is a powerful display of Christ's healing power, in which he chooses to touch the woman's hand, either out of affection or because he understands its significance.
