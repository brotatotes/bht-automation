## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He cast out the spirits with His word; or rather, 'with a word' - a word of command."
2. "Evidently they would have spoken, if permitted, proclaiming His Messiahship in such terms as in the synagogue; but once in one day, and that testimony immediately silenced, was enough."
3. "That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying (Matthew 8:17- :), Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In biblical Greek the process is the reverse, this doctrine being rejected for that of an overruling personal providence, and the strange gods, 'obscure to human knowledge and alien to human life,' taking the abstract term uniformly in an evil sense."
2. "While in Hesiod the demons are all good, according to Empedocles they are both bad and good. This conception relieved the gods of the responsibility for proceedings unbecoming the divine nature."
3. "Demons are synonymous with unclean spirits... They are special powers of evil, influencing and disturbing the physical, mental, and moral being."

### John Calvin:
1. "He did not permit the devils to speak...because the time of the full revelation was not yet come." 
2. "He refused to have, as heralds and witnesses of his divinity, those whose praise could have no other effect than to soil and injure his character." 
3. "The prince of death, and his agents, are in a state of irreconcileable enmity with the Author of eternal salvation and life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This does not imply that some were not healed, either because there was not time, or because they lacked faith; both Matthew (Matthew 8:16) and Luke (Luke 4:40) say that all were healed."
2. "Our Lord could be Himself the witness to His claims (comp. John 8:14-18); practically no man ever believes in Christ without first believing Christ Himself independently of other witnesses."
3. "But Satan and Satanâ€™s emissaries can speak the truth when it will serve an evil end."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Demons it should be translated always."
2. "The reason given is 'because they knew him.'"
3. "Testimony from such a source was not calculated to help the cause of Christ with the people."

### John Gill:
1. "And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases...he healed all that came, or were brought to him, which were many, of every sort of disease, which were divers, with which they were afflicted."
2. "He suffered not the devils to speak...which shows his great power over them."
3. "He would not suffer them to say a word about him, because he knew that they knew that he was the Christ, the Son of God."

### John Wesley:
1. He suffered not the devils to say that they knew him â€” That is, according to Dr. Mead's hypothesis, (that the Scriptural demoniacs were only diseased persons,) He suffered not the diseases to say that they knew him!
