# Mark 1:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a firm and powerful manner, Jesus strictly charged the healed leper to keep it a secret, urging him not to share his story before he could be officially pronounced clean by the priests. The reason behind this command was Jesus' desire to prevent any premature hostility from his enemies and to avoid potential denial or skepticism about the man's former leprosy or his miraculous cleansing. By refraining from sharing the healing, unnecessary opposition could be avoided, preserving room for Jesus to continue his ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strictly charged (√•Ãì√¨√¢√±√©√¨√ß√≥√°ÃÅ√¨√•√≠√Ø√≤)... The Lord evidently spoke to him peremptorily."
2. "The reason for this charge and dismissal lay in the desire of Jesus not to thwart his ministry by awaking the premature violence of his enemies."
3. "If they should see the leper and hear his story before he had been officially pronounced clean by the priest, they might deny either that he had been a leper or had been truly cleansed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Solemnly charged him. This implies strong emotion. Our Lord perceived the man‚Äôs disobedient spirit."
2. "Straightway sent him away. Not out of the house, for there is no evidence that the miracle was performed in a house."
3. "Away from Himself, for despite our Lord‚Äôs compassion, feelings of grief seem to have been awakened by the man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a strong word for the snorting of a horse and expresses powerful emotion as Jesus stood here face to face with leprosy, itself a symbol of sin and all its train of evils."
2. "The command to report to the priests was in accord with the Mosaic regulations."
3. "The prohibition against talking about it was to allay excitement and to avoid needless opposition to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Either with the sin which had been the cause of this leprosy, and to take care that he sinned that sin no more, lest a worse evil should befall him."
2. "These seven things are, in another place, said to be an evil tongue, shedding of blood, a vain oath, uncleanness, a proud spirit, theft, and envy."
3. "Or rather the charge was to tell no man of his cure, before he came to the priest: nor to him, or any other, how he came by it, and by whom he was healed."
