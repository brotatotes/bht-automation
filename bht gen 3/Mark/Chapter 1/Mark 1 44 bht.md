# Mark 1:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not trouble thyself with talking to others, but go and get thyself formally declared pure, for without the formal testimony of the priests, the people would not accept the leper as clean. This charge served as a testimony of ingratitude for those who rejected it, while the leper was commanded to maintain silence. Yet, if we have been cleansed from the leprosy of sin, it is our duty to publish it abroad for the honor of our Benefactor and the encouragement of others.
