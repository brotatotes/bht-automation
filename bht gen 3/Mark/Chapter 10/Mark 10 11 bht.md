# Mark 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A marriage that has been consummated cannot be annulled by a formal divorce; it is only through the breaking of the bond that the marriage is truly annulled. Although Mark does not explicitly mention the exception for fornication, it is implied in what Mark records. Divorcing a wife and marrying another without just cause is an act of adultery against the wife, injuring the very person who is lawfully married. However, the one justifiable ground for divorce, fornication, is understood as a matter of course.
