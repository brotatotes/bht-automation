# Mark 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly come to Jesus, we must cast away the things that differentiate us from children and become like them. Infant baptism not only justifies, but sets the normal pattern for all baptisms. Jesus felt deep emotion, even indignation, when children were hindered from coming to Him. It should be a joy for parents to bring their children to Jesus, and they will be held accountable for keeping them away. The kingdom of God consists of those who possess the innocence and humility of children and strive to cultivate a childlike temperament.
