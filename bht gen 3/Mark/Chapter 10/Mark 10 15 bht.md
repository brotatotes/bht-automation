# Mark 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus presents the little child with simple and loving obedience as the model for adults in coming into the kingdom. Only as a little child can anyone enter. It is a promise that His grace will not fail. Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall not enter but attain no true spiritual knowledge of the Gospel. We must lay aside pride and prejudice, attending with humility and meekness, disclaiming all worthiness and fitness as a week old.
