This is said not to deny Jesus' goodness or be angry with the young ruler for calling Him good, but to lead him to a true knowledge of Jesus' goodness and deity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Why callest thou, etc."
2. "The renderings of the A. V. and Rev. here are correct."
3. "There is no change of reading as in Matthew, where the text was altered to conform it to Mark and Luke."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Why callest thou me good? Matthew (the correct reading): â€˜Why askest thou me of that which is good?â€™" 
2. "Either â€˜there is none good, but God: Christ is good; therefore Christ is Godâ€™ or, â€˜there is none good, but God: Christ is not God: therefore Christ is NOT GOODâ€™"
3. "Since but one is good, God, then giving up all for Him is the last test, and following Christ (Mark 10:21) is doing that."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The young ruler was probably sincere and not using mere fulsome compliment, but Jesus challenges him to define his attitude towards him as was proper."
2. "Did he mean 'good' in the absolute sense as applied to God? The language is not a disclaiming of deity on the part of Jesus."
3. "Matthew 19:16 has 'that I may 'get'."

### John Gill:
1. "Why callest thou me good? This is said, not as denying that he was good, or as being angry with him for calling him so, but in order to lead this young man to a true knowledge of him, and his goodness, and even of his proper deity."
2. "There is none good, but one, [that is], God; some render it, 'but one God', as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions; and so the words are a proof of the unity of the divine being."
3. "This Christ said not as his sense, that the way to eternal life lies in keeping the commandments of the law; but he speaks in the language of the Pharisees, and of this man; and his view is, to bring him to a sense of the impossibility of obtaining eternal life by these things."
