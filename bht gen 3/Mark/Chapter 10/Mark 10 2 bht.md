# Mark 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, once again, approached Jesus in Galilee, not with good intentions, but to test and tempt him. Their motives were evil, for they sought to expose any inconsistency in Jesus' teachings. Perhaps they hoped that Jesus would be stricter than what Moses taught, or maybe they wanted to see if he would differ from Herod's law on divorce. Nonetheless, their purpose was not to seek instruction but to ensnare him. This dangerous topic of divorce, which was also discussed in Matthew's account, had the potential to disturb the territory of Herod, the husband of Herodias.
