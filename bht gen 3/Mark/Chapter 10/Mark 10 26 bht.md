# Mark 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, well aware that having riches and trusting in them go hand in hand, are filled with dread at Jesus' solemn statement. Their astonishment and dismay are understandable, as they see the almost inevitable connection between wealth and misplaced trust. The impossibility of a rich person entering the kingdom of God amplifies their disbelief, prompting them to wonder who, then, can be saved. The disciples' amazement increases greatly when Jesus uses a comparison that implies the severe difficulty for a rich person to enter God's kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This reiterated expression of dismay, after the explanation in ver. 24, need not surprise us."
2. "The disciples were quite as well aware as we must be, if we deal truly with ourselves, that they that have riches and they that trust riches are too nearly commensurate."
3. "for the mind to be relieved of much of its dread at the solemn saying which preceded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Astonished out of measure. Driven out of their wonted state of mind, dismayed."
2. "Evidently they felt that having riches almost inevitably led to â€˜trusting in riches.â€™"
3. "Because the impossibility was thus extended, the question, Then who can be saved? was so natural."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Then who (ÎºÎ± Ï„Î¹Ï‚). Matthew 19:25 has Î¤Î¹Ï‚ Î¿Ï…Î½. Evidently ÎºÎ± has here an inferential sense like Î¿Ï…Î½. 


### John Gill:
1. "They were still more amazed, their surprise increased exceedingly upon our Lord's using the above comparison; which, in their apprehension, showed, that it was utterly impossible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." 
2. "Who then can be saved? in the Messiah's kingdom, if rich men are not?" 
3. "The Persic version renders it, 'how can this man be saved?' as if the words had a particular respect to the young man, that had great possessions, and was gone away sorrowful."
