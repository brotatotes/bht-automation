# Mark 10:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who have sacrificed familial ties and material possessions for the sake of preaching the Gospel and following Christ will receive immeasurable rewards and blessings.

Mark emphasizes this point, perhaps due to his own personal experiences and desire to caution others against making the same mistakes he did. The commitment to Christ and the proclamation of His Gospel should be paramount, even if it means leaving behind what is most dear to us.
