## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "spit upon him, Mark and Luke:â€”crucify him, Matthew only, which is remarkable, as being the first intimation, in plain terms, of the death He should die."
2. "The taking up the cross, so often alluded to, might have had now for them a deep meaning."
3. "The they in ver. 34 means the Gentiles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken."
2. "The meaning of the words they could be at no loss to understand, but their import in relation to His Messianic kingdom they could not penetrate..."
3. "That they should have clung so tenaciously to the popular notion of an 'unsuffering' Messiah, may surprise us; but it gives inexpressible weight to their after-testimony to a suffering and dying Saviour."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Spit upon him. See chap. Mark 15:19. Omitted by Matthew."
2. "Kill him. Matthew: â€˜crucify Him,â€™ which is implied here, as the â€˜Gentiles,â€™ to whom the whole verse refers, were to put Him to death."
3. "After three days. This form is given by Mark in all three predictions (chaps. Mark 8:31; Mark 9:31, and here)."

### John Gill:
1. "And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him... and shall spit upon him." 
2. "This clause is placed by the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, between the two former; though, according to the order in which these things were executed, he was first scourged, then mocked, and then spit upon: all which express both the cruel and indecent usage he was to meet with."
3. "and shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again."
