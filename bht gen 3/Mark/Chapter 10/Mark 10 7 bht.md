## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our makes Adam's saying His own: in Matthew it is attributed to 'him that made (them) from the beginning.' The parallel is most instructive."
2. "We may notice, that St. Mark omits St. Matthewâ€™s 'for every cause' in ver. 2,â€”and his 'except for fornication' in ver. 11; as also does St. Luke (xvi. 18). The one omission seems to involve the other."
3. "As a general rule, St. Mark, so accurate in circumstantial details, is less exact than St. Matthew in preserving the order and connexion of the discourses."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Shall cleave. See on Matthew 19:5. Tynd., bide by.


### John Gill:
1. "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother..."
2. "...and cleave to his wife..."
3. "...in Genesis 2:24, from whence this passage is cited; or in any copy of the evangelist."

### John Wesley:
1.  Genesis 2:2411,12. All polygamy is here totally condemned.
