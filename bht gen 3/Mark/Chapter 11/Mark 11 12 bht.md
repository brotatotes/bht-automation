# Mark 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How Jesus spent the previous night remains uncertain, but what is clear is that He was genuinely hungry when He sought fruit on the fig tree, not merely using the scene as a teaching tool. This event occurred early on the following morning, Monday, after the Triumphal Entry that took place on Sunday. The desire of the religious leaders to seize Jesus and their increased fear of the people may have been influenced by this incident, but ultimately their conscience made them cowards.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How was that? Had he stolen forth from that dear roof at Bethany to the 'mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God?' (Luke 6:12); or, 'in the morning,' as on a former occasion, 'risen up a great while before day, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed' (Mark 1:35); not breaking His fast thereafter, but bending His steps straight for the city, that He might 'work the works of Him that sent Him while it was day?' (John 9:4)." 
2. "We know not, though one lingers upon and loves to trace out the every movement of that life of wonders."
3. "One thing, however we are sure of‚Äîit was real bodily hunger which He now sought to allay by the fruit of this fig tree, 'if haply He might find any thing thereon'; not a mere scene for the purpose of teaching a lesson, as some early heretics maintained, and some still seem virtually to hold."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark shows that it was a continued effort (literally ‚Äòthey were seeking‚Äô); while Luke tells that they would have done so on the spot, had they not been afraid of the people."
2. "Their desire to seize Him was increased by this parable, but their fear of the people was also increased, since they (i.e., the rulers) perceived that he spake the parable against them, and in the presence of the people (Luke 20:9), so that they felt themselves convicted before the people."
3. "Conscience made them cowards."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "On the morrow (œÑŒ∑ ŒµœÄŒ±œÖœÅŒπŒøŒΩ). Matthew 21:18 has 'early' (œÄœÅœâ), often of the fourth watch before six A.M. This was Monday morning."
2. "The Triumphal Entry had taken place on our Sunday, the first day of the week."

### John Gill:
1. "The next day early in the morning..."
2. "When he came out of Bethany..."
3. "He was hungry."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 21:18.
