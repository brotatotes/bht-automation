# Mark 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus approached a fig tree that had leaves but no fruit, even though it was not yet the season for figs. This was unusual, as the leaves on a fig tree typically appear after the fruit. Perhaps the tree was prematurely and unnaturally developed, giving the appearance of promise without performance. Jesus, hungry from the previous day's events, hoped to find fruit on the tree, but it was barren. This event serves as a parable, symbolizing the pretentious hypocrisy of the Jewish hierarchy, and a reproof of the unfruitfulness of the Jewish Church.
