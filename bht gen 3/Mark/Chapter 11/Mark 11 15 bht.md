### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Such words as these might naturally find their place in the mongrel Greek of the slaves and freedmen who formed the first congregations of the church in Rome" (Ezra Abbott, Art. "Gospels," in Encyclopedia Britannica).


### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 11:15. And they come to Jerusalem. Still another mark of accuracy. On the cleansing of the temple, see on Matthew 21:12 (John 3:13-17, refers to a distinct occurrence).
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "and Jesus went into the temple... and began to cast out them that bought and sold in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves." 
2. "They 'that bought and sold in the temple', were those that bought and sold lambs for the passover, which was now at hand; and the sheep and oxen for the 'Chagiga', or feast the day following; as well as doves for new mothers, and such as had fluxes."
3. "and by 'the money changers', whose 'tables' are said to be 'overthrown', are meant, such as sat at tables to receive the half shekel, who changed those that brought whole shekels, or foreign money: and who had so much for changing, which was called 'Kolbon'; from whence they had the name of 'Collybistae', in the text: and 'doves', as before observed, were the offering of the poorer sort of women after birth, at the time of their purification, and of profluvious persons; of which many came from all parts, at the time of the passover."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 21:12; Luke 19:45.
