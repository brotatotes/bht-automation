# Mark 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders question Jesus about his actions, including his teachings and the cleansing of the temple. This question is seen as legitimate and requires an answer from Jesus himself. His authority to perform these acts is highlighted, demonstrating that the only justification for such actions is the authority given to him. This challenges the leaders more definitively. Jesus not only enters the temple as if he is its Lord, but also performs miracles and takes on the role of instructing the people.
