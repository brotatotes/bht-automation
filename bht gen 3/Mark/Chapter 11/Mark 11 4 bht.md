2. "Wordsw. interprets it, â€˜the back way, w hich led round the house.â€™"
3. "Dean Trench, on the A.V. p. 116, would render it 'a way round,' 'a crooked lane.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In a place where two ways met [ÎµÏ€Î¹ Ï„Î¿Ï… Î±Î¼Ï†Î¿Î´Î¿Ï…] . Amfodon is literally any road which leads round [Î±Î¼Ï†Î¹] a place or a block of buildings." (Commentary)
2. "The word occurs only here in the New Testament. Rev., in the open street, which in an Eastern town is usually crooked." (Commentary)
3. "It is a topographical note," says Dr. Morison, "that could only be given by an eye - witness." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark is more detailed here: perhaps Peter was one of those sent (comp. Luke 22:8), where Peter and John are the two sent into the city."
2. "At the door without. Probably the door of the ownerâ€™s house."
3. "In the open street, or, â€˜lane.â€™ The E. V. following the Latin Vulgate, paraphrases: â€˜in a place where two ways meet.â€™ The phrase refers first to a way round, i.e., round a block of houses, then to the street of a town (usually winding in the East)."

1. "The better class of houses were built about an open court, from which a passage way under the house led to the street outside. It was at this outside opening to the street that the colt was tied."
2. "The word Î±Î¼Ï†Î¿Î´Î¿Ï‚ (from Î±Î¼Ï†Ï‰, both, and Î¿Î´Î¿Ï‚, road) is difficult. It apparently means road around a thing, a crooked street as most of them were."
3. "And they loose him (ÎºÎ± Î»Ï…Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î½ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î½). Dramatic present tense. Perhaps Peter was one of those sent this time as he was later (Luke 22:8). If so, that explains Mark's vivid details here."
