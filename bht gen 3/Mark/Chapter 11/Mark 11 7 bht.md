# Mark 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus entered Jerusalem, his friends brought a colt to him, just as he had predicted. The owners willingly released the colt, allowing Jesus to sit upon it. It is worth noting that other accounts specify that Jesus sat upon the colt. Interestingly, instead of a saddle, his followers placed their garments on the colt. It is remarkable that Jesus was able to ride the colt without any difficulty, even though it had never been ridden before. And so, he continued on his way to Jerusalem.
