# Mark 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their plan was to entrap Him into some expression construed as disaffection to the Roman government, knowing the Pharisees were discontented with the Roman yoke. They wanted to catch Him in talk and sent a combination of Pharisees and Herodians to achieve this. They thought they should unavoidably catch Him, just as prey is taken in a net. If He declared against giving tribute to Caesar, the Herodians would accuse Him, and the Pharisees would be witnesses against Him; if He supported it, the Pharisees would expose Him as an enemy to civil liberties.
