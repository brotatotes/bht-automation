### John Gill:
1. "The command is, 'for the eldest' to marry his brother's wife: if he will not, they go to all the brethren; if they will not, they return to the eldest, and say, the command is upon thee, either pluck off the shoe, or marry."
2. "if the eldest will not marry her, they go round to all the brethren; and if they will not, they return to the eldest, and say, upon thee is the command, either pluck off the shoe, or marry; and they do not compel him to marry, but they compel him to pluck off the shoe."
3. "And died, neither left he any, seed, and the third likewise; married her, and died without issue, as the second did."
