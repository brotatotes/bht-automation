# Mark 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Sadducees posed their question about marriage in the resurrection, they were not asking specifically about whose wife she would be of the seven, but rather about when the wife and the seven brothers would rise. The woman in question was considered the lawful wife of each brother according to the law, so why would one brother have a special claim to her above the others? Jesus' response corrects their misconception by affirming that in the resurrection, there is no marriage, but those who are raised are like angels in heaven.

### Henry Alford:
1.  23.] when they shall rise does not here mean, â€˜when men (the dead) shall rise,â€™ but when they (the wife and seven brothers) shall rise: see on ver. 25.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 23. In the resurrection therefore
	when they shall rise, &amp;c.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  To wife (Î³Ï…Î½Î±Î¹ÎºÎ±). Predicate accusative in apposition with "her" (Î±Ï…Ï„Î·Î½). So Luke, but Matthew merely has "had her" (ÎµÏƒÏ‡Î¿Î½ Î±Ï…Ï„Î·Î½), constative aorist indicative active. 


### John Gill:
1. "In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise...in the resurrection of the dead I will raise thee."
2. "The question put on supposition of a resurrection...whose wife shall she be of them? of the seven brethren."
3. "She was, according to the law, the lawful wife of all seven; what particular and special claim could one have to her above the rest?"
