# Mark 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the future resurrection, marriage will cease to exist because it is meant to perpetuate the human family, but with no death in the future state, this ordinance will no longer be relevant. Although the equality taught here is limited to the immortality of human nature, the Pharisees and Sadducees were mistaken in their understanding of the resurrection body and future life without marriage. Humans will become like angels, rising to an undecaying existence and sharing in the immortality of their heavenly Father.
