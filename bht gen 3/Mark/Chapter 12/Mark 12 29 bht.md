### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Lord here gives His explicit sanction to the distinction between commandments of a more fundamental and primary character, and commandments of a more dependent and subordinate nature."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews seek for mysteries in these letters, and think the unusual size of them, points at some very great things: they observe, that the first of these letters is numerically 'seventy', and directs to the seventy names of the law, and the seventy ways in which it may be interpreted, and the seventy nations of the world, from whom the Israelites are distinguished, by their belief of the one God and that the latter stands for the number 'four', and shows that the Lord is the one God, in heaven and in earth, in all the world, and in the four parts of it."
2. "And now, though there is no solid foundation for such interpretations, yet this shows what an opinion they had of the greatness of this command."
3. "To believe this, is the first and chief commandment in the law, and is the principal article of the Christian faith; namely, to believe that there is one God, and that there are three persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, in the Godhead."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Lord our God is one Lord â€” This is the foundation of the first commandment, yea, of all the commandments."
2. "The Lord our God, the Lord, the God of all men, is one God, essentially, though three persons."
3. "From this unity of God it follows, that we owe all our love to him alone."
