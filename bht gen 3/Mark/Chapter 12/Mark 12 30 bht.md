# Mark 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly love God is not limited to a simple affection, but rather encompasses a deep and encompassing devotion that extends to every part of our being. This love is the most tender, unselfish, and divine of all affections we can have. The command to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength demands a sincere, fervent, intelligent, and energetic love. Despite the fallen nature of mankind, this command remains in effect, as true love for God is produced through His abundant mercy and is expressed through the entirety of our being.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "LOVE is an all-inclusive affection, embracing not only every other affection proper to its object, but all that is proper to be done to its object; for as love spontaneously seeks to please its object, so, in the case of men to God, it is the native well spring of a voluntary obedience."
2. "One can love only a Person. It is the tenderest, the most unselfish, the most divine of all affections."
3. "The command of the Law is, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy powersâ€”with a sincere, a fervid, an intelligent, an energetic love.' But this is not all that the Law demands. God will have all these qualities in their most perfect exercise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The heart, not only as the seat of the affections, but as the center of our complex being - physical, moral, spiritual, and intellectual." 
2. "The word [soul] is often used in the New Testament in its original meaning of life. Hence, as an emphatic designation of the man himself."
3. "Mind: The faculty of thought : understanding, especially the moral understanding."

### John Gill:
1. "The fall of man, the corruption of nature, and the impotency, and even aversion in man to observe this command, do not make it null and void."
2. "Love is produced in such persons, to God the Father, who has begotten them again, according to his abundant mercy; and to Christ, who has saved them from their sins; and to the blessed Spirit, who has quickened and comforted them."
3. "Love is in some measure exercised as it should be, and as here directed to, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; that is, with all the powers and faculties of the soul."

### John Wesley:
1. With all thy strength â€” That is, the whole strength and capacity of thy understanding, will, and affections.
