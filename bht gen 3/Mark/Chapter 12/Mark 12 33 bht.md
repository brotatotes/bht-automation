# Mark 12:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Genuine worship extends beyond external observances, as the scribe wisely acknowledged that loving God with all one's heart and loving one's neighbor holds greater worth than offerings and sacrifices. It involves a union of the mind with God, blending understanding and heartfelt devotion. The prophets similarly teach that sacrifices alone are insufficient, but when coupled with brotherly kindness, they become pleasing to God. Therefore, authentic worship encompasses a sincere love and compassion for others, which God considers highly significant.
