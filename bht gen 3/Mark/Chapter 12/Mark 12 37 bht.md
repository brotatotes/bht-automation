# Mark 12:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The common people, the great multitude, heard Him gladly - they were drawn closer to Him than before, even as the Sanhedrin tried to destroy His influence. They listened to Him with relish and pleasure, recognizing that His teachings were superior to any other. And no one dared to question or challenge Him any longer. The Messiah, while human as the son of David, is also divine and the Lord of a spiritual kingdom. Thus, He surpasses David in both his inferiority and superiority.
