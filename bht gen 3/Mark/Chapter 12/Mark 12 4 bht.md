# Mark 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant, sent to collect the fruit, faced hostility as stones were cast at him, resulting in injuries to his head. While the purpose of this violence was not to kill, it was a reflection of the contemptuous rejection faced by the servant. Each stone thrown playfully mocked the servant, insinuating that there was indeed fruit for him to gather. Ultimately, the servant was shamefully sent away, subjected to great ignominy and reproach.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "And at him they cast stones, and wounded [him] in the head...though it seems, that this servant, or this set of men, were not stoned to death, because he was afterwards said to be sent away." 
2. "This servant was sent to reckon with these husbandmen, and take an account from them of the fruit of the vineyard, one cast a stone at him, saying, there is fruit for you; and a second cast another stone, saying the same thing; and so they went on one after another, till at last they said, in a deriding way, now the sum is made up with you."
3. "Sent [him] away shamefully handled; with great ignominy and reproach."
