### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In the verse, it is mentioned that a certain poor widow contributed two mites, which make a farthing. These mites were small coins made of copper, and the Greek name for them, lepton, suggests their diminutive size. They were of very little value, about two-fifths of a cent. The widow's giving of these coins was especially significant, as one in contrast with the many rich contributors, and also with a suggestion of her loneliness. Although the precise value of these coins cannot be easily estimated now, it is clear that her contribution was truly sacrificial in nature.
