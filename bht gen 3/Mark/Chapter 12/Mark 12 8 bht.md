# Mark 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
They killed him and cast him forth, or as Matthew and Luke state it, cast forth and killed him. Others suggest that he was taken, killed, and cast out of the vineyard, delivered to the Gentiles, who were without the vineyard, and at their instigation, he was put to death, even to the death of the cross.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
