# Mark 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the abomination of desolation is found where it should not be, it is a clear warning to those who can understand. The Roman ensigns symbolized this abomination to the Jews, and Christians wisely fled to Pella to avoid the impending calamities. Mark personifies the abomination, while Luke connects it to the armies of Rome. In this second fulfillment of Daniel's words, Rome replaces Syria. Those in Judea and Jerusalem should flee to the mountains for safety, as did the believers during this time of destruction.
