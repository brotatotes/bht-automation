# Mark 13:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pray that your flight will not coincide with the winter, when the days are short, roads are bad, and the weather is inclement, making it difficult and uncomfortable to find shelter in the mountains. Moreover, be aware not to be caught in the midst of your escape on the Sabbath day, as the fear of violating its sacred rest might deceive you into staying when you should be fleeing for your life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  18.] St. Matthew adds, ‚Äúnor on the sabbath day.‚Äù St. Mark wrote mostly for Gentile readers, and thus perhaps was not likely to report this.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter‚Äîmaking escape perilous, or tempting you to delay your flight."
2. "Neither on the sabbath day," when, from fear of a breach of its sacred rest, they might be induced to remain.

### John Gill:
1. "And pray ye that your flight be not in winter. When days are short, roads bad, the weather inclement; and when to lodge in mountains, is very incommodious, and uncomfortable." 
2. "The Persic version adds, 'neither on the sabbath day'."
