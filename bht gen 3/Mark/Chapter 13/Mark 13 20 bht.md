# Mark 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The distinctive style of St. Mark imparts a solemn tone to the words of our Lord. These idiomatic expressions enhance the significance of His message. The shortening mentioned signifies a merciful intervention in order to prevent the utter destruction of the nation. It is an act of divine sovereignty, aiming to preserve a remnant of the elect. Till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in does not imply the universal conversion of the world, but rather speaks of the Gentiles' allotted time in the Church. This foreshadows the future liberation of Jerusalem from Gentile domination.

3. "'Till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in'â€”or, in our Lord's phraseology, 'till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled'â€”does not mean 'till the general conversion of the world to Christ,' but 'till the Gentiles have had their full time of that place in the Church which the Jews had before them.'"
