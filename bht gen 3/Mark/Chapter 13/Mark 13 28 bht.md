# Mark 13:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus said, Now from the fig tree learn the parable, he was using the example of the fig tree to teach an important lesson. In the same way that you can discern the nearness of a season from the coming forth of leaves on a fig tree, you should be all the more alert and discerning when you see the sure and awful signs that indicate the approach of the end. Just as the fig tree's branch is yet tender and puts forth leaves, so do these signs indicate the nearness of the end. So pay attention to these signs, for they are significant.
