# Mark 13:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass until all these things be done or fulfilled. Whether we take this to mean that the whole would be fulfilled within the limits of the generation then current, or that the generation then existing would not pass away without seeing a begun fulfillment of this prediction, the facts entirely correspond. For either the whole was fulfilled in the destruction accomplished by Titus, or, if we stretch it out, till the thorough dispersion of the Jews a little later, every requirement of our Lord's words seems to be met.
