Their understanding of these events, however, was confused and lacked clarity. Jesus, in His own unique manner, responds to their questions by providing prophecies about the destruction of Jerusalem. Mark's inclusion of these prophecies is thought to be a means of warning and preparing the readers for the impending catastrophe.

Jesus addresses both topics in His response, although they may not occur simultaneously.
