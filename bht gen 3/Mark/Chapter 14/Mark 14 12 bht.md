# Mark 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day before the Passover lamb was slain, the disciples made the necessary preparations. This was the customary practice, as the lamb was to be killed on the fifteenth day. It is interesting to note the absence of the two disciples' names, which could be due to Peter's oversight of this Gospel. We should approach this account with caution and refrain from indulging in fanciful interpretations, focusing instead on the customary practices associated with the Passover.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "when they killed the passover, like St. Lukeâ€™s expression 'when the passover must be killed,' denotes the ordinary day, when they (i.e. the Jews) sacrificed the Passover."
2. "We may notice that if this Gospel, as traditionally reported, was drawn up under the superintendence of Peter, we could hardly have failed to have the names of the two disciples given."
3. "It becomes a duty to warn students of the sacred word against fanciful interpretations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The paschal lamb (note Ï€Î±ÏƒÏ‡Î±) was slain at 6 P.M., beginning of the fifteenth of the month (Exodus 12:6), but the preparations were made beforehand on the fourteenth (Thursday)." 
2. "Imperfect indicative, customary practice." 
3. "See on Matthew 26:17 for discussion of 'eat the passover.'"

### John Gill:
1. "An Israelite kills (the passover), and a priest receives (the blood), and gives it to his neighbour, and his neighbour to his neighbour, and he receives (the basin) full, and returns it empty; the priest that is near to the altar sprinkles it, at one sprinkling, over against the bottom of it."
2. "The whole nation does the work of a priest; every one particularly bringing the sacrifices for himself, and then slaying them with his own hands."
3. "For it was now Thursday morning, and the passover was to be slain after the middle of the day, between the two evenings, and eaten in Jerusalem at night."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When the Passover lamb was killed, which was the customary practice on the fourteenth day, the disciples prepared for the Passover meal. This happened on the day before the lamb was actually eaten, as the lamb was supposed to be slain on the fifteenth day. It is worth noting that the Gospel does not specify the names of the two disciples who handled the preparations, an omission which could be attributed to the fact that this Gospel was likely overseen by Peter. It is important to approach this passage with care, being cautious of fanciful interpretations and focusing on the customary practices surrounding the Passover.
