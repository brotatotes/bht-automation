# Mark 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words he that eateth with me give pathos, enhancing the upcoming betrayal. These words don't point out a specific person, but they add emotion to what comes next. It's a pity those verbs aren't translated properly. Leonardo da Vinci depicted Jesus and his apostles sitting in the Last Supper, but traditionally, during the Passover, they would lie along. It's worth noting that the Arabs honor hospitality and don't mistreat those who share a meal with them. The last clause indicates that Judas was reclining near Jesus.
