## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In consequence of the vast influx of strangers, embracing all the male population of the land who had reached a certain age, there were within the walls of Jerusalem at this festival some two million people; and in their excited state, the danger of tumult and bloodshed among 'the people,' who for the most part took Jesus for a prophet, was extreme." 
2. "What plan, if any, these ecclesiastics fixed upon for seizing our Lord, does not appear. But the proposal of Judas being at once and eagerly gone into, it is probable they were till then at some loss for a plan sufficiently quiet and yet effectual. So, just at the feast time shall it be done; the unexpected offer of Judas relieving them of their fears."
3. "Thus, as BENGEL remarks, did the divine counsel take effect."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 14:2. Lest haply there shall be a tumult. The form indicates expectation that this would certainly result.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They had first planned to kill him at the feast, but the Triumphal Entry and great Tuesday debate had made them decide to wait till after the feast was over."
2. "It was plain that Jesus had too large and powerful a following."
3. "See on Matthew 26:47."

### John Gill:
1. "But they said not on the feast day... and therefore they did not choose to seize him, and put him to death at that time." 
2. "Lest there should be an uproar of the people; or among them, lest they should rise in his favour, and rescue him out of their hands."
