## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There clearly appears to have been a certain sort of ointment which they drank."
2. "brake the box can hardly mean only having broken the resin with which the cork was sealed."
3. "I see no objection to supposing that the box was crushed in the hand, and the ointment thus poured over His head."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "pure nard, a celebrated aromatic—(See Song of Solomon 1:12)."
2. "The only use of this was to refresh and exhilarate—a grateful compliment in the East, amid the closeness of a heated atmosphere, with many guests at a feast."
3. "Such was the form in which Mary's love to Christ, at so much cost to herself, poured itself out."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Spikenard [ναρδου πιστικης] . The meaning of pistikhv is greatly disputed. The best authorities define it genuine or unadulterated : pure nard." (32 words)
2. "Brake. Possibly by striking the brittle neck of the flask. This detail is peculiar to Mark." (17 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ointment. John: ‘a pound,’ etc."
2. "Spikenard, or ‘nard pistic.’ ‘Nard’ means an oriental gum, but the Greek word ‘pistic’ is akin to the word meaning ‘faithful,’ and probably refers to the purity of the precious gum."
3. "She brake the box. Crushing the neck of the cruse with the hand. See notes on Matthew. Mark alone gives this detail."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As he sat at meat (κατακειμενου αυτου). Matthew 26:7 uses ανακειμενου, both words meaning reclining (leaning down or up or back) and in the genitive absolute."
2. "Spikenard (ναρδου πιστικης). This use of πιστικος with ναρδος occurs only here and in John 12:3."
3. "Brake (συντριψουσα). Only in Mark. She probably broke the narrow neck of the vase holding the ointment."

### John Gill:
1. "very precious, costly, and valuable"
2. "she broke the box"
3. "poured it on his head"

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 26:6.
