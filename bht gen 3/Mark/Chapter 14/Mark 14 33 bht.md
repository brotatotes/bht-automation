## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  33.] Notice the graphic sore amazed, and see note on ch. ix. 15 where the same word is used in the original. St Matthew has to be sorrowful.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. To be sore amazed [ÎµÎºÎ¸Î±Î¼Î²ÎµÎ¹ÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹] . A word peculiar to Mark. Compare Mark 9:15; Mark 16:5, Mark 16:6.


### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 14:33. To be greatly amazed and sore troubled. The first expression used by Mark is stronger than that used by Matthew, the second is the same in both Gospels.
