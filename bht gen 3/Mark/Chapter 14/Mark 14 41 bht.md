It is enough, Jesus said to his disciples, not referring to their watching for Him, but rather indicating that He no longer needed it as the hour had come. This use of the phrase in an impersonal sense is rare in the New Testament and has puzzled many expositors. Nonetheless, it was evident that this was not the time to expose the faults of friends, for the enemy was approaching. The approaching betrayal by one of His disciples would mark the moment when the Son of Man would be handed to sinners, both Jews and Gentiles.

- Attempt 1 BHT: It is enough, Jesus said to his disciples. He didn't mean that their watching with Him had been sufficient, but rather that He no longer needed their watchfulness as the hour had come. The use of this phrase in an impersonal sense is rare in the New Testament and has puzzled many expositors. Some have suggested that Jesus meant, Enough of your watching with me, or seeming to watch with me. Regardless, it was clear that this was not the time for the disciples' faults to be exposed, as the enemy was approaching. (Matthew 26:45 offers more insight into the approach of Judas.) Now the hour had arrived, and the Son of Man was about to be betrayed into the hands of sinners, both Jews and Gentiles, even by one of His own disciples.
