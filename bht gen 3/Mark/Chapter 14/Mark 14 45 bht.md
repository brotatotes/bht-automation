# Mark 14:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas addressed our Lord using the term á¿¥Î±Î²Î²ÎµÎ¯, which is believed to have been his usual way of speaking to Jesus. However, this does not mean that he never called Him Lord. When Judas kissed Jesus, it was an action that had already been mentioned in Matthew 26:49. This kiss was not a genuine display of affection, but rather a deceitful act by Judas, who was trying to show affection and respect while betraying Him.
