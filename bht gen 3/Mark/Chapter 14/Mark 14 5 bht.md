## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. The three hundred denarii is common to our narrative and that of St. John.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence‚Äîbetween nine and ten pounds sterling." 
2. "This he said, 'not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and had the bag'." 
3. "What a remarkable arrangement was this, by which an avaricious and dishonest person was not only taken into the number of the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of their little property!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Murmured [ŒµŒΩŒµŒ≤œÅŒπŒºœâŒΩœÑŒø] . See on Mark 1:43.


### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 14:5. And they murmured against her. Peculiar to Mark. The original seems to indicate a harsh address to Mary, though there was probably also a general murmur against her.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Above three hundred pence." - The use of "far above" may be a detail from Peter's memory of Judas' objection whose name in this connection is preserved in John 12:4.
2. "And they murmured against her." - Imperfect tense of this striking word used of the snorting of horses and seen already in Mark 1:43; Mark 11:38. It occurs in the LXX in the sense of anger as here (Daniel 11:30).
3. "Judas made the complaint against Mary of Bethany, but all the apostles joined in the chorus of criticism of the wasteful extravagance."

### John Gill:
1. "For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence...."
2. "and given to the poor; which was thought to be a better way of expending it..."
3. "and they murmured against her: that she should lavish so much money away in such an imprudent manner..."
