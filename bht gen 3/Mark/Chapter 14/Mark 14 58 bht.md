# Mark 14:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Eager to find criminal matter against Jesus, His enemies fixated on a single speech, ignoring His three-year ministry. While the ecclesiastics prosecuting Him likely knew His true meaning, they chose to distort His words concerning the temple made with hands and the temple made without hands. This statement alludes to Daniel 2:34 and bears resemblance to His reference to the temple of His body in John 2:19. By distorting His words from years ago, the accusers unwittingly affirmed His impeccable conduct throughout His ministry.
