# Mark 14:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The witnesses' inconsistent testimonies, with varying terms used to describe the offense, made it challenging to construct a coherent case against the accused. Even the slightest alteration in the reported words could turn them into either an indictable matter or a groundless charge. While the witnesses agreed on the main point, their testimonies were not equal to their desires or sufficient to condemn the accused to death.
