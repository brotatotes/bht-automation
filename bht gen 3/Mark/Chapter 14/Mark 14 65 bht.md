## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The some appear to be members of the Sanhedrim: the servants follow."
2. "Prophesy, who smote thee?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And the men that held Jesus mocked him"‚Äîor cast their jeers at Him.
2. "Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote Thee?" The sarcastic fling at Him as "the Christ," and the demand of Him in this character to name the unseen perpetrator of the blows inflicted on Him, was in them as infamous as to Him it must have been, and was intended to be, stinging.
3. "Ah! Well did He say prophetically, in that Messianic prediction which we have often referred to, 'I gave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting!'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Palms of their hands [œÅŒ±œÄŒπœÉŒºŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ]. An unclassical word, but used also by John (xix. 3). The word means blows."
2. "Did strike. Following the old reading, eballon. The Correct reading is elabon, received."
3. "Rev. Received him into custody."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Some. Others than the 'officers,' spoken of below. The context (Mark 14:64) points to members of the Sanhedrin as engaged in this cruelty."
2. "The officers. Probably those who had been by the fire (Mark 14:54)."
3. "Received him with blows of their hands. The correct reading is thus translated, describing the conduct of the officers when they received Jesus again as their prisoner."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not in Matthew, but in Luke 22:64 where Revised Version translates œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒªœÖœàŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ by 'blind-folded.'"
2. "All three Gospels give the jeering demand of the Sanhedrin: 'Prophesy,' meaning, as Matthew and Luke add, thereby telling who struck him while he was blindfolded."
3. "At any rate it was a gross indignity."

### John Gill:
1. "And some began to spit on him...." - The men that held him. 
2. "...to blindfold him, as a person unworthy to behold the light." 
3. "...buffet him with their double fists."
