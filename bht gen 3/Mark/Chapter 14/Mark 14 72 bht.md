## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No entirely satisfactory meaning has yet been given for the original word thus rendered."
2. "The sense in the text, though not elsewhere found, seems to suit both the word and the context better than any other that has been suggested."
3. "Referring to my Greek Testament for the discussion, I may sum it up by stating that..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Second Evangelist makes no mention of this look, but dwells on the warning of his Lord about the double crowing of the cock, which would announce his triple fall, as what rushed stingingly to his recollection and made him dissolve in tears." 
2. "The most precious link, however, in the whole chain of circumstances in this scene is beyond doubt that 'look' of deepest, tenderest import reported by Luke alone."
3. "And remembering the Savior's own words at the table, 'Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not,' may we not say that this prayer fetched down all that there was in that look to pierce and break the heart of Peter, to keep it from despair, to work in it 'repentance unto salvation not to be repented of,' and at length, under other healing touches, to 'restore his soul?'"

2. "The calling to mind was the momentary act of remembrance occasioned by the crowing of the cock, this the serious and continued reflection on the sin." 
3. "Other interpretations are given: 'rushing forth,' i.e., he threw himself out of the place; 'beginning' 'continuing,' 'covering his head,' etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Called to mind (Î±Î½ÎµÎ¼Î½Î·ÏƒÎ¸Î·)... was reminded."
2. "When he thought thereon (ÎµÏ€Î¹Î²Î±Î»Ï‰Î½)... the meaning is to put the mind upon something."
3. "Wept (ÎµÎºÎ»Î±Î¹ÎµÎ½). Inchoative imperfect, began to weep."

### John Gill:
1. "he turned himself to weep"; he turned away from the company, he threw himself out of it, and got out of doors as fast as he could, and broke out into a violent fit of weeping.
2. "he began to weep"; this phrase is omitted in the Ethiopic version: some choose to render it, "he looked upon him", that is, on Christ: as Christ looked upon him; which produced true evangelical repentance in him, so Peter looked upon his dear Lord with concern, whom he so had shamefully denied; he looked upon him and mourned, he looked upon him with an eye of faith, and sorrowed for his sin after a godly sort.
3. "he covered himself"; he cast his garment over his head, he veiled himself as mourners did, who covered their heads, and their faces, and even their lips.

### John Wesley:
1. And he covered his head â€” Which was a usual custom with mourners, and was fitly expressive both of grief and shame.
