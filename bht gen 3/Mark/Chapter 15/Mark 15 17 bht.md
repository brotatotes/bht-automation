Though Matthew uses the term scarlet, the Greek word for purple is often used to signify different shades of red. It's important to note that the color of the robe is not as significant as its symbolic meaning. This cloak, along with the crown of thorns and the reed, all serve as ironic symbols of kingship.

- Attempt 3 BHT: The soldiers mockingly dressed Jesus in a purple robe, as purple was often associated with royalty and greatness. While Matthew calls it a scarlet robe, the Greek word used can encompass various shades of red.

The soldiers also placed a crown of thorns on his head, mimicking a crown, and handed him a reed, pretending it was a scepter. This whole act was a mocking portrayal of Jesus as a fake king.

- Attempt 4 BHT: The soldiers sarcastically clothed Jesus in a purple robe, which was often worn by kings. Although Matthew refers to it as a scarlet robe, the Greek word used can also denote various shades of red. Rather than being a literal representation, the color serves as a symbol of false grandeur. To amplify the mockery, they placed a crown of thorns on his head, simulating a royal crown, and handed him a reed as a pretend scepter. This cruel display was a scornful depiction of Jesus as a counterfeit king.

This cruel scene portrayed Jesus as a sham king, ridiculing his authority.
