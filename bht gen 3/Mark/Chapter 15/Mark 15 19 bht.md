# Mark 15:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a humiliating display, the soldiers mocked Jesus with false worship, repeatedly striking him and spitting on him. Their actions were a mockery of the respect and honor shown to kings, as they saw Jesus not as divine, but as someone foolishly claiming to be a king. The mockery went even further as they smote him on the head with a reed, causing the thorns on his crown to pierce his temples, and they spat directly on his face. Even in their contempt, they still bowed their knees to him, ironically treating him like a sovereign prince.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Mocked him with the 'appearance' of homage."
2. "The word 'worship' here delotes only the respect and honor shown to princes and kings."
3. "They regarded him as foolishly and madly claiming to be a king - not as claiming to be divine."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Worshipped him (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒµŒ∫œÖŒΩŒøœÖŒΩ). In mockery. Imperfect tense as are ŒµœÑœÖœÄœÑŒøŒΩ (smote) and ŒµŒΩŒµœÄœÑœÖŒøŒΩ (did spit upon). Repeated indignities. 


### John Gill:
1. "And they smote him on the head with a reed...which drove the sharp pointed thorns into his temples." 
2. "And did spit upon him; 'upon his face', as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions read."
