# Mark 15:20 Commentary Help Text

In a vivid and historical present, they lead him out of the city, unkinging him by taking off the purple cloak. He carries his own cross, bearing the weight and burden, as they guide him through the city towards the usual place of crucifixion. These soldiers, who have been entrusted with his custody, receive the perquisites of his clothes at his execution. This scene is reminiscent of the accounts in Matthew 27:31 and John 19:16, where he too is led out.
