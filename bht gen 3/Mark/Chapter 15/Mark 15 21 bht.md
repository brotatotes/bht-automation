# Mark 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon, a man from Cyrene, was compelled to bear the cross of Jesus. The mention of Rufus, possibly the same person as in Romans 16:13, indicates Mark's accuracy in designating Simon. It is interesting that Jesus initially bore his own cross until Simon took over. The mention of Simon being from the field does not explain why he was chosen or if it was a regular feast day. Simon's act of carrying the cross of Jesus, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who were well-known individuals, adds significance to the event.

2. "The father of Alexander and Rufus. Persons well known to the first readers of this Gospel. As Mark probably wrote in Rome, the 'Rufus 'saluted in Romans 16:13, may be the person here spoken of. But the name was a common one."
3. "This 'Alexander,' can scarcely be the man put forward by the Jews at Ephesus (Acts 19:33), who may or may not be identical with the person mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:20; 2 Timothy 4:14."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Simon met the procession."
2. "Paul mentions a Rufus in Romans 16:13, but it was a common name and proves nothing."

3. "The father of Alexander and Rufus; who were men well known...they obliged 'Simon' to bear his cross."

### John Wesley:

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Simon, a man from Cyrene, was compelled to bear the cross of Jesus as they journeyed to the crucifixion site. It is interesting to note the accuracy in Mark's designation of Simon and the mention of Rufus, possibly the same person mentioned in Romans 16:13. However, it is important to remember that Rufus was a common name. Jesus himself bore his own cross initially until Simon took over. The mention of Simon being from the field does not shed light on why he was chosen for this task or whether it was a regular feast day. Simon's act of carrying the cross of Jesus, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who were well-known individuals, speaks to the impact and significance of this event.
