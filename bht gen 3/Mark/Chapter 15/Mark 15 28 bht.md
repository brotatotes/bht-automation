### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Mark 15:28, Jesus is not portrayed as a transgressor, but rather as having a place among transgressors in his death. This does not mean that God saw Jesus as a sinner, but rather that in the eyes of the people or through the judgement of the authorities, he was regarded as one. Jesus, however, died as the just for the unjust and remained holy, harmless, and undefiled throughout his life and death. It is worth noting that some manuscripts omit this verse, but its genuineness is confirmed in Luke 22:37, and Mark rarely quotes prophecies so directly. Ultimately, Jesus, without any sin of his own, willingly took upon himself the sins of his people as a substitute, fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 53:12.
