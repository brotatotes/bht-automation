# Mark 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mocking cries of Ah! The Latin vah! Destroyest echoed, the same word used in ancient games for applause. It seemed to be applied ironically to our Lord, perhaps with reproach. Thou that destroyest the temple... and buildest it in three days, they jeered, mocking His power. But now, where was their bravado? These words serve as a reminder of the futility of boasting and the transient nature of human pride. (Matthew 27:39)
