# Mark 15:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mentioned day is known as the day before the Sabbath or Friday, which began at sunset. It is called the preparation because it was necessary to take down the bodies of Jesus and the other crucified men before the Sabbath day. The Jews had already made arrangements for their removal as they did not want the bodies to remain on the cross during the Sabbath. This day of preparation ensured that everything was ready for the upcoming solemn Sabbath day.
