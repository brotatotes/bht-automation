# Mark 15:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus died, Pilate was likely relieved to have him off his hands and to have Joseph take care of the burial. It was unusual for Jesus' body to be referred to as a corpse, considering the word cadaver is only used for dead bodies. The centurion confirmed Jesus' death, and Pilate, satisfied with the report, gave the body to Joseph. This official confirmation was necessary before the burial.
