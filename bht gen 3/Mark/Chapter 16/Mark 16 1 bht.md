# Mark 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the Sabbath was past at sunset, the women had bought spices to anoint Jesus' body. Nicodemus had wrapped the body quickly with spices and linen clothes, but the women had not yet prepared the spices for a proper anointing. It is possible they had purchased the spices immediately after the Crucifixion on Friday evening, before the Sabbath rest began. Having returned from the tomb after watching late Friday afternoon, the women came prepared with the spices for their visit at dawn.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: After the Sabbath ended at sunset, the women bought spices to anoint Jesus' body. They had not yet done this, as Nicodemus had only wrapped the body hastily in spices and linen clothes. Our translators may be correct in rendering it as had bought because they likely purchased the spices immediately after the Crucifixion before the Sabbath rest began. It is important to note that the women had returned from the tomb after watching late Friday afternoon and had already prepared the spices. While it is understood that the Jewish day begins the night before, the women resolved among themselves to visit the sepulcher before dawn.
