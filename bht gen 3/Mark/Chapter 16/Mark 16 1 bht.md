2. "Hence we read of 'the spices of the dead,' which were used to expel an ungrateful savour: this they did, out of affection to Christ, but seemed to have no faith in his resurrection, though he had told them of it, which they had forgot."
3. "Though it seems most likely, that they came to anoint his body; for this was one of the things which was customary in Israel to do to dead men, as Maimonides observes, 'they anoint him with various sorts of spices'."
