## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This idiom, never used by St. Mark, is three times contained in this passage (vv. 12, 15)."
2. "Them that had been with him, though found in the Acts (xx. 18), never occurs in the Gospels."
3. "Nor does the word 'disciples' in this passage."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An absolute use of the pronoun unexampled in Mark." (Commentary)
2. "Went, go. This verb for to go occurs nowhere else in this Gospel except in compounds." (Commentary)
3. "A circumlocution foreign to the Gospels." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Emphasis seems to rest on the word 'she;' she was the first to tell them, the others probably returning later, after they had seen the Lord on the way."
2. "An unusual expression for 'disciples,' probably including the whole company of His followers."
3. "A natural touch, showing how little they anticipated His resurrection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Went (œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµŒπœÉŒ±). First aorist passive participle. Common word for going, but in Mark so far only in Mark 9:30 in the uncompounded form." 
2. "Them that had been with him (œÑŒøŒπœÇ ŒºŒµœÑ' Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπœÇ). This phrase for the disciples occurs here alone in Mark and the other Gospels if the disciples (ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑŒ±) are meant." 
3. "As they mourned and wept (œÄŒµŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ Œ∫Œ± Œ∫ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ). Present active participles in dative plural agreeing with œÑŒøŒπœÇ ... Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπœÇ and describing the pathos of the disciples in their utter bereavement and woe."

### John Gill:
1. "she went, as she was bid by Christ, and told his disciples, what she had heard and seen"
2. "even those who had been with him from the beginning, and had heard his doctrines, and seen his miracles, and had had communion with him, and truly believed in him, and were his constant followers, and real disciples"
3. "As they mourned and wept, being inconsolable for the death of their Lord, and the loss of his presence; and also for their carriage towards him, that one among them should betray him, another deny him, and all forsake him"

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 24:9; John 20:18.
