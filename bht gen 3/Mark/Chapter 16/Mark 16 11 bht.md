## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "had been seen of (by) her is a construction only found here in N.T."
2. "the word here used for 'seen' (which occurs again ver. 14) is not used by Mark."
3. "believed not (disbelieved) is only used in ver. 16 and Luke xxiv. 11, 41, throughout the Gospels."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed notâ€”This, which is once and again repeated of them all, is most important in its bearing on their subsequent testimony to His resurrection at the risk of life itself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Believed not - This is proof that they did not expect his resurrection; proof that they were not easily deceived, and that nothing but the clearest evidence could undeceive them.


### John Calvin:
1. "I am convinced that all of them in common conveyed the message in obedience to the commands of Christ."
2. "If the women had related anything of which they had not formerly heard, there would have been some reason for not immediately believing them in a matter which was incredible."
3. "They not only refuse the light of truth, but reject it as an idle fancy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Had been seen of her. Another expression peculiar to this section. But 'new facts, new words.'"

### John Gill:
1. "When they heard the report of Mary Magdalene, that Christ was raised from the dead, and was certainly alive..."
2. "they believed not; the words of Mary, and the other women, for they seemed as idle tales to them..."
