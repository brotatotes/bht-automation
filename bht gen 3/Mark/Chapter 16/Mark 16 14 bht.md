# Mark 16:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' doubt in the resurrection of Jesus is not a sign of intellectual superiority but rather a struggle between skepticism and belief. It is worth mentioning that even some prominent scientists today are devout believers in the risen Christ. The disciples' disbelief was not due to deception but rather an unwillingness to accept the miraculous truth. Jesus reproached them for their hardened hearts, as their obstinate unbelief deliberately suppressed the evident truth. Ultimately, they could no longer deny the overwhelming evidence of Jesus' resurrection.
