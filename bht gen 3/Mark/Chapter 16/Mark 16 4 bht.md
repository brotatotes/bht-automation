## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "for it was very great is stated as a reason why they could see that it was rolled away on looking up, possibly at some distance."
2. "This explanation is according to St. Markâ€™s manner of describing minute circumstantial incidents."
3. "To refer this clause back as the reason why they questioned who should remove the stone is not only harsh but inconsistent with the usage of this Gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Looking up. They may have been looking down before, absorbed in their conversation; the tomb was probably above them, cut horizontally in the face of the rock at a slight elevation."
2. "They see that the stone is rolled back. Possibly â€˜rolled up,â€™ as if it had rested in a hollow at the door of the tomb."
3. "For it was exceeding great. This does not mean that the greatness of the stone was the reason of their anxiety and questioning, although this was doubtless true, but that its size enabled them to notice the position even in the early morning. A vivid touch peculiar to Mark."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Their problem is solved for the stone lies rolled back before their very eyes."
2. "Mark has his frequent vivid dramatic present 'behold.'"
3. "Mark explains by the size of the stone this sudden and surprising sight right before their eyes."

### John Gill:
1. "They saw that the stone was rolled away; they perceived it lay at some distance from the door of the sepulchre, which doubtless was very grateful, and matter of rejoicing to them."
2. "For it was very great; these words are to be read, in connection with the preceding verse; for they are not a reason, why when they looked towards the sepulchre, they saw the stone rolled, because it was a very large one, and so easily to be seen at a distance; but a reason why they were so thoughtful and concerned, who should roll it away for them."
3. "They could not think that they were able to do it themselves."
