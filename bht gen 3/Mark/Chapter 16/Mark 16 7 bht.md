## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mention of him here is probably merely officialâ€”as the â€˜first among equals.â€™" 
2. "We cannot say that others of the Apostles may not have denied their Master besides Peter."
3. "It must not be concluded from this that we have a trace of Peterâ€™s hand in the narrative."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This Second Gospel, being drawn upâ€”as all the earliest tradition statesâ€”under the eye of Peter, or from materials chiefly furnished by him..."
2. "...there is something deeply affecting in the preservation of this little clause by Mark alone."
3. "...that he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said unto you."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But. Emphatic: instead of lingering here, go tell, etc." 
2. "And Peter. A special token of love to this one who had denied Him, and a recognition of his prominence among his equals."
3. "As he said to you. Chap. Mark 14:28; see on Matthew 28:7."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter remembered gratefully this special message from the Risen Christ."
2. "An event that changed doubt to certainty with the apostles."
3. "Promised meeting in Galilee."

### John Gill:
1. "Peter is particularly mentioned, not as distinct from the apostles, or as if he was not one of them, having sinned in the manner he had done; much less because he was the chief of them; but to comfort him in his great sorrow, on account of his fall; and to encourage him to meet Christ with the rest of his disciples..."
2. "This is a kind intimation, in favour of Peter; none of the other evangelists observe it; but this Gospel being published, as is thought by some, under the direction and examination of Peter himself, he was careful to relate every thing, that either aggravated his own crime, or illustrated the grace of God, and love of Christ towards him."
3. "The Persic version puts Peter first, rendering it, 'say to Cephas and the rest of the disciples'; all copies, and other versions, put him last..."

### John Wesley:
1. And Peter â€” Though he so oft denied his Lord. What amazing goodness was this!
