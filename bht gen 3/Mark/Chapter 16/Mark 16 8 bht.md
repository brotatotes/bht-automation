## BHT:
The women, seized with tremor and amazement, fled in terror from the tomb, leaving the message unspoken. Their intense emotions of fear and astonishment, mingled with joy, at the sight of the risen Jesus were to be expected.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The women fled in terror from the sepulchre, and did not deliver the message at the time,â€”for they were afraid." 
2. "It is a manifest evidence that our narrative is here suddenly broken off, and (perhaps?) that no more information about the women was in the possession of its author."
3. "The legitimate inference is, that it was placed as a completion of the Gospel soon after the apostolic period,â€”the Gospel itself having been, for some reason unknown to us, eh incomplete."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Tremor and amazement seized them."
2. "How intensely natural and simple is this!"
3. "Appearances of Jesus after His Resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Quickly. Omitted by best texts."
2. "The wonder merges into fear."
3. "By a large number of the ablest modern critics the remainder of this chapter is held to be from some other hand than Mark's."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And fled from the tomb. In a tumult of excitement."
2. "For trembling and astonishment possessed them. This was the reason of their fleeing."
3. "The remarkable events of that day produced mingled and indeed confused emotions. To that of fear and indecision, Mark gives prominence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Trembling and astonishment, while Matthew 28:8 has 'with fear and great joy' which see for discussion. Clearly and naturally their emotions were mixed."
2. "They said nothing to any one. This excitement was too great for ordinary conversation. Hushed to silence their feet had wings as they flew on."
3. "The facts are very complicated, but argue strongly against the genuineness of verses Mark 16:9-20 of Mark 16. It is difficult to believe that Mark ended his Gospel with verse Mark 16:8 unless he was interrupted."

### John Gill:
1. "And they went out quickly... immediately they went out." 
2. "They trembled and were amazed; at what they saw and heard, and yet this dread and fear were mixed with joy at the news of Christ's resurrection." 
3. "Neither said they any thing to any man... for they were afraid; not only affrighted with what they had seen and heard, but they were afraid to tell any but the disciples of these things."
