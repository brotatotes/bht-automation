## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To a woman was this honor given to be the first that saw the risen Redeemer, and that woman was NOT his virgin-mother."
2. "There is some difficulty here, and different ways of removing it have been adopted."
3. "She had gone with the other women to the sepulchre, parting from them, perhaps, before their interview with the angel, and on finding Peter and John she had come with them back to the spot; and it was at this second visit, it would seem, that Jesus appeared to this Mary."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A phrase which Mark does not use."
2. "With Mark's well-known habit of particularizing, it is somewhat singular..."
3. "An unusual expression. Mark habitually uses the preposition ejk in this connection..."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "From whom he had cast out seven demons."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "First (œÄœÅœâœÑŒøŒΩ). Definite statement that Jesus appeared (ŒµœÜŒ±ŒΩŒ∑) to Mary Magdalene first of all." 
2. "The verb ŒµœÜŒ±ŒΩŒ∑ (second aorist passive of œÜŒ±ŒπŒΩœâ) is here alone of the Risen Christ (cf. ŒïŒªŒµŒπŒ±œÇ ŒµœÜŒ±ŒΩŒ∑, Luke 9:8), the usual verb being œâœÜŒ∏Œ∑ (Luke 24:34; 1 Corinthians 15:5)." 
3. "This description of Mary Magdalene is like that in Luke 8:2 and seems strange in Mark at this point, described as a new character here, though mentioned by Mark three times just before (Mark 15:40; Mark 15:47; Mark 16:1)."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus rose from the dead on the first day of the week, agrees with the accounts of all the evangelists, and is here expressly affirmed."
2. "That he rose early on that day, is clear from the women, who set out at the end of the sabbath, when that was past and over."
3. "This was a very great favour, and an high honour that was bestowed upon her; and who had received large favours from him before."

### John Wesley:
1. John 20:11.
