## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 1. And again he entered into
	Capernaumâ€”"His own city" ( :-). 
	
and it was noised that he was
	in the houseâ€”no doubt of Simon Peter ( :-).


### Albert Barnes:
1. "And it was noised ... - He entered the city, doubtless, privately; but his being there was soon known, and so great had his popularity become that multitudes pressed to hear him."
2. "Jesus probably remained long enough in the desert to heal the sick who were brought to him, and to give instructions to the multitudes who attended his preaching."
3. "Capernaum was not 'the city' mentioned in Mark 1:45, and it is probable that there was no difficulty in his remaining there and preaching."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It was reported - he is in the house!" 
2. "He has gone into the house, and is there."
3. "He was speaking when the occurrence which follows took place."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "After some days. More than one day, but how many does not appear. Still even this indefinite mark of time favors the view, that the order of this Evangelist is exact."
2. "Noised. This suggests a private entrance into the city, and then a general report that He was there."
3. "In the house. The article is wanting in the original; the phrase is equivalent to â€˜at home;â€™ but with the additional idea of having come there. It is therefore probable that the house was His usual residence in Capernaum, but this is not definitely expressed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After the first tour of Galilee when Jesus is back in the city which is now the headquarters for the work in Galilee."
2. "In the house, at home, in the home of Peter, now the home of Jesus."
