# Mark 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many publicans and sinners sat together with Jesus and His disciples in Levi's house, being invited by Levi himself. This gathering of individuals of abandoned character, fitting companions for publicans, was a testament to the popularity of our Savior and His message. The fact that the host was one of the former class (and would naturally gather his associates) is brought out by Luke. The majority of them followed Jesus out of a desire to hear more of His gracious words and experience His tender behavior.

2. "Our Lord, and those following Him as disciples, were ordinarily entertained where He was invited, which will account for their following Him."
3. "There were many, and they followed him, is peculiar to Mark."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This feast was made by Matthew in honor of the Saviour."
2. "Sinners of abandoned character - of the same character that publicans commonly sustained - fit companions of publicans - great sinners."
3. "There is no doubt that our Saviour, in the early part of his ministry, was extremely popular. Multitudes of the common people attended him, and gave conclusive evidence that they were his real disciples."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "for there were many, and they followed him" (8 words)
3. "many of the Scribes and Pharisees; yet with a different view from the former, not to get any advantage to themselves, but, if they could, an advantage against Christ." (35 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "Some of them doubtless invited by Matthew, moved with compassion for his old companions in sin."
2. "For there were many, and they followed him, seem to imply, that the greater part, encouraged by his gracious words and the tenderness of his behaviour, and impatient to hear more, stayed for no invitation."
3. "Pressed in after him, and kept as close to him as they could."
