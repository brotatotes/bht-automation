### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus came not to call the righteous, but those who are sick. The Pharisees may have claimed to be whole and strong, but Jesus knew they were far from it. He accepted their self-righteousness for the sake of argument, but in reality, they were in need of spiritual healing and repentance. Those who see the impurity and sickness within themselves, who are sick of their own sinful nature, are the ones who recognize their need for a physician. Jesus called people to new spiritual life, away from sin, and towards repentance. The well and strong, who do not see their own need for a physician, have no need of Jesus. It is those who recognize their own sickness and brokenness that Jesus came to save.
