- Attempt 1 BHT: The disciples of John and the Pharisees, who were accustomed to fasting, approached Jesus with a question about fasting. The fact that the followers of John aligned themselves with the Pharisees in questioning Jesus shows that they had missed the true spirit of their leader.

Ultimately, their question reveals their lack of understanding and misalignment with Jesus' teachings.
