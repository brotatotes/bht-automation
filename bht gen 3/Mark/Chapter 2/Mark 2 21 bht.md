# Mark 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Adding something new to something old results in the new taking away from the old, causing a worse tear. This concept is highlighted by the parable, which demonstrates the independent accounts of Mark, Matthew, and Luke. The new addition in this case refers to the traditions of the elders, which were considered new compared to God's commandments. These traditions were not to be combined with the Jews' moral and ceremonial righteousness, as they often led to neglecting God's commands and rendering them void.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Seweth [ŒµœÄŒπœÅœÅŒ±œÄœÑŒµŒπ] . A word found in Mark only. Matthew (ix. 16) and Luke (v. 36) use ejpiballei, throweth upon, as we speak of clapping a patch upon.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "That which filleth it up (lit, ‚Äòthe fulness‚Äô) taketh away from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent is made."
2. "The form is peculiar to Mark, and characteristic of his lively style."
3. "The variations show entire independence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The traditions of the elders are meant, particularly concerning eating and drinking, and fasting, things before spoken of; and which occasioned this parable, and which were new things in comparison of the commands of God."
2. "The former [moral and ceremonial righteousness of the Jews] were not to be joined with these [traditions of the elders], to make up a justifying righteousness before God."
3. "By attendance to the traditions of the elders, the Jews were taken off from, and neglected the commandments of God; nay, oftentimes the commands of God were made void by these traditions."

This concept aligns with the underlying message of the parable being discussed. The independent accounts provided by Mark, Matthew, and Luke showcase their distinctive perspectives. In the context of this discussion, the addition being referred to is the introduction of the traditions of the elders, considered new compared to God's commands.
