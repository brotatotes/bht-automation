# Mark 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus and his disciples were walking through the cornfields on the Sabbath day, they began to pluck the ears of corn and eat them. While some suggest that they created a path by plucking the stalks, this interpretation is likely mistaken, as they wouldn't have needed to do so. The offense that the Pharisees took was not at the disciples' actions of clearing a path, but rather at the work of preparing food on the Sabbath. This incident is also paralleled in Matthew 12:1-8 and Luke 6:1 for a more thorough discussion.
