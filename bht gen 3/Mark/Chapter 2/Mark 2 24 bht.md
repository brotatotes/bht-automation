# Mark 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, in their malicious and implacable nature, questioned Jesus' disciples on the Sabbath, accusing them of violating the law by picking and eating ears of corn. Their stern and rigorous demeanor stemmed from their ambition to find fault in everything Jesus did or said. However, their narrow-minded interpretation of the Sabbath laws demonstrated their prideful and cruel dispositions, rather than a genuine desire for true spiritual worship. The Sabbath was meant to be a time of sanctification and freedom from worldly occupations, not a vehicle for self-righteous legalism.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The only reason for keeping the Sabbath was, that the people, by sanctifying themselves to God, might be employed in true and spiritual worship; and next, that, being free from all worldly occupations, they might be more at liberty to attend the holy assemblies."
2. "But this shows clearly the malicious and implacable nature of superstition, and particularly the proud and cruel dispositions of hypocrites, when ambition is joined to hatred of the person."
3. "It was not the mere affectation of pretended holiness... that made the Pharisees so stern and rigorous; but as they expressly wished to carp at everything that Christ said or did, they could not do otherwise than put a wrong meaning."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 2:24. See on Matthew 12:21, for the Pharisaical views of the Sabbath.
	


### John Gill:
1. "Behold, why do they on the sabbath day, that which is not lawful?"
2. "See how they pluck the ears of corn and rub them, and eat things, which by the law, especially by the traditions of the elders, were not lawful to be done on the sabbath day."
3. "Luke 6:2."
