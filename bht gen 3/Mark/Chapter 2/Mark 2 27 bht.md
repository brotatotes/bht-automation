# Mark 2:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Sabbath, created for man's rest and as a symbol of the rest that awaits God's people, was given authority to Jesus, who has taken on humanity and has power over creation. It is important to note that man was not created for the Sabbath; rather, the Sabbath was created for man. The Sabbath is a means to an end, instituted by God for the physical and moral well-being of man. Therefore, it is a misuse of the Sabbath to turn it into a burden or an occasion for strict rules.
