## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But here we learn, not only that his bearers had the same faith with himself, but that Jesus marked it as a faith which was not to be defeatedâ€”a faith victorious over all difficulties."
2. "This was the faith for which He was ever on the watch, and which He never saw without marking, and, in those who needed anything from Him, richly rewarding."
3. "And yet, as the Pharisees understood our Lord to be dispensing pardon by this saying, and Jesus not only acknowledges that they were right, but founds His whole argument upon the correctness of it, we must regard the saying as a royal proclamation of the man's forgiveness by Him to whom it belonged to dispense it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 2:5. See on Matthew 9:2. â€˜Be of good cheer,â€™ is omitted here, and in Lukeâ€™s account, the latter has â€˜Manâ€™ instead of â€˜Son.â€™
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is no reason for excluding his faith. They all had confidence in the power and willingness of Jesus to heal this desperate case."
2. "The astonishing thing both to the paralytic and to the four friends is that Jesus forgave his sins instead of healing him. The sins had probably caused the paralysis."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ calls him son, though, in this afflicted condition a person may be a child of God, and yet greatly afflicted by him; afflictions are not arguments against, but rather for sonship..."
2. "...he was a son of God by divine predestination, being predestinated to the adoption of children: he was a son by virtue of the covenant of grace..."
3. "...the blessing Christ conferred on this poor man is of the greatest consequence and importance, forgiveness of sin: it is what springs from the grace and mercy of God; it is provided in a promise in the covenant of grace..."
