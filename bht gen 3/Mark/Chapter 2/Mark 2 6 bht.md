# Mark 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jewish ecclesiastics had gathered from all around to observe Jesus, but their hearts were far from teachable. Their venemous thoughts remained unspoken, but Jesus could perceive their hostility. They had come to scrutinize His words and actions, sitting in a conspicuous position. Their presence hindered the simple ones who rejoiced in the truth, as they exchanged light for darkness. It was disheartening to witness their lack of receptiveness to the truth, for they had allowed their learnedness to blind them.
