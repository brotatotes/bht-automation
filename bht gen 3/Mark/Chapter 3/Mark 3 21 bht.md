# Mark 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
People heard that Jesus was being overwhelmed by crowds, and his mother and brothers, not his disciples, said that he was beside himself. It is a mournful sight to picture Jesus' own family thinking he was delusional. This accusation of madness due to his devotion to religion is not limited to Jesus; it is a charge that has been made throughout history against those who are deeply committed to their faith. However, in this case, it seems that their motive was a lack of faith or a desire to protect Jesus by conceding to the accusations made against him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They heard of his being so beset by crowds: see vv. 7â€“11."
2. "Our version is right in giving the meaning He is mad: for the sense requires it."
3. "They had doubtless heard of the accusation of his having a demon: which we must suppose not to have first begun after this, but to have been going on throughout this course of miracles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is beside himself - He is delirious or deranged."
2. "The charge of 'derangement' on account of attention to religion has not been confined to the Saviour."
3. "And none will be more ready to originate or believe the charge than an ungodly and infidel parent or brother, a self-righteous Pharisee or professor in the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His friends... i.e., by origin or birth." 
2. "Not his disciples, since they were in the house with him."
3. "They said... Very graphic, they kept saying."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is beside himself. This implies either actual insanity in a bad sense, or religious enthusiasm and ecstasy, even to derangement, in a good sense."
2. "While an accusation of madness on the part of His relatives is neither impossible nor improbable, so long as they were not true believers, it may have been a mere pretext."
3. "The context favors the thought that the motive was policy resulting from want of faith, though perhaps not from positive disbelief. This doubting, worldly policy, which could seek to shelter Him by meeting the accusations of His foes half way, is in keeping with the desire to thrust Him forward which was afterwards shown."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a mournful spectacle to think of the mother and brothers saying, He is beside himself." 
2. "Certainly Mary did not believe that Jesus was in the power of Beelzebub as the rabbis said already."
3. "Herod Antipas will later consider Jesus as John the Baptist redivivus, the scribes treat him as under demonic possession."

### John Gill:
1. "They went out to lay hold on him...for they said, he is beside himself."
2. "This was done in kindness to him, and does not design any violent action upon him, in order to take him home with them, and to confine him as a madman."
3. "[They] came out, in order to dissuade him from such excessive labours, and engage him to go with them, where he might have rest and refreshment, and be composed, and retire."

### John Wesley:
1. His relations â€” His mother and his brethren, Mark 3:31. But it was some time before they could come near him.
