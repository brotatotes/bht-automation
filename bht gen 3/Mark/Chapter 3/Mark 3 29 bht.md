# Mark 3:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Attributing the work of Christ to the devil is an unpardonable sin, guilty of eternal sin never to be wiped out. This eternal sin finds its parallel in ye shall die in your sins. The punishment is perpetual because the sin excludes repentance, leaving one in a state of eternal sin and guilt. It is a fearful aspect of eternal punishment, being forever deprived of the necessary influences of the Holy Spirit, leading to an unending state of activity in sin and everlasting destruction.
