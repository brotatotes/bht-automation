# Mark 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord's denunciation is grounded in the fact that the accusers called and summoned Him, who looked on them and those who surrounded Him. These accusers had attributed the works of the Holy Spirit to the power of an evil spirit, despite the evidence that they were divinely accomplished. Their act amounted to the unforgivable sin against the Holy Ghost, as they ascribed the miracles of Christ to the influence of the devil himself.
