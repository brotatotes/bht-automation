## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Rather a â€˜boat.â€™ There were properly speaking, no â€˜shipsâ€™ on the Sea of Tiberias." 
2. "This was probably a small boat that belonged to the disciples, in which he could draw off from the shore, and teach the people without being pressed by them."
3. "He therefore withdrew from the multitude, and sought a situation where he might address them to greater advantage."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That a small boat. The original refers to a boat even smaller than the usual fishing-boats."
2. "Wait on him. Be constantly at His service."
3. "Because of the crowd. A different word from â€˜multitudeâ€™ (Mark 3:7-8), though the one usually so translated. The purpose was probably both to teach from the boat and to retire from the crowd when He wished."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The boat was to keep close to the shore in constant readiness and move as Jesus did."
2. "Whether he needed it or not is not told, but it was there at hand."
