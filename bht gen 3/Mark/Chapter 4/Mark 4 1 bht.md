# Mark 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Once again, Jesus began to teach by the seaside, and a great multitude gathered around Him. This crowd was immense, filling the whole area by the sea and on the land, pressing Him towards the sea. It had become a common experience for Him to teach the masses on the beach, so he sat in a boat on the water, slightly elevated above the audience. This turning point in His public teaching marked the beginning of His parabolic instruction, and the boat in the sea proved to be the best arrangement for addressing such a large gathering.
