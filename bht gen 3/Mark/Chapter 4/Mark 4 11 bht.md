# Mark 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Discipleship means initiation into the secret of God's kingdom and it will come gradually to those within Jesus' circle of followers. Without the key to understanding the parables, which veil the truth of the kingdom stated in terms of another realm, they are hard to grasp. The purpose of these parables is not to give good moral advice, but to reveal otherwise unknown truthsâ€”the peculiar doctrines of the gospel. As for those outside the circle, the mysteries are hidden from them, preventing them from entering the kingdom of God.
