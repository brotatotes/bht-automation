# Mark 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus uses parables in the confrontation with the Pharisees to condemn their willful blindness and rejection of Him, pronouncing their doom and reflecting Isaiah's prophecy. The purpose of the parables is to both reveal and conceal the truth, depending on the moral state of the hearers. Through preaching His word, God seeks to renew hearts and minds, but when it blinds and hardens the reprobate, it is a consequence of their own depravity. True understanding requires willing hearts that are open to perceiving and receiving His message.
