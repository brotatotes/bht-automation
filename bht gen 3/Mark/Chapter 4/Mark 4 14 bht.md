## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The result is entirely different, the whole difference must lie in the soils, which mean the different states of the human heart."
2. "The great general lesson held forth in this parable of the sower is, that however faithful the preacher, and how pure soever his message, the effect of the preaching of the word depends upon the state of the hearer's heart."
3. "The sower is the same, and the seed is the same; while the result is entirely different."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The sower soweth the word. More precise than either Matthew or Luke. Compare Matthew 13:19; Luke 8:11.


### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 4:14. Peculiar to Mark, though involved in the other accounts.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  The sower soweth the word (Œø œÉœÄŒµŒπœÅœâŒΩ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøŒΩ œÉœÄŒµŒπœÅŒµ). Not put thus clearly and simply in Matthew 13:19 or Luke 8:11. 


### John Gill:
1. "The sower soweth the word."
2. "The seed in the parable, before delivered, and which fell on different sorts of ground, is the word of God."
3. "The word is the word of life and truth; the word of peace and reconciliation; the word of faith and righteousness; the word of salvation; the word which publishes and declares all these to be in and by Jesus Christ."
