# Mark 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Superficial hearts eagerly welcome the truth but quickly lose their zeal when faced with tribulations, resembling the seed sown on stony ground. Ministers often encounter disappointing outcomes when their faithful teachings fail to penetrate these hearers' hardened hearts. Lacking a genuine understanding of sin and their need for Christ, their delight in the truth stems from self-interest and the desire for a well-connected scheme of eternal happiness. Without true brokenness and transformation, their initial promise of fruitfulness fades away like dried-up plants in the scorching sun.
