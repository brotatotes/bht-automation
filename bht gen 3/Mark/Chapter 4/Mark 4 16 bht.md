# Mark 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The great truth here taught is that hearts superficially impressed are apt to receive the truth with readiness, and even with joy. The heat of tribulation or persecution because of the word, or the trials which their new profession brings upon them quickly dries up their relish for the truth, and withers all the hasty promise of fruit which they showed. Such disappointing issues of a faithful and awakening ministryâ€”alas, how frequent are they!

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The great truth taught in this verse is that hearts that are superficially impressed by the word of God are often quick to receive it with joy. However, the heat of tribulation or the trials that come along with professing faith quickly dries up their initial enthusiasm, causing their interest in the truth to wither away. This is a disappointing outcome that is all too common in ministry. These types of hearers are like the stony ground on which the seed falls, taking root and showing some affection for the word, but lacking true brokenness and a transformation of heart. Although they may seem delighted with the message, their hearts remain hardened and unchanged.
