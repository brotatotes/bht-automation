# Mark 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and make it unfruitful. This condition is often seen in commercial countries where many once promised much fruit but now bring no fruit to perfection. The desires become lusts when they interfere with spiritual growth, even innocent objects may become snares. Other worldly distractions and the perplexing and distressing cares of this world diminish the fruitfulness of the word. Let those who have received and retained the word be watchful and guard against unfruitful desires.
