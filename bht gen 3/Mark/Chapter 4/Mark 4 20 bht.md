# Mark 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The interpretation of the parable emphasizes the significance of the honest and good heart, which is described as a heart that is soft, tender, and guarded against worldly distractions, showing a deep concern for eternal matters. These hearers produce fruit through patient endurance, with varying degrees of fruitfulness ranging from thirtyfold to a hundredfold. The order of fruitfulness is given by Mark as thirty, sixty, to a hundred, while Matthew reverses this order.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice the concluding words of the interpretation exactly reproducing those of the parable..."
2. "It is remarkable that the same is found in Matthew but in another form and order..."
3. "In Luke, the two are varied."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A heart soft and tender, stirred to its depths on the great things of eternity, and jealously guarded from worldly engrossments, such only is the 'honest and good heart'." 
2. "Such 'bring forth fruit with patience', or continuance, 'enduring to the end'; in contrast with those in whom the word is 'choked' and brings no fruit to perfection." 
3. "The 'thirtyfold' is designed to express the lowest degree of fruitfulness; the 'hundredfold' the highest; and the 'sixtyfold' the intermediate degrees of fruitfulness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Such as. A good rendering of the pronoun oitinev, which indicates the class of hearers.


### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 4:20. The closing words of the parable (Mark 4:8) are repeated in the last clause of this verse, as in Matthew, and the same difference in order is preserved.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Bear fruit (Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄŒøœÜŒøœÅŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ). Same word in Matthew 13:23 and Luke 8:15. Mark gives the order from thirty, sixty, to a hundred, while Matthew 13:23 has it reversed. 


### John Gill:
1. "Such hearers who are intended by the good ground on which other seed fell, are those who are made good men by the grace of God; for there is none good naturally, nor that doeth good, no not one."
2. "These are such who hear the word, and receive it; as the word of God, in whose hearts it works effectually; who receive it not into their heads only, but into their hearts; and having received it, hold it fast, and abide by it in the worst of times."
3. "All bring forth good fruit of the same quality, though not of the same quantity."
