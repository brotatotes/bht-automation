3. "Judas had doubtless all the appearance of a true Christian; he had the Gospel committed to him, and the knowledge of it, and gifts qualifying him to preach it, and a commission from Christ for it, yea, even a power of working miracles to confirm what he preached; and yet not having true grace, all was taken away from him, and were of no use unto him in the business of salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. He that hath â€” That improves whatever he has received, to the good of others, as well as of his own soul. Matthew 13:12; Luke 8:18.
