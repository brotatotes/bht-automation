# Mark 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The emphasis of the parable is on the seed and its power to grow, rather than the man who sows it. The aorist tense highlights the single act of casting the seed, while the present tense signifies the continuous process of sleeping and rising. This parable likens the kingdom of God to a man casting seed into the ground and trusting in the natural laws of growth. The imperceptible growth of the seed reflects the gradual increase of grace through the word. Just as the farmer rests, pious teachers should have faith and not be anxious about the growth of the kingdom.
