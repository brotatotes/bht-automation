### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "How shall we liken?" (Œ†œâœÇ ŒøŒºŒøŒπœâœÉœâŒºŒµŒΩ?) Deliberative first aorist subjunctive. This question alone in Mark.
2. "In what parable shall we set it forth?" (ŒµŒΩ œÑŒπŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒ∑ Œ∏œâŒºŒµŒΩ?) Deliberative second aorist subjunctive. The graphic question draws the interest of the hearers (we) by fine tact.
3. "Luke 13:18 retains the double question which Matthew 13:31 does not have, though he has it in a very different context, probably an illustration of Christ's favourite sayings often repeated to different audiences as is true of all teachers and preachers."

### John Gill:
1. "Still continuing his discourse on this subject, and in order to convey to the minds of his disciples clearer ideas of the Gospel dispensation, the success of the Gospel, and the usefulness of their ministration of it, for their encouragement, how unpromising soever things might then be."
2. "It was usual with the Jewish doctors, when about to illustrate anything in a parabolical way to begin with such like questions; as, ◊ú◊û◊î ◊î◊ì◊ë◊® ◊ì◊ï◊û◊î, 'to what is this thing like'?"
3. "When the answer is to such or such thing, as here."
