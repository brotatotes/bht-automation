# Mark 4:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without any preparation, Jesus remained in the boat as they set off, with other boats accompanying them. They took Jesus as he was, without any previous arrangements. These other boats were likely filled with people who wanted to be close to Jesus. As they journeyed across the lake, Jesus laid himself at the stern, his head resting on a pillow. It seems that these other boats were meant to witness the miracle that would happen later on.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Without any preparation, Jesus was taken as he was, without so much as leaving the boat where he had been teaching all day. Other boats accompanied him, most likely with passengers wanting to be close to him. They did not send the other boats away, but left them, setting off at once. These other boats would later be separated from them during the subsequent gale. It is worth noting that Mark is the only gospel that mentions these additional boats, which were ordered in providence to witness the miraculous events that would unfold later.
