# Mark 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some individuals who heard the word of God had hearts that were like thorny ground; when the word was preached to them, it did not take root. These people made a quick and superficial profession of faith without truly experiencing the transformative power of the word. If their hearts had been deeper, the word would have had more time to do its work and they would have had a more substantial and genuine profession of faith.
