# Mark 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seed in this scenario yielded no fruit because thorns existed in the ground, drawing away the soil's richness and moisture. These thorns effectively choked and compressed the seed, preventing it from taking root. This outcome is specific to Mark's account, indicating that it is not a condensed version. The prevailing thorns rendered the word ineffective and unsuccessful, failing to produce faith, grace, or good works. In essence, the word was unable to overcome and eliminate these hindrances, resulting in a fruitless outcome.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. In ver. 7 St. Mark adds and it yielded no fruit,

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This case is [like] ground not thoroughly cleaned... which, rising above the good seed, 'choke' or 'smother' it, excluding light and air, and drawing away the moisture and richness of the soil." 
2. "[The thorns] exist in [the soil] of what draws all the moisture and richness of the soil away to itself, and so starves the plant."
3. "The evil here is neither a hard nor a shallow soil‚Äîthere is softness enough, and depth enough; but it is the existence in it of what draws all the moisture and richness of the soil away to itself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Choked [œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÄŒΩŒπŒæŒ±ŒΩ] . The preposition, sun = com (together), carries the idea of com - pression. It yielded no fruit. Added by Mark.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "And it yielded no fruit."
2. "This Mark adds, showing that his account is not an abridgment."
3. "The same result is of course implied in the other narrative."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Choked (œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÄŒΩŒπŒæŒ±ŒΩ). Œ†ŒΩŒπŒ≥œâ means to strangle, throttle."
2. "Mark has the compounded form with œÉœÖŒΩ-, squeezed together."
3. "Yielded no fruit (Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄŒøŒΩ ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµŒ¥œâŒ∫Œ±ŒΩ). In Mark alone. Barren in results."

### John Gill:
1. "The word did not take place so as to beat down, overcome, and root out these things, nor even to weaken, and keep under, and prevent the influence of them."
2. "These got the ascendant of the word, and prevailed over it, and made it altogether useless and unsuccessful."
3. "It was not the means of grace; faith did not come by it, nor any other grace; nor did it produce good works in the life and conversation."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Mark 4:7, it is said that the seed yielded no fruit, and this is likened to ground where thorns exist and choke the good seed. These thorns draw away moisture and richness, starving the plant. The evil here is not a hard or shallow soil, but the existence of what draws all the soil's nutrients away. The compound form of choked implies compression and strangling. This result is unique to Mark's account and shows that it is not an abridgment, as it implies the same outcome as the other narratives. Overall, the word did not overcome or weaken these thorns, nor did it produce any desired results of faith, other graces, or good works.
