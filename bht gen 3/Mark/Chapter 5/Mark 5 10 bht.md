# Mark 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fervent entreaty of the spirits in this account not to be sent away from the country exposed their malicious intentions towards humanity. Their request to remain in that region, perhaps due to its lawless nature or a desire to stay with the possessed man, highlighted their hold over him. Christ's authority over the demons was evident in His ability to command their movements and restrict them from uninhabited places. They were compelled to obey, unable to go anywhere without His permission and restrained by His divine power.
