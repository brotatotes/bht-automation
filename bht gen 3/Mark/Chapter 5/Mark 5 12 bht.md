## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If we must quit our hold of this man, suffer us to continue our work of mischief in another form, that by entering these swine, and thus destroying the people's property, we may steel their hearts against Thee!"
2. "Had they spoken out all their mind, perhaps this would have been it..."
3. "Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."

### John Gill:
1. "They chose to be any where, rather than depart the country; and especially than to be sent into the deep, the abyss, or bottomless pit."
2. "The devils are unwearied in doing mischief, they cannot rest unless they are about it."
3. "If they are not suffered to touch the lives of men, or ruin their souls, it is some satisfaction to them to be suffered to hurt their bodies; and if that is no longer permitted, rather than be doing nothing, they are desirous of doing injury to irrational creatures, the property of men."
