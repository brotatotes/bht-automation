## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though there be no discrepancy between these two statementsâ€”more than between two witnesses, one of whom testifies to something done by one person, while the other affirms that there were twoâ€”it is difficult to see how the principal details here given could apply to more than one case."
