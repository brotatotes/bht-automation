## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "Emblem of our natural state as fallen creatures, and illustrating the worse than vanity of all human remedies for spiritual maladies."
2. "The higher design of all our Lord's miracles of healing irresistibly suggests this way of viewing the present case."
3. "The propriety of [viewing the case from this perspective] will still more appear as we proceed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mark is much fuller and more vivid than Matthew or Luke."
2. "Had suffered [Ï€Î±Î¸Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ±] . To be taken, as everywhere in the New Testament, in the sense of suffering pain, not merely subjected to treatment."
3. "And was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lordâ€™s conduct was a protest against both these. Just in proportion as His influence permeates society, is woman not only elevated, but tenderly dealt with..." (36 words)
2. "All, physicians included, may learn a lesson here in the treatment of invalids of the female sex." (18 words)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A pathetic picture of a woman with a chronic case who had tried doctor after doctor."
2. "The tragedy of it was that she 'was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse.'"
3. "Her money was gone, her disease was gaining on her, her one chance came now with Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "She took many a nauseous medicine, and had gone through courses of physic with different physicians; for there were many among the Jews that pretended to the cure of fluxes."
2. "This is often the case of persons who are, in some measure, sensible of the disease of sin, but are ignorant of the proper methods to be taken for the cure of it. They apply to their own works of righteousness, moral and civil, to the duties of religion, private and public, to a legal repentance, external humiliation and tears, and an outward reformation of life."
3. "For such a course of action, such conduct and methods as these bring them into a spirit of bondage; for when they fail in their duties, do not come up to the rules prescribed them, what terror of mind possesses them!"
