# Mark 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This woman had heard of Jesus, of His marvellous cures, and her bitter experience with other remedies had kindled a firm confidence in her soul. She came to Jesus, knowing that even touching the hem of His garment could set her free from her defiling disease, for this wondrous Healer must be above such laws. Like this woman, we too can approach Jesus, having heard of His ability to save the worst of sinners, and by faith, even a weak and trembling touch, find righteousness and strength that could not be attained through our own works.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What had she 'heard of Jesus?' No doubt it was His marvellous cures she had heard of; and the hearing of these, in connection with her bitter experience of the vanity of applying to any other, had been blessed to the kindling in her soul of a firm confidence that He who had so willingly wrought such cures on others was able and would not refuse to heal her also."
2. "According to the ceremonial law, the touch of anyone having the disease which this woman had would have defiled the person touched. Some think that the recollection of this may account for her stealthily approaching Him in the crowd behind, and touching but the hem of His garment."
3. "But there was an instinct in the faith which brought her to Jesus, which taught her, that if that touch could set her free from the defiling disease itself, it was impossible to communicate defilement to Him, and that this wondrous Healer must be above such laws."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She came because she had heard."
2. "She had heard of His doings, as well as His name."
3. "His garment."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the sinner's last shift; he tries everyone first before he comes to him; he spends all his money, strength, and time, with others, to no purpose; and finding them all to be useless and unserviceable, he applies to him, who is the only physician that can give relief in this case."
2. "Like this woman, having heard of his ability to save to the uttermost those that come to him; and being encouraged by the many cures of the worst of sinners, of such who were in the most desperate condition, presses in the throng, through a great many temptations, difficulties, and discouragements thrown in the way by Satan, and its own evil heart of unbelief."
3. "Though I am such a vile, sinful, unrighteous, and impotent creature, yet surely in the Lord there is righteousness and strength, if I can but by faith lay hold thereon; though it be but in a weak way, only by a touch, and in a trembling manner; I shall be justified from all things, I could not be justified by all the works of righteousness I have been doing, and that evidentially and comfortably."
