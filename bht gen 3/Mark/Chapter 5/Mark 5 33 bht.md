## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "alarmed, as a humble,
	shrinking female would naturally be, at the necessity of so public an
	exposure of herself, yet conscious that she had a tale to tell which
	would speak for her." 
2. "When the woman saw that she was not hid, she
	came trembling, and falling down before Him, she declared unto Him
	before all the people for what cause she had touched Him, and how she
	was healed immediately."
3. "This, though it tried the modesty of
	the believing woman, was just what Christ wanted in dragging her
	forth, her public testimony to the facts of her caseâ€”the disease,
	with her abortive efforts at a cure, and the instantaneous and
	perfect relief which her touching the Great Healer had brought her."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her experience in the past well accounts for her conduct; rough physicians, painful treatment, loss of means, constant diminution of health, the nature of her disease, all led to the secret mode she adopted, and this was in keeping with that."
2. "Told him all the truth, and that too 'before all the people' (Luke 8:47). Her faith is brought out and triumphs thus over her timidity."
3. "To this day, physicians complain of want of candor in female patients, or at least of a failure to accurately state their symptoms, etc. So that the naturalness of the picture is remarkable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These participles vividly portray this woman who had tried to hide in the crowd."
2. "She had to come and confess, for something 'has happened' (Î³ÎµÎ³Î¿Î½ÎµÎ½, second perfect active indicative, still true) to her."
3. "She told 'the pitiful tale of chronic misery' (Bruce)."

### John Gill:
1. "After conversion, after souls have laid hold on Christ for righteousness and life; after they have had the pardon of their sins, and are cured of their diseases, they are not without their fears and tremblings, though there is no just reason for them."
2. "They fear where no fear is; that is, where there is no true cause of fear; which was this woman's ease: they are sometimes afraid they have no interest in Christ, and in his love; that they are hypocrites; that the truth of grace is not in them; that they shall never hold out to the end; that they shall perish, and come short of eternal glory, notwithstanding they know, as this woman did, what has been done in them, and done for them."
3. "The secret experiences of grace in our souls we should not be ashamed to relate to others; this makes for the glory of divine grace, and the good of others."
