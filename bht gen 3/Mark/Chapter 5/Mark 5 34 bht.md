# Mark 5:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus spoke the words, Daughter, be of good comfort. Thy faith hath made thee whole... go in peace, it was a solemn ratification of the healing the woman had obtained surreptitiously. In addition to physical healing, she found sympathy, healing, and pardon for her sins. The peace Jesus spoke of may have more the idea of the Hebrew shalom, health of body and soul. This woman's faith had saved her from her bodily disease and sins, granting her true spiritual peace.

### John Gill:
1. "She was one of those that were predestinated to the adoption of children, and were given to Christ as such; and who are evidentially the children of God by faith in him: and to have a testimony of adoption from the Spirit of God, and from the mouth of Christ himself, as this woman had; how great a blessing is it!"
2. "In the Greek text it is, 'thy faith hath saved thee'; both from her bodily disease, and from her sins: not that there is such an intrinsic virtue in faith as to deliver from either; for certain it is, that it was not virtue that went out of her faith, but virtue which went out from Christ, that cured her of her issue; though faith was the means of drawing it out; or it was that, through which, virtue from Christ exerted itself, and produced such an effect."
3. "Peace is the effect of faith in Christ, of pardon through his blood, and salvation in him; true, spiritual, solid peace is enjoyed in a way of believing; it is the fruit of a view of interest in justification by faith in Christ's righteousness; and nothing more effectually produces and secures it than a sense of all spiritual diseases being healed, or an application of pardoning grace and mercy, through the blood of Christ; which itself speaks better things than that of Abel, even pardon, and so peace."
