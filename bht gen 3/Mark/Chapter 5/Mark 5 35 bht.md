1. 35. Thy daughter is dead; why
	troublest thou the Master any further?â€”the Teacher.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From his house; for the ruler himself is addressed."
2. "Troublest. See on Matthew 9:36. Compare Luke 11:22, where occurs the cognate word skula, spoils, things torn or stripped from an enemy."
3. "Wyc., travailest. Tynd., diseasest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Why troublest thou the master (Greek: â€˜teacherâ€™) any further? The underlying thought is: the case is now beyond the help of Jesus, who might have cured, but cannot raise her."
2. "The language is kind, and indicates faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "While he yet spake (Î•Ï„ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï… Î»Î±Î»Î¿Ï…Î½Ï„Î¿Ï‚). Genitive absolute. Another vivid touch in Mark and Luke 8:49."
2. "The arrival of the messengers from Jairus was opportune for the woman just healed of the issue of blood (ÎµÎ½ Ï…ÏƒÎµ Î±Î¹Î¼Î±Ï„Î¿Ï‚) for it diverted attention from her."
3. "There was no further use in troubling the Teacher about the girl."

### John Gill:
1. "The above things to the poor woman, in commendation of her faith, and for her future encouragement, peace, and comfort in soul and body."
2. "These brought him the account that his daughter was actually dead, which he himself feared before; and therefore they thought it was in vain to give Christ any further trouble to drag along through a crowd of people pressing him."
3. "Whom they looked upon as a very worthy person, an eminent doctor and prophet, a master in Israel, and one that had done great cures on living persons in distress; yet imagined it was wholly out of his power to raise one from the dead."
