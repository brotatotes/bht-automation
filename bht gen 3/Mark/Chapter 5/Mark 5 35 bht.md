The people felt that it was all over for the girl, so there was no further use in troubling the Teacher. The language used here is kind, indicating faith, but it also suggests that the case is beyond the help of Jesus to cure and raise her from death. However, these words were spoken to the poor woman, in commendation of her faith and for her future encouragement, peace, and comfort in soul and body.
