# Mark 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus allowed only Peter, James, and John to accompany Him, excluding the other disciples, perhaps due to limited space in the house.

While Matthew does not mention this detail, it was important for Mark to highlight. James, recently martyred, holds a notable position in Mark's writing.
