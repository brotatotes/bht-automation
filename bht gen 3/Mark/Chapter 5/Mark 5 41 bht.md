## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The accuracy of St. Mark‚Äôs reports...often gives occasion to the insertion of the actual Syriac and Aramaic words spoken by the Lord." (Mark 5:41)
2. "Talitha, in the ordinary dialect of the people, is a word of endearment addressed to a young maiden. So that the words are equivalent to Rise, my child." (Mark 5:41)
3. "For she was of the age of twelve years is added, as Bengel, to show that she 'returned to the state of body congruous to her age.'" (Mark 5:41)

3. "See Mark 7:34; Mark 14:36."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Maid (korasion). Not a classical word, but used also by Matthew.


### John Calvin:
1. "Though naturally this cry was of no avail for recalling the senses of the deceased young woman, yet Christ intended to give a magnificent display of the power of his voice, that he might more fully accustom men to listen to his doctrine."
2. "It is easy to learn from this the great efficacy of the voice of Christ, which reaches even to the dead, and exerts a quickening influence on death itself."
3. "Accordingly, Luke says that her spirit returned, or, in other words, that immediately on being called, it obeyed the command of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The addition of an interpretation shows that he wrote for other than Jewish readers, but the insertion of the very words is a mark of accuracy, and of the strong impression made upon the eye-witness."
2. "'Damsel' is a word of endearment, as if it were: 'Rise, my child,' and 'Talitha' has precisely that sense."
3. "'I say to thee,' is inserted so that the meaning shall be as plain as possible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Talitha cumi. These precious Aramaic words, spoken by Jesus to the child, Peter heard and remembered so that Mark gives them to us."
2. "Mark interprets the simple words into Greek for those who did not know Aramaic (œÑŒø Œ∫ŒøœÅŒ±œÉŒπŒøŒΩ, ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπœÅŒµ), that is, Damsel, arise."
3. "All three Gospels mention the fact that Jesus took her by the hand, a touch of life (Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒ∑œÉŒ±œÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÇ), giving confidence and help."

### John Gill:
1. "Talitha Cumi. The Ethiopic version reads it, 'Tabitha Cumi'; and so do some Greek copies, and Latin versions, taking it to be the same word as in Acts 9:36 whereas that signifies 'Dorcas, a roe'; but this word is of another signification, as here explained, which is, being interpreted, damsel (I say unto thee) arise."
2. "The phrase, 'I say unto thee', is no part of the interpretation of the above Syriac words; but is added, by the evangelist, as being what was expressed by Christ at the same time, signifying his authority and power over death."
3. "'Tali', signifies a 'boy', and 'Talitha', a 'girl'; and so they are often used in the Targums, and in the Talmud: the one is used for a boy of seventeen years of age, and the other for a girl of sixteen or seventeen years of age; so that this child might well be called by this name, since she was but twelve years of age."
