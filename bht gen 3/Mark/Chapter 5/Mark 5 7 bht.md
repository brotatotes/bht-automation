## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  7.] I adjure thee by God; ‚ÄúI beseech thee‚Äù Luke.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not." 
2. "Behold the tormentor anticipating, dreading, and entreating exemption from torment!" 
3. "In Christ they discern their destined Tormentor; the time, they know, is fixed, and they feel as if it were come already!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Crying - he saith. The inarticulate cry (verse 5), and then the articulate speech."
2. "What have I to do with thee? [œÑŒπ ŒµŒºŒøŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÉŒøŒπ; ] . Lit., what is there to me and thee? What have we in common?"
3. "I adjure thee by God. Stronger than Luke's I pray thee. The verb oJrkizw, I adjure, is condemned by the grammarians as inelegant."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peculiar to Mark is the strong expression: I adjure thee by God."
2. "The language of the demon, not of the man; not a mere blasphemy, but a plausible argument."
3. "The highest acknowledgment comes from the most virulent demon."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I adjure thee by God (ŒøœÅŒ∫ŒπŒ∂œâ œÉŒµ œÑŒøŒΩ Œ∏ŒµŒøŒΩ). The demoniac puts Jesus on oath (two accusatives) after the startled outcry just like the one in Mark 1:24, which see."
2. "He calls Jesus here 'son of the Most High God' (œÖŒπŒµ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖ œÖœàŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ) as in Luke 8:28 (cf. Genesis 14:18)."
3. "Torment me not (ŒºŒ∑ ŒºŒµ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒ∑ŒπœÇ). Prohibition with ŒºŒ∑ and the ingressive aorist subjunctive. The word means to test metals and then to test one by torture (cf. our 'third degree'). Same word in all three Gospels."

### John Gill:
1. "Devils believe there is one God, and tremble at him; and they confess that Jesus of Nazareth, who was born of the virgin, according to the human nature, is the Son of God, according to his divine nature."
2. "Truly they choose not to have anything to do with God himself; they have cast off allegiance to him, and rebelled against him; and have left their estate, and departed from him; and still less do they care to have anything to do with his Son."
3. "Men may know much of Christ notionally; may know, and confess him to be God, to be the Son of God, in the highest and true sense of the phrase; to be the Messiah, to have been incarnate, to have suffered, died, and risen again; to be ascended to heaven, from whence he will come again; and yet have no more to do with him, or have no more interest in him, than the devils themselves."
