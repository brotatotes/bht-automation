- Attempt 1 BHT: When Jesus confronted the demonic possessed man in Mark 5:8, the demons within him pleaded with Jesus not to torment them. This plea must have confused those present, as they witnessed Jesus commanding the demons to come out of the man. However, the delay in the demon's obedience served a purpose, allowing Jesus to display His power and accomplish His purposes. Through the imperfect form of the verb, the simultaneousness of Christ's exorcism, the outbreak of demoniac malice, and the cry of the tormented man is emphasized.
