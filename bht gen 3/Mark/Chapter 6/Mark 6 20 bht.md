# Mark 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Recognizing John's righteousness, Herod kept him safe from Herodias, yet his actions did not reflect genuine, saving grace. Herod's visits to John in prison provided a brief respite for his troubled conscience, but they did not result in true repentance. He remained torn between his fear of John and his attachment to Herodias, ultimately lacking a transformed heart. While Herod's external acts appeared virtuous, they fell short of the inner change that comes from embracing God's grace.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Herod, though filled with fear of John, had a strange fascination for him, having a sense of the righteousness and holiness in John. Mark paints a picture of a conflicted man, vacillating between his fear of John and his attachment to Herodias. These occasional visits to John in prison served to refresh Herod's mind, but it became a temporary reprieve from the turmoil of his conscience.
