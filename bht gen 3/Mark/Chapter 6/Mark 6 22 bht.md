## BHT:
When Herodias' own daughter came in and danced, she pleased not only Herod but also everyone else sitting with them. Herod, in his excitement, made a reckless promise to the girl, saying she could ask for anything and he would give it to her.

The fact that Herod was so pleased by this act of degradation shows how easily he was led into committing a crime he did not wish to commit.
