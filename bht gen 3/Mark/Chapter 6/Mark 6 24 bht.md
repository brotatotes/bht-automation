# Mark 6:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The abandoned and shameless Herodias saw an opportunity to rid herself of John the Baptist, whose fidelity had marred her pleasures. Her daughter, unprepared for her mother's ghastly response, went to Herod and asked for the head of John. This incident reveals the wretched anxiety of a bad conscience and the power of the word of God, which even in prison tortures the king's wife. Herodias, driven by the sweetness of revenge, valued having her will on the great and good man more than having half the king's dominions.
