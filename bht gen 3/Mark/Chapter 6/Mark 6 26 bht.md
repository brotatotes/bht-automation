## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "With his feelings regarding John, and the truths which so told upon his conscience from that preacher's lips, and after so often and carefully saving him from his paramour's rage, it must have been very galling to find himself at length entrapped by his own rash folly."
2. "See how men of no principle, but troublesome conscience, will stick at breaking a rash oath, while yielding to the commission of the worst crimes!"
3. "Under the influence of that false shame, which could not brook being thought to be troubled with religious or moral scruples. To how many has this proved a fatal snare!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Exceeding sorry. Where Matthew has sorry.


### John Calvin:
1. "And yet he has not the courage to give a refusal to a dancing girl, lest he should incur the reproach of unsteadiness; as if it were more dishonorable to retract a rash and foolish promise than to persist in a heinous crime."
2. "No inward feelings of religion constrained Herod to do this, but the mere love of power drove him headlong; for he reckoned that he would sink in the estimation of those who were present, if he did not fulfill his engagement."
3. "Hence it follows, that monastic vows, which are attended by open impiety, do not bind the conscience any more than the enchantments of magicians; for it is not the will of God that his sacred name shall give support to what is sinful."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 6:26. Exceeding sorry. Markâ€™s language is stronger than that of Matthew.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  He would not reject her (Î¿Ï…Îº Î·Î¸ÎµÎ»Î·ÏƒÎµÎ½ Î±Î¸ÎµÏ„Î·ÏƒÎ± Î±Ï…Ï„Î·Î½). He was caught once again between his conscience and his environment. Like many since his day the environment stifled his conscience. 


### John Gill:
1. "And the king was exceeding sorry..."
