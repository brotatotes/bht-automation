## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If these disciples had, up to this time, stood apart from Him, as adherents of John (Matthew 14:12- :), perhaps they now came to Jesus, not without some secret reflection on Him for His seeming neglect of their master; but perhaps, too, as orphans, to cast in their lot henceforth with the Lord's disciples."
2. "But He of whom it was said, as He stood by the grave of His friend Lazarus, 'Jesus wept,' was not likely to receive such intelligence without deep emotion."
3. "And one reason why He might not be unwilling that a small body of John's disciples should cling to him to the last, might be to provide some attached friends who should do for his precious body, on a small scale, what was afterwards to be done for His own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This man, whose inner life was burnt out; who was made up of contradictions, speaking of his kingdom like Ahasuerus, and yet the slave of his Jezebel..." 
2. "Willingly hearing the prophet, and unwillingly killing him..."
3. "Who will be a Sadducee, and yet thinks of a resurrection; who has a superstitious fear of the Lord Jesus, and yet a curiosity to see him."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was, to leave the corpse of the holy man unburied; for there is reason to believe that, when his disciples performed this duty, the attendants of the tyrant had thrown out the corpse."
2. "Though the honor of burial is of no importance to the dead, yet it is the will of the Lord that we should observe this ceremony as a token of the last resurrection."
3. "This confession was therefore worthy of praise, more especially as it was not without danger; for they could not do honor to a man who had been put to death by the executioner without exciting against themselves the rage of the tyrant."

### Philip Schaff:
