# Mark 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, the carpenter, performed ordinary carpentry work making plows and yokes among men. His lack of ability to perform miracles was not because He was powerless, but because of the people's faithlessness. He often required faith from recipients, and without it, help could not be given. The fact that Jesus was rejected even by His own brothers, who disbelieved His Messianic claims, is a sad reality. This highlights the significance of His humble life as a carpenter, setting an example of industry and diligence.
