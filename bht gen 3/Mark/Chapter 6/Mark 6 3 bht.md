# Mark 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, during his time among men, worked as a carpenter, handling ordinary tasks such as ploughs and yokes. The people of Nazareth took offense at the mere notion that Jesus, who had grown up amongst them, could make claims of being the Messiah. Their lack of faith hindered Jesus from performing many miracles among them, for he often required faith from those he sought to help. It was saddening that even his own family disbelieved his Messianic claims, adding to the stumbling block for the Nazarenes.

1. "For He wrought, while among men, the ordinary works of a carpenter, to wit, ploughs and yokes."
2. "The want of ability spoken of is not absolute, but relative: 'not because He was powerless, but because they were faithless.'"
3. "In most cases of human infirmity, it was our Lord‚Äôs practice to require faith in the recipient of aid: and that being wanting, the help could not be given."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This word 'throws the only flash which falls on the continuous tenor of the first thirty years, from infancy to manhood, of the life of Christ." (Farrar, "Messages of the Books")
2. "They were offended." (See On Matthew 5:29)

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Such may Christ be reasonably thought to be, since his father was; and which business he might follow, partly through the meanness and poverty of his parents; and partly that he might set an example of industry and diligence; and chiefly to bear that part of the first Adam's curse, which was to eat his bread with the sweat of his brow."
2. "The Jews ought not to have flouted Christ with this trade of a carpenter, since, according to them, it was necessary that a carpenter, in some cases, should be a regular priest; as in repairing of the temple, especially the holy of holies."
3. "Or they were offended at the meanness of his extraction and descent, his father, and mother, and brethren, and sisters, being all persons in low circumstances of life; whereas they expected the Messiah would be born and brought up as a temporal prince, in great grandeur and splendour."

### John Wesley:
1. Is not this the carpenter? ‚Äî There can be no doubt, but in his youth he wrought with his supposed father Joseph.
