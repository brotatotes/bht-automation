Among his own kindred, Jesus was not received with the respect and honor due to a prophet. These reflections of envy and objection, coming from His distant relatives, reveal the challenge Jesus faced in His own country and amongst His own kin. Despite His wisdom and divine purpose, His rise from what was considered a lowly branch of the family caused them to overlook His true stature. As the saying goes, a prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
