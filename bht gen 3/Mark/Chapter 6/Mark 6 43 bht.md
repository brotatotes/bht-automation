### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The first three Evangelists wrote independently of each other, with the fourth likely having seen all the others. They all use the same word to describe the baskets used, even referencing their specific type known as cophinus. In both the narratives of the feeding of the Four Thousand, the baskets used are called spuris. Mark adds that the baskets were not only filled with fragments of bread but also with the fishes. The accounts of this miracle vary in their descriptions of what was gathered by the disciples, with no two accounts precisely alike. However, it is likely that what remained of the fishes was included in the contents of the twelve baskets. Ultimately, through the powerful multiplication of Christ, there was enough for everyone to be satisfied with an abundance of fragments.
