## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Of these, however, there would probably not be many; as only the males were obliged to go to the approaching festival."
2. "When Jesus therefore perceived that they would take Him by force, to make Him a king, He departed again into a mountain Himself alone."
3. "One very important particular given by John alone (John 6:15) introduces this portion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Men [Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµœÇ] . Not generic, including men and women, but literally men. Compare Matthew 14:21, beside women and children; a detail which we should have expected from Mark.


### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 6:44. Five thousand men. Mark, usually so exact, does not speak of the ‚Äòwomen and children‚Äô (Matthew). An evidence of independence.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This remarkable miracle is recorded by all Four Gospels, a nature miracle that only God can work."
2. "No talk about accelerating natural processes will explain this miracle."
3. "The evidence is overwhelming."

### John Gill:
1. "And they that did eat of the loaves... were about five thousand men." 
2. "The word 'about' is  omitted in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Persic and Ethiopic versions, reading five thousand men certain." 
3. "The Evangelist Matthew adds, 'beside children and women.'"
