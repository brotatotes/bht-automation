The disciples embarked on their journey, but to their distress, a strong wind caused the seas to rise. As they struggled, Jesus had come down from the mountain where he had prayed to the Father. In the darkness, Jesus had not yet joined them, leaving the disciples feeling hopeless in the midst of their turbulent voyage. This created the perfect scenario for the incredible miracle that was about to unfold: Jesus walking on water to reach his disciples in their time of need.
