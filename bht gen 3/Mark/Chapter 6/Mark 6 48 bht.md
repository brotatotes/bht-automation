Amidst the disciples' toiling and exhaustion, they saw Jesus walking on the sea. Initially, it seemed as if He intended to pass by them silently, causing them to cry out in fear. However, Jesus had observed their struggle from a distance and understood their distress. He purposely allowed them to reach the point of exhaustion and despair before coming to their aid. Though it may have appeared that Jesus was going to pass them by, He was actually showing them that they no longer needed to strive on their own.
