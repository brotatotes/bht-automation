### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The sick [Œ±œÅœÅœâœÉœÑŒøŒπœÇ], those with constitutional weakness, were unable to receive healing in that place. Though Jesus had the power to perform miracles, he chose not to in this case, as it went against his purpose. It was the unbelieving who did not provide him with the opportunity to save them, as His miracles required both an opportunity and a sufficient moral purpose. Working miracles in that place was not fitting or proper, and it would not have served His ultimate goal. He performed miracles in other places to demonstrate His power and the benefits that could have been enjoyed if only they had believed. By not performing miracles there, Jesus left them without excuse and did not increase their damnation by providing more evidence.
