# Mark 6:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, initially filled with fear, now eagerly receive Jesus, and their fears are replaced with awe and delight.

This overwhelming reaction is unique to Mark, who vividly portrays the disciples' intense excitement through the use of the imperfect tense.
