# Mark 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' surprise at the lack of faith from his own countrymen reflects the duality of his nature. As both fully human and divine, he had divine knowledge yet experienced human limitations, leading him to genuinely marvel at their unbelief. In contrast, he had previously marveled at the unexpected faith of a Roman centurion. This rejection in Nazareth marked the beginning of his journey through Galilee, where he tirelessly taught the people about the kingdom of God, despite encountering disbelief. Even Jesus' mother, Mary, never wavered in her faith in her extraordinary Son.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Marvelledâ€”this need not surprise us, nor be construed otherwise than as a literal description of the Lordâ€™s mind."
2. "In the mystery of his humanity...so He might wonder at the unbelief of His countrymen."
3. "And he went round... see Matt. ix. 35."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He marvelled because of their unbelief. To be taken literally. On another occasion our Lord 'marvelled' (Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:9) at the great faith of a heathen centurion. Both instances indicate the great importance of faith."
2. "The unbelief of Nazareth did not stop our Lord's activity. This circuit was closely connected with the sending forth of the Twelve (Mark 6:7); hence it seems to be identical with that mentioned in Matthew 9:35, if we refer the latter to a distinct journey."
3. "It would be the third circuit through Galilee, which began with this rejection at Nazareth and continued until the return of the Apostles, when they all withdrew (Mark 6:30)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus had divine knowledge and accurate insight into the human heart, but he had human limitations in certain things that are not clear to us."
2. "He marvelled at the faith of the Roman centurion where one would not expect faith. Here he marvels at the lack of faith where he had a right to expect it."
3. "One may excuse Mary, the mother of Jesus, from this unbelief, puzzled, as she probably was, by his recent conduct. There is no proof that she ever lost faith in her wonderful Son."

### John Gill:
1. "It was a surprise to Christ, as man, that his countrymen should not believe in him, but reject him as the Messiah."
2. "The proofs of Christ's deity and Messiahship are so plain and incontestable, that it is amazing that there should be any, who have read them or heard of them, that should be deists, or continue unbelievers."
3. "He took a circuit throughout all the little towns and villages round about Nazareth, instructing the ignorant country people, in the things concerning the kingdom of God."

### John Wesley:
1. He marvelled â€” As man. As he was God, nothing was strange to him.
