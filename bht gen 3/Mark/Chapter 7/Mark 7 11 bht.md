3. "this was not the form of an oath, or swearing by Corban, or the sacred treasury in the temple, mentioned in Matthew 27:6, of which I do not remember any instance; nor was it a dedication of his substance to holy and religious uses; to the service of God and the temple; but it was a vow he made, that what he had, should be as Corban, as a gift devoted to sacred uses"

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When Jesus speaks about the issue of Corban in Mark 7:11, he is addressing a practice among the religious leaders where they allowed someone to use the word Corban as a means of avoiding the responsibility of supporting their parents. This word symbolized a gift to God, but in this context, it permitted individuals to withhold resources from their parents. This was a deceptive tactic that the Pharisees justified, claiming that the person's possessions were now dedicated to God and therefore couldn't be used for the support of their parents. Jesus rebukes this practice, pointing out that it disregards the commandment to honor one's parents and undermines the intention of providing for family members in need.
