# Mark 7:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus exposes a teaching that allowed people to neglect their parents. The Pharisees' emphasis on keeping vows meant that individuals were obligated to prioritize fulfilling their vows over caring for their parents, even if the parents were poor or helpless. This clash between human traditions and God's commandments is evident, as the Pharisees insisted on the observance of vows, even when it went against the command to honor and care for one's parents unless a wise authority intervened to dissolve the vow.
