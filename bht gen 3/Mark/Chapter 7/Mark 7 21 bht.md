# Mark 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heart is the laboratory and the fountain-head of all that is good and bad in the inner life of man.

Pride, seen in a haughty and stuck-up attitude, is also among these evils. This text warns that the inward part of man is wicked and full of evil, making it impossible for anything good to naturally come out of such a heart.
