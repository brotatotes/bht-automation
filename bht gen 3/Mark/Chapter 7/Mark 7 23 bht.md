# Mark 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All these evil things come from within, from the heart, which is sadly corrupted and the fountain from whence all these impure streams flow. If all these evils come from within, then the inward part of man must be sinful and polluted, prior to the commission of these evil things. Sin in thought, word, and deed is the defiling thing that should be carefully avoided, rather than focusing on external practices like diets as long as moderation is used.
