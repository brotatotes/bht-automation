# Mark 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The idea conveyed is that the Jews were initially given the opportunity to accept or reject the Gospel before it was offered to the Gentiles. This does not mean that the Gentiles were excluded indefinitely, but rather they would be filled once the Jews had their turn. The priority was given to the Jews, but this does not negate the possibility of the Gentiles receiving the Gospel later. Ultimately, both Jews and Gentiles can partake in the blessings and nourishment of the Gospel.
