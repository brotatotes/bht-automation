2. "He uses either his own touch,â€”something from Himself,â€”or the cleansing element to which He so often compares his word." 
3. "It is remarkable that the same medium of conveying the miraculous cure is used also in ch. viii. 23."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To the impotent man He said, 'Wilt thou be made whole?' to the blind men, 'What will ye that I shall do unto you?' and 'Believe ye that I am able to do this?' But as this patient could hear nothing, our Lord substitutes symbolical actions upon each of the organs affected." 
2. "Moistening the man's parched tongue with saliva from His own mouth, as if to lubricate the organ or facilitate its free motion; thus indicating the source of the healing virtue to be His own person." 
3. "Probable to fix his undistracted attention on Himself, and by means of certain actions He was about to do, to awaken and direct his attention to the proper source of relief."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why this was done we have no means of information. It might have been to conceal from the multitude everything respecting the 'manner' of cure..."
2. "Jesus had power at once to open his ears and loose his tongue, but for some cause he chose to accompany it with a sign."
3. "This was intended, probably, simply to denote that the power of healing came from him; to satisfy the man by the touch that he had this power, and that it could come from no other quarter."

### John Calvin:

2. "Yet that he has supreme power to remove all our defects, and restore us to health, is proclaimed by him when he simply orders the tongue and ears to be opened."
3. "Among other fooleries with which baptism has been debased by foolish men, the ceremony used by our Lord is turned into a piece of buffoonery; and this instance shows us that there is no end to licentiousness, when men wantonly change at their own pleasure the mysteries of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Took him aside from the multitude apart (or, â€˜by himselfâ€™)...The design seems to have been, still to connect the miraculous effect with His own person, yet to show that He was not bound to one mode." 
2. "The peculiar manner of the miracle was not occasioned by the difficulty of the case...It is not necessary to find a symbolical meaning in each act."
3. "Probably moistening His finger with saliva, He touched his tongue. The two parts affected by disease were touched, to show that our Lord could choose His own mode."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The secrecy here observed was partly to avoid excitement and partly to get the attention of the deaf and dumb demoniac."
2. "There was, of course, no virtue in the spittle and it is not clear why Jesus used it."
3. "Whether this was a concession to the man's denseness one does not know. But it all showed the poor man that Jesus healed him in his own way."

### John Gill:
1. "These actions were not done as means of healing, or as having any natural virtue, or tendency in them, to effect a cure; but to show the power of Christ."
2. "The taking this man aside from the multitude ... [represents] the Lord's separating his people from the rest of the world, when he calls them by his grace."
3. "Christ's touching his tongue with the spittle of his mouth may lead us to observe the application of his word, through the efficacy of his grace, as a means of loosing his tongue and opening his lips to show forth his praise."

### John Wesley:
1. "We are not to prescribe to him... but to expect his blessing by whatsoever means he pleases." 
2. "Even though there should be no proportion or resemblance between the means used, and the benefit to be conveyed thereby."
