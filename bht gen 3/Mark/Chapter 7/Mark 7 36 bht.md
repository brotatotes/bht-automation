# Mark 7:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus had just performed a great miracle by healing a man possessed by demons and had commanded him to go and proclaim it to others. However, now He was in a different region, and the people could not contain their excitement about what Jesus had done. Even though Jesus charged them not to tell, they were even more determined to disobey. This human tendency to go against prohibitions was demonstrated once again, as people cannot help but speak of the incredible things they have experienced.
