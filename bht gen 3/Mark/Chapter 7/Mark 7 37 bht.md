1. "He hath done all things well (ŒöŒ±ŒªœâœÇ œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ± œÄŒµœÄŒøŒπŒ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ). The present perfect active shows the settled convictions of these people about Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of God, in opening the ears and heart of a sinner, and causing the tongue of the dumb to sing his praise, is very astonishing, to men and angels; to the persons themselves that partake of it; and to all the saints that hear of it; it is amazing that such grace should be bestowed at all; and it is more, that it should be communicated to such unworthy persons it is; as also that it should produce such effects it does; that it should make such a surprising change, and be attended with such blessed consequences."
2. "He hath done all things well; not by Beelzebub, the prince of devils, as said the Scribes and Pharisees; nor in any ostentatious manner, for the sake of the honour and applause of men, as they plainly saw; but for the good of mankind, and for the glory of God."
3. "He maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb, or those that could not speak, at least without a great deal of difficulty, to speak; an instance of both which there was in this single man's case."
