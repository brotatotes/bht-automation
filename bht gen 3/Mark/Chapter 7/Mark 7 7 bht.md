# Mark 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their worship, though attended with a great show of sanctity and religion, was a mere empty thing, devoid of life, power, and spirituality. It neither issued in the glory of God, nor brought any true pleasure or solid peace to themselves. Alas, they would find, by sad experience, that their hope of being in the favor of God, and of enjoying eternal happiness on account of it, would prove a vain hope.
