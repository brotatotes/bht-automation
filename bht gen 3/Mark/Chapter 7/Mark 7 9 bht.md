Their adherence to these traditions revealed a repugnance to wholeheartedly obey God. This ironic remark should caution against interpreting it as an endorsement of the Pharisees' perversion of God's word to preserve their own traditions.

By prioritizing their man-made traditions over God's commandments, they had perverted the true meaning of His word.
