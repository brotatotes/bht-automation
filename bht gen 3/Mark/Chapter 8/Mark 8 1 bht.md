# Mark 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In those days, a multitude gathered, and Jesus performed a nature miracle, feeding about four thousand people. The repetition of a similar miracle raises doubt among critics, but it is more plausible that both Mark and Matthew included both incidents, distinguishing the baskets used in each. Scholars speculate that the coming referred to could be a significant event like the day of Pentecost or the destruction of Jerusalem. The multitude had no provisions, and Jesus called His disciples to Him, demonstrating His power and compassion in providing for their needs.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The coming referred to was probably at the day of Pentecost, or the destruction of Jerusalem, and the consequent triumph of Christianity, as a religion distinct from Judaism."
2. "This would be not simply with power, but in power, i.e., its principal manifestation would be an exhibition of power."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The repetition of a nature miracle of feeding four thousand in Decapolis disturbs some modern critics who cannot imagine how Jesus could or would perform another miracle elsewhere so similar to the feeding of the five thousand up near Bethsaida Julias."
2. "Surely it is easier to conceive that Jesus wrought two such miracles than to hold that Mark and Matthew have made such a jumble of the whole business."
3. "Both Mark and Matthew give both miracles, distinguish the words for baskets (Œ∫ŒøœÜŒπŒΩŒøœÉ, œÉœÜœÖœÅŒπœÇ), and both make Jesus later refer to both incidents and use these two words with the same distinction."

### John Gill:
1. "The multitude being very great: for the number of men that ate, when the following miracle was wrought, were about four thousand." 
2. "Having nothing to eat; what they might have brought with them being expended, and they in a desert, where nothing was to be had, nor bought for money."
