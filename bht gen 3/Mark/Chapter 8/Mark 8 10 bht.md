# Mark 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After dismissing the multitude, Jesus immediately boarded a ship with his disciples and sailed to Dalmanutha, a village likely near Magdala on the western shore of the lake of Galilee. Mark's mention of Dalmanutha, while Matthew mentions Magadan, demonstrates the independence of Mark's account. Notably, Mark includes the detail that Jesus embarked with his disciples, a detail not explicitly mentioned in Matthew's version. The specific place names and details in this account can vary in different translations and manuscripts, leading to differences in readings.

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The theory that they were on the south-eastern shore of the lake is altogether unsupported, and makes of these journeys of our Lord an aimless wandering."

3. "See Matt. on Mark 15:39."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Both names are unknown elsewhere, but apparently the same region of Galilee on the western side of the lake not far from Tiberias."
2. "Mark here uses 'parts' (ŒºŒµœÅŒ∑) in the same sense as 'borders' (ŒøœÅŒπŒ±) in Mark 7:24 just as Matthew reverses it with 'parts' in Matthew 15:21 and 'borders' here in Matthew 15:39."
3. "Mark has here 'with his disciples' (ŒºŒµœÑŒ± œÑœâŒΩ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑœâŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ) only implied in Matthew 15:39."

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as ever he had dismissed the multitude, he took shipping with his disciples."
2. "It was a city in the coasts of Magdala, and is thought by Dr. Lightfoot to be the same with Tzalmon, or Salmon, a place often mentioned in the Jewish writings."
3. "The Arabic version reads it, 'Magdal'; and in two of Beza's copies it is read, 'Madegada'; but the Syriac version reads, 'Dalmanutha'; and the Persic, 'Dalmanuth'; and the Ethiopic, 'Dalmathy'."
