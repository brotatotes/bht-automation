## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The nine questions following each other in rapid succession (...) show how deeply He was hurt at this want of spiritual apprehension, and worse still, their low thoughts of Him, as if He would utter so solemn a warning on so petty a subject."
2. "It will be seen, however, from the very form of their conjecture, 'It is because we have no bread,' and our Lord's astonishment that they should not by that time have known better with what He took up His attention‚Äîthat He ever left the whole care for His own temporal wants to the Twelve."
3. "Who that, like angels, 'desire to look into these things' will not prize such glimpses above gold?"

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  They reasoned one with another (Œ¥ŒπŒµŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒø œÄœÅŒøœÇ Œ±ŒªŒªŒ∑ŒªŒøœÖœÇ), implying discussion. Imperfect tense, kept it up. Matthew 16:7 has ŒµŒΩ ŒµŒ±œÖœÑŒøŒπœÇ, in themselves or among themselves. 


### John Gill:
1. "And they reasoned among themselves..."
2. "Upon Christ's giving this caution..."
