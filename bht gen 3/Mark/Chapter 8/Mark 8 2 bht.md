3. "The Rev. has properly rejected it in every such case, using it only in its literal sense in the single passage, Acts 1:18."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Now three days (Œ∑Œ¥Œ∑ Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ± œÑœÅŒµŒπœÇ). This text preserves a curious parenthetic nominative of time (Robertson, Grammar, p. 460). See on Matthew 15:32.
