### John Gill:
1. "And when the seven among four thousand,.... That is, when seven loaves were broken among four thousand men." 
2. "How many baskets full of fragments took ye up? this surely you must remember, it being so recent an action, but just done, as it were."
3. "And they said, seven; for this, as yet, could not have slipped their memories; though they had been reasoning among themselves because of their straitness of provisions, as if these things had never been done."
