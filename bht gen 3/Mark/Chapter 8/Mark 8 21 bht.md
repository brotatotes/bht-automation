# Mark 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How is it that you, my disciples, do not understand? I have performed countless miracles and yet you still fail to grasp their significance. Even the different types of baskets used in the two miraculous feedings were intended to be noticed and understood. These details were meant to be observed by those who witnessed the miracles and by all who read about them. As the greatest teacher, I expected my disciples to have a deeper comprehension, but it seems that understanding requires patience and faith.
