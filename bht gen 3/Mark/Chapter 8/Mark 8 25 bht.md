## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the only recorded example of a progressive cure, and it certainly illustrates similar methods in the spiritual kingdom."
2. "Of the four recorded cases of sight restored, all the patients save one either came or were brought to the Physician."
3. "So some seek and find Christ; of others He is found who seek Him not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sinners are by nature blind... The effect of religion, or of the influence of the Holy Spirit, is to open the eyes, to show the sinner his condition and his danger, and to lead him to 'look' on him as a Saviour."
2. "When converted he is in a new world. Light is shed on every object, and he sees the Scriptures, the Saviour, and the works of creation, the sun, the stars, the hills, the vales, in a new light."
3. "Yet let him not despair. Light, in due time, will be shed on these obscure and mysterious truths. Faithful and repeated application to the Father of lights in prayer, and in searching the Scriptures, and in the ordinances of religion, will dissipate these doubts, and he will see all things clearly, and the universe will appear to be filled with one broad flood of light."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Instead of vaguely staring, he fixed his eyes on definite objects."
2. "He saw and continued to see."
3. "The farthest things were clearly seen."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The gradual cure would remove the notion of magical influence."
2. "We need not and ought not to expect Christâ€™s work of grace to be manifested in all cases through the same experience."
3. "The work of grace, though always wrought by Christ, is often a gradual process, in which other agencies are apparently involved."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He saw thoroughly now, effective aorist (Î´Î¹ÎµÎ²Î»ÎµÏˆÎµÎ½), he was completely restored (Î±Ï€ÎµÎºÎ±Ï„ÎµÏƒÏ„Î·, second aorist, double compound and double augment), and kept on seeing (ÎµÎ½ÎµÎ²Î»ÎµÏ€ÎµÎ½, imperfect, continued action) all things clearly or at a distance (Ï„Î·Î»Î±Ï…Î³Ï‰Ï‚, common Greek word from Ï„Î·Î»Îµ, afar, and Î±Ï…Î³Î·, radiance, far-shining)." 
2. "He saw thoroughly now, effective aorist (Î´Î¹ÎµÎ²Î»ÎµÏˆÎµÎ½), he was completely restored (Î±Ï€ÎµÎºÎ±Ï„ÎµÏƒÏ„Î·, second aorist, double compound and double augment)."
3. "Some manuscripts (margin in Westcott and Hort) read Î´Î·Î»Î±Ï…Î³Ï‰Ï‚, from Î´Î·Î»Î¿Ï‚, plain, and Î±Ï…Î³Î·, radiance."

### John Gill:
1. "He saw every object distinctly, and afar off, as the word used also signifies; he could distinguish men from trees, and trees from men."
2. "As at first conversion, the enlightened soul has but a very glimmering view of things, particularly of Christ, the glory and fulness of his person, the efficacy of his blood, the excellency of his righteousness, of his ability, willingness, and suitableness as a Saviour."
3. "For Gospel light at present is not perfect in any such who have the clearest views of things, have some darkness and imperfection in them; though they may be said to see all things clearly in comparison of what they sometimes did, and others do."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Mark 8:25, we see a unique example of a progressive cure, illustrating similar methods in the spiritual kingdom. Like the other recorded cases of sight being restored, the patient came to Jesus seeking healing. However, it is also noteworthy that sometimes Christ is found by those who do not actively seek Him. In this particular case, the man fixed his eyes on definite objects, seeing thoroughly and clearly, even far-off things. The use of the different tenses and forms of the Greek verbs emphasize the completeness and continuing action of the restoration. Some manuscripts even suggest that the man saw things plainly and radiantly. This gradual process of healing serves to dispel any notion of magical influence and reminds us that the work of grace often involves other agencies and is not always manifested in the same way for everyone. Ultimately, through the work of the Holy Spirit, sinners are opened to the light, enabling them to see the Scriptures, the Savior, and the beauty of creation in a new and transformative way. As we seek the Father in prayer, study the Word, and participate in the ordinances of faith, our doubts and uncertainties will be dispelled, and we will see all things clearly in the flood of light that fills the universe.
