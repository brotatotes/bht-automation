## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the only recorded example of a progressive cure, and it certainly illustrates similar methods in the spiritual kingdom."
2. "Of the four recorded cases of sight restored, all the patients save one either came or were brought to the Physician."
3. "So some seek and find Christ; of others He is found who seek Him not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sinners are by nature blind...The effect of religion, or of the influence of the Holy Spirit, is to open the eyes, to show the sinner his condition and his danger, and to lead him to 'look' on him as a Saviour." 
2. "When converted he is in a new world...He sees the beauty of the plan of salvation, and wonders that he has not seen it before."
3. "It is only by repeated applications to the Source of light that he sees all things clearly... Faithful and repeated application to the Father of lights in prayer, and in searching the Scriptures, and in the ordinances of religion, will dissipate these doubts, and he will see all things clearly."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Made him look up. The best texts omit, and substitute die bleyen, he looked stedfastly. See on Matthew 7:5. Instead of vaguely staring, he fixed his eyes on definite objects." 
2. "He saw [ÎµÎ½ÎµÎ²Î»ÎµÏ€ÎµÎ½] . Imperfect tense. Continuous action. He saw and continued to see. Compare the aorist tense above: He looked stedfastly, fastened his eyes, denoting the single act, the first exercise of his restored sight." 
3. "Clearly [Ï„Î·Î»Î±Ï…Î³Ï‰Ï‚] . From thle, far, aujgh, shining. The farthest things were clearly seen."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The gradual cure would remove the notion of magical influence."
2. "We need not and ought not to expect Christâ€™s work of grace to be manifested in all cases through the same experience."
3. "The work of grace, though always wrought by Christ, is often a gradual process, in which other agencies are apparently involved."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He saw thoroughly now, effective aorist, he was completely restored, and kept on seeing all things clearly or at a distance."
2. "Î´Î·Î»Î±Ï…Î³Ï‰Ï‚, from Î´Î·Î»Î¿Ï‚, plain, and Î±Ï…Î³Î·, radiance."
3. "Some manuscripts (margin in Westcott and Hort) read Î´Î·Î»Î±Ï…Î³Ï‰Ï‚, from Î´Î·Î»Î¿Ï‚, plain, and Î±Ï…Î³Î·, radiance."

### John Gill:
1. "He saw every object distinctly, and afar off, as the word used also signifies; he could distinguish men from trees, and trees from men."
2. "This man, upon his first reception of sight, had a very dim, obscure, and imperfect view of things; could not well distinguish one thing from another, though he saw."
3. "For Gospel light at present is not perfect in any such who have the clearest views of things, have some darkness and imperfection in them; though they may be said to see all things clearly in comparison of what they sometimes did, and others do."
