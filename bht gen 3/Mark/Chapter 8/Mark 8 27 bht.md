# Mark 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus and his disciples ventured to the region of Mount Hermon in Iturea, ruled by Herod Philip, granting Jesus safety and uninterrupted teaching. Positioned on the mountain slope, Jesus took advantage of this setting to provide his disciples with vital instruction on his forthcoming crucifixion. This was a pivotal moment for the disciples to reveal how much they had absorbed from their surroundings, as well as Jesus's direct teachings. Before this, Jesus took time alone to pray, setting the stage for the profound revelation that was to follow.
