## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. He saith [ŒµœÄŒ∑œÅœâœÑŒ±] . More correctly, he questioned or asked. So Rev. Mark omits the commendation of Peter. See Introduction. 
On verses 31 - 33, compare notes on Matthew 16:21-28.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The full confession is the form in Matthew. Luke's language means practically the same, while Mark's is the briefest." 
2. "But the form in Mark really means the full idea." 
3. "But did the disciples still believe in Jesus as Messiah after all the defections and oppositions seen by them? It was a serious test to which Jesus now put them."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou art the Christ; the Messiah that was long ago promised and so often prophesied of in the books of Moses and the prophets; and whom the Jews have so much and long expected." 
2. "This confession of Peter's in which all the apostles agreed with him speaks out what Jesus really was, and exceeds the most exalted sentiments which the people had of him: he was not the harbinger of the Messiah but the Messiah himself."
3. "Not one of the various opinions of the people being just, and answering the true character of Jesus, he demands the sense of his disciples which is here given by Peter in their name, and which was right."
