# Mark 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, aware that the time for the full revelation of his true identity as the Messiah and Son of God was not yet ripe, instructed his disciples to remain silent. This silence served multiple purposes, preventing the provocation of the religious leaders and premature attempts to establish Jesus as a temporal king. Instead, Jesus entrusted Peter with the keys of the kingdom of heaven, conferring authority, and affirms that his church will be built upon Peter's confession of faith. The future triumphal entry into Jerusalem would witness the stones themselves testifying if people remained silent.
