# Mark 8:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, with his disciples and a crowd around him, looked at his disciples and told them, Follow me. The disciples had been informed earlier about Jesus' impending death, but the concept of his resurrection on the third day seemed to pass over their heads. The mention of the third day was vital because it had been destined and prophesied in the Scriptures as the time for the Son of Man's suffering. The distinction between after three days and on the third day reinforced the idea that the fourth day was impossible.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The disciples, along with a crowd, gathered around as Jesus looked at his disciples and said, Follow me. This came as no surprise, as they had been told about the approaching death of Jesus, but it seemed that the resurrection on the third day didn't make much of an impression on their minds. The mention of the third day was significant, as it was a specific and predetermined time for the suffering of the Son of Man, just as it had been foretold in the Scriptures. This rejection and suffering were foreseen by the builders and would culminate on the third day. The distinction between after three days and on the third day is important as it emphasizes the impossibility of the fourth day.
