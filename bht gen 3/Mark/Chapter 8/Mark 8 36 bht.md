# Mark 8:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul? The pursuit of worldly wealth and success may seem appealing, but it holds no true value in the long run. Even if one were to amass great riches and enjoy the pleasures of the world, it would all be in vain if their soul is ultimately lost. The soul continues forever, and its loss and damnation carry eternal torment. The fleeting enjoyment of the world cannot compare to the everlasting consequences of losing one's soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Gain - lose. See on Matthew 16:26.


### John Gill:
1. "For what shall it profit a man,.... In the long run, in the issue of things, who by denying Christ, and his Gospel, may not only save his life for the present, but procure for himself great riches and wealth." 
2. "yet supposing he had his desire, of what avail would this be in the upshot of things, should the following be his case, as it will, and lose his own soul?" 
3. "The world can only be enjoyed for a season, and that with a great deal of fatigue and trouble; but the soul continues forever; and if it is lost and damned, its torment always abides, and the smoke of it ascends forever, its worm never dies, and its fire is never quenched."
