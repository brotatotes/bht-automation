## BHT:
The value of the soul is emphasized, as it declares that the riches of the world are insufficient to redeem it. Material wealth holds no power to save the soul from judgment or destruction. Even if someone possessed everything the world had to offer, it would not be enough to rescue their soul. This points to the immeasurable worth of the soul, which cannot be traded or replaced.
