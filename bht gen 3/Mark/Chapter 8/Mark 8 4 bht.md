# Mark 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, feeling as helpless as they did before when the five thousand were fed, express their doubt by questioning where they could possibly find enough bread in the wilderness to satisfy the hunger of the crowd. Despite having witnessed the miracle of feeding the five thousand before, they modestly leave it up to Jesus to decide what should be done, not even attempting to offer any solutions. They fail to rise to faith in the unlimited power of Jesus, and instead, their doubt overshadows their memories of His previous miracles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though the question here is the same as when He fed the five thousand, they evidently now meant no more by it than that they had not the means of feeding the multitude; modestly leaving the Lord to decide what was to be done."
2. "And this will the more appear from His not now trying them, as before, by saying, 'They need not depart, give ye them to eat'; but simply asking what they had, and then giving His directions."
3. "From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The disciples feel as helpless as when the five thousand were fed."
2. "They do not rise to faith in the unlimited power of Jesus after all that they have seen."
3. "The disciples feel as helpless as when the five thousand were fed."

### John Gill:
1. "Forgetting the late miracle of feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fishes." 
2. "From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?" 
3. "From what place, and by what ways and means can it be thought, that such a quantity of bread can be got at any rate in a desert, as to satisfy so large a number of hungry men?"
