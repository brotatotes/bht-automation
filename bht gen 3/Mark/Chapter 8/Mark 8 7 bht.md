## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The language intimates that they were separately blessed and distributed."
2. "Having blessed. A different word from that used in Mark 8:6. The distinction is slight, however: this one implying praise, and the other thanksgiving."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  A few small fishes (Î¹Ï‡Î¸Ï…Î´Î¹Î± Î¿Î»Î¹Î³Î±). Mark mentions them last as if they were served after the food, but not so Matthew 15:34. 


### John Gill:
1. "It looks, by this account, as if the fishes were blessed, and brake, and distributed separately, alter the blessing, breaking, and distribution of the bread."
2. "According to Matthew they were both blessed, and brake, and distributed together, as it is highly reasonable to suppose they were both ate together."
3. "The Syriac version renders it, 'upon whom also he blessed'; and the Persic thus, 'and he also blessed the fishes'."
