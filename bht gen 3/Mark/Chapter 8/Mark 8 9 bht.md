## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Had not our Lord distinctly referred, in this very chapter and in two successive sentences, to the feeding of the five thousand and of the four thousand as two distinct miracles, many critics would have insisted that they were but two different representations of one and the same miracle."
2. "In view of these things, who could have believed that these were one and the same miracle, even if the Lord Himself had not expressly distinguished them?"
3. "The localities, though both on the eastern side of the lake, were different; the time was different; the preceding and following circumstances were different; the period during which the people continued fasting was differentâ€”in the one case not even one entire day, in the other three days; the number fed was differentâ€”five thousand in the one case, in the other four thousand."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Baskets. See on Matthew 14:20. 
Four thousand. Matthew (xv. 38) here adds a detail which we should rather expect in Mark : beside women and children.


### Philip Schaff:
1. Mark 8:9. Mark again omits â€˜besides women and children.â€™
	


### John Gill:
1. "And he sent them away; some that came dumb, with their speech, and deaf, with their hearing; others that were maimed, with perfect healing of their wounds, and with their limbs sound and whole; others that came lame, he dismissed leaping; and others that were blind, with their sight restored to them, and all of them full."
2. "And they that had eaten were about four thousand."
3. "That is, men, besides women and children, as Matthew observes."
