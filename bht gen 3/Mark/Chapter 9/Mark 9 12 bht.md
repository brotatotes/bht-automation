# Mark 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sense given by this statement is extremely meagre and without precedence in our Lord's discourses. It concludes by affirming that Elias has come and suggests that the sufferings of the Son of Man were imminent. Just as the first coming of the Son of Man involved suffering and death, so did the first coming of Elias fulfill prophecy. Jesus patiently clarifies the understanding of his disciples as they engage in an argument about the interpretation of the scribes. It becomes evident that the predicted Elijah has indeed come and suffered, identifying John the Baptist as this Elijah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But not to mention that such a sentence would be without example in our Lordâ€™s discourses, the sense given by it is meagre in the extreme."
2. "Then comes the conclusion in ver. 13 with But I say unto you, stating that Elias has come, and leaving it therefore to be inferred that the sufferings of the Son of Man were close at hand."
3. "Just as the first coming of the Son of Man is to suffer and to die, so has the first coming of Elias been as it was written of him; but there is a future coming of Elias to restore all things, and of the Son of Man in glory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The next verse shows that the main point is not so much to prove that the Son of man must soon suffer, as that the predicted Elijah had come, and, like the Old Testament Elijah, had suffered as the Messiah also would..." (emphasis added). 
2. "...hence that this Elijah was John the Baptist..." (emphasis added).
3. "Most later scholars take the first half only as a question: And how is it written of the Son of man? then the answer: That he should suffer, etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Restoreth all things (Î±Ï€Î¿ÎºÎ±Ï„Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î±Î½Îµ Ï€Î±Î½Ï„Î±). This late double compound verb, usual form Î±Ï€Î¿ÎºÎ±Î¸Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î·Î¼ in the papyri, is Christ's description of the Baptist as the promised Elijah and Forerunner of the Messiah." 
2. "The disciples had not till now understood that the Baptist fulfilled the prophecy in Malachi 3:5." 
3. "But Jesus patiently enlightens his dull pupils as they argue about the exegesis of the scribes."

### John Gill:
1. "And among the rest of the things he sets right, this is one, and not of the least; namely, that he gives the true sense of such passages of the sacred writings, which related to the contemptuous usage, rejection, and sufferings of the Messiah." 
2. "He was the Lamb of God typified in the sacrifices of the law, who by his sufferings and death takes away the sin of the world."
3. "Therefore he exhorted and directed those to whom he ministered, to look unto him, and believe in him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Elijah's coming is not inconsistent with my suffering. He is come: yet I shall suffer."
2. "The first part of the verse answers their question concerning Elijah."
3. "The second refutes their error concerning the Messiah's continuing for ever."
