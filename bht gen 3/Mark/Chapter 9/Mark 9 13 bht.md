# Mark 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The suffering of the forerunner, who is referred to as Elijah, can be understood by inferring from the Old Testament prophecy of Elijah's sufferings. The statement [...] that Elias is indeed come... implies that Elijah's suffering has already taken place, as it is written that the people did to him whatever they pleased. This aligns with the prophecy which states that what follows pertains to what the Scribes and Pharisees, along with the people of the Jews, did to John according to their own desires.
