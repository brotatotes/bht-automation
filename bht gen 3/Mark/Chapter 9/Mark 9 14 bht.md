## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is hardly such another contrast to be found in the Gospel as this, between the open heaven and the sons of glory on the mount, and the valley of tears with its terrible forms of misery and pain and unbelief." 
2. "The scribes were probably boasting over the disciples, and reasoning from their inability to that of their Master also."
3. "I have already in the notes to Matthew spoken of the noble use made of this contrast in the last and grandest picture of the greatest of paintersâ€”the Transfiguration of Raffaele."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This was 'on the next day, when they were come down from the hill.' The Transfiguration appears to have taken place at night." 
2. "No doubt these cavillers were twitting the apostles of Jesus with their inability to cure the demoniac boy of whom we are presently to hear, and insinuating doubts even of their Master's ability to do it." 
3. "They, zealous for their Master's honor, would no doubt refer to His past miracles in proof of the contrary."

### Marvin Vincent:

1. "'The next day' (Luke)."

3. "Jesus and the three find them at it when they arrive in the plain."

### John Gill:
