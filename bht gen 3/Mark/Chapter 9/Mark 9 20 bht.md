# Mark 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as the man with the legion of demons, 'when he saw Jesus, ran and worshipped Him,' so this demon, when he saw Him, immediately 'tare him.' Still Jesus does nothing, but keeps conversing with the father about the caseâ€”partly to let its virulence have time to show itself, and partly to deepen the exercise of the father's soul, to draw out his faith. The presence of Christ awakens Satan, who raises as violent a storm as he can.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Just as the man with the legion of demons, 'when he saw Jesus, ran and worshipped Him,' so this demon, when he saw Him, immediately 'tare him.' The feeling of terror and rage was the same in both cases."
2. "Still Jesus does nothing, but keeps conversing with the father about the caseâ€”partly to have its desperate features told out by him who knew them best, in the hearing of the spectators; partly to let its virulence have time to show itself; and partly to deepen the exercise of the father's soul, to draw out his faith, and thus to prepare both him and the by-standers for what He was to do."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mark is more specific in his detail of the convulsion which seized the lad as he was coming to Jesus." 
2. "He notes the convulsion as coming on at the demoniac's sight of our Lord." 
3. "He gives the dialogue between Jesus and the boy's father, and relates the process of the cure in graphic detail."

### John Calvin:
1. "For in proportion as the grace of Christ is seen to be nearer at hand, and acts more powerfully, the fury of Satan is the more highly excited."
2. "The presence of Christ awakens him like the sound of a trumpet. He raises as violent a storm as he can, and contends with all his might."
3. "When our affliction is so heavy that we are almost at the point of death, that is the true commencement of our cure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The kingdom of Satan, in small and great, is ever stirred into a fiercer activity by the coming near of the kingdom of Christ." 
2. "Satan has great wrath, when his time is short."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "This compound with ÏƒÏ…Î½- (together with), strengthens the force of the verb."
3. "Wallowed (ÎµÎºÏ…Î»Î¹ÎµÏ„Î¿). Imperfect passive, was rolled. A pitiful sight."

### John Gill:
1. "When he saw him, either when Jesus saw the child, or the child saw Jesus; or the evil spirit in him, and by him which were all at once."
2. "Straightway the spirit tare him; threw him into a violent fit, shook him, and convulsed him in a dreadful manner."
3. "He fell on the ground; at the feet of Jesus, not being able to stand, through the violent motions and convulsions he threw him into."

### John Wesley:
