# Mark 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The ignorant and weak faith of the wretched father is evident as he pleads, Help me and Have mercy on me, identifying himself with his son's misery. Despite the disciples' failure, the father still believes in Jesus' power. The boy's chronic epilepsy, coupled with demon possession, makes the case desperate. With touching tenderness, the father pleads for mercy, making his son's case his own. However, his intense feelings alone don't equate to faith. He approaches Jesus with hesitation, doubting His full power, though faith should embrace the boundless power of God.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The father describes the case still further, representing the demon as a malignant enemy seeking to kill his only son."
2. "The fatherâ€™s sense of need is stirred by the recital, but his faith is very weak. Not strong at first, it had probably been weakened by the failure of the disciples."

1. "The Ethiopic version before fire and water reads, 'into the deep'; meaning either the sea or some deep pit, or off a precipice. All this is said to aggravate the case, and show the miserable condition the child was in, from the frequency of the fits, and the danger he was exposed to."
2. "This man's faith was very weak, and perhaps weaker than when he first came from home with his child... he puts an if upon his power, and earnestly entreats him, if he had any, he would put it forth."
3. "He tries, in very moving language, both the power and pity of Christ; and begs that if he had either, he would exert them on this occasion."

### John Wesley:
1. If thou canst do any thing â€” In so desperate a case: Have compassion on us - Me as well as him.
