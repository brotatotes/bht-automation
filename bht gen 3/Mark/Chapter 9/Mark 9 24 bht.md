## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The poor father is drawn out into a sense of the unworthiness of his distrust, and 'the little spark of faith which is kindled in his soul reveals to him the abysmal deeps of unbelief which are there.'" (Trench, p. 367)
2. "Thus does the Redeemer shew himself to the father as a Creator and bringer out of faith first, before He heals his son. In the struggle of his anxiety, the strength of Faith is born, by the aid of Christ, in the soul empty of it before." (Olshausen, B. Comm: i, 534)
3. "The fact is, that the analogy rests far deeper: viz. on the 'inclusion' of 'the old man' in Adam and the 'new man' in Christ." (Rom. v. 12‚Äì21)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is useless concealing from Thee, O Thou mysterious, mighty Healer, the unbelief that still struggles in this heart of mine; but that heart bears me witness that I do believe in Thee; and if distrust still remains, I disown it, I wrestle with it, I seek help from Thee against it." 
2. "Two things are very remarkable here: First, The felt and owned presence of unbelief, which only the strength of the man's faith could have so revealed to his own consciousness. Second, His appeal to Christ for help against his felt unbelief‚Äîa feature in the case quite unparalleled."
3. "Showing, more than all protestations could have done, the insight he had attained into the existence of a power in Christ more glorious than any he had besought for his poor child."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Cried out and said [Œ∫œÅŒ±ŒæŒ±œÇŒµŒªŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩ] . The former denoting the inarticulate cry, the ejaculation, followed by the words, "Lord, I believe," etc.


### John Calvin:
1. "There is none of us that does not experience both of them in himself."
2. "It is our duty, in the meantime, carefully to shake off the remains of infidelity which adhere to us, to strive against them, and to pray to God to correct them."
3. "If we duly inquire what portion has been bestowed on each, it will evidently appear that there are very few who are eminent in faith, few who have a moderate portion, and very many who have but a small measure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The full form; ‚Äòthe father of the child,‚Äô not only implies that the son was a child in years, but suggests the spiritual connection between ‚Äòfather ‚Äòand ‚Äòchild‚Äò in this matter, and the effect of the faith of the former upon the cure of the latter."
2. "I believe, help thou mine unbelief, i.e., want of faith. The man‚Äôs faith is further awakened by the challenge of our Lord; but this increase of faith only shows him how great his doubt is; and he at once adds to his confession of belief a new prayer for help."
3. "Weak faith is yet faith and when it leads to prayer it becomes stronger."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Cried out (Œ∫œÅŒ±ŒæŒ±œÇ)... I believe; help my unbelief (Œ†ŒπœÉœÑŒµœÖœâ: Œ≤ŒøŒ∑Œ∏Œµ œÑŒ∑ Œ±œÄŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±)." 
2. "An exact description of his mental and spiritual state." 
3. "The word comes from Œ≤ŒøŒ∑, a cry and Œ∏Œµœâ, to run, to run at a cry for help, a vivid picture of this father's plight."

### John Gill:
1. "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief; not forward, but out of the way"
2. "He saw it was not in his own power to believe; nor had he strength of himself to oppose his unbelief"
3. "Every believer, more or less, at one time or another, finds himself in this man's case; and also that it is necessary to make use of the same petition"

### John Wesley:
1. Help thou mine unbelief ‚Äî Although my faith be so small, that it might rather be termed unbelief, yet help me.
