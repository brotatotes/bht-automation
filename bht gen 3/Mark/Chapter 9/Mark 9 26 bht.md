# Mark 9:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The demon, aware that his time was limited, made one final attempt to destroy his victim, almost succeeding. But in that moment, the Lord of life, the Healer, the Stronger than the strong man armed, was present. Though the child suffered greatly from the demon's departure, becoming motionless as if dead, this quietude was a sign of the demon's absence. The demon inflicted as much harm as possible before leaving, but his works will be ultimately destroyed.
