# Mark 9:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' inability to cast out the evil spirit was a result of their unbelief, lack of prayer, and failure to recognize the need for special preparation and self-denial. The magnitude of the task they faced required a height of faith that cannot be reached without effort and a humble reliance on God. Their overconfidence in themselves and underestimation of Christ's power rendered them powerless, as they trusted in their own abilities rather than earnestly seeking God's intervention through prayer and fasting.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Because of your unbelief."
2. "That there are kinds, more and less malicious, of evil spirits."
3. "The Lordâ€™s saying here is rather for their after guidance, than their present."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This kind of evil spirits cannot be expelled, or so desperate a case of demoniacal possession cannot be cured, but by prayer and fasting."
2. "Great and difficult duties require special preparation and self-denial."
3. "Though nothing is impossible to faith, yet such a height of faith as is requisite for such triumphs is not to be reached either in a moment or without effortâ€”either with God in prayer or with ourselves in self-denying exercises."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This kind. Probably evil spirits in general."
2. "The failure in this case of remarkable malignity was for their admonition."
3. "The â€˜prayer and fastingâ€™ would not work the miracle, but were necessary to sustain the faith which would successfully call upon Christâ€™s power in such a case."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Save by prayer. The addition of 'and of fasting' does not appear in the two best Greek manuscripts (Aleph and B). It is clearly a late addition to help explain the failure. But it is needless and also untrue."
2. "Prayer is what the nine had failed to use. They were powerless because they were prayerless. Their self-complacency spelled defeat."
3. "They had too much faith in themselves, too little in Christ. 'They had trusted to the semi-magical power with which they thought themselves invested' (Swete). "Spirits of such malignity were quick to discern the lack of moral power and would yield to no other' (ibid.)."

### John Gill:
1. "This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting." 
2. "They could not cast out the foul spirit, which was their unbelief."
3. "They had not observed [prayer and fasting]."
