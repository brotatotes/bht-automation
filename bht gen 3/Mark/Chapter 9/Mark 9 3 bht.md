# Mark 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
His raiment became shining and exceeding white, glistening with a splendor that no human effort could achieve. The radiance of his clothes was preternatural, beyond anything seen before. This brilliance was so intense that it was compared to the snow-capped summit of Hermon, the whitest of all whiteness. The raiment was white as snow, surpassing the skill of any fuller on earth to achieve such whiteness. Just as the Israelites could not withstand the glory of Moses' countenance, mankind was unable to behold the full brightness of his garments.
