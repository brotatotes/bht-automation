## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If the receiving any one, even a little child, in thy Name, be receiving Thee; were we doing right when we forbade one who used thy Name, but did not follow us?" 
2. "Let those observe this who bind on spiritual gifts to canonical succession." 
3. "This man actually did what the very Apostles themselves were specially appointed to do: and our Lord, so far from prohibiting, encourages him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbade him, because he followeth not usâ€”The link of connection here with the foregoing context lies, we apprehend, in the emphatic words which our Lord had just uttered, 'in My name.'"
2. "Were we right, or were we wrong?" Answerâ€”"Ye were wrong."
3. "But we did it because he followeth not us." "No matter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no improbability in supposing that this might have been one of the disciples of John, or one of the seventy whom Jesus had sent out." 
2. "There is no evidence that he was merely an 'exorcist,' or that he used the name of Jesus merely as a pretence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. In thy name. John's conscience is awakened by the Lord 's words. They had not received the man who cast out devils in Christ 's name.


### John Calvin:
1. "It is possible that he who is here mentioned had embraced the doctrine of Christ, and betaken himself to the performance of miracles with no bad intention."
2. "The Lord was pleased, in this way also, to throw luster around his name, as he sometimes does by means of those of whose ministry he does not approve as lawful."
3. "Every man who undertakes more than he knows that he is permitted to do by the word of God is chargeable with rashness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This unknown man had wrought such miracles as the Apostles did and by the same power, though it had not been directly committed to him as to them."
2. "He was not a follower of Jesus, yet he believed in the power of our Lord sufficiently to attempt this exorcism."
3. "They probably demanded that the man should either stop his activity or join them. How natural!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Note vivid imperfect tense again."
2. "Perhaps what Jesus had just said in verse Mark 9:37 raised a doubt in John's mind as to the propriety of his excessive narrowness."
3. "One needs to know the difference between loyalty to Jesus and stickling over one's own narrow prejudices."

### John Gill:
1. "Taking notice of what Christ just now said, and observing how well pleasing it was to him, to receive in a meek and humble manner, the least believer in his name..."
2. "This person not only attempted to cast out devils, but really did; and that more than one; but in which of Christ's names he did it, is not expressed..."
3. "Wherefore they feared, that by such an irregular way of proceeding, the dignity of Christ would be lessened, and some dishonour and reproach reflected on him..."

### John Wesley:
1. "But ought we to receive those who follow not us?"
2. "How readily do we also lust to envy?"
3. "But to confine religion to them that follow us, is a narrowness of spirit which we should avoid and abhor."
