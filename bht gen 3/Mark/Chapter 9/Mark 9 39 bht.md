# Mark 9:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone works a miracle in the name of Jesus, it is a demonstration of their love and connection to Him, and we should not lightly criticize or speak evil of them. This teaching extends beyond miracles to a fundamental principle of Christian tolerance and charity. We must be cautious not to limit the work of the Holy Spirit to any particular sect or outward form of the Church. Instead, let us refrain from hindering those who do good in His name and rejoice in the advancement of the kingdom of Christ, irrespective of their denomination or approach.
