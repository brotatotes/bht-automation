## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These solemn repetitions of former declarations are by no means to be regarded as arbitrary insertions by this or that Evangelist, but as the truth of what was uttered by our Lord."
2. "This triple repetition gives sublimity, and leaves no doubt of the discourse having been verbatim thus uttered."
3. "Vv. 44, 46, 48 are only in Mark; they are cited from Isaiah (see Isa. lxvi. 24), where the prophecy is of the carcases of those who have transgressed against the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The oldest and best manuscripts do not give these two verses."
2. "They are a mere repetition of verse Mark 9:48."
3. "Hence we lose the numbering 44 and 46 in our verses which are not genuine."

### John Gill:
1. "By their worm is meant, their conscience; for as a worm that is continually gnawing upon the entrails of a man, gives him exquisite pain; so the consciences of sinners, will be continually flying in their faces, bringing their sins to remembrance, accusing them of them, upbraiding them with them, aggravating them, tormenting them for them, filling them with dreadful anguish and misery, with twinging remorses, and severe reflections, and which will never have an end."
2. "This will be always the case; conscience will be ever distressing, racking, and torturing them; it will never cease, nor cease doing this office."
3. "By 'the fire' may be meant the fire of divine wrath let into their souls, which will never be extinguished."

### John Wesley:
1. "Where their worm â€” That gnaweth the soul, dieth not..."
2. "No more than the soul itself..."
3. "The fire... is not quenched for ever."
