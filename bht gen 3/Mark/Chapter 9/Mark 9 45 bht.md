# Mark 9:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who provide essential support and sustenance, like a foot to the body, should be avoided if they cause others to stumble and fall away from Christ. It is better to go alone to heaven than to be accompanied by those who lead others astray, as they would be cast into the unquenchable fire of hell.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "Such who are that to men, as the foot is to the body, the support of them through whom they have their maintenance and subsistence; and yet these, if they are a means of causing them to stumble and tail, or of leading out of the ways of Christ, and off from him, their company is to be shunned and abstained from."
2. "It is better to go alone without such company into heaven than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched."
