# Mark 9:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every disciple of Jesus shall have a fiery trial to undergo, and everyone who would be found an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God, must have such a salting, like the Levitical sacrifices. Fire is the symbol of divine purity and presence. In the fire of hell, rebellious sinners shall not be consumed but preserved in torment. Those seasoned with the grace of God are preserved from the corruptions of the world and kept safe for God's kingdom and glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every sacrifice is parallel with every one, and is equivalent to just as."
2. "Fire is the symbol of the divine purity and presence."
3. "In and among this purifying fire shall the people of God ever walk and rejoice everlastingly."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every disciple of Mine shall have a fiery trial to undergo, and everyone who would be found an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God, must have such a salting, like the Levitical sacrifices."
2. "To apply the preservative salt of the sacrifice to the preserving quality of hell-fire, is equally contrary to the symbolical sense of salt and the Scripture representations of future torment."
3. "Our Lord has still in His eye the unseemly jarrings which had arisen among the Twelve, the peril to themselves of allowing any indulgence to such passions, and the severe self-sacrifice which salvation would cost them."

### John Calvin:
1. "To be salted with fire is an incorrect phrase; but as salt and fire possess the same quality of purifying and refining, Christ applied the same term to both."
2. "He exhorts them to retain always their savor. When men have lost, by their carelessness, that savor which they obtained by the grace of God, there is no farther remedy."
3. "Those who lose their faith, by which they were consecrated to God, and become without savor, are in a desperate condition: for the good savor cannot be acquired by any other seasoning."

### John Gill:
1. "That fire shall be to them, what salt is to flesh; as that keeps flesh from putrefaction and corruption, so the fire of hell, as it will burn, torture, and distress rebellious sinners, it will preserve them in their beings; they shall not be consumed by it, but continued in it."
2. "The soul in torment shall never die, or lose any of its powers and faculties; and particularly, not its gnawing, torturing conscience; and that the fire of hell is inextinguishable."
3. "Such who are seasoned with the grace of God, are preserved from the corruptions of the world, are acceptable in the sight of God, and are kept safe to his kingdom and glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every one â€” Who does not cut off the offending member, and consequently is cast into hell, shall be, as it were, salted with fire, preserved, not consumed thereby..."
2. "...whereas every acceptable sacrifice shall be salted with another kind of salt, even that of Divine grace..."
3. "...which purifies the soul, (though frequently with pain) and preserves it from corruption."
