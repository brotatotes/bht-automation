2. "When Paul enjoins, 'Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt,' he means, that we ought to be holy, and purified from all profane follies and corruptions, and filled with spiritual grace, which edifies all who hear it, and diffuses over them its sweet odor."

2. "Salt is an emblem of firm union, concord, and agreement: hence the covenant of peace is called a covenant of salt."
3. "This exhortation, very appropriately follows upon the making mention of salt in different senses; especially, this exhortation was the more necessary to the disciples at this time, since they had been very lately warmly disputing the point among themselves, who should be greatest in the kingdom of the Messiah; and which had occasioned this discourse of Christ's."

### John Wesley:
1. "Such salt is good indeed; highly beneficial to the world, in respect of which I have termed you the salt of the earth."
2. "But if the salt which should season others, have lost its own saltness, wherewith will ye season it? - Beware of this; see that ye retain your savour; and as a proof of it, have peace one with another."
3. "As every burnt offering was salted with salt, in order to its being cast into the fire of the altar, so every one who will not part with his hand or eye, shall fall a sacrifice to Divine justice, and be cast into hell fire, which will not consume, but preserve him from a cessation of being."
