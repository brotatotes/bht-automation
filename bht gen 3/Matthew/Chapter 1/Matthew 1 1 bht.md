## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It [book of the generation] refers exclusively to the genealogy, by 'Jesus Christ' being used in the enunciation, and the close being 'Jesus which is called Christ.'"
2. "The word [Christ] is equivalent to the Hebrew Messiah, anointed. It is used of kings, priests, prophets, and of the promised Deliverer."
3. "Son of David was an especial title of the Messiah... That He should be son of Abraham, was too solemn a subject of prophecy to be omitted here, even though implied in the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus, the name given to our Lord at His circumcision, was that by which He was familiarly known while on earth." 
2. "The word 'Christ'...only began to be so used by others about the very close of His earthly career." 
3. "From the nearest of those two fathers came that familiar name of the promised Messiah, 'the son of David', which was applied to Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is the proper title of the chapter. It is the same as to say, 'the account of the ancestry or family, or the genealogical table of Jesus Christ.'"
2. "Jesus is called either the Messiah, or the Christ, meaning the same thing."
3. "Though Jesus was of humble birth, yet he was descended from most illustrious ancestors."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ [œáœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ]. Properly an adjective, not a noun, and meaning anointed (criw, to anoint)."
2. "Hence the word 'Christ' was representative of our Lord, who united in himself the offices of king, prophet, and priest."
3. "Anointing was practiced upon the sick. Jesus, 'the Great Physician,' is described by Isaiah (Isaiah 61:1, Isaiah 61:2; compare Luke 4:18) as anointed by God to bind up the broken - hearted, and to give the mournful the oil of joy for mourning."

### John Calvin:
1. "But we have not yet replied to their objection, that the ancestry of Joseph has nothing to do with Christ. The common and well-known reply is, that in the person of Joseph the genealogy of Mary also is included, because the law enjoined every man to marry from his own tribe."
2. "I am well aware of the manner in which they attempt to solve this difficulty. The word son, they allege, is put for son-in-law, and the interpretation they give to Joseph being called the son of Heli is, that he had married Heli‚Äôs daughter. But this does not agree with the order of nature, and is nowhere countenanced by any example in Scripture."
3. "The fourth and last is; when they are speaking of the same persons, they sometimes give them different names."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The book of birth, birth-book,' i.e., pedigree, genealogy."
2. "This combination is the Gospel in a nutshell, a declaration that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah."
3. "Christ is our Anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. That of ‚ÄòKing‚Äô was most prominent in the expectations of the Jews."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Book (Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒøœÇ). There is no article in the Greek, but the following genitives make it definite. It is our word Bible that is here used, the Book as Sir Walter Scott called it as he lay dying."
2. "Matthew proposes to show that Jesus Christ is on the human side the son of David, as the Messiah was to be, and the son of Abraham, not merely a real Jew and the heir of the promises, but the promise made to Abraham."
3. "The names are given in three groups, Abraham to David (Matthew 1:2-6), David to Babylon Removal (Matthew 1:6-11), Jechoniah to Jesus (Matthew 1:12-16). The removal to Babylon (ŒºŒµœÑŒøŒπŒ∫ŒµœÉŒπŒ±œÇ ŒíŒ±Œ≤œÖŒªœâŒΩŒøœÇ) occurs at the end of verse Matthew 1:11, the beginning of verse Matthew 1:12, and twice in the resume in verse Matthew 1:17."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the genuine title of the book, which was put to it by the Evangelist himself; for the former seems to be done by another hand."
2. "The Jews call their blasphemous history of the life of Jesus, ◊°◊§◊® ◊™◊ï◊ú◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊©◊ï 'The book of the generations of Jesus.'"
3. "By the promise made to Abraham he was to descend from him, as Jesus did; who took upon him the seed of Abraham, Hebrews 2:16 or assumed an human nature which sprung from him, and is therefore truly the son of Abraham."

### John Wesley:
1. "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ ‚Äî That is, strictly speaking, the account of his birth and genealogy."
2. "These accounts sufficiently answer the end for which they are recited. They unquestionably prove the grand point in view, that Jesus was of the family from which the promised seed was to come."
3. "He is so called, because to these he was more peculiarly promised; and of these it was often foretold the Messiah should spring."
