# Matthew 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inclusion of Joacim in the genealogy is questionable as it lacks evidence and disrupts the pattern of generations. It is suggested that Eliakim and his son should be regarded as one generation rather than separate ones. Jehoiakim, being a puppet king, is intentionally omitted from the list. The term brethren refers to Jechonias' uncles, specifically Zedekiah. The careful choice of words reflects respect for the national sentiment, as the Jews preferred not to mention the bitter experience of captivity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reading which inserts Joacim (i. e. Eliakim) rests on hardly any foundation, and would make fifteen generations in the second 'fourteen.'"
2. "The solution of the difficulty by supposing the name to apply to both Eliakim and his son, and to mean the former in ver. 11 and the latter in ver. 12, is unsupported by example, and contrary to the usage of the genealogy."
3. "We are led to seek our solution in some manner of speaking of these kings, by which Eliakim and his son were not accounted two distinct generations."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jeconiah was Josiah's grandson, being the son of Jehoiakim, Josiah's second son, but Jehoiakim might well be sunk in such a catalogue, being a mere puppet in the hands of the king of Egypt."
2. "The 'brethren' of Jechonias here evidently mean his unclesâ€”the chief of whom, Mattaniah or Zedekiah, who came to the throne, is, in 2 Chronicles 36:10, as well as here, called 'his brother.'"
3. "The Jews avoided the word 'captivity' as too bitter a recollection, and our Evangelist studiously respects the national feeling."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Josiah. The next king was Jehoia-kim...unworthy of mention." 
2. "The removal...does not necessarily imply a forcible removal."
3. "The course is downward through these royal generations."

### John Gill:
1. "And Josias begat Jechonias...." This Jechonias is the same with Jehoiakim, the son of Josias, called so by Pharaohnecho, when he made him king, whose name before was Eliakim. 
2. "Two of them were kings.... shallum, who is called Jehoahaz... Zedekiah, called before Mattaniah." These being both kings, is the reason why his brethren are mentioned; as well as to distinguish him from Jechonias in the next verse; who does not appear to have had any brethren.
3. "About the time they were carried away to Babylon." This phrase is not to be connected with the word "begat" but with the phrase "his brethren" and may be rendered thus, supposing Ï„Î¿Ï…Ï‚ understood, "which were at", or "about the carrying away to Babylon", or the Babylonish captivity.

### John Wesley:
1. "Josiah begat Jeconiah â€” Mediately, Jehoiakim coming between."
2. "And his brethren â€” That is, his uncles. The Jews term all kinsmen brethren."
3. "About the time they were carried away â€” Which was a little after the birth of Jeconiah."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Matthew 1:11, there is some speculation about whether Joacim (Eliakim) should be included in the genealogy. However, this idea has little evidence and would disrupt the pattern of fourteen generations. Another suggestion is that Eliakim and his son are considered one generation, which goes against the usual usage. It is more likely that the kings listed are not meant to represent distinct generations but rather an arrangement that does not include Jehoiakim, who was merely a puppet king. The term brethren refers to Jechonias' uncles, particularly Zedekiah, who is referred to as his brother in another passage. This choice of words is likely to be respectful of the national sentiment, as the Jews did not like to acknowledge the bitter experience of captivity.

- Attempt 5 BHT: The debate arises over the inclusion of Joacim in the genealogy since it lacks sufficient evidence and disrupts the pattern.
