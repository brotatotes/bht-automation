# Matthew 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The denouncement of Jechoniah as childless in Jeremiah implied that no descendant of his would prosper on David's throne. The mention of Zerubbabel in the lineage raises uncertainty, as 1 Chronicles suggests he is the son of Pedaiah, Salathiel's brother. This could indicate a different Zerubbabel or Salathiel raising up seed for his brother. Nonetheless, even in their dispersion, the nation of Judah experienced God's grace in glimpses, offering a sense of hope amidst their struggles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When, therefore, it is denounced (Jer. xxii. 30) that Jechoniah should be â€˜childless,â€™ this word must be understood as explained by the rest of the verse, â€˜for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.â€™" 
2. "There is no difficulty here which does not also exist in the O.T." 
3. "Either this may have been a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may, according to the law, have raised up seed to his brother."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This [Matthew 1:12] does not contradict Jeremiah 22:30, 'Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man (Coniah, or Jeconiah) childless'; for what follows explains in what sense this was meantâ€”'for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David.'"
2. "He [Jeconiah] was to have seed, but no reigning child."
3. "But it would appear from 1 Chronicles 3:19 that Zerubbabel was Salathiel's grandson, being the son of Pedaiah, whose name, for some reason unknown, is omitted."

### John Calvin:
1. "For those who returned home submitted, of their own accord, to the authority of Zerubbabel."
2. "The fragments of the royal scepter lasted till the coming of Christ was at hand."
3. "And even during that wretched and melancholy dispersion, the nation never ceased to be illuminated by some rays of the grace of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The succeeding list cannot be verified, although we meet with the names of Salathiel (Shealtiel), Zerrubbabel." 
2. "In 1 Chronicles 3:19, Zerubbabel is said to have been the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel." 
3. "Either this may have been a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may, according to the law, have raised up seed to his brother."

### John Gill:
1. "To remove which, it may be observed, that the sentence pronounced may be considered with this tacit condition or proviso, if he repented not."
2. "The sentence does not imply that he should have no children, but rather that he should... be left bare, destitute, and unhappy, as Jechonias and his posterity were."
3. "However, it is certain... that he was of the son's sons of Jechonias, king of Judah, from whom our Evangelist makes him to descend."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: According to the commentary, there seems to be some confusion regarding the lineage of Jechoniah and the succeeding generations. The denouncement of Jechoniah being childless in Jeremiah 22:30 is not to be taken literally, but rather refers to the fact that no one from his descendants would prosper as a king in Judah. The mention of Zerubbabel in Matthew 1:12 is intriguing, as 1 Chronicles 3:19 states that Zerubbabel is the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel. It is possible that this is a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may have raised up seed for his brother according to the law. Despite the confusion, it is important to understand that God's grace continued to shine on the nation of Judah, even in their dispersion.

- Attempt 4 BHT: The denouncement of Jechoniah as childless in Jeremiah does not mean he would have no children, but rather that his seed would not prosper on Davidâ€™s throne.
