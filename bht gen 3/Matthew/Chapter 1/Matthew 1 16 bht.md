## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And yet it is here studiously proclaimed that Joseph was not the natural, but only the legal father of our Lord."
2. "His birth of a virgin was known only to a few; but the acknowledged descent of his legal father from David secured that the descent of Jesus Himself from David should never be questioned."
3. "It is applied in the Old Testament to the kings, to the priests, and to the prophets... and it was applied, in its most sublime and comprehensive sense, to the promised Deliverer."

### John Calvin:
1. "Matthew points out his office, to inform the readers that this was not a private person, but one divinely anointed to perform the office of Redeemer."
2. "What that anointing was, and to what it referred, I shall not now illustrate at great length."
3. "But that the fearful desolation which followed might not throw the minds of the godly into despair, it pleased God to appropriate the name of Messiah, Anointed, to the Redeemer alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Luke gives the genealogy of Mary, Hell being her father, and the father-in-law of Joseph." 
2. "Both are genealogies of Joseph. This assumes one, or perhaps two, levirate marriages in the family of Joseph."
3. "The objection to the whole theory is, that Jewish usage would insert in the genealogy not the name of the second husband (the real father), but only that of the first husband who died childless."

### John Wesley:
1. "Otherwise they would not allow Jesus to be the Christ."
2. "We are by nature at a distance from God, alienated from him, and incapable of a free access to him. Hence we want a mediator, an intercessor, in a word, a Christ, in his priestly office."
3. "Now here we want Christ in his prophetic office, to enlighten our minds, and teach us the whole will of God."
