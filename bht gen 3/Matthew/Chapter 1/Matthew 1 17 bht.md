## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If we carefully observe Matthew's arrangement, we shall have no difficulty in completing the three 'fourteens'." 
2. "This last, then, takes in from Jechonias to JESUS CHRIST inclusive."
3. "So that the three stand thus, according to the words of this verse: (1) from Abraham to David. (2) From David to the migration; (3) From the migration (i.e. from Jechonias) to Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the whole may be conveniently divided into three fourteens, each embracing one marked era, and each ending with a notable event, in the Israelitish annals." 
2. "Such artificial aids to memory were familiar to the Jews, and much larger gaps than those here are found in some of the Old Testament genealogies."
3. "As the Evangelist himself ( :-) reckons David twiceâ€”as the last of the first fourteen and the first of the secondâ€”so, if we reckon the second fourteen to end with Josiah, who was coeval with the 'carrying away into captivity' (Matthew 1:11), and third to begin with Jeconiah, it will be found that the last division, as well as the other two, embraces fourteen names, including that of our Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews were destitute of books besides the Old Testament, and they had but few copies of that among them, and those chiefly in their synagogues. They would therefore naturally devise plans to keep up the remembrance of the principal facts in their history."
2. "And, though it is not strictly accurate, yet it was the Jewish way of keeping their records, and answered their purpose. There were three leading persons and events that nearly, or quite, divided their history into equal portions: Abraham, David, and the Babylonian captivity."
3. "Babylon was situated on the Euphrates, and was encompassed with walls which were about 60 miles in circuit, 87 feet broad, and 350 feet high, and the city was entered by 100 brass gates - 25 on each side."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But to make out the second and third series, one name must be counted twice."
2. "In a nation where few books and records existed, such genealogical tables would be put into a form easy to be remembered."
3. "Thus Jesus is the sacred heir of the ancient world; as heir of the blessing, the Prophet of the world; as heir of the sufferings entailed by the curse, its atoning High Priest; as heir of the promise, its King."

### John Gill:
1. "The Evangelist...gives the sum of each part under its distinct head; 'so all the generations,' that is, the degrees of generation, or the persons generated from Abraham to David, both being included, 'are fourteen generations'." 
2. "Here David who closed the first division must be excluded this, and it must be observed, that the Evangelist does not say as before, that 'all' the generations from David to the captivity were fourteen, for there were seventeen, three kings being omitted by him at once; but, the generations he thought fit to mention, in order to reduce them to a like number as before, and which were sufficient for his purpose, were fourteen."
3. "This must be understood as before; for there might be more generations in this interval, but these were enough to answer the design of the Evangelist; and which he thought proper to mention."

### John Wesley:
1. "When we survey such a series of generations, it is a natural and obvious reflection, how like the leaves of a tree one passeth away, and another cometh!"
2. "Yet the earth still abideth. And with it the goodness of the Lord which runs from generation to generation, the common hope of parents and children."
3. "Happy are we, if, while we are forgotten by men, we are remembered by God! If our names, lost on earth, are at length found written in the book of life!"
