### Philip Schaff:
1. "The birth of Jesus Christ. Same word as in Matthew 1:1 (â€˜generationâ€™). Here it means â€˜origin.â€™ The more usual word implies a â€˜begettingâ€™; the choice of this word indicates something peculiar in this birth."

2. "To admit real incarnation and also full human birth, both father and mother, creates a greater difficulty than to admit the Virgin Birth of Jesus begotten by the Holy Spirit."

3. "Now Mary's being with child, and its being known, were facts, at the time when she was
espoused to Joseph, and thereby the outward credit both of Mary and Jesus were secured."
