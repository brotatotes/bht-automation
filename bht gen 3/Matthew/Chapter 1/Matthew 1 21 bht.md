3. "Christ is not truly acknowledged as a Savior, till, on the one hand, we learn to receive a free pardon of our sins, and know that we are accounted righteous before God, because we are free from guilt; and till, on the other hand, we ask from him the Spirit of righteousness and holiness, having no confidence whatever in our own works or power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The salvation here ascribed to him, and for which he is every way fit, being God as well as man, and which he is the sole author of, is to be understood, not of a temporal, but of a spiritual and everlasting salvation." 
3. "By 'his people' whom he is said to save are meant, not all mankind, though they are his by creation and preservation, yet they are not, nor will they be all saved by him spiritually and eternally; nor also the people of the Jews, for though they were his nation, his kinsmen, and so his own people according to the flesh, yet they were not all saved by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus ‚Äî That is, a Saviour. It is the same name with Joshua (who was a type of him) which properly signifies, The Lord, Salvation."
2. "His people ‚Äî Israel. And all the Israel of God."
