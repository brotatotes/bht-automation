## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Men shall callâ€”i. e. it shall be a name by which He shall be calledâ€”one of his appellations." (23 words)
2. "The change of person seems to shew, both that the prophecy had a literal fulfilment at the time, and that it is here quoted in a form suited to its greater and final fulfilment." (33 words)
3. "Emmanuel] i.e. God (is) with us. In Isaiah, prophetic primarily of deliverance from the then impending war; but also of final and glorious deliverance by the manifestation of God in the flesh." (37 words)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold, a virginâ€”the virgin...destined to this unparalleled distinction." 
2. "They shall call his name Emmanuel, which...is, God with us." 
3. "He should come to be known in this character, as God manifested in the flesh, and the living bond of holy and most intimate fellowship between God and men from henceforth and for ever."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Behold, a virgin shall be with child... It thus implies that the conception of Christ was miraculous, or that the body of the Messiah was created directly by the power of God."
2. "The word 'Immanuel' is... literally means 'God with us.' Matthew doubtless understands it as denoting that the Messiah was really 'God with us,' or that the divine nature was united with the human."
3. "He had just given an account of the miraculous conception of Jesus... His appropriate name, therefore, was 'God with us.' And though the mere use of such a name would not prove that he had a divine nature, yet as Matthew uses it... it does prove that Jesus was more than a man; that he was God as well as man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not, some virgin or other."
2. "Immanuel (Hebrew, God is with us). To protect and save."
3. "The promise of the name is fulfilled in Jesus... by his helpful and saving presence with his people in their sorrow, their conflict with sin, and their struggle with death."

### John Calvin:
1. "But in Christ the actual presence of God with his people, and not, as before, his shadowy presence, has been exhibited."
2. "If the reason of this name began to be actually true, when Christ appeared in the flesh, it follows that it was not completely, but only in part, that God was formerly united with the Fathers."
3. "For whenever we contemplate the one person of Christ as God-man, we ought to hold it for certain that, if we are united to Christ by faith, we possess God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Old and New Testaments are related to each other as type and antitype, prophecy and fulfilment, preparation and consummation."
2. "The New Testament writers do not, however, use the Scriptures by way of accommodation; whenever a passage is explained by them as having a second fulfilment, as in the present case, that fulfilment is in accordance with the first, only fuller, broader, more spiritual."
3. "God with us. Applied to Christ in the highest and most glorious sense: God incarnate among us, He is still Immanuel, God with us; once He came among men and identified himself with them; now He saves men and identifies them with Himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Men, people, will call his name Immanuel, God with us."
2. "The interest of the evangelist, as of all New Testament writers, in prophecy, was purely religious."
3. "God's help, Jesus=the Help of God, is thus seen."

### John Gill:
1. "The sign or wonder lay in this, that a 'virgin' should 'conceive' or 'be with child'."
2. "The meaning is, not that he should be commonly known and called by such a name, any more than by any, or all of those mentioned in Isaiah 9:6, but only that he should be so."
3. "Jesus, who is God in our nature, the word that was made flesh and dwelt among us."

### John Wesley:
1. "To be called, only means, according to the Hebrew manner of speaking, that the person spoken of shall really and effectually be what he is called, and actually fulfil that title."
2. "He shall be all these, though not so much nominally, as really, and in effect."
3. "It is observable, the words in Isaiah are, Thou (namely, his mother) shalt call; but here, They - that is, all his people, shall call - shall acknowledge him to be Emmanuel, God with us."
