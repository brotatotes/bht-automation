## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason for the women (Thamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) being mentioned, has been variously assigned: it might be, to meet the objection of the Jews to our Lordâ€™s birth: or for the sake of minute accuracy."
2. "It most probably is, that the Evangelist omitted what was ordinary, but stated what was doubtful or singular."
3. "It has been suggested, that as these women are of Gentile origin or dubious character, they may be mentioned as introducing the calling of Gentiles and sinners by our Lord: also, that they may serve as types of the mother of our Lord, and are consequently named in the course of the genealogy, as she is at the end of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This feature in the present genealogyâ€”herein differing from that given by Lukeâ€”comes well from him who styles himself in his list of the Twelve, what none of the other lists do, 'Matthew the publican'; as if thereby to hold forth, at the very outset, the unsearchable riches of that grace which could not only fetch in 'them that are afar off,' but teach down even to 'publicans and harlots,' and raise them to 'sit with the princes of his people.'" 
2. "David is here twice emphatically styled 'David the king,' as not only the first of that royal line from which Messiah was to descend, but the one king of all that line from which the throne that Messiah was to occupy took its nameâ€”'the throne of David.'"
3. "It will be observed that Rachab is here represented as the great-grandmother of Davidâ€”a thing not beyond possibility indeed, but extremely improbable, there being about four centuries between them. There can hardly be a doubt that one or two intermediate links are omitted."

### John Calvin:
1. "He came into the world to empty himself, to be a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people."
2. "He therefore did not refuse to admit a stain into his genealogy, arising from incestuous intercourse which took place among his ancestors."
3. "The astonishing goodness of God strove with the sin of both; so that, nevertheless, this adulterous seed came to possess the scepter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mention of this name not only proves the correctness of the genealogy, but tends to humble Jewish pride and exalt the grace of God."
2. "Tamar, a heathen woman, guilty of intentional incest."
3. "The Jews and some commentators seek to excuse her, but the stain must be admitted."

### John Gill:
1. "The line of the Messiah was in Phares, and very rightly is he put in the genealogy of Christ, the Jews themselves being witnesses; who expressly say, that 'the Messiah comes from him.'"
2. "Thamar, daughter-in-law to Judah; who, though she was a Canaanitish woman, has the honour to be named in the genealogy of Christ, who came to save Gentiles as well as Jews."
3. "The Jews themselves frequently acknowledge that the Messiah was to spring from her: they say, 'there are two women from whom come David the king, and Solomon, and the king Messiah; and these two are Thamar and Ruth.'"

### John Wesley:
1. Of Thamar â€” St. Matthew adds the names of those women also, that were remarkable in the sacred history.
