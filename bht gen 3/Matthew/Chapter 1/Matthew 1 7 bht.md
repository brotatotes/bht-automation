# Matthew 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew's genealogy, three kings are omitted to maintain the structure of three groups of fourteen generations. Scholars suggest that these omissions are due to religious considerations, such as the kings' connection with the house of Ahab or their inadequate qualifications as legitimate links in the theocratic chain. Nevertheless, the exclusion of these names does not undermine the significance of the genealogy, which serves as a powerful testament to the lineage it presents.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Three kings are here omittedâ€”Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah (1 Chronicles 3:11; 1 Chronicles 3:12)."
2. "Some omissions behooved to be made, to compress the whole into three fourteens (Matthew 1:17)."
3. "The reason why these, rather than other names, are omitted, must be sought in religious considerationsâ€”either in the connection of those kings with the house of Ahab (as LIGHTFOOT, EBRARD, and ALFORD view it); in their slender right to be regarded as true links in the theocratic chain (as LANGE takes it); or in some similar disqualification."

### John Gill:
1. "And Solomon begat Roboam...of Naamah an Ammonitess." 
2. "And Roboam begat Abia...sometimes called Abijam." 
3. "And Abia begat Asa, who was a good king...perhaps it is not his proper mother, but his grandmother who is meant."
