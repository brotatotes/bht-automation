# Matthew 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Between Joram and Uzziah, there are intentionally omitted names, possibly to reduce the number of generations. Some suggest erasions were made on account of their connection with the cursed house of Ahab, but it is more likely for the sake of convenience in aligning the genealogical portions. Despite these omissions, the purpose of the Gospel is to show that Jesus is of the house of David. Thus, Jehoram mediately begat Uzziah, just as Christ is mediately the son of David.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Between Joram and Uzziah in the genealogy, there are intentionally omitted names, possibly to reduce the number of generations. Some suggest that the erasions were made due to their connection with the cursed house of Ahab, but it is more likely for the sake of convenience in aligning the genealogical portions. This omission does not affect the purpose of the Gospel, which is to demonstrate that Jesus is of the house of David. Therefore, Jehoram mediately begat Uzziah, just as Christ is mediately the son of David. It is worth noting that Jehoram was a good prince and the firstborn, while the subsequent generations are referred to as the sons who would come from Hezekiah after many generations.
