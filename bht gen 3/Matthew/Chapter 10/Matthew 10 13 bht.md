When Jesus sends out his disciples, he instructs them to offer peace to houses they enter, an act of customary greetings in the East.

The disciples are to be gracious guests, valuing the peace they offer even if it is rejected.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When Jesus tells his disciples to offer peace to a house, he is not simply referring to the customary Eastern salutation. Rather, this peace goes beyond a mere greeting and carries a deeper significance. The worthiness of the house is not determined by the inhabitants, but by their readiness to receive the message of the preachers. If the house welcomes them, the disciples' peace will come upon it. However, if the house rejects their message, the peace will return to the disciples. Hospitality is an important virtue, and the disciples are to be gracious and not burdensome as guests. Ultimately, it is not up to the disciples to decide worthiness, but to faithfully proclaim the message and offer God's peace to all.
