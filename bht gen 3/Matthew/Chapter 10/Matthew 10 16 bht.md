### Albert Barnes:
1. "As sheep in the midst of wolves - That is, I send you, inoffensive and harmless, into a cold, unfriendly, and cruel world. Your innocence will not be a protection."
2. "Be wise as serpents ... - Serpents have always been an emblem of wisdom and cunning... Probably the thing in which Christ directed his followers to imitate the serpent was in its caution in avoiding danger."

2. "The Lord sends the ministers of his word on the condition of dwelling in the midst of wolves; that is, of having many determined enemies and of being beset on every hand by many dangers."
3. "He [Christ] bids them move forward honestly wherever their calling leads them. Serpents, being aware that they are hated, carefully avoid and shrink from everything that is hostile to them. In this manner he enjoins believers to take care of their life, so as not to rush heedlessly into danger, or lay themselves open to any kind of injury. Doves, on the other hand, though naturally timid, and liable to innumerable attacks, fly in their simplicity, imagine themselves safe till they are struck, and in most cases place themselves within the reach of the fowlerâ€™s snares. To such simplicity Christ exhorts his disciples, that no excess of terror may hinder them from pursuing their course."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I who know what awaits you, send you into these trials, but as my 'Apostles,' with my authority and promise and support."
2. "The spiritual strength He had imparted prevented the discouragement likely to arise from this revelation of the thorough hostility of the world. Only His sheep can successfully encounter wolves."
3. "Wisdom to avoid persecution without cowardice, simplicity to encounter it without compromise. The spirit of Christ alone can combine these apparently antagonistic qualities of serpents and doves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The situation called for consummate wisdom and courage."
2. "The combination of wariness and innocence is necessary for the protection of the sheep and the discomfiture of the wolves."
3. "The word means 'unmixed,' 'unadulterated,' 'simple,' 'unalloyed.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He compares them to 'sheep', because they were meek and humble in their spirits, harmless, and inoffensive, in their lives and conversations; were weak, and unable to protect themselves."
2. "The serpent is a very sharp sighted, cunning creature, and uses various arts and stratagems for its own preservation, and especially of its head; and is so far to be imitated by the followers of Christ, as to make use of all proper methods to preserve themselves from the insults and rage of men, and not expose themselves to unnecessary dangers."
3. "Maintain the innocence and harmlessness of the dove, being free from all wicked cunning and craftiness, without rancour, malice, and wrath; not meditating and seeking revenge, but meek and humble in their deportment, leading inoffensive lives, and proceeding in the course of their calling."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 10:3.
