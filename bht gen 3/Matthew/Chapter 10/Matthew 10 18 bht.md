# Matthew 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles were appointed to bear testimony, both for and against, as the word of God possesses a double power. They would testify to the truth and its glorious effects, even before governors and kings, reaching beyond the lost sheep of Israel. Fulfilling this prophecy shows Christ's knowledge of the future, as it seemed unlikely for Galilean fishermen to stand before powerful monarchs. Their testimony would extend to Jews and Gentiles, who would receive or reject the truth preached to them.

2. "The 'testimony' is in both sensesâ€”a testimony to, and against them."
3. "It was a testimony in the best sense to Sergius Paulus, Acts xiii. 7, but against Felix, Acts xxiv. 25; and this double power ever belongs to the word of God as preachedâ€”it is a 'two-edged sword' Rev. i. 16; ii. 12)."

2. "The civil power has often aided ecclesiastical persecutors."
