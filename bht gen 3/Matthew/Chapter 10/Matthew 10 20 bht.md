## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is to be observed that our Lord never in speaking to His disciples says our Father, but either my Father, or your Father, or both conjoined, never leaving it to be inferred that God is in the same sense His Father and our Father."
2. "In the great work of God in the world, human individuality sinks down and vanishes, and God alone, His Christ, His Spirit, is the worker."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you." 
2. "How remarkably this has been verified, the whole history of persecution thrillingly proclaims."
3. "From the Acts of the Apostles to the latest martyrology."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Inspiration for their defence is an indirect proof of the inspiration of the apostolic writings, since the purpose of both is 'testimony' (Matthew 10:18), and writing was a permanent, and hence the most important, testimony."
2. "The inspiration affects both what is said and how it is said. The human form is influenced by the Divine substance revealed."
3. "God is our Father in a different sense; Christ's sonship differs from ours, and He calls God simply 'Father' or 'My Father'."

### John Gill:
1. "For it is not ye that speak... but the Spirit of your father, which speaketh in you, or 'by you'." 
2. "What they should say was not to be dictated by their own spirit or natural understanding, nor by an angel, but by the Spirit of God."
3. "And this character of him might serve to strengthen their faith... since he was the spirit of him, who stood in the relation of a father to them, and bore a paternal affection for them."
