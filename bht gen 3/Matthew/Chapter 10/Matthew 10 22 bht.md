# Matthew 10:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Throughout this prophecy, the first apostolic period is used as a type of the whole ages of the Church. The universality of the hatred the disciples would face would make it evident that no amount of discretion on their part would stifle that enmity. However, those who endure to the end, showing the evidence of the reality and solidity of their faith, will be saved. This endurance has a literal reference to significant epochs, such as the destruction of Jerusalem, and the promise of ultimate victory should sustain their faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Throughout this discourse and the great prophecy in ch. xxiv., we find the first apostolic period used as a type of the whole ages of the Church."
2. "The shall be saved here bears its full scripture meaning, of everlasting salvation."
3. "Hardly will the Gospel have been fully preached to all nations when the Son of Man shall come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The universality of this hatred would make it evident to them, that since it would not be owing to any temporary excitement, local virulence, or personal prejudice, on the part of their enemies, so no amount of discretion on their part, consistent with entire fidelity to the truth, would avail to stifle that enmity."
2. "But he that endureth to the end shall be savedâ€”a great saying, repeated... and often reiterated by the apostle as a warning against 'drawing back unto perdition'... As 'drawing back unto perdition' is merely the palpable evidence of the want of 'root' from the first in the Christian profession, so 'enduring to the end' is just the proper evidence of its reality and solidity."
3. "Enduring to the end is just the proper evidence of its reality and solidity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye shall be hated of all men - That is, of all kinds of people. The human heart would be opposed to them, because it is opposed to Christ."
2. "But he that endureth to the end ... - That is, to the end of life, be it longer or shorter. He that bears all these unspeakable sufferings, and who does not shrink and apostatize, will give decisive evidence of attachment to me, and shall enter into heaven."
3. "See Revelation 3:21-22."

### John Calvin:
1. "This single promise ought sufficiently to support the minds of the godly, though the whole world should rise against them."
2. "They are assured that the result will be prosperous and happy."
3. "If those who fight under earthly commanders... are carried forward even to death by steadiness of purpose, shall those who are certain of victory hesitate to abide by the cause of Christ to the very last?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christianity of Christians, not their errors or personal faults, will call forth this hatred. The latter may be the pretext, yet the world has hated most those whom it was forced to respect and admire most."
2. "In the case of individual believers, to the end of life, but primarily with a literal reference to great epochs; in this case, to the destruction of Jerusalem."
3. "Perseverance to the end, however bitter, is the evidence of genuine faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye shall be hated. It will go on through the ages."
2. "For my name's sake. 'The name' as here stands for the person."
3. "'He that endureth to the end.' Effective aorist participle with future indicative."

### John Gill:
1. "And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake...of most men, or of the far greater part of the Jews, even of all wicked men who disbelieved and rejected the Messiah." 
2. "This hatred they should be exposed to, would not be on account of any ill will to their persons; or because of any evil or immorality committed by them; but purely, and alone, for the name of Christ, in whom they believed."
3. "Such persons are happy, who patiently endure the hatred of men, and all manner of persecution, for Christ's sake; who are not moved by the afflictions they suffer, but stand fast in the faith, hold fast the profession of it, go on in their Christian course, and hold out to the end; for such shall be saved, not only with a temporal salvation, but with an eternal one."

### John Wesley:
1. Of all men â€” That know not God. Matthew 24:13.
