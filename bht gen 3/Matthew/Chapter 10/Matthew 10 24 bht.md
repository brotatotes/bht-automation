They should be prepared for reproach and persecution, understanding that even their Lord, with his superior character and dignity, was not spared insults.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Disciples must be content with no worse treatment than their Master, for they should not expect any better. As the teacher is to the disciple, the Lord is to the servant, and the master of the house is to the members of the household. Christ's followers cannot aspire to a higher honor than being on the same level as their master. They should not refuse to share in the same conditions to which he willingly submitted. Just as their Lord faced reproach and persecution, they too should be prepared for the same, knowing that if he, with his superior character and dignity, could not escape insults, they, being inferior, should not expect to either.

- Attempt 4 BHT: Disciples should not expect a better fate than their Master, but rather be content if they face no worse. The threefold relationship between Jesus and His followers is exemplified in Scripture: the master of the house and the household, the teacher and the disciple, and the Lord and the servant. As the disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord, Christ's followers should not anticipate more favorable treatment than He received, thereby signifying His empathy. This verse serves to strengthen the minds of disciples in the face of reproach and persecution, reminding them that if Jesus, their Lord, was not spared from insults, they too cannot hope to avoid them.
