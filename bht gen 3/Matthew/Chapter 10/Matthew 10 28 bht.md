# Matthew 10:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Fear not those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul, but rather fear God who has power over both life and death. The disciples are reminded that their Heavenly Father is the sole object of childlike trust and fear. While earthly opposition can harm the body, it cannot touch the soul. However, God, as the dispenser of life and death, can destroy both body and soul in hell. This emphasizes the importance of reverencing and obeying God, as the torment of the lost affects both the material and spiritual aspects of our nature.
