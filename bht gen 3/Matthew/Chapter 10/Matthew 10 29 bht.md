### John Calvin:

2. "Now, Christ declares that each of the creatures in particular is under his hand and protection, so that nothing is left to chance. Unquestionably, the will of God is contrasted with contingence or uncertainty."
3. "We ought to contemplate Providence, not as curious and fickle persons are wont to do, but as a ground of confidence and excitement to prayer. When he informs us that the hairs of our head are all numbered, it is not to encourage trivial speculations, but to instruct us to depend on the fatherly care of God which is exercised over these frail bodies."

1. "Two sparrows (Œ¥œÖŒø œÉœÑœÅŒøœÖŒ∏ŒπŒ±)...sparrows in particular."

### John Gill:
1. "And this was the common price of two sparrows. Our Lord appeals to his disciples, for the truth of it, as a thing well known: according to the question in Luke, five sparrows were sold for two farthings, which makes them somewhat cheaper still. This shows they were of little account."
2. "The design of Christ is to assert the doctrine of providence, as reaching to all creatures and things, even the most minute and worthless: he instances not in men, nor in the beasts of the field, but in the fowls of the air, and in those of the inferior sort, and more useless, in sparrows, yea in little sparrows; as the word may be rendered."
3. "Much such a way of arguing is used by the Jews, who say, 'a bird without God does not perish, much less a man'. And again, 'a bird without God does not fly away, much less the soul of a man'."
