## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Bartholomew, i.e. in Heb., son of Talmai or Tolom Ã¦ us, has been generally supposed to be the same with Nathanael of Cana in Galilee."
2. "Thomas, in Greek Didymus (the twin)."
3. "Matthew the publican is clearly by this appellation identified with the Matthew of ch. ix. 9."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Bartholomew is not so properly an individual's name as a family surname."
2. "Matthew the publicanâ€”In none of the four lists of the Twelve is this apostle so branded but in his own."
3. "James the son of Alphaeusâ€”the same person apparently who is called Cleopas or Clopas."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Philip was a native of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
2. "Bartholomew (literally, 'the son of Tolmai')."
3. "Thomas - Literally, 'a twin,' in reference to which he is also called 'Didymus.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Matthew the publican, the writer of the Gospel, who inserts his previous employment as a token of the power of grace."
2. "Lebbeus, whose surname (or other name) was Thaddeus. Both have the same meaning, â€˜courageous.â€™ He was also called â€˜Judasâ€™; was probably the brother of James, â€˜the son of Alpheus,â€™ and the author of the short Epistle of Jude."
3. "It is as likely that there was a great number of persons about our Lord called James, Judas, and Simon, as that two of the Apostles mentioned together were not brothers, although the father of each was named Alpheus."

### John Gill:
1. "Thomas, and Matthew the publican: [...] puts Thomas first, which is an instance of his modesty; and also calls himself the 'publican', which the other do not: this he mentions, to magnify the grace of God in his vocation."
2. "James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus: the former of these is so called, to distinguish him from James, the son of Zebedee. This is the James, who was the brother of our Lord, Galatians 1:19 and is called 'James the less', Mark 15:40."
3. "His surname Thaddaeus, is thought by some to be a deflexion of Jude; or Judas, and as coming from the same root, ×™×“×”, which signifies 'to praise', or 'give thanks'; or from the Syriac word, ×ª×“, 'a breast', and may be so called for the same reason as he was Lebbaeus."

### John Wesley:
1. Lebbeus â€” Commonly called Judas, the brother of James.
