# Matthew 10:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly follow Christ, we must love Him above all else, surpassing even the closest family ties. If we are not willing to give up earthly possessions and forsake earthly relationships in order to obey Him, then our attachment to Him is not genuine. This devotion to Christ may seem extreme, but it is a love that is reserved solely for the divine. No one is inherently worthy of Christ, but the love He imparts creates the love He demands, serving as the reward for our trials and sacrifices.
