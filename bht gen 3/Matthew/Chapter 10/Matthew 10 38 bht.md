# Matthew 10:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus first introduced the concept of taking up one's own cross to his disciples, it must have seemed strange and unfamiliar, as crucifixion was not a Jewish form of punishment. This saying emphasized the preparedness to go forth even to the extreme of crucifixion for the sake of Christ. The image of carrying one's own cross was borrowed from the practice of criminals being required to bear their own cross to their execution. It signifies the specific afflictions that believers must bear individually for Christ, which may include various trials, reproaches, persecutions, and even death itself.
