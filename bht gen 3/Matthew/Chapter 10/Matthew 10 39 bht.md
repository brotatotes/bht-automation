# Matthew 10:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever finds their life in this world, preserving their own comfort and security, will lose the true life offered by Christ. This life, the higher and eternal one, is found by those willing to sacrifice the temporal for the sake of the spiritual. It is a paradoxical saying of Christ, reflecting the necessary surrender of the lower life to attain the higher one. By embracing self-denial and being willing to give up everything for Christ, we find the true life in God and gain eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In Luke ix. 23, the taking up of the cross is to be 'daily;' in ch. xvi. 24||Mk. 'let him deny himself' is joined with it. Thus we have the crucifying of the life of this world,‚Äîthe death to sin spoken of Rom. vi. 4‚Äì11, and life unto God."
2. "But besides the primary meaning of this saying as regards the laying down of life literally for Christ‚Äôs sake, we cannot fail to recognize in it a far deeper sense, in which he who loses his life shall find it."
3. "And this life unto God is the real, true life, which the self-denier shall find, and preserve unto life eternal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it." 
2. "The pith of such paradoxical maxims depends on the double sense attached to the word 'life' - a lower and a higher, the natural and the spiritual, the temporal and eternal." 
3. "An entire sacrifice of the lower, with all its relationships and interests - or, a willingness to make it which is the same thing - is indispensable to the preservation of the higher life; and he who cannot bring himself to surrender the one for the sake of the other shall eventually lose both."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that is anxious to save his 'temporal' life, or his comfort and security here, shall lose 'eternal' life, or shall fail of heaven."
2. "He that is willing to risk or lose his comfort and 'life' here for my sake, shall find 'life' everlasting, or shall be saved."
3. "The manner of speaking is similar to that where he said, 'Let the dead bury their dead.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our Lord looked back in thought to each man's past, and forward to its appropriate consummation in the future."
2. "He who is truly a man ought not to care about living a certain time: he knows, as women say, that we must all die, and therefore he is not fond of life; he leaves all that with God, and considers in what way he can best spend his appointed term."
3. "Who knows if life be not death, and death life?"

### John Calvin:
1. "He who findeth his life Lest the former doctrine, which is very difficult and troublesome to the flesh, should have little weight with us, Christ confirms it in two ways by this statement."
2. "We know that there is nothing which men will not do or leave undone for the sake of life, (so powerful is that attachment to it which is natural to us all;) and, therefore, it was necessary that Christ should employ such promises and threatenings in exciting his followers to despise death."
3. "To support this sentiment he immediately adds two comparisons, of which Matthew takes no notice: but as the subject treated is substantially the same, I have not scrupled to introduce in this place what we find in Luke."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Life is here used in two senses; otherwise the paradoxical statement would have no meaning at all."
2. "Christ must be loved more than life itself."
3. "He gave His life for us, and therefore asks us to give our lives for Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Wisdom of Sirach (Hebrew text) in 51:26 has: 'He that giveth his life findeth her (wisdom).'"
2. "It is one of the profound sayings of Christ that he repeated many times."
3. "The article and aorist participles here (Œø ŒµœÖœÅœâŒΩ, Œø Œ±œÄŒøŒªŒµœÉŒ±œÇ) are timeless in themselves just like Œø Œ¥ŒµœáŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ in verses Matthew 10:40 and Matthew 10:41."

### John Gill:
1. "He that findeth his life shall lose it...yet he is sure to lose the happy and eternal life of his soul and body, in the world to come."
2. "That man that is willing to forego the present advantages of life, to suffer reproach and persecution, and lay down his life cheerfully for the sake of Christ and his Gospel...shall find his soul possessed of eternal life, as soon as separated from his body."
3. "Shall find his corporal life again, in the resurrection morn, to great advantage; and shall live with Christ in soul and body, in the utmost happiness, to all eternity."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that saves his life by denying me, shall lose it eternally; and he that loseth his life by confessing me, shall save it eternally."
2. "And as you shall be thus rewarded, so in proportion shall they who entertain you for my sake."
3. "Matthew 16:25; John 12:25."
