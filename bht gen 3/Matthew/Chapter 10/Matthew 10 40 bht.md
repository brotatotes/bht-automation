## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "On the sense of the verse, see John xx. 21, and on him that sent me, 'I send you,' ver. 16, and Heb. iii. 1."
3. "There is a difference between the representation of Christ by His messengers, which at most is only official, and even then broken by personal imperfection and infirmity... and the perfect unbroken representation of the Eternal Father by His Blessed Son, John xiv. 9: Heb. i. 3."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me." 
2. "As the treatment which an ambassador receives is understood and regarded as expressing the light in which he that sends him is viewed, so, says our Lord here, 'Your authority is Mine, as Mine is My Father's.'"
3. "Your authority is Mine, as Mine is My Father's."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whatever is done to them, Christ does not hesitate to reckon as done to himself."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The reception is not merely a welcome of the disciples to the house, but of their message to the heart. The language is not entirely figurative. Those who welcome the men, are most apt to welcome the truth they bear, and thus the Master they represent."
3. "He that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me, i.e., God. Receiving the servant of Christ is receiving God. Applicable to all true Christians."

2. "If ye receive him, it is all one as if you received me."
3. "That a man's messenger is as himself."
