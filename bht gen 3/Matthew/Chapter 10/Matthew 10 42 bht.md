By doing these acts in the name of a disciple, out of love for Christ, we can be assured that our efforts will not go unrewarded. Even the least significant acts of hospitality and care for these little ones hold great value in the eyes of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Hardly, as some think, to the despised and meanly-esteemed for Christâ€™s sake."
2. "I should rather imagine some children may have been present: for of such does our Lord elsewhere use this term."
3. "Though perhaps the expression may be meant of lower and less advanced converts, thus keeping up the gradation from the prophet."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little onesâ€”Beautiful epithet! Originally taken from Zechariah 13:7. The reference is to their lowliness in spirit, their littleness in the eyes of an undiscerning world, while high in Heaven's esteem."
2. "a cup of cold water onlyâ€”meaning, the smallest service."
3. "verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his rewardâ€”There is here a descending climaxâ€”'a prophet,' 'a righteous man,' 'a little one'; signifying that however low we come down in our services to those that are Christ's, all that is done for His sake, and that bears the stamp of love to His blessed name, shall be divinely appreciated and owned and rewarded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A cup of cold water only. The smallest kindness."
2. "In the name of a disciple, 'because he is a disciple,' out of love to Christ His master."
3. "Thus those who went out to persecution, to cast a sword into the world, to be hated of all, and holding loosely to their lives for Christâ€™s sake, bestowed blessings by their very presence."

### John Gill:
1. "Whosoever takes notice but of 'one' of these, receives him into his house, and gives him a cup of cold water only, is regarded, a phrase used to express the least favour, or benefit whatever."
2. "Now whosoever takes notice of, and shows favour to the meanest of Christ's people, though it be but bestowing so small a benefit as a cup of cold water; yet, if it is done in the name of a disciple, or because that poor person is a disciple of Christ, verily, says Christ, I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward."
3. "The Jews say many things in praise of hospitality, to 'a disciple of a wise man'; and observe that he that hospitably entertains such an one in his house, and causes him to eat and drink, and partake of the goods of his house, there is reason to believe, he shall be much more blessed than the house of Obed Edom was for the ark's sake."

### John Wesley:
1. One of these little ones â€” The very least Christian. Mark 9:41.
