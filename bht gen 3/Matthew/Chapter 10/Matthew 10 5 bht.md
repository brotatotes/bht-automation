# Matthew 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostles were sent on a mission to prepare for Jesus, but their instructions also apply to missionaries and ministers. The prohibition against going to the Gentiles and the Samaritans was to give the Jews the first opportunity to hear the Gospel without prejudice. It was important to prioritize reaching the Jewish people first, as the full time for preaching to Gentiles had not yet come. The Samaritans, being descendants of those transported and partially instructed in the Jewish religion, occupied an intermediate position between the Jews and Gentiles.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The primary reference of this verse is to the mission of the Apostles, who were sent to prepare the way for Jesus. However, these instructions also prophetically apply to all ministers and missionaries of the Gospel throughout history. The location and purpose of their mission are outlined in the first few verses, with further details on how they were to proceed. The Apostles were initially prohibited from going to the Gentiles and the Samaritans, who occupied an intermediate position between the Jews and Gentiles. This prohibition was lifted later on, and the Apostles were instructed to be witnesses first in Jerusalem, then in Judea, Samaria, and eventually to the uttermost parts of the earth. The pairing of the Apostles and the use of the word sent forth reflect their role as ambassadors or messengers. The prohibition against going among the Gentiles and Samaritans during this initial mission was to give the Jews the first opportunity to hear the Gospel without prejudice. Ultimately, the full time for preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles had not yet come, and it was important to prioritize reaching the Jewish people first, who would form the basis of the Christian Church.
