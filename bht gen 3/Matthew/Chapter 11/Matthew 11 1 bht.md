## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The form to which I allude is this: John having heard all these reports, being himself fully convinced Who this Wonderworker was, was becoming impatient under the slow and unostentatious course of our Lord's self-manifestation, and desired to obtain from our Lord's own mouth a declaration which should set such rumours at rest."
2. "And the return message is so far from being a satisfaction designed for the disciples, that they are sent back like the messenger from Gabii to Sextus Tarquinius, with indeed a significant narrative to relate, but no direct answer; they were but the intermediate transmitters of the symbolic message, known to Him who sent it, and him who received it."
3. "It is a fact not to be neglected in connexion with this solution of the difficulty, that John is said to have heard of the works, not of Jesus, but of (the) Christ: the only place where that name, standing alone, is given to our Lord in this Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They departed, and went through, the towns, preaching the Gospel, and healing everywhere."
2. "They cast out many devils (demons) and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them."
3. "Though this 'anointing with oil' was not mentioned in our Lord's instructionsâ€”at least in any of the records of themâ€”we know it to have been practiced long after this in the apostolic Church."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "The directions to the apostles were given in the vicinity of Capernaum."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Their cities [Î±Ï…Ï„Ï‰Î½]. The towns of those to whom he came - the Galilaeans."
3. "Compare Matthew 4:23."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not desist from the exercise of his office, while the Apostles were laboring in another direction."

2. "Note both 'teach and preach' as in Matthew 4:23."
