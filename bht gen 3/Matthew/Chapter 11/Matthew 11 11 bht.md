John the Baptist, the greatest among those born of women, is still surpassed by the least in the kingdom of heaven.

This verse signifies the transition from the old covenant to the new, where the ministers of the Gospel are far superior to John, and the kingdom of heaven, with its complete redemption and eternal satisfaction in Christ, is proclaimed.
