### Marvin Vincent:

### John Gill:
1. "the kingdom of heaven, the Gospel, and the ministry of it, first by John, then by Christ and his apostles, suffereth violence; or 'comes with force', and power upon the souls of men."
2. "and which was further seen, in the manner it did all this; suddenly, secretly, powerfully, and effectually, and yet not against the wills of men; and by such instruments as the apostles were, poor, sinful, mortal men; despised by the world, and attended with opposition and persecution."
3. "the Gospel's suffering violence by the persecutions of its enemies opposing and contradicting it, reproaching it, intimidating the professors of it, and seeking to take away the life of Christ, the great subject of it."
