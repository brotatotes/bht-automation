- Attempt 1 BHT: John the Baptist marked the beginning of a new era, closing the chapter of the old dispensation guided by the prophets and the law of Moses. The law and the prophets, though they represented God through figures and shadows, did not present Him before the eyes of men. John's preaching, part of the Gospel, was a first lesson, speaking plainly about the coming of Christ.

In light of these teachings, it is highly irresponsible for individuals to remain indifferent when the presence of God has been made known to them.
