# Matthew 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These words are often used by our Lord when there is a deeper meaning in His words. If John the Baptist is Elias and the forerunner of the Lord, then the Lord is come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. This proverbial expression implies that the highest attention should be given to what was spoken. The comparison that follows suggests that few would receive the truth about John or have ears to hear the glad news of the Messiah's presence. Mutual influence can hinder the fruit of God's speaking to others.
