# Matthew 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Both Tyre and Sidon are mentioned as examples of the lesser towns in which Jesus performed miracles. Despite their wealth, they had faced God's judgment, yet still existed. The phrase repented...in sackcloth and ashes alludes to mourning and repentance. These cities symbolize the entire region favored with the presence and teachings of Jesus, but their overthrow was prophesied due to their luxury, irreligion, and moral degeneracy. This highlights the meagerness of our knowledge of Judaism during Christ's time and the severity of the future fate of these towns.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both this and Chorazin appear to be put as examples of the lesser towns in which our Lord had wrought his miracles." 
2. "Tyre and Sidon] These wealthy cities, so often the subject of prophecy, had been chastised by Godâ€™s judgment under Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander, but still existed."
3. "repented... in sackcloth and ashes is probably an allusion to Jonah iii. 6, or to general Eastern custom."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These two cities appear to be singled out to denote the whole region in which they layâ€”a region favored with the Redeemer's presence, teaching, and works above every other."
2. "As their wealth and prosperity engendered luxury and its concomitant evilsâ€”irreligion and moral degeneracyâ€”their overthrow was repeatedly foretold in ancient prophecy, and once and again fulfilled by victorious enemies."
3. "Remarkable language, showing that they had done less violence to conscience, and so, in God's sight, were less criminal than the region here spoken of."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bethsaida means literally a 'house of hunting' or 'a house of game,' and it was probably situated on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, and supported itself by hunting or fishing." 
2. "Tyre and Sidon - These were cities of Phoenicia, formerly very opulent, and distinguished for merchandise." 
3. "In sackcloth and ashes - Sackcloth was a coarse cloth, like canvas, used for the dress of the poor, and for the more common articles of domestic economy."

### John Calvin:
1. "There was not one of them who did not look upon the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon as abominable despisers of God. It is, therefore, no small heightening of his curse, when Christ says, that there would have been more hope of reformation from those places in which there was no religion, than is to be seen in Judea itself." 
2. "Comparing the citizens of Bethsaida, and their neighbors, with the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, he reasons, not of what God foresaw would be done either by the one or by the other, but of what both parties would have done, so far as could be judged from the facts."
3. "Let us, therefore, aware of our own weakness, learn to contemplate this height and depth with reverence; for it is intolerable fretfulness and pride that is manifested by those who cannot endure to ascribe praise to the righteousness of God, except so far as it comes within the reach of their senses, and who disdainfully reject those mysteries, which it was their duty to adore, simply because the reason of them is not fully evident."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The places of less importance come first."
2. "Our Lord claims knowledge of contingent spiritual events."
3. "The symbol of mourning and repentance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Proof of 'the meagreness of our knowledge of Judaism in the time of Christ' (Plummer) and of the many things not told in our Gospels." 
2. "We know something of Bethsaida and more about Capernaum as places of privilege." 
3. "Note condition of the second class, determined as unfulfilled in verses Matthew 11:21 and Matthew 11:23."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are to be understood in a popular sense, as Grotius observes, and express what was probable, according to an human judgment of things."
2. "The words are an hyperbolical exaggeration of the wickedness of those cities, like to Ezekiel 3:5 showing, that they were worse than the Tyrians and Sidonians; an Heathenish and idolatrous people, who lived very profligate and dissolute lives, in all intemperance, luxury, and impiety; and therefore would be punished in a severer way."
3. "Neither this passage, nor what follows, can be any proof of God's giving sufficient grace to all men alike, which in some is effectual to conversion, and in others not, but of the contrary; since the men of Tyre and Sidon had not the same means, or the same grace, as the inhabitants of the other cities."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wo to thee, Chorazin â€” That is, miserable art thou. For these are not curses or imprecations, as has been commonly supposed; but a solemn, compassionate declaration of the misery they were bringing on themselves."
2. "Moreover I say unto you â€” Beside the general denunciation of wo to those stubborn unbelievers, the degree of their misery will be greater than even that of Tyre and Sidon, yea, of Sodom."
