Chorazin and Bethsaida, who witnessed mighty works yet did not repent, face a woe, while Tyre and Sidon will experience a more tolerable punishment on the day of judgment. The punishment of these city dwellers will be in proportion to their sins; the greater the sins, the more intolerable the condemnation and punishment. This reveals that not all sins are equal, and God's justice demands varying degrees of torment in hell.
