# Matthew 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Father, I wholeheartedly acknowledge and thank You for the justice of Your ways. Your mysterious arrangements bring condemnation to the prideful and salvation to the humble and childlike. It is through a simple and teachable spirit that these truths are revealed, while the wise and clever of this world remain blind to them. Even in the rejection of Your message, it is the pride of their hearts that hinders understanding, displaying the brilliance of Your truth. May we, as forgiven sinners, listen and learn from You, wholly dependent on Your grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I confess to Thee, â€˜I recognize the justice of Thy doings;â€™ viz. in the words Even so, Father, &c."
2. "[God's] mysterious arrangements, by which the sinner is condemned in his pride and unbelief, the humble and childlike saved, and God justified."
3. "These are â€˜revealedâ€™ to those who can in a simple and teachable spirit, as babes, obey the invitation in vv. 28â€“30, but â€˜hiddenâ€™ from the wise and clever of this world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yes; but there is a brighter side to the picture; even in those who have rejected the message of eternal life, it is the pride of their own hearts only which has blinded them, and the glory of the truth does but the more appear in their inability to receive it."
2. "I assent to thee. But this is not strong enough. The idea of 'full' or 'cordial' concurrence is conveyed by the preposition. The thing expressed is adoring acquiescence, holy satisfaction with that law of the divine procedure about to be mentioned."
3. "Because it is not for the offending and revolted to speak or to speculate, but to listen to Him from whom we have broken loose, that we may learn whether there be any recovery for us at all and if there be, on what principlesâ€”of what natureâ€”to what ends."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I thank [ÎµÎ¾Î¿Î¼Î¿Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Ï…Î¼Î±Î¹]. Compare Matthew 3:6, of confessing sins. Lit., I confess. I recognize the justice and wisdom of thy doings." 
2. "Prudent [ÏƒÏ…Î½ÎµÏ„Ï‰Î½]. Rev., understanding; Wyc., wary. From the verb sunihmi, to bring together, and denoting that peculiarity of mind which brings the simple features of an object into a whole. Hence comprehension, insight."
3. "Wise [ÏƒÎ¿Ï†Ï‰Î½] and understanding are often joined, as here. The general distinction is between productive and reflective wisdom, but the distinction is not always recognized by the writer."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let it be observed, also, that the discourse is addressed to the Father, and consequently is marked by greater energy than if he had spoken to his disciples."
2. "It was on their behalf, no doubt, and for their sake, that he gave thanks to the Father, that they might not be displeased with the low and mean aspect of his Church."
3. "True, humble persons have Christ for their master, and the first lesson of faith is, Let no man presume on his wisdom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I fully confess, thankfully acknowledge the justice of thy doings."
2. "Those most learned and sagacious in all earthly things often cannot understand the simplest truths of Christianity."
3. "Those despised by the world, because often ignorant of what it values, or considered 'babes,' because they believe like little children what their Heavenly Father reveals to them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is usual to call this golden utterance a prayer, but it is at once prayer, praise, and self-communing in a devout spirit." 
2. "The only satisfying explanation lies in the fact that Jesus did have this strain of teaching that is preserved in John's Gospel."
3. "Jesus praises the Father 'not that the ÏƒÎ¿Ï†Î¿ were ignorant, but that the Î½Î·Ï€Î¹Î¿ knew'."

### John Gill:
1. "I thank thee, 0 Father, Lord of heaven and earth." 
2. "The things of the Gospel are hidden from them" (referring to the wise and prudent). 
3. "To such souls God reveals the covenant of his grace, Christ, and all the blessings of grace in him, the mysteries of the Gospel, and the unseen glories of another world."

### John Wesley:
1. "I thank thee - That is, I acknowledge and joyfully adore the justice and mercy of thy dispensations..." 
2. "Because thou hast hid - That is, because thou hast suffered these things to be hid from men, who are in other respects wise and prudent, while thou hast discovered them to those of the weakest understanding..."
3. "...to them who are only wise to Godward."
