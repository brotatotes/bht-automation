## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Learn of Me, both 'from My example,' which however is the lower sense of the words, and 'from My teaching,' from which alone the rest can flow."
2. "Thus we have it revealed here, that the rest and joy of the Christian soul is, to become like Christ: to attain by His teaching this meekness and lowliness of His."
3. "Olshausen makes an excellent distinction between lowly in heart, an attribute of divine Love in the Saviour, and lowly, or poor, in spirit, ch. v. 3: Prov. xxix. 23, which can only be said of sinful man, knowing his unworthiness and need of help."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Take my yoke upon youâ€”the yoke of subjection to Jesus."
2. "And learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls."
3. "As Christ's willingness to empty Himself to the uttermost of His Father's requirements was the spring of ineffable repose to His own Spirit, so in the same track does He invite all to follow Him, with the assurance of the same experience."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let anyone compare them with the burdensome and expensive ceremonies of the Jews, or with the religious rites of the pagan everywhere, or with the requirements of the Popish system, and he will see how true it is that Jesusâ€™ yoke is easy."
2. "And let his laws and requirements be compared with the laws which sin imposes on its votaries - the laws of fashion, and honor, and sensuality - and he will feel that religion is 'freedom.'"
3. "It is 'easier' to be a Christian than a sinner; and of all the yokes ever imposed on people, that of the Redeemer is the lightest."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "One of the most common figurative expressions of the time was that of the yoke for submission to an occupation or obligation."
2. "The Savior's words must have had a special significance to those who remembered this lesson; and they would now understand how, by coming to the Savior, they would first take on them the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, and then that of the commandments, finding this yoke easy and the burden light."
3. "The rest of Christ is twofold - given and found. It is given in pardon and reconciliation. It is found under the yoke and the burden; in the development of Christian experience, as more and more the 'strain passes over' from self to Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not, he tells us, absolve men from their sins in such a manner, that, restored to the favor of God, they may sin with greater freedom, but that, raised up by his grace, they may also take his yoke upon them..." 
2. "It is a mistake, I think, to suppose that Christ here assures us of his meekness...It is rather his design to form us to the imitation of himself, because the obstinacy of the flesh leads us to shrink from his yoke as harsh and uneasy." 
3. "So long as the flesh kicks, we rebel; and those who refuse the yoke of Christ, and endeavor to appease God in any other manner, distress and waste themselves in vain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The â€˜meek and lowlyâ€™ One can teach us this first lesson."
2. "Humility is the first requisite in learning of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But Jesus offers refreshment in his school and promises to make the burden light, for he is a meek and humble teacher."
2. "Humility was not a virtue among the ancients. It was ranked with servility. Jesus has made a virtue of this vice. He has glorified this attitude."
3. "The yoke of Christ is useful, good, and kindly."

### John Gill:
1. "A man must first take upon him the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, and after that take upon him the 'yoke' of the commandment."
2. "Those who come to him for life, and believe in him, as the Saviour of their souls, though they are not to trust in, and depend upon any duties performed by them; yet they are not to sit still, or lay aside the performance of good works, or live a licentious course of life, but are always to be doing the will and work of their Lord."
3. "There never was such an instance of humility, and lowliness of mind, as Christ; nor is there any example so worthy of our imitation as his."

### John Wesley:
1. "Take my yoke upon you â€” Believe in me: receive me as your prophet, priest, and king."
