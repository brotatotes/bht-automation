2. "On this point, accordingly, he does not raise a doubt, but only inquires if Jesus be that promised Redeemer; for, having been persuaded of the redemption promised in the Law and the Prophets, they were bound to receive it when exhibited in the person of Christ."
3. "Resting on the truth of God, [faith] does not gaze on all sides, does not vary, but is satisfied with Christ alone, and will not be turned to another."

1. "John was temporarily in depression and doubt, respecting the slow and unostentatious mode of Christâ€™s manifestation, and the true nature of his kingdom."
2. "Johnâ€™s disciples (not himself) were in doubt, and he sent them to be instructed; the opinion of some of the Fathers. This saves Johnâ€™s orthodoxy at the expense of his morality."

2. "John could not be ignorant of this, who had seen the Spirit of God descending on him at his baptism, heard a voice from heaven, declaring him the Son of God; and had so often pointed him out to others, and had borne frequent testimonies that he was the Lamb of God, and bridegroom of his church."
3. "John, with the rest of the Jews, having a notion of a temporal kingdom, and hearing of the mighty works of Christ, wonders that he himself was not delivered out of prison by him, grows impatient upon it, and asks, if he was the Messiah? And if he was, why did he suffer his forerunner and chief minister to lie in prison?"

### John Wesley:
1. He that is to come â€” The Messiah.
