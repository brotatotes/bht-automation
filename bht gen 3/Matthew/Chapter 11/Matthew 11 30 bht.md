# Matthew 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rest that Christ offers can be seen as both a yoke and a burden, representing the struggle and sorrow that come from our sinful nature. However, this yoke is light, providing a peace that surpasses understanding and upholds the soul. Christ's yoke is described as wholesome, serviceable, and kindly, encompassing all of these meanings. While it may not be easy in the ordinary sense, it is a gracious and beneficial yoke that makes all other burdens light and easy to bear.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "But it is a light yoke; the inner rest in the soul giving a peace which passeth understanding, and bearing it up against all." 
3. "See 2 Cor. iv. 16."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Matchless paradox, even among the paradoxically couched maxims in which our Lord delights!"
2. "That rest which the soul experiences when once safe under Christ's wing makes all yokes easy, all burdens light."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Clear proof has been furnished that Jesus is the Christ and can save us."
3. "The poor and needy; the weary and heavy-ladened; the soul sick of sin and of the world; the sinner conscious of guilt and afraid to die, may come to Jesus Christ and live."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ's yoke is not easy in the ordinary sense of that word. The word means originally, good, serviceable."

2. "Christ indeed demands a righteousness exceeding that of the Scribes and Pharisees, and teaches us that there is a depth of meaning in the law, which our consciences did not perceive; yet. He says that His yoke, His requirements, are wholesome, and His burden, oftentimes a cross, is light!"
3. "Saved by Him, indeed, as Augustine says, the yoke is like the plumage of the bird, an easy weight enabling it to soar heavenward."

### John Gill:
1. "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light." 
2. "His commandments are not grievous, hard and heavy to be borne, as theirs were, but easy and light."
3. "The commands of Christ, and the ordinances of the Gospel, are so in comparison of the law of Moses; which required perfect obedience, but gave no strength to perform, and threatened with condemnation and death, in case of the least failure."

### John Wesley:
1. For my yoke is easy â€” Or rather gracious, sweet, benign, delightful: and my burden - Contrary to those of men, is ease, liberty, and honour.
