2. "However mean any person may be, his poverty is so far from being a ground of despair, that it ought rather to animate him with courage to seek Christ."
3. "None are accounted poor but those who are really such, or, in other words, who lie low and overwhelmed by a conviction of their poverty."

### Philip Schaff:
