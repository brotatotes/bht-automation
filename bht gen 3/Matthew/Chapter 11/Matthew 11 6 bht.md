# Matthew 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Happy is the one who does not stumble or take offense at Jesus. Even John the Baptist, who had doubts while in the fog, found some occasion of stumbling in Jesus. But those who can see beyond Jesus' poverty and obscurity and recognize the evidence of his Messiahship will be blessed. We should not be surprised if we encounter offenses and obstacles along the way. Christ himself is often a stumbling-block, despised and disfigured, but it is those who steadfastly adhere to the faith of the Gospel that will be happy and not be offended by him.
