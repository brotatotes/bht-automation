The repetition of the question and the order of the answers bring attention to the remarkable nature of the third response, which highlights the true purpose of John's pilgrimage and his holy office. It contrasts his appearance in soft raiment with that of a proud earthly prince, emphasizing that he is the preacher of repentance before a humble and suffering Savior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The repetition of this question, and the order of the suggestive answers, are remarkable."
2. "The third brings before them the real object of their pilgrimage in his holy office, and even amplifies that office itself."
3. "Such an one, in soft raiment, might be the forerunner of a proud earthly prince, but not the preacher of repentance before a humble and suffering Saviour."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Clothed in soft raiment - The kind of raiment here denoted was the light, thin clothing worn by effeminate persons."
2. "This kind of clothing was an emblem of riches, splendor, effeminacy, feebleness of character."
3. "He meant to say that John was a man of a different stamp - coarse in his exterior, hardy in his character, firm in his virtue, suited to endure trials and privations, and thus qualified to be the forerunner of the toiling and suffering Messiah."

### John Calvin:
1. "There are many other passages in which luxury of dress, and excessive attention to outward appearance, are censured."
2. "But this passage simply means, that there was nothing in the wilderness to attract the people from every quarter; that every thing there was rude and unpolished, and fitted only to inspire disgust."
3. "Such elegance of dress as delights the eyes is rather to be looked for in the courts of kings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A man clothed in soft raiment? An allusion to the coarseness of Johnâ€™s clothing (chap. Matthew 4:3)."
2. "Behold. This is equivalent to, â€˜oh no, such are not found in the wilderness.â€™"
3. "In kingsâ€™ houses; not in kingsâ€™ prisons. An allusion to the courtiers about Herod Antipas. John was not a flatterer nor had he drawn back from his testimony to Jesus to escape from prison or from any selfish motive. Thus our Lord defends His forerunner from the suspicion of the multitude."

### John Gill:
1. "No, behold they that wear soft clothing, or, as Luke says, are 'gorgeously apparelled'; to which he adds, and live delicately, are in kings' houses, or 'courts'; not in a desert, where John came preaching, nor in a prison, where he now was."
2. "He was no light, inconstant, flattering person, as generally courtiers are; had he, he would not have been in a prison; it was for his uprightness and faithfulness, in reproving Herod the king, that he was in such a place and condition."
3. "Thus from his very garb and diet, his character is vindicated from the charge of levity and change."

### John Wesley:
1. "A man clothed in soft, delicate raiment."
2. "An effeminate courtier, accustomed to fawning and flattery?"
3. "You may expect to find persons of such a character in palaces; not in a wilderness."
