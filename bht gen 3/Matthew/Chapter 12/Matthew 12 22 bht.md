- Attempt 1 BHT: A demonized person who was blind and unable to speak was brought to Jesus, and he healed this individual to the extent that they could both speak and see. It is clear that this man had become blind and had lost the ability to speak, but it was not due to any physical defects. Rather, it was a result of being possessed by a demon. Satan, who is permitted by God to corrupt and distort all aspects of the soul, had taken control of this individual's senses. However, Jesus, without the need for medicine or physical intervention, simply spoke a word and the demon was cast out. Consequently, the blindness and inability to speak were eliminated, restoring both sight and speech to the man. This miracle allowed him to not only see his Savior but also praise His name. The true nature of the disorder and its cure were revealed by the Holy Spirit, even though many likely assumed these impairments to be natural. This serves as a reminder that there may be seemingly natural disorders today that are actually manifestations of demonic influence.
