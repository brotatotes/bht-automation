# Matthew 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were amazed and almost beside themselves with excitement when they witnessed this remarkable miracle. They asked one another, Is this the Son of David? Can it possibly be? They did not directly assert it for fear of the wrath of the ecclesiastics who were hostile towards Jesus. Nevertheless, they acknowledged the power of God and were led to consider more attentively the glory of Christ. While not all of them profited as much as they should have, they were certainly moved to faith by this extraordinary demonstration of divine power.
