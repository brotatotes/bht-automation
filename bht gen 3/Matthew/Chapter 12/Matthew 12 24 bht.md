3. "The opinion expressed by the scribes, that there is a prince among wicked spirits, did not arise from a mistake of the common people, or from supposition, but from a conviction entertained among the godly, that the reprobate have a head, in the same manner as Christ is the Head of the Church."

"They could not deny the miracle, or that it was one; but to deprive him of the glory of it, and even reproach him for it, and to bring him into contempt with the people, they not only speak of him in a scornful manner, Î¿Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï‚, 'this' sorry man, 'this' vile fellow; but ascribe the miracle he wrought to familiarity with the devil, to diabolical influence and skill in magic art."
2. "They pretended he was in confederacy with Satan, and was carrying on his interest: and therefore, that he might gain credit and reputation, the prince of devils suffered the inferior ones to remove at his word."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 3:22.
