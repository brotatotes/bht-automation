## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is at first sight a difficulty in the argument which our Saviour draws from the oneness of the kingdom of Satan: viz. that it seems the very idea of this kingdom, that it should be this anarchy; blind rage and hate not only against God, but each part of it warring against every other part."
2. "Just as a nation or kingdom may embrace within itself infinite parties, divisions, discords, jealousies, and heartburnings: yet, if it is to subsist as a nation at all, it must not, as regards other nations, have lost its sense of unity; when it does so, of necessity it falls to pieces and perishes."
3. "Our Lord here in the most solemn manner re-asserts and confirms the truths respecting the kingdom of evil which the Jews also held. The kingdoms are so set parallel with one another, that the denial of the reality of the one with its chief, or the supposing it founded merely in assent on the part of our Lord to Jewish notions, inevitably brings with it the same conclusions with regard to the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And Jesus knew their thoughtsâ€”'called them'"
2. "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not standâ€”'house', that is, 'household'"
3. "-"

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reproved them with the greater severity, because he was a witness and judge of their inward malice."
2. "There is no community of interest between him and Satan, because that father of cunning keeps one object in view â€” the preservation of his kingdom."
3. "Everybody knew that Christ had driven Satan from his possession, and nothing was plainer than that all his miracles tended to this object; and hence it was easy to conclude, that his power, which was so much opposed to Satan, was divine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He perceived not only that they opposed, but their very thoughts."
2. "This organized kingdom of darkness, because it is only evil, is racked with discords and hatred, but against the kingdom of God it is a unit."
3. "An organization which acts against itself, its own distinctive aims, must destroy itself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By parables, by a series of conditions (first class), by sarcasm, by rhetorical question, by merciless logic, he lays bare their hollow insincerity and the futility of their arguments." 
2. "Satan does not cast out Satan." 
3. "Christ is engaged in deathless conflict with Satan the strong man."

### John Gill:
1. "He not only heard their blasphemous words, but was privy to their secret thoughts; he knew their vile malicious intentions and designs."
2. "A government, in which there is a disagreement between the chiefs of it, and the body of the people... cannot continue in any comfortable situation, and flourishing state, but must come to nothing."
3. "If citizens fall out with their magistrates, or one with another, and turn out, and disfranchise each other; and if the heads of families, and the respective branches thereof, quarrel with, and divide from one another, a dissolution of the whole must ensue."

### John Wesley:
1. Jesus knowing their thoughts â€” It seems they had as yet only said it in their hearts.
