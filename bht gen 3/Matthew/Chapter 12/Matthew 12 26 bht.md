# Matthew 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No society can stand when turned against itself; such intestine war is suicidal. The works I do are destructive of Satan's kingdom, so it is absurd to suggest that I am in league with him. He is divided, for if he is casting himself out, there must have been a previous division. Satan's wicked nature ensures that there is no internal struggle between good and evil within him. His kingdom is constantly at odds with the kingdom of God, making any notion of acting against his own interests weak and malicious.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: No society can sustain itself when it is divided and turned against itself, as this would lead to self-destruction. Likewise, it is unthinkable that I, Jesus, would be in league with Satan, for the works I do are in direct opposition to his kingdom. Satan, being utterly wicked, does not possess the internal struggle between good and evil, so the idea of him fighting against himself is absurd. Moreover, Satan has his own kingdom, and it is clear that it is in constant antagonism to the kingdom of God. Thus, any suggestion that Satan would act contrary to his own interests and subvert his own power is both weak and malicious. Surely, Satan, being so cunning, knows that this is not the way to establish his kingdom.
