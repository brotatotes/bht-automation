# Matthew 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No society can stand when turned against itself. It is absurd to think that I, who am destroying Satan's kingdom, would be in league with him. If Satan is casting himself out, then there must have been a previous division within him. Even if a man is at war within himself, his acts would not necessarily be in opposition. Satan, being utterly wicked, does not struggle between good and evil. It is assumed he has a constant antagonism with the kingdom of God.

2. "there is a form of government among the devils, who are united in one body, under one head; and whose unity and concord are their greatest strength, as in all other governments."
3. "since Satan, who is so cunning and crafty, can never be thought to act such an opposite part to himself, subversive of his kingdom and government; the weakness, and maliciousness of such a suggestion, must be clear and evident to all."

### John Wesley:
1. How shall his kingdom be established ‚Äî Does not that subtle spirit know thin is not the way to establish his kingdom?

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: No society can stand when it is turned against itself. It would be absurd to think that I, who am destroying Satan's kingdom, would be in league with him. If Satan is casting himself out, then there must have been a previous division within him. Even if a man is at war within himself, his outward acts would not necessarily be in opposition. Satan, being utterly wicked, does not have a struggle between good and evil within him. It is assumed that Satan is a person with a kingdom that is constantly antagonistic to the kingdom of God. By acting against his own interest, Satan is subverting his own power and dominion. The devils have a form of government, united under one head, and their unity is their greatest strength. It would be clear to all that Satan, being so cunning, would never act in a way that is so opposite to his own kingdom and government. Satan knows that this is not the way to establish his kingdom.

- Attempt 5 BHT: It is impossible for any society, whether it be a kingdom, city, or household, to stand when it is divided against itself. It is utterly ridiculous to suggest that I, who am engaged in destroying Satan's kingdom, would be in league with him. If Satan is even casting himself out, it implies a prior division within himself. Even if a person is at war within themselves, their outward actions would not necessarily be contrary. Satan, as an utterly wicked being, does not experience a struggle between good and evil within himself. It is assumed that Satan is a distinct person with his own kingdom, constantly at odds with the kingdom of God.
