# Matthew 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The world offers no middle ground; those who are not with Christ, who do not gather with Him, are against Him and undo His work. Denying the power of the Holy Spirit is a grave sin, and Jesus emphasizes the impossibility of remaining neutral in this endeavor. He draws a clear line between Himself and His enemies, those who hate Him and all that is noble. Christ is the magnet of the ages, attracting or repelling, and there are no neuters in this war.
