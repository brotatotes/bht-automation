# Matthew 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sin and blasphemy mentioned here is not a specific wrongdoing, but rather a deliberate opposition to the present power of the Holy Spirit through acts of blasphemy. Although all sins find forgiveness with God, this sin, blaspheming against the Spirit, is an exception. It involves attributing the miracles of Jesus, done through the power of the Holy Spirit, to the work of the devil. This sin is inexcusable and will not be forgiven, even with subsequent repentance or claims of ignorance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The distinction in these much controverted verses seems to be, between 1) the sin and blasphemy which arises from culpable ignorance and sensual blindnessâ€¦ and (2) the blasphemy of those whoâ€¦ openly oppose themselves to [God's power], as didâ€¦ these Pharisees."
2. "They may as yet have been under the veil of ignorance; but this their last proceeding, in the sight of Him who knows the hearts, approximated very near to, or perhaps reached, this awful degree of guilt."
3. "It is not a particular species of sin which is here condemned, but a definite act shewing a state of sin, and that state a wilful determined opposition to the present power of the Holy Spirit; and this as shewn by its fruit, blasphemy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Well, says our Lord, all sinâ€”whether in its ordinary or its more aggravated formsâ€”shall find forgiveness with God." 
2. "There is no sin whatever, it seems, of which it may be said, 'That is not a pardonable sin.'"
3. "This glorious assurance is not to be limited by what follows; but, on the contrary, what follows is to be explained by this."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those who rebel, after that the power of God has been revealed, cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance."
2. "Those persons sin and blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, who maliciously turn to his dishonor the perfections of God, which have been revealed to him by the Spirit, in which His glory ought to be celebrated, and who, with Satan, their leader, are avowed enemies of the glory of God."
3. "It shows equal ignorance to object, that it would be absurd if even repentance could not obtain pardon; for blasphemy against the Spirit is a token of reprobation, and hence it follows, that whoever have fallen into it, have been delivered over to a reprobate mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Every sin and blasphemy. Every sin up to and including blasphemy, with the exception afterwards mentioned."
2. "â€˜Blasphemy,â€™ the worst form of sin: it is malicious evil-speaking against God. Even this may be forgiven if repented of."
3. "But the blasphemy against the Spirit. The one exception."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What is the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit? These Pharisees had already committed it." 
2. "That sin was without excuse and would not be forgiven in their age or in the coming one."
3. "Probably some do who ridicule the manifest work of God's Spirit in men's lives and attribute the Spirit's work to the devil."

### John Gill:
1. "all kind of sin, whether committed more immediately against God, or man, the first or second table of the law, or against any of the divine precepts; be they sins small or great, secret or open, sins of heart, lip, or life, or attended with whatsoever aggravating circumstances; and all kind of blasphemy, or evil speaking of men, or of angels, or of the name of God, but what is hereafter excepted, there is forgiveness of in the grace of God, through the blood of Christ, even for all sorts of men and sinners whatever."
2. "by which is meant, not every ignorant denial of, and opposition to his deity and personality; nor all resistance of him in the external ministry of the word; nor every sin that is knowingly and wilfully committed; but it is a despiteful usage of the Spirit of grace, an opposing, contradicting, and denying the operations wrought, or doctrines revealed by him, against a man's own light and conscience, out of wilful and obstinate malice, on purpose to lessen the glory of God, and gratify his own lusts"
3. "which sin was unpardonable at that present time, as well as under that dispensation then to come, when the Spirit of God was poured down in a more plenteous manner."

### John Wesley:
1. "The blasphemy against the Spirit - How much stir has been made about this? How many sermons, yea, volumes, have been written concerning it?"
2. "And yet there is nothing plainer in all the Bible."
3. "It is neither more nor less than the ascribing those miracles to the power of the devil, which Christ wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost."
