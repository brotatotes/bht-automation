## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "This verse resumes again the leading argument, and sets forth the inconsistency of the Pharisees in representing Him as in league with evil, whose works were uniformly good."
3. "But the words have a double reference: to our Lord Himself, who could not be evil, seeing that His works were good; and (which leads on to the next verse) to the Pharisees, who could not speak good things, because their works were evil."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 33. Either make the tree good,
	&amp;c.


### Albert Barnes:

2. "You are to judge of man's being in league with Satan by his works."
3. "If my doctrines and works be properly the works of Satan, then I am corrupt; if not, then your charge is blasphemy."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing is more inconsistent with honesty than hypocrisy, and it is in vain for men to boast of pretensions to righteousness who are not sincere and upright."
2. "Christ does not demand absolute and entire perfection, but only a sincere and unfeigned disposition."
3. "The sincere worshippers of God, though they are encompassed by the infirmity of their flesh and by many sins, and groan under the burden, are called good."

### Philip Schaff:

1. "The tree is known by his fruit; fruit will discover what a tree is, and accordingly judgment may be made."
2. "Either say I am a good man, and do good works, or that I am an evil man, and do evil works: to say that I do good works, as the casting out of devils must be allowed to be, and yet am an evil man, and do this under satanical influence, is as great an inconsistency, as to say that a corrupt tree brings forth good fruit."
3. "Nothing can be concluded from hence in favour of free will, or a power in the creature to make himself good; for the word 'make', here signifies to 'say, affirm, assert', and the like."

### John Wesley:
1. "Either make the tree good and its fruit good: or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt â€” That is, you must allow, they are both good, or both bad." 
2. "For if the fruit is good, so is the tree; if the fruit is evil, so is the tree also."
3. "For the tree is known by its fruit â€” As if he had said, Ye may therefore know me by my fruits. By my converting sinners to God, you may know that God hath sent me."
