# Matthew 12:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our words hold great significance, for they are a reflection of the inner treasures stored within us that are only fully known by God. These treasures encompass both good and evil, and in the judgment to come, our entire lives, including our words, will be exposed. From the overflow of our hearts, a good person brings forth goodness, while an evil person brings forth wickedness. Our words, spoken under the pressure of the abundance within, reveal to which kingdom we belong, whether the kingdom of light or another.
