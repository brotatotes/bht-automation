# Matthew 12:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words we speak are a reflection of the treasure within us, known only by God and partially by ourselves. These words, often overlooked, hold great significance and will be subjects of judgment. They spring forth from the inner fountains of good and evil within our hearts. A good man brings forth good things from the abundance of his heart, while an evil man brings forth evil things. Our words not only defile ourselves but also reveal the kingdom to which we truly belong.
