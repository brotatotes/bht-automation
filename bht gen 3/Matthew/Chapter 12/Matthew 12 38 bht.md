# Matthew 12:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scribes and Pharisees, who accused Jesus of being in league with Satan, hypocritically asked Him for a sign from heaven to prove that His miracles were from above. Their demand was audacious and insulting, considering they had witnessed His miracles of healing. These individuals admired displays of power but failed to recognize the miracles of mercy. They expected signs and wonders from the Messiah, yet now reject them as unnecessary. Jesus sternly rebuked their impudent request, exposing their disbelief.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "These were not the same class with those who charged Him with being in league with Satan (as we see from Luke 11:15; Luke 11:16); but as the spirit of both was similar, the tone of severe rebuke is continued."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the same that charged him with casting out devils, by the prince of devils; but others...being willing to divert the discourse, and try what they could do with him in another, and more gentle and crafty way..."
2. "they desire, or rather, in an imperious way, demand one from heaven...they seem to require some such things to be done, as were on Mount Sinai, at the giving of the law..."
3. "this is to be learned from hence, that the Jews, in Christ's time, expected signs and wonders to be wrought by the Messiah, in proof of his being so, though now they reject them as needless."

### John Wesley:
1. We would see a sign â€” Else we will not believe this. Matthew 16:1; Luke 11:16,29.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The scribes and Pharisees had the audacity to accuse Jesus of being in league with Satan and then hypocritically asked Him for a sign from heaven. They wanted an immediate and decisive sign that would prove that Jesus' miracles were from above, not from beneath. However, their demand was impudent, insulting, and revealed their disbelief in Jesus' previous miracles of healing. These individuals, who admired marvels of power more than miracles of mercy, failed to recognize the signs already given to them and instead requested something akin to the signs given on Mount Sinai. It is clear that during Jesus' time, the Jews expected the Messiah to perform signs and wonders to prove His identity, although they later rejected them as unnecessary.
