# Matthew 12:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but fails to see the remarkable foreshadowing of Jesus's resurrection in Jonah's story. Jesus declares that no sign will be given to them, except for the sign of Jonah, symbolizing his personal descent into the place of departed souls. Their unbelief and idolatry are likened to an adulterous betrayal of their covenant with God. Their demand for signs exposes their stubbornness and rejection of Jesus as the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sign of Jonas is the most remarkable foreshadowing in the O.T. of the resurrection of our Lord."
2. "For Jonah himself calls the belly of the sea monster (Jonah ii. 2), ‚Äòthe belly of Hades,‚Äô = the heart of the earth here."
3. "But of our Lord‚Äôs personal descent into the place of departed souls."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "an evil and adulterous generation‚ÄîThis latter expression is best explained by Luke 11:29- :, 'Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.' For this was the relationship in which He stood to the covenant-people‚Äî'I am married unto you'"
2. "seeketh after a sign‚ÄîIn the eye of Jesus this class were but the spokesmen of their generation, the exponents of the reigning spirit of unbelief."
3. "there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Adulterous [ŒºŒøŒπœáŒ±ŒªŒπœÇ]. A very strong and graphic expression, founded upon the familiary Hebrew representation of the relation of God's people to him under the figure of marriage."
2. "Hence idolatry and intercourse with Gentiles were described as adultery; and so here, of moral unfaithfulness to God."
3. "Where Michael wrought Vengeance upon the proud adultery."

### John Calvin:
1. "A wicked generation He does not merely charge that age with malice, but pronounces the Jews‚Äîor at least the scribes, and those who resembled them‚Äîto be a wicked nation; thus declaring that they labored under a hereditary disease of obstinacy."
2. "What a display was this, I do not say of indifference, but of malice, in shutting their eyes against so many signs! There was, therefore, no proper ground for this annoyance; and they had no other object in view than to appear to have a good reason for rejecting Christ."
3. "You despise," he says, "the Son of God, who has come down to you from heaven: but I am yet to die, and to rise from the grave, and to speak to you after my resurrection, as Jonah came from the bottom of the sea to Nineveh."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their craving after a sign was a token of the same spirit of apostacy which made them join with heathen idolaters in crucifying Jesus."
2. "No sign,' to confirm their false views of the Messiah."
3. "The sign of Messiahship, like the Messiah Himself, was the reverse of their expectations: not a sign 'from heaven,' but from 'the heart of the earth.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An evil and adulterous generation (Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒµŒ± œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅŒ± Œ∫Œ± ŒºŒøŒπœáŒ±ŒªŒπœÇ). They had broken the marriage tie which bound them to Jehovah."
2. "What is 'the sign of Jonah?'"
3. "See Psalms 73:27; Isaiah 57:3; Isaiah 62:5; Ezekiel 23:27; James 4:4; Revelation 2:20."

### John Gill:
1. "an evil and adulterous generation; not only in a spiritual sense, being degenerated from the faith, religion, and piety of their ancestors; but literally, which appeared not only in their polygamy, and frequent divorces on trivial occasions, but by criminal conversation with other women"
2. "Seeketh after a sign; this is perfectly Talmudic language, the language of the Jews... This the Jews sought of Christ, time after time; not content with one, sought another, though such wonderful ones were wrought, which most fully demonstrated him to be the Messiah"
3. "no such signs should be given they desired, not one from heaven; but one particularly should be given them, out of the earth, and should be, not for their conviction, but condemnation; and would seem very much like that which was done to the prophet Jonas, or Jonah"

### John Wesley:
1. "An adulterous generation - Whose heart wanders from God, though they profess him to be their husband."
2. "Seeketh a sign - After all they have had already, which were abundantly sufficient to convince them, had not their hearts been estranged from God, and consequently averse to the truth."
3. "The sign of Jonah - Who was herein a type of Christ."
