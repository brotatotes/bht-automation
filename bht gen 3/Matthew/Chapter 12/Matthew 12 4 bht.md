### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No example could be more apposite than this. The man after God's own heart, of whom the Jews ever boasted, when suffering in God's cause and straitened for provisions, asked and obtained from the high priest what, according to the law, it was illegal for anyone save the priests to touch."
2. "Yet there is not a little confusion in what is said of these priests in different parts of the Old Testament."
3. "Thus he is called both the son of the father of Ahimelech (1 Samuel 22:20; 2 Samuel 8:17); and Ahimelech is called Ahiah (1 Samuel 14:3), and Abimelech (1 Chronicles 18:16)."

### Philip Schaff:

"If David, a holy, good man, and, the men that were with him, who were men of religion and conscience, when in great distress, through hunger, ate of the showbread, which was unlawful for any to eat of but priests, the high priest himself assenting to it; then it could not be criminal in his disciples, when an hungred, to pluck, rub, and eat a few ears of corn, which were lawful for any man to eat, even though it was on the sabbath day."
2. "Now our Lord's argument stands thus, that if David, a holy, good man, and, the men that were with him, who were men of religion and conscience, when in great distress, through hunger, ate of the showbread, which was unlawful for any to eat of but priests, the high priest himself assenting to it; then it could not be criminal in his disciples, when an hungred, to pluck, rub, and eat a few ears of corn, which were lawful for any man to eat, even though it was on the sabbath day."
3. "If David, a holy, good man, and, the men that were with him, who were men of religion and conscience, when in great distress, through hunger, ate of the showbread, which was unlawful for any to eat of but priests, the high priest himself assenting to it; then it could not be criminal in his disciples, when an hungred, to pluck, rub, and eat a few ears of corn, which were lawful for any man to eat, even though it was on the sabbath day."

### John Wesley:
1. "He entered into the house of God â€” Into the tabernacle. The temple was not yet built."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In this verse, we see an example from the Old Testament where David, a man after God's own heart, and his companions, who were men of religion and conscience, ate the showbread, which was meant only for the priests. Despite its unlawfulness, the high priest himself assented to David's request. This situation is brought up to support the argument that it could not be considered criminal for Jesus' disciples to pluck and eat a few ears of corn on the Sabbath, an action that was lawful for any man to do. The showbread, consisting of twelve loaves that represented the twelve tribes of Israel, was placed on a table in the holy place as a symbol of the communion between God and men. It is important to note that these actions of David and Jesus' disciples were done out of necessity and while in distress. The showbread was only to be eaten by the priests, but in these instances, it was permitted due to the extenuating circumstances.
