## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If it be necessary to make good the three days and nights during which our Lord was in the heart of the earth, it must be done by having recourse to the Jewish method of computing time."
2. "In the Jerusalem Talmud (cited by Lightfoot) it is said 'that a day and night together make up a day (night-day), and that any part of such a period is counted as the whole.'"
3. "See Gen. xl. 13, 20: 1 Sam. xxx. 12, 13: 2 Chron. x. 5, 12: Hos. vi. 2."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly‚Äîso shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." 
2. "Jonah's case was analogous to this, as being a signal judgment of God; reversed in three days; and followed by a glorious mission to the Gentiles." 
3. "The expression 'in the heart of the earth'... means simply the grave, but this considered as the most emphatic expression of real and total entombment."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The whale [œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ∑œÑŒøœÖœÇ] . A general term for a sea - monster.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the belly of the whale, or 'great fish.' Probably a white shark, which reaches an immense size in the Mediterranean. Our Lord vouches for the main fact."
2. "So shall the Son of man be three days and three nights. In round numbers according to the Jewish mode of reckoning time."
3. "In the heart of the earth. Either in 'hades' or in the 'grave.' The first sense accords better with the case of Jonah, although nothing can be inferred from this respecting the locality of the 'place of departed spirits.' Christ's sepulchre was not strictly in the heart of the earth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The whale (œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ∑œÑŒøœÖœÇ). Sea-monster, huge fish."
2. "Three days and three nights may simply mean three days in popular speech."
3. "It is just a fuller form for 'after three days'."

### John Gill:
1. "However, be it what it will, Jonas was three days and three nights in the belly of it; which agrees with the account in the above mentioned place, and is the sign Christ speaks of in the foregoing verse; and a very great sign and miracle it was, that being swallowed down by such a fish, he should remain in the belly of it three days and three nights, as one dead; for, without a miracle, he could not have lived an hour."
2. "To solve this difficulty, and set the matter in a clear light, let it be observed, that the three days and three nights, mean three natural days, consisting of day and night, or twenty four hours, and are what the Greeks call ŒΩœÖœáŒ∏Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±, 'night days'; but the Jews have no other way of expressing them, but as here; and with them it is a well known rule, and used on all occasions, as in the computation of their feasts and times of mourning, in the observance of the passover, circumcision, and divers purifications, that ◊û◊ß◊¶◊™ ◊î◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊õ◊õ◊ï◊ú◊ï, 'a part of a day is as the whole'."
3. "Christ was laid in the grave towards the close of the sixth day, a little before sun setting, and this being a part of the night day preceding, is reckoned as the whole; he continued there the whole night day following, being the seventh day; and rose again early on the first day, which being after sun setting, though it might be even before sun rising, yet being a part of the night day following, is to be esteemed as the whole; and thus the son of man was to be, and was three days and three nights in the grave."

### John Wesley:
1. "Three days and three nights... was with them the very same, as to say, it happened after three days, or on the third day." 
2. "It was customary with the eastern nations to reckon any part of a natural day of twenty-four hours, for the whole day." 
3. "As the Hebrews had no word to express a natural day, they used night and day, or day and night for it."

- Attempt 1 BHT: For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly‚Äîso shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. This verse refers to the time that Jonah spent in the belly of the whale, which was a miraculous sign and a foreshadowing of Christ's own death and resurrection.

The main focus is on the fulfillment of the sign and the powerful parallel between Jonah's experience and Christ's mission.
