# Matthew 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The queen of Sheba, reigning over Egypt and Ã†thiopia, left her kingdom to seek the wisdom of Solomon, a mere man. In contrast, the Jews rejected the Greater than Solomon, Jesus. The queen of the south will rise up in judgment against that generation, serving as an example and condemning their refusal to accept Jesus, the Prince of all the prophets. It is a humbling reminder that a Gentile woman, uneducated in the ways of God, traveled a great distance to hear Solomon's wisdom, while the Jews rejected the greater wisdom offered by Jesus.
