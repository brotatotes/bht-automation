# Matthew 12:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The demon ironically claims to have left willingly, likening himself to a man leaving his house for a walk. The proverb worse than the first describes the person's state as an empty house swept and garnished, inviting the unclean spirit. Satan delights in the emptiness that comes from neglecting divine grace and rejecting Christ, finding pleasure in the absence of God, true knowledge, fear, love, faith, affection, hope, and spiritual godliness. The house is outwardly reformed but filled with secret lusts and corruptions, welcoming the unclean spirit. The demon's pride is evident in his voluntary departure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The metaphor of a house swept and embellished is taken from men who find pleasure in the cleanness and neatness of their apartments; for to Satan no sight is beautiful but deformity itself, and no smell is sweet but filth and nastiness."
2. "The meaning therefore is, that Satan never finds a more appropriate habitation within us, than when, having parted with Christ, we receive Satan as a guest. His highest delight is in that emptiness by which the neglect of divine grace is followed."
3. "That which he loves most, and in which he takes a supreme pleasure, is the emptiness which is produced, when man sets no value on the grace of God, and is indifferent about making a good use of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "My house, i.e. , the demoniac."
2. "Not in a state of moral purity, but empty of a good tenant; swept of all that would be forbidding to an evil spirit; and garnished, set in order, and adorned, but in a way inviting to the unclean spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The demon is ironically represented as implying that he left his victim voluntarily, as a man leaves his house to go for a walk."
2. "Worse than the first" is a proverb.

### John Gill:
1. "Not empty of sin...but empty of God, of the true knowledge of him, of the fear of him, and love to him; of Christ, of faith in him, affection for him, and hope on him; of the Spirit of God, and of his graces, and of spiritual, internal religion, and powerful godliness."
2. "Swept...with the besom of an outward reformation."
3. "Garnished...with secret lusts and corruptions, which rendered it an agreeable habitation for this unclean spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "He findeth it empty - of God, of Christ, of his Spirit: Swept - from love, lowliness, meekness, and all the fruits of the Spirit." 
2. "With levity and security: so that there is nothing to keep him out, and much to invite him in."
3. "He speaks as if he had come out of his own accord: See his pride!"
