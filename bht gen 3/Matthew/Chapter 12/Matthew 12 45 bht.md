# Matthew 12:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we turn away from God's grace, we subject ourselves to the dangerous consequences highlighted by Christ in His warning. The man who expelled a demon failed to fill the void with righteousness, which allowed the enemy to return stronger than before, accompanied by other evil spirits. This process of deterioration, exemplified by the wicked generation, led to a state far worse than the initial condition. Let us not underestimate the devil's knowledge and experience, but trust in the invincible power of the Holy Spirit to safeguard God's children.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ shows that if we fall from his grace, our subjection to Satan is doubled, so that he treats us with greater cruelty than before, and that this is the just punishment of our slothfulness."
2. "Let us not then suppose that the devil has been vanquished by a single combat, because he has once gone out of us. On the contrary, let us remember that, as his lodgment within us was of old standing, ever since we were born, he has knowledge and experience of all the approaches by which he may reach us."
3. "Whatever may be the fierceness or violence of Satanâ€™s attacks, they ought not to intimidate the sons of God, whom the invincible power of the Holy Spirit preserves in safety."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Seven other spirits, etc. To be understood indefinitely, of a more complete and terrible possession; there being no resistance to their entrance."
2. "The last state of that man is worse than the first. ... Thus shall it be also unto this wicked generation."
3. "A process of deterioration, with occasional vicissitudes and fluctuations, but resulting in a state far worse than any that had gone before it."

### John Gill:
1. "More wicked than himself, as these are more pernicious to man, than the devil himself."

3. "The Scribes and Pharisees... filled them with more malice, blasphemy, and blindness, than ever, which issued in their utter ruin and destruction."

### John Wesley:
