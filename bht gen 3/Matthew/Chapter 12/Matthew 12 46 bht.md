# Matthew 12:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus's family, including Mary His mother, sought to speak with Him while He addressed the multitudes. Though Mary's faith surely grew stronger, her connection to Jesus was no greater than that of believers united to Him by the Spirit. In His zeal, Jesus seemed indifferent to His own needs, leading some to think He was beside Himself. Despite false accusations from the Pharisees, His disciples remained devoted. Mary and the others sent a messenger, likely concerned for Jesus's well-being amidst the pressure and conspiracies of the Scribes and Pharisees.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus's family members, including His mother Mary, sought to speak with Him while He was addressing the multitudes. Despite the honorable position of being the mother of the Savior, Mary's connection to Jesus was not superior to that of believers who are united to Christ through the Holy Spirit. Jesus, in His zeal and dedication, appeared unconcerned with His personal needs as He preached, causing some to accuse Him of being beside Himself. Though the Pharisees falsely claimed that Jesus was in league with Satan, His disciples remained faithful to Him and did not believe the accusations. In their love and concern, Mary and the others in Jesus's family sent a messenger to Him, possibly to urge Him to rest and take care of Himself amidst the pressures and conspiracies orchestrated by the Scribes and Pharisees.
