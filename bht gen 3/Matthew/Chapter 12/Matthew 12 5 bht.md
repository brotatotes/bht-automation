### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The priests of the temple were commanded to perform many tasks on the Sabbath that the Pharisees would consider violations of the Sabbath. However, the sacred history provides examples of exceptions to the Sabbath law based on necessity. The Law itself allows for work to be done on the Sabbath as a duty. Jesus asks the Pharisees if they have not read in the law how the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and yet are blameless. The double offerings and the preparation of the showbread required a significant amount of work on the Sabbath for the priests. Even circumcision, which is a religious duty, had to be performed on the Sabbath when the eighth day of a child fell on that day. It is clear that the duties of piety are not inconsistent with each other. The holiness of the spiritual temple exempts its worshippers from blame while they perform the duties of godliness. Therefore, it is evident that the labors performed in the temple are not offensive to God and do not violate the Sabbath.
