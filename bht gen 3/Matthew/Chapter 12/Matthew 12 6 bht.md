# Matthew 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is emphasized that Jesus is greater than the temple, indicating the disciples' innocence in their actions. The disciples, who were following Jesus and grew hungry in their dedication to Him, can be likened to the blameless priests in the temple who were excused for violating Sabbath rules. This underscores the significance of Jesus as the true Temple of God on earth, surpassing the importance of the physical temple. Therefore, the disciples' commitment to Jesus takes precedence over strict adherence to Sabbath regulations, as their rights outweigh even those of the temple.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A greater thing than the temple is here."
2. "If the priests in the temple and for the templeâ€™s sake, for its service and ritual, profane the Sabbath, as ye account profanation, and are blameless, how much more these disciples who have grown hungry in their appointed following of Him who is greater than the temple, the true Temple of God on earth, the Son of Man!"
3. "It seems to me, as above, to bear a more general and sublime sense than the masculine; see ver. 41, &c."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the templeâ€”or rather, according to the reading which is best supported, 'something greater.'"

3. "Thus indirectly, but not the less decidedly, does our Lord put in His own claims to consideration in this questionâ€”claims to be presently put in even more nakedly."
