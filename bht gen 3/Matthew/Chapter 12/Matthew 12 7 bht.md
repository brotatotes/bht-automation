### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The law of this new Temple-service is the law of charity and love. It is all for man's sake and man's good. The overflow of speech reveals what is within the heart. If the Pharisees had understood the great principle of all religion, that ceremonial observances must give way before moral duties, they would have refrained from complaints against blameless individuals. Jesus specifically applies this principle to the law of the Sabbath when he states that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. This maxim is vital for the establishment and true freedom of Sabbath observance. The Pharisees failed to recognize the greater temple and accept the service of mercy and not sacrifice. They should have known this, being interpreters of the Old Testament. God values mercy over sacrifice, and external rites are only valuable when directed to their proper object. Believers practice justice towards one another, proving their sincere service to God. The Pharisees, claiming to be knowledgeable in Scripture, were actually ignorant of it. They lacked compassion and failed to understand God's preference for acts of mercy. Love is the end of it all.
