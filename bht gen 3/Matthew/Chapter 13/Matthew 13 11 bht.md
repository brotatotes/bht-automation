# Matthew 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Kingdom of Heaven has its secrets and inner counsels, which are revealed to humble and diligent hearers while remaining concealed from others. The disciples have been initiated into the mysteries of the Kingdom, receiving the honor of understanding the glorious Gospel truths. Parables serve the dual purpose of revealing these truths to those who appreciate them, while offering only temporary entertainment to those who are spiritually blind. The word of God is not obscure in its own nature, but can be darkened by the blindness of men.
