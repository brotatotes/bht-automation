# Matthew 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, &amp;c.‚ÄîThey were thus judicially sealed up under the darkness and obduracy which they deliberately preferred to the light and healing which Jesus brought nigh to them. The prophecy of Isaiah is fully satisfied in the conduct of the Pharisees and Jesus himself points it out. Let us not wonder if that judgment, which God displayed through the ministration of the Prophet, is likewise fulfilled at the present day.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prophecy is cited verbatim from the LXX, which changes the imperative of the Hebrew ( ‚ÄòMake the heart of this people fat,‚Äô&c., E.V.) into the indicative, as bearing the same meaning."
2. "is fulfilled] is being fulfilled, ‚Äòfinds one of the stages of its fulfilment:‚Äô a partial one having taken place in the contemporaries of the prophet."
3. "in them properly signifies relation, ‚Äòwith regard to them.‚Äô"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And in them is fulfilled‚Äîrather, 'is fulfilling,' or 'is receiving its fulfilment.'" 
2. "By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, &amp;c.‚ÄîThey were thus judicially sealed up under the darkness and obduracy which they deliberately preferred to the light and healing which Jesus brought nigh to them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Is fulfilled [Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÄŒªŒ∑œÅŒøœÖœÑŒ±Œπ] . Rather of something in progress : is being fulfilled or in process of fulfilment.


### John Calvin:
1. "God enlightens to salvation, and that by a peculiar gift, those whom He has freely chosen; and that all the reprobate are deprived of the light of life, whether God withholds his word from them, or keeps their eyes and ears closed, that they do not hear or see."
2. "All who have been given over to a reprobate mind do voluntarily, and from inward malice, blind and harden themselves."
3. "Let them not wonder if that judgment, which God anciently displayed through the ministration of the Prophet, is likewise fulfilled at the present day. At the same time, we ought to be extremely careful, that the fruit of the Gospel be not lost through our negligence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It fulfilled. A stronger word than that commonly used; a complete fulfillment, which may or may not have been preceded by a partial one."
2. "The sense of the original prophecy is given, but not its form. In Isaiah is a command; here a strong prediction, indicating that judgment is a result of what is done by man as well as what is done to man."
3. "By hearing, etc. The sense of the original prophecy is given, but not its form. In Isaiah is a command; here a strong prediction, indicating that judgment is a result of what is done by man as well as what is done to man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The prophecy of Isaiah is fully satisfied in the conduct of the Pharisees and Jesus himself points it out." 
2. "Note two ways of reproducing the Hebrew idiom (infinitive absolute), one by Œ±Œ∫ŒøŒ∑ the other by Œ≤ŒªŒµœÄŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ."
3. "Note also the strong negative ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑ with aorist subjunctive."

### John Gill:
1. "The sense of the prophecy is, with respect to the times of the Messiah, that the Jews, whilst hearing the sermons preached by him, whether with, or without parables, should hear his voice, and the sound of it, but not understand his words internally, spiritually, and experimentally; and whilst they saw, with the eyes of their bodies, the miracles he wrought, they should see the facts done, which could not be denied and gainsayed by them, but should not take in the clear evidence, full proof, and certain demonstration given thereby, of his Messiahship."
2. "The words run in the imperative, 'hear ye, see ye,' but are here rendered in the future, 'shall hear, shall see,' which rendering of the words is supported and established by the version of the Septuagint, by the Chaldee paraphrase, and by many Jewish commentators."
3. "The prophecy was to have, and had, its accomplishment over and over again in that people."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye will surely hear. All possible means will be given you: yet they will profit you nothing." 
2. "Your heart is sensual, stupid, and insensible; your spiritual senses are shut up."
3. "You have closed your eyes against the light; as being unwilling to understand the things of God, and afraid, not desirous that he should heal you."
