# Matthew 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individuals being referred to have dull of hearing and closed eyes, indicating their sluggishness and imperfect understanding. Their continual persistence in not hearing, seeing, understanding, and being saved has led to their spiritual senses being sealed shut, akin to a punishment. However, there is hope for them if they choose to turn away from their obstinacy and towards God. This requires them recognizing their own dissatisfaction and being open to seeking healing and forgiveness from Him.

3. "lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart... and I should heal them; or, as in Mark, 'and their sins should be forgiven them'; for healing of diseases, and forgiveness of sins, are, in Scripture language, one and the same thing."
