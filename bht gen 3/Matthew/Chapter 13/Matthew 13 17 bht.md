# Matthew 13:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were blessed above the blinded just spoken of, favored above the most honored and the best that lived under the old economy. They were granted the privilege to see and hear what even prophets and righteous men of the past desired but did not have. They saw Christ in the flesh, heard his teachings, witnessed his miracles, and understood them spiritually and savingly. This parable emphasizes the mixed character of the kingdom in its present state and the final separation of the two classes.
