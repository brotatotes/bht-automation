## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The seed is one and the same everywhere and to all: but seed does not spring up without earth, nor does earth bring forth without seed; and the success or failure of the seed is the consequence of the adaptation to its reception, or otherwise, of the spot on which it falls."
2. "But of course, on the other hand, as the enquiry, 'Why is this ground rich, and that barren?' leads us up into the creative arrangements of God,â€”so a similar enquiry in the spiritual interpretation would lead us into the inscrutable and sovereign arrangements of Him who 'preventeth us that we may have a good will, and worketh with us when we have that will'."
3. "The great leading idea is that 'mystery of the Kingdom,' according to which the grace of God, and the receptivity of it by man, work ever together in bringing forth fruit."

### John Calvin:
1. "He only intended to warn us, that, in many persons, the seed of life is lost on account of various defects, in consequence of which it is either destroyed immediately, or it withers, or it gradually degenerates."
2. "That we may derive the greater advantage from this warning, we ought to bear in mind, that he makes no mention of despisers who openly reject the word of God, but describes those only in whom there is some appearance of docility."
3. "But if the greater part of such men perish, what shall become of the rest of the world, by whom the doctrine of salvation is openly rejected?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Hear, in your hearts, ye who are so highly favored, the true meaning of these parables."
2. "Our Lordâ€™s explanation is to guide us in the interpretation of other parables."
3. "He does not say: it teaches this general principle, nor does He give a significance to all the objects and actions which may be linked with sowing in a grain-field."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He can go on preaching the mysteries of the kingdom without their comprehending what he is saying, but he is anxious that the disciples really get personal knowledge of these same mysteries."
2. "So he explains in detail what he means to teach by the Parable of the Sower."
3. "He appeals to them (note position of Ï…Î¼ÎµÎ¹Ï‚) to listen as he explains."

### John Gill:
1. "Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower." 
2. "Do ye not understand the meaning of it, so easy to be taken in?" 
3. "How then will ye know all parables?"
