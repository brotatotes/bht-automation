3. "By fowls of the airâ€”passing thoughts and desires, which seem insignificant and even innocentâ€“does Satan do his work, and rob the heart of the precious seed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "While any one is hearing, the evil one is coming and snatching away, just as the birds do not wait for the sower to be out of the way, but are at work while he is sowing."
2. "He that was sown; identifying the seed of the figure with the man signified."

### John Calvin:
1. "He mentions, in the first place, the barren and uncultivated, who do not receive the seed within, because there is no preparation in their hearts."
