## BHT:
In this case, there is a surface disposition easily stirred and excited, but beneath lies a heart harder than the trodden path. This person embraces the Gospel with great joy, but lacks deep spiritual conviction or conflict. Their faith is like a quickly sprouting plant that withers and is destroyed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this second case, the surface of the mind and disposition is easily stirred, soon excited: but beneath lies a heart even harder than the trodden way."
2. "So the plant, springing up under the false heat of excitement, having no root struck down into the depths of the being, is, when the real heat from without arises, which is intended to strengthen and forward the healthy-rooted plant, withered and destroyed."
3. "...withered and destroyed."

### John Calvin:
1. "We see too many of this class in our own day, who eagerly embrace the Gospel, and shortly afterwards fall off; for they have not the lively affection that is necessary to give them firmness and perseverance."
2. "Let every one then examine himself thoroughly, that the alacrity which gives out a bright flame may not quickly go out, as the saying is, like a fire of tow."
3. "Great commendation is due, no doubt, to that promptitude, which receives the word of God with joy, and without delay, as soon as it is published; but let us learn, that nothing has been done, till faith acquires true firmness, that it may not wither in the first blade."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "His profession is taken up in haste, immediately, upon a flash of affection, and a little head knowledge, it does not last long, nor prove honourable."

### John Wesley:
