# Matthew 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some people's faith is like a plant with no deep roots, easily influenced by changing circumstances. They may initially seem sincere, but are ultimately unstable and superficial. When faced with trials and tribulations, they quickly fall away, unable to endure the pressure. Their faith lacks the essence of true grace, without the root of the matter. This serves as a reminder that authentic faith is rooted in embracing the Spirit of adoption and genuinely calling upon God as our Father. Let us examine our hearts and ensure our faith withstands life's challenges.

2. "These try men's principles and professions, and whether the truth of grace is in them or not."
3. "He shrinks back from it, does not care to take it up, and follow Christ; but drops his religion, and the profession of it; apostatises, falls away, and comes to nothing."

### John Wesley:
