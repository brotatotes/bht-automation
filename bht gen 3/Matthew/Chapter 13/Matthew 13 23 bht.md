# Matthew 13:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The different responses to God's word are represented by the various soils, but it is His grace that prepares hearts to receive and understand it. The fruitfulness of the soil reflects its receptiveness and the value of the seed. Only those transformed by divine grace bear fruit and fulfill the purpose of sowing. Let us not despise those with a lower degree of excellence, for the master recognizes them as good. By cultivating a receptive heart, the word takes root, overcomes obstacles, and produces fruit for God's glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But every predisposition to receive them is of God:â€”even the shallow soil covering the rock, even the thorny soil, received its power to take in and vivify the seed, from God."
2. "Divine grace is the enabling, vivifying, cleansing power throughout: and these sown on the good land are no naturally good, amiable, or pure class, but those prepared by divine graceâ€”receptive, by granted receptive power."
3. "The sowing is not necessarily the first that has ever taken place: the field has been and is continually resown, so that the care of the husbandman is presupposed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Understandeth [ÏƒÎ¿Î½Î¹ÎµÎ¹Ï‚] . See on 11 25, prudent. The three evangelists give three characteristics of the good hearer. Matthew, he understandeth the word; Mark, he receiveth it; Luke, he keepeth it.


### John Calvin:
1. "None are compared by Christ to a good and fertile soil, but those in whom the word of God not only strikes its roots deep and solid, but overcomes every obstacle that would prevent it from yielding fruit."
 
2. "Let each of us endeavor, at least, to deaden them, that they may not hinder the fruit of the word."
3. "We have no right to despise those who occupy a lower degree of excellence; for the master of the house himself, though he gives to one the preference above another on account of more abundant produce, yet bestows the general designation, good, even on inferior soils."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The good ground... All is of divine grace, yet the verse plainly teaches that the persons referred to actively and willingly accept and understand the truth." 
2. "The result being continued fruitfulness."
3. "This class alone fulfills the purpose of the sower."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fruit reveals the character of the tree and the value of the straw for wheat."
2. "The first three classes have no fruit and so show that they are unfruitful soil, unsaved souls and lives."
3. "The variety in the results of the seed sown according to the soil on which it falls."

### John Gill:
1. "The hearer compared to good ground into which the seed fell, is he that heareth the word and understandeth it; has a new and spiritual understanding given him, feels the power of it on his heart, enlightening and quickening him."
2. "This is an heart of flesh, a new and right heart, and spirit; an heart to fear God, to love him, and to trust in him; in which Christ dwells by faith; in which the Spirit of God has his temple; and in which every grace is implanted."
3. "The fruit bore, and brought forth by such an hearer, is the true fruit of grace and righteousness, and is all from Christ, under the influences of the Spirit, through the word and ordinances, as means, and issues in the glory of God."

### John Wesley:
1. Some a hundred fold, some sixty, some thirty â€” That is, in various proportions; some abundantly more than others.
