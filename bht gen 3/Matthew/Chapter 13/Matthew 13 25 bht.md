It is vital for believers to remain vigilant, recognizing and guarding against those who may outwardly appear as true followers but lack genuine faith.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Matthew 13:25, Jesus speaks of the enemy who sowed tares among the wheat while men slept. This act of malice, practiced in the East, involved sowing destructive weeds in the neighbor's plowed field. The bearded darnel, which resembles wheat but has black grains, can remain indistinguishable from the wheat until near the harvest. This dangerous situation exposes the church and good believers to various sins and snares, causing the potential loss of Christ's presence, liveliness, and comfort. It also leads to spiritual poverty and leanness. It is crucial to remain vigilant, for the enemy seeks to harm Christ personally and destroy true believers by instigating sin and death. These tares, initially looking like wheat, lack true grace and bear no fruit, making them unfruitful, unprofitable, and destined to be burned.
