# Matthew 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the wheat started to grow and produce fruit, the tares also appeared. This manifestation of antagonistic principles became evident during harvest time, as the tares revealed themselves. The evil result of malicious sowing became apparent when things seemed promising for the wheat. The distinction between genuine believers and false ones emerged through the zeal and fruitfulness of true converts, setting them apart from the tares. Although the initial appearances may be peaceful and joyful, the true nature of each eventually becomes clear.

1. "And such a profession ought to be made by all that are partakers of the grace of God; and ought to be made both verbally, by a confession of the mouth, and a declaration of the work of God upon the heart, and by deeds, by submitting to the ordinances of the Gospel; and should be sincere, and from the heart, and be visible to men, and be held fast unto the end without wavering."
2. "But the first appearances of grace under a profession, such as sorrow for sin, after a godly sort, fear and reverence of God, great humility, much self-denial, ardent love to Christ, pantings and breathings after him, and communion with him, strong affection for the people of God, some exercise of faith on Christ, zeal for his cause and interest, and a concern to honour and glorify God."
3. "They always appeared to be what they were to God the searcher of hearts; but now, through the zeal of true converts, to which these opposed themselves, and the fruitfulness of their lives, from which they were so very different, they became manifest to ministers and churches."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was not discerned before: it seldom appears, as soon as the good seed is sown." 
2. "All at first appears to be peace, and love, and joy."
3. "When the blade was sprung up, then appeared the darnel."
