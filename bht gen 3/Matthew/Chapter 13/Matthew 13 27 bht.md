## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This well expresses the surprise, disappointment, and anxiety of Christ's faithful servants and people at the discovery of 'false brethren' among the members of the Church."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the servants' that came to him, are meant, not civil magistrates, who have nothing to do in the affairs of churches; nor the angels, though these are ministering servants to Christ, and will be employed by him, in the close of time, to gather up the tares, bind them in bundles, and cast them into the fire; but the ministers of the Gospel, the servants of Christ, and of the most high God, who are made use of in planting, and sowing, and weeding his field, the church."
2. "Their manner of address, calling him Sir, or Lord, is expressive of their reverence of him, and obedience to him; and which is said, not in word only, but in the sincerity of their hearts, and under the influence of the Spirit of God."
3. "Moreover, they intimate, that nothing but good could come from Christ; no bad seed, no tares could be of his sowing: and declare their ignorance of the rise of them; which ignorance was owing to their being asleep, when the enemy sowed them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? Whence then hath it darnel?" 
2. "No evil can from thee proceed: 'Tis only suffer'd, not decreed."
3. "As darkness is not from the sun, Nor mount the shades, till he is gone."
