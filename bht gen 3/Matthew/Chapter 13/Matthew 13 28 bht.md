# Matthew 13:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
An enemy hath done this - the words of a good Husbandman who honors his faithful servants and separates them from the wrong done to his field. The servants, displaying their concern for the true members of the church, want to gather up the weeds so as not to let them harm the wheat. Their zealousness, though, must be examined for any carnal heat mixed in.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "An enemy hath done thisâ€”Kind words these from a good Husbandman, honorably clearing His faithful servants of the wrong done to his field."
2. "Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?â€”Compare with this the question of James and John, 'Lord, wilt Thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume' those Samaritans? In this kind of zeal there is usually a large mixture of carnal heat."

### John Gill:
1. "An enemy has done this... meaning, not that the enemy was a man; for he was the devil... but it is an Hebraism; such as in Esther 7:6, 'the man adversary and enemy' is this wicked Haman; and signifies a certain enemy, and one indeed that is an implacable enemy to man."
2. "The servants said unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? which words express the concern of the ministers of Christ for the true members of the church, comparable to wheat, lest they should receive any damage by the ill examples, and pernicious principles of evil men among them."
3. "They show great regard to the glory of God, and interest of religion, and their readiness to execute any orders Christ should give them; but not willing to proceed of themselves, ask counsel and advice of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "An enemy hath done this â€” A plain answer to the great question concerning the origin of evil."
2. "Darnel, in the Church, is properly outside Christians, such as have the form of godliness, without the power."
3. "Open sinners, such as have neither the form nor the power, are not so properly darnel, as thistles and brambles: these ought to be rooted up without delay, and not suffered in the Christian community."
