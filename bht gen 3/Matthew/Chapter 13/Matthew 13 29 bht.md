# Matthew 13:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Between the wheat and tares, discerning the difference is difficult until they mature in the blade. This parable teaches the challenge of distinguishing the two classes, and attempting to hastily remove the tares may harm the wheat. It is important to exercise patience in the Church, as not everyone suspected to be a tare should be immediately removed, as it may offend genuine believers. A pure and perfect church is not to be expected in this present age, so saints must patiently endure until Christ intervenes.
