## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A parable is a story of that which purports to have happened,â€“has not actually happened, but might have happened."
2. "The Parable is especially adapted to different classes of hearers at once: it is understood by each according to his measure of understanding."
3. "The great Teacher by Parables therefore is He who needed not that any should testify of man; for He knew what was in man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These parables are SEVEN in number and it is not a little remarkable that while this is the sacred number, the first FOUR of them were spoken to the mixed multitude, while the remaining THREE were spoken to the Twelve in privateâ€”these divisions, four and three, being themselves notable in the symbolical arithmetic of Scripture."
2. "while the first of the Sevenâ€”that of the Sowerâ€”is of the nature of an Introduction to the whole, the remaining Six consist of three pairsâ€”the Second and Seventh, the Third and Fourth, and the Fifth and Sixth, corresponding to each other; each pair setting forth the same general truths, but with a certain diversity of aspect."
3. "This parable may be entitled, THE EFFECT OF THE WORD DEPENDENT ON THE STATE OF THE HEART."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A parable is a form of teaching in which one thing is thrown beside another. Hence its radical idea is comparison." 
2. "The unspiritual do not link these facts of the natural life with those of the supernatural, which are not discerned by them, and therefore they need an interpreter of the relation between the two."
3. "The parable differs from the allegory in that there is in the latter 'an interpenetration of the thing signified and the thing signifying; the qualities and properties of the first being attributed to the last,' and the two being this blended instead of being kept distinct and parallel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Many things. Out of the 'many,' Matthew selects these parables; for this selection we seek a reason." 
2. "Behold, calling attention to what follows, not to some object in sight, which would have distracted attention from the parable." 
3. "The sower, standing for the class; went forth, i.e., as usual, pointing rather to a supposed case, than to something occurring before their eyes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The parables already mentioned in Matthew include the salt and the light, the birds and the lilies, the splinter and the beam in the eye, the two gates, the wolves in sheep's clothing, the good and bad trees, the wise and foolish builders, the garment and the wineskins, the children in the market places." 
2. "The word parable is an objective illustration for spiritual or moral truth."
3. "The parables of Jesus are vivid word pictures. To understand them one must see them, with the eyes of Jesus if he can. Christ drew his parables from familiar objects."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of [the parable of the sower] is to set forth the nature of the word of God, the work and business of the ministers of it, the different success of the preaching of it, and the fruitfulness of it."
2. "[The sower] is Jesus Christ himself, who is often so called on account of his human nature... and may the rather be thought to be intended here, since the seed he sowed is called 'his seed'; meaning the Gospel."
3. "This sower 'went forth' from his own house to his field; which, as applied to Christ, may intend his incarnation, his coming into this world... and his going forth still in his ministers, and by his Spirit, in the preaching of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "This way of speaking, extremely common in the eastern countries, drew and fixed the attention of many, and occasioned the truths delivered to sink the deeper into humble and serious hearers."
2. "At the same time, by an awful mixture of justice and mercy, it hid them from the proud and careless."
3. "How exquisitely proper is this parable to be an introduction to all the rest! In this our Lord answers a very obvious and a very important question."
