## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the general sense, the insignificant beginnings of the kingdom are set forth: the little babe cast in the manger at Bethlehem; the Man of sorrows with no place to lay His Head; the crucified One; or again the hundred and twenty names who were the seed of the Church after the Lord had ascended." 
2. "We must beware however of imagining that the outward Church-form is this Kingdom. It has rather reversed the parable, and is the worldly power waxed to a great tree and the Churches taking under the shadow of it."
3. "The individual application of the parable points to the small beginnings of divine grace; a word, a thought, a passing sentence, may prove to be the little seed which eventually fills and shadows the whole heart and being, and calls ‚Äòall thoughts, all passions, all delights‚Äô to come and shelter under it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, that is, 'never so little faith.'" (28 words)
2. "But as this seed has a hot, fiery vigor, gives out its best virtues when bruised, and is grateful to the taste of birds, which are accordingly attracted to its branches both for shelter and food..." (34 words)
3. "...is it straining the parable, asks TRENCH, to suppose that, besides the wonderful growth of His kingdom, our Lord selected this seed to illustrate further the shelter, repose and blessedness it is destined to afford to the nations of the world?" (46 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Less than all seeds, i.e., those sown by the Jews."
2. "The main point is the rapid growth from a diminutive seed."
3. "The birds of the heaven represent the external adherents of the kingdom, nations nominally Christian; oftentimes ‚Äòoutward church form,‚Äô since the kingdom itself is not the Church organization."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  A tree (Œ¥ŒµŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøŒΩ). "Not in nature, but in size" (Bruce). "An excusable exaggeration in popular discourse." 


### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel, and the ministry of it were like a grain of mustard seed, little, mean, and contemptible; the author of it, Christ, was so to the Jews, in his birth, parentage, education, and outward appearance."
2. "The grace of God, which under the ministry of the word is implanted in the hearts of the Lord's people, is at first very small, like a grain of mustard seed; it is a day of small things; faith in Christ is very weak and low, spiritual strength small, comfort little, experience of the love of God not large, light and knowledge in the doctrines of grace but very obscure and glimmering."
3. "The Gospel, and the ministry of it, as to its large spread in the world; which at first was confined to the Jews, but was afterwards published to the Gentiles, and carried through the whole world; and, in ages since, has made a considerable progress, particularly at the Reformation; and will make a much greater one, towards the end of time."

### John Wesley:
1. "The least ‚Äî That is, one of the least: a way of speaking extremely common among the Jews."
2. "It becometh a tree ‚Äî In those countries it grows exceeding large and high."
3. "So will the Christian doctrine spread in the world, and the life of Christ in the soul."
