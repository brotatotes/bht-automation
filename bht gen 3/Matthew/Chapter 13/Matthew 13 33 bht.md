# Matthew 13:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the leaven portrays the all-penetrating and assimilating quality of the Gospel, by which it gradually transforms the whole mass of humanity with the influence of the Holy Spirit. Just as the leaven permeates the dough, the Gospel reaches the conscience, enlightens the understanding, and subdues the will of each individual. This parable emphasizes the inward growth of the kingdom and the personal agency and example of believers, utterly transforming institutions and tribes of men, uniting the world under the kingdom of our Lord and His Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But then, how is it said that the Kingdom of Heaven is like this leaven? For the construction is not the same as in ver. 24, where the similitude is to the whole course of things related, but answers to 'a grain of mustard seed which a man took,'&c.: so 'leaven, which a woman took,'&c."
2. "The Parable, like the last, has its general and its individual application: (1) in the penetrating of the whole mass of humanity, by degrees, by the influence of the Spirit of God, so strikingly witnessed in the earlier by the dropping of heathen customs and worship;â€”in modern times more gradually and secretly advancing, but still to be plainly seen in the various abandonments of criminal and unholy practices."
3. "In fact the Parable does nothing less than set forth to us the mystery of regeneration, both in its first act, which can be but once, as the leaven is but once hidden; and also in the consequent (subsequent?) renewal by the Holy Spirit, which, as the ulterior working of the leaven, is continual and progressive."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavenedâ€”This parable... holds forth, perhaps, rather the inward growth of the kingdom, while 'the Mustard Seed' seems to point chiefly to the outward."
2. "It yields more real satisfaction to see in this brief parable just the all-penetrating and assimilating quality of the Gospel, by virtue of which it will yet mould all institutions and tribes of men."
3. "and exhibit over the whole earth one 'kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The kingdom of heaven - The meaning here is the same as in the last parable; perhaps, however, intending to denote more properly the secret and hidden nature of piety in the soul."
2. "It is secret, silent, steady; pervading all the faculties of the soul and all the kingdoms of the world, as leaven, or yeast, though hidden in the flour, and though deposited only in one place, works silently until all the mass is brought under its influence."
3. "The measure mentioned here probably contained about a peck and a half."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leaven [Î¶Ï…Î¼Î·] . Wyc., sour dough, as German Sauerteig. From zew, to boil or seethe, as in fermentation."
2. "The English leaven is from the Latin levare, to raise, and appears in the French levain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure is generally applied to evil influences, but here probably to gracious ones."
2. "The parable indicates that the influence is internal and noiseless, not dependent upon external organization so much as upon quiet personal agency and example."
3. "The leaven transforms the dough lying next, until it is 'all leavened.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The language of Jesus is not to be explained away by such exegetical jugglery."
2. "The leaven permeates all the 'wheaten meal' till the whole is leavened."
3. "To find the Trinity here is, of course, quite beside the mark."

### John Gill:
1. "so the Gospel reaches the conscience, pierces the heart, enlightens the understanding, informs the judgment, raises and sets the affections on right objects, subdues the will, and brings down all towering thoughts, to the obedience of Christ, in particular persons."
2. "The Gospel, where it takes place, warms the affections, causes the heart to burn within, inspires with zeal for God, and Christ, and the Gospel; it swells and fills churches with such as shall be saved, and assimilates the several persons it operates in."
3. "To be 'leavened' by the Gospel, is to be evangelized by it, to be brought into the life and liberty of it, to a Gospel way of living by faith on Christ; to derive all peace, joy, and comfort from him, and not from any works of righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. Three measures â€” This was the quantity which they usually baked at once: till the whole was leavened - Thus will the Gospel leaven the world and grace the Christian. Luke 13:20.
