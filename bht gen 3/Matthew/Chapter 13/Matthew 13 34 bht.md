### John Calvin:
1. "Though Mark expressly says, that Christ spoke the word to them as they were able to bear it, yet I think it probable that he continued to employ parables, not so much for the purpose of instruction, as to keep the attention of his hearers awake till a more convenient time."
2. "For why did he explain them familiarly to his disciples when they were apart? Was it because they were more slow of apprehension than the great body of the people? No; but because he wished to convey to them privately a knowledge of his meaning, and to allow others to remain in a state of suspense, till a fitter opportunity should arrive."
3. "These were only a sort of introduction to the Gospel, the full brightness and publication of which was delayed till the proper time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 13:34. And without a parable spake he nothing unto them. On that occasion; probably true also of the subject of discourse, the kingdom of heaven.

2. "Not that he never had preached but in a parabolical way unto them, or that he never did afterwards use any other way of speaking... but in that sermon, and at that time, he thought fit to make use of no other method."
3. "He explained the meaning of some of them to his disciples, at their request, yet he dismissed the multitude without any explication of them."

### John Wesley:
1. Without a parable spake he not unto them â€” That is, not at that time; at other times he did.
