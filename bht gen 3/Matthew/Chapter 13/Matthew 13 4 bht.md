# Matthew 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this vivid scene, a cornfield slopes towards the water's edge, while an unpaved path traverses through it without any barrier. Thorn bushes, reminiscent of the crown of thorns, emerge from the midst of the swaying wheat. The seed that falls by the wayside signifies those who are careless and inattentive, much like birds devouring the seed. These individuals hinder the effectiveness of the seed, similar to how the birds consume it. The challenge lies in evading both the birds' consumption and the scorching heat that can cause the seed to wither.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There was the undulating cornfield descending to the water's edge."
2. "There was the trodden pathway running through the midst of it, with no fence or hedge to prevent the seed from falling here and there on either side of it or upon it; itself hard with the constant tramp of horse and mule and human feet."
3. "There were the large bushes of thorn - the nabk, that kind which tradition says that the crown of thorns was woven - springing up, like the fruit-trees of the more inland parts, in the very midst of the waving wheat."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The paths or roads pass close to the edge of the ploughed ground in unenclosed fields; or the reference may be to the path across the field on which the sower walked as he sowed."
2. "In any case the seed was exposed, and quickly picked up by the birds."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By the wayside (œÄŒ±œÅŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒøŒ¥ŒøŒΩ). People will make paths along the edge of a ploughed field or even across it where the seed lies upon the beaten track."
2. "Devoured (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœÜŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒΩ). 'Ate down.' We say, 'ate up.' Second aorist active indicative of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœÉŒ∏Œπœâ (defective verb)."


### John Gill:
1. "By the wayside; by the common road, or private paths, which led through corn fields, in which Christ and his disciples walked... and designs such hearers as are careless, negligent, and inattentive." 
2. "Mean the devils; so called, because their habitation is in the air... to hinder its usefulness, as fowls do, where seed is sowing." 
3. "Satan, and his principalities, and powers, rove about in the air, come down on earth, and seek whom they may devour."

### John Wesley:
1. "The first danger is, that the birds will devour the seed."
2. "If it escape this, there is then another danger, namely, lest it be scorched, and wither away."
3. "A vast majority of those who hear the word of God, receive the seed as by the highway side."
