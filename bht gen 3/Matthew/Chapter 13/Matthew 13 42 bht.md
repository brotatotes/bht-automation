2. "What terrific strength of languageâ€”the 'casting' or 'flinging' expressive of indignation, abhorrence, contempt."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a metaphorical expression; for, as the infinite glory which is laid up for the sons of God so far exceeds all our senses, that we cannot find words to express it, so the punishment which awaits the reprobate is incomprehensible, and is therefore shadowed out according to the measure of our capacity."
2. "From ignorance of this, the Sophists have tortured themselves, to no purpose, by fruitless disputes."
3. "I choose to philosophize more sparingly, and to rest satisfied with the plain and natural meaning."

### Philip Schaff:
