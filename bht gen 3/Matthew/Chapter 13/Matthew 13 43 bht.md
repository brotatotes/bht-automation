## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They shall shine, literally, shine out (their light here being enfeebled and obscured), as the sun from a cloud."
2. "Of their Father, answering to the sons, ver. 38."
3. "This sublime announcement is over and above the interpretation of the parable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Fatherâ€”as if they had been under a cloud during the present association with ungodly pretenders to their character, and claimants of their privileges, and obstructors of their course."
2. "Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
3. "The subject of this last pair, as of the two former, is the same, but also under a slight diversity of aspect: namelyâ€”THE PRICELESS VALUE OF THE BLESSINGS OF THE KINGDOM. And while the one parable represents the Kingdom as 'found without seeking,' the other holds forth the Kingdom as 'sought and found.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shine forth as the sun from behind a cloud."
2. "The mixture of evil with good in the world obscures the good."
3. "Veils the true glory of righteous character."

### John Calvin:
1. "Then will the righteous shine. What a remarkable consolation!"
2. "Though many wicked men now hold a high rank in the Church, yet that blessed day is assuredly to be expected, when the Son of God shall raise his followers on high, and remove every thing that now tends to dim or conceal their brightness."
3. "The kingdom of the Father, as the inheritance of the godly, is contrasted with the earth, to remind them that here they are pilgrims, and therefore ought to look upwards towards heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then shall the righteous shine forth. The gospel tells how men become â€˜righteous.â€™ As such they have a glory, a light which is here obscured, but shall then burst forth, as Christâ€™s glory shall appear."
2. "In the kingdom of their Father. The righteous being Godâ€™s adopted sons, He is â€˜their Father.â€™ This kingdom of final glory seems to be distinguished from the mediatorial kingdom of Christ spoken of throughout the chapter; comp. 1 Corinthians 15:24."
3. "He that hath ears, etc. This conclusion befits the importance of the parable. The prophecy respecting the destiny of all men deserves the attention of all men. Yet even on this point many have no ears to hear."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Shine forth (ÎµÎºÎ»Î±Î¼ÏˆÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î½). Shine out as the sun comes from behind a cloud (Vincent) and drive away the darkness after the separation has come (cf. Daniel 12:3). 


### John Gill:
1. "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun...in perfect holiness of nature, in all felicity and prosperity of soul; and in the shining dazzling robes of glory, incorruption, and immortality, on their bodies." 
2. "The ultimate glory may...be styled the kingdom of the Father; of God, who is the Father of Christ and of his people; and which is observed, to assure the saints of their interest in it, right unto it, and certain enjoyment of it." 
3. "Who hath ears to hear, let him hear; and seriously consider of the several things said in this parable, concerning the wheat and tares, the righteous and the wicked, as being matters of the greatest moment and importance."
