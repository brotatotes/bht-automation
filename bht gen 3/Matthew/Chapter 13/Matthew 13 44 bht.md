## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This sets before us the case of a man who unexpectedly, without earnest seeking, finds, in some part of the outward Church, the treasure of true faith and hope and communion with God."
2. "Having found this, for joy of it he becomes possessor, not of the treasure without the field (for that the case supposes impossible), but of the field at all hazards, to secure the treasure which is in it."
3. "He possesses himself of the means of grace provided in that branch of the Church, where, to use a common expression, he has 'gotten his good:' he makes that field his own."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a fieldâ€”no uncommon thing in unsettled and half-civilized countries, even now as well as in ancient times, when there was no other way of securing it from the rapacity of neighbors or marauders." 
2. "the which when a man hath foundâ€”that is, unexpectedly found."
3. "he hideth, and for joy thereofâ€”on perceiving what a treasure he had lighted on, surpassing the worth of all he possessed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The point of the parable lies in his 'earnestness,' his anxiety, his care, and his actually obtaining it."
2. "The gospel is more valuable than such a treasure... It is hidden from most people."
3. "The truth often lies buried: it is like rich veins of ore in the sacred Scriptures; it must be searched out with diligence, and its discovery will repay a man for all his sacrifices."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are greatly in need of such a warning; for we are so captivated by the allurements of the world, that eternal life fades from our view."
2. "The excellence of the heavenly life is not perceived, indeed, by the sense of the flesh; and yet we do not esteem it according to its real worth, unless we are prepared to deny, on account of it, all that glitters in our eyes."
3. "The heavenly kingdom is commonly held as of no account, because men are incapable of relishing it, and do not perceive the inestimable value of that treasure which the Lord offers to us in the Gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He obtained the â€˜treasure,â€™ worth more than he could pay, and also â€˜the field,â€™ which he could buy." 
2. "Many, therefore, refer â€˜the fieldâ€™ to the external Church, in which a man may, as it were, stumble on the treasure of true religion; he naturally possesses himself also of the means of grace, the external forms of the Church."
3. "We may aptly apply it historically to the days of the Reformation, when true religion was sought and obtained at the cost of everything; the discovery of the treasure was apparently accidental, and great joy attended it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He may have hid it to prevent it being stolen, or to prevent himself from being anticipated in buying a field" (Plummer).
2. "The enormous wealth of the Kingdom for which any sacrifice, all that one has, is not too great a price to pay."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel, which is a treasure consisting of rich truths, comparable to gold, silver, and precious stones; of the most valuable blessings, and of exceeding great, and precious promises; and reveals the riches of God, of Christ, and of the other world."
2. "The Gospel was in some measure hid, under the former dispensation, from the Old Testament saints; and for a long time was hid from the Gentile world; and is entirely hid from them that are lost, who are blinded by the god of this world; and even from the elect of God themselves, before conversion."
3. "The willingness of such souls, who are led into the glory, fulness, and excellency of the word of God, the scriptures of truth, and of the immense treasure of the Gospel therein, to part with all that has been, or is dear unto them; with their sins, and self-righteousness; with their good names and characters; their worldly substance, and life itself, for the sake of the Gospel, and their profession of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The kingdom of God within us is a treasure indeed, but a treasure hid from the world, and from the most wise and prudent in it."
2. "He that finds this treasure, (perhaps when he thought it far from him,) hides it deep in his heart, and gives up all other happiness for it."
3. "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field."
