## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this parable our Lord sets before us, that although in ordinary cases of finding â€˜the truth as it is in Jesus,â€™ the buying of the field is the necessary prelude to becoming duly and properly possessed of it; yet there are cases, and those of a nobler kind, where such condition is not necessary."
2. "This case then corresponds to such Christians only as from youth have been trained up in the way which they should go. In these alone can be the settled habits, the effectual self-direction, the convergence to one point of all the powers and tendencies of the soul, which are indicated by the illustration."
3. "But as the same writer goes on to observe, even here there is a discovery, at a particular time. The person has been seeking, and finding, goodly pearls; what is true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report: but at last he finds one pearl of great priceâ€“the efficacious principle of inward and spiritual life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 45. Again, the kingdom of heaven is
	like unto a merchantman, seeking goodly pearls.


### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 13:45. Merchant seeking goodly pearls. One who is making it his business to seek what is valuable, what is true and right.
	


### John Gill:
1. "He has sought after them which implies, that they were lost and going astray; expresses his great love to them, value for them, and desire after them."
2. "Christ's finding his elect a chance business; nor have they any intrinsic excellency in them, to denominate them pearls, but by his grace."
3. "Such a soul is willing to part with all for him; with sinful self, and righteous self; and with the honors, riches, and profits of this world; and buy him, his grace and righteousness, without money, and without price."

### John Wesley:
1. "The kingdom of heaven â€” That is, one who earnestly seeks for it..." 
2. "the Gospel, wherever it is preached, gathers at first both good and bad, who are for a season full of approbation and warm with good desires." 
3. "But Christian discipline, and strong, close exhortation, begin that separation in this world, which shall be accomplished by the angels of God in the world to come."
