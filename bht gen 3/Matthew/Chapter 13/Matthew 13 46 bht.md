## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He chooses vital Christianity, at whatever cost, for his portion."
2. "The pearl is bought pure‚Äîby itself. It is found, not unexpectedly in the course of outward ordinances, with which therefore it would become to the finder inseparably bound up."
3. "The pearl is found by diligent search, spiritual and immediate, in its highest and purest form."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The one pearl of great price, instead of being found by accident, as in the former case, is found by one whose business it is to seek for such, and who finds it just in the way of searching for such treasures." 
2. "But in both cases the surpassing value of the treasure is alike recognized, and in both all is parted with for it."
3. "The object of this brief parable is the same as that of the Tares and Wheat. But as its details are fewer, so its teaching is less rich and varied."

### John Calvin:
1. "By the word buy Christ does not mean, that men bring any price, with which they may purchase for themselves the heavenly life...yet we are said to buy it, when we cheerfully relinquish the desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent us from obtaining it."
2. "...we are said to buy it, when we cheerfully relinquish the desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent us from obtaining it."
3. "Cheerfully relinquish the desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent us from obtaining it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One pearl of great price. Christ Himself, not religion; when this pearl becomes ours, we have true religion."
2. "This parable has a historical application to the present age of investigation and discovery. True science seeks goodly pearls, and leads to the discovery of the one pearl of great price."
3. "We may hope for a purer Christianity as the result of intense and earnest investigation; yet the whole discourse shows that side by side with this we must expect an intense and earnest search in the interest of Satan‚Äôs kingdom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He went and sold...rather eagerly and vividly told thus, 'He has gone off and sold.'" 
2. "The present perfect indicative, the dramatic perfect of vivid picture."
