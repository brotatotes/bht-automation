# Matthew 13:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, the Church is depicted as a net that gathers people from all kinds of backgrounds. The far-reaching power of the Gospel is highlighted, as it draws in a variety of individuals with different characters. While the Church is a mixture of good and bad, it serves as a restraint for Christ's disciples. The separation between the holy and unholy will come later. Until then, the Church remains imperfect, never fully free from stains and pollutions, but still fulfilling its purpose in bringing diverse souls to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The leading idea of this parable is the ultimate separation of the holy and unholy in the Church, with a view to the selection of the former for the masterâ€™s use."
2. "This net is the Church gathering from the sea of the world, all kinds."
3. "The comparison must not be strained beyond its limits, as our Lord shews us that the earthly here gives but a faint outline of the heavenly."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word here rendered 'net' signifies a large drag-net, which draws everything after it, suffering nothing to escape, as distinguished from a casting-net." 
2. "The far-reaching efficacy of the Gospel is thus denoted." 
3. "This Gospel net 'gathered of every kind,' meaning every variety of character."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A long draw-net, the ends of which are carried out and drawn together."
2. "Men join hands, so as to form a line across from the north coast to the south, and then march through the island from end to end, and hunt out the inhabitants."
3. "He saw that all had fallen in blood and dust, many as fishes on the shelving beach, drawn from the hoary deep by those who tend the nets with myriad meshes."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Church of God, so long as it exists in the world, is a mixture of the good with the bad, and is never free from stains and pollutions."
2. "Christ intends not only to remove the offense which perplexes many weak minds, because they do not find in the world all the purity that might be desired, but likewise to employ the influence of fear and modesty, in restraining his disciples."
3. "The Church will not be free from every spot and blemish, until Christ shall have separated the sheep from the goats."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A drag-net or seine is meant. Appropriate for an audience largely made up of fishermen."
2. "The parable resembles that of the tares; that, however, represented the two developments of good and evil, side by side in the world (and in the church); this one is applicable rather to the missionary effort of the Church."
3. "â€˜The seaâ€™ is a Scriptural figure for â€˜the nationsâ€™ (Revelation 17:15; Isaiah 8:7; Psalms 65:7). Gathered of every kind. This predicted result of Christian effort is sufficiently evident at all times."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Just as the field is the world, so the drag-net catches all the fish that are in the sea."
2. "The separation comes afterwards."
3. "The slain suitors in the halls of Ulysses are likened to fishes on the shore caught by nets with myriad meshes."

### John Gill:
1. "By which also is meant, the Gospel, and the ministry of it. This may be compared to a net, for its meanness in the esteem of men... and yet like a net, a piece of curious artifice and workmanship, being the produce of the grace of God; in which his manifold wisdom is displayed."
2. "The casting of it into the sea, designs the opening of the Gospel, and the unfolding the mysteries of it, and the preaching it in all the world; and supposes persons qualified for it... and requires art, skill, and wisdom, might and strength, industry, diligence, and patience; and which is done at a venture, whether there are fish or not; and sometimes succeeds, and sometimes not."
3. "The preaching of the Gospel, is the means of gathering souls to Christ, and into his churches; and those that are gathered into a visible Gospel church state, are of every kind, of all nations in the world; Jews and Gentiles: of all ranks and degrees of men, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free; of all sorts of sinners, and of men good and bad; some who have the truth of grace in them, and others that are only hypocrites."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Matthew 13:47, the parable of the net represents the Church gathering people from all walks of life. This powerful Gospel net draws everyone in, leaving no one behind. While the comparison of the earthly net falls short of the heavenly reality, it captures the far-reaching efficacy of the Gospel. Just as the net catches all the fish in the sea, the Church welcomes everyone, regardless of their background or character. However, the ultimate separation between the holy and the unholy will occur later. In the meantime, the Church exists as a mixture of good and bad, never completely free from stains and pollutions. Yet, through the influence of fear and modesty, Christ uses this mixture to restrain His disciples.
