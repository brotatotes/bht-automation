# Matthew 13:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The separation of the righteous and the wicked is a deliberate and judicial process that will take place once the number of the elect is complete. This separation is depicted by casting away the worthless fish, representing the removal of the wicked. We are warned against rushing this discernment, as it is God's prerogative. Ultimately, there will only be two categories: the children of God and those destined for judgment. The preaching of the Gospel will cease, and the righteous will enter Christ's eternal kingdom, while the wicked will face a burning punishment.
