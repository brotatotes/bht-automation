## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That there were four persons known as 'His brethren,' or 'the brethren of the Lord,' NOT OF THE NUMBER OF THE TWELVE."
2. "That not a word is any where dropped to prevent us from inferring that these brethren were His relations in the same literal sense as we know His mother to have been; but that His own saying, where He distinguishes His relations according to the flesh from His disciples, seems to sanction that inference."
3. "The silence of the Scripture narrative leaves it free for Christians to believe these to have been real (younger) brethren and sisters of our Lord, without incurring any imputation of unsoundness of belief as to His miraculous conception."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whence, then, such wisdom and such miracles?"
2. "These particulars of our Lord's human history constitute the most valuable testimony."
3. "His townsmen had discovered nothing about Him different from other men."

### John Calvin:
1. "Most improperly and unjustly, therefore, were the inhabitants of Nazareth offended on this account; for they ought rather to have received him with reverence, as one who had suddenly come down from heaven."
2. "They see God working in Christ, and intentionally turn away their eyes from this sight, to behold Joseph, and Mary, and all his relatives; thus interposing a veil to shut out the clearest light."
3. "The word brothers, we have formerly mentioned, is employed, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, to denote any relatives whatever; and, accordingly, Helvidius displayed excessive ignorance in concluding that Mary must have had many sons, because Christâ€™s brothers are sometimes mentioned."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The carpenterâ€™s son. The word rendered â€˜carpenterâ€™ is sometimes applied to artisans in general, but it means strictly a worker in wood."
2. "The question, though not contemptuous, implies: He is one of us, no better than we are, etc."
3. "They knew His family, and mention the name of His mother and brothers, speaking also of His sisters, who possibly still resided in Nazareth."

### John Gill:
1. "Is not this the carpenter's son?... The generally received notion of the ancient Christians is, that he was a carpenter, and that Jesus was brought up to the same business, which lay in making ploughs and yokes."
2. "Plain Mary, without any other title, or civil respect; a poor spinstress, that got her bread by her hand labour: the Jews say, she was a plaiter of women's hair, and treat her with the utmost scorn."
3. "The Jews ought not to have made these remarks, since many of their great doctors were of mean parentage; as R. Zachariah was a butcher's son, and R. Jochanan a blacksmith's son."

### John Wesley:
1. "The carpenter's son â€” The Greek word means, one that works either in wood, iron, or stone."
2. "His brethren â€” Our kinsmen. They were the sons of Mary, sister to the virgin, and wife of Cleophas or Alpheus."
3. "James â€” Styled by St. Paul also, the Lord's brother, Galatians 1:19. Simon - Surnamed the Canaanite."
