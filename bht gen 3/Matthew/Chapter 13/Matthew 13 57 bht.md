# Matthew 13:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people in Jesus' hometown turned against him and were repelled by him because they found it difficult to accept someone so extraordinary coming from their midst. They were envious of his wisdom and too proud to be taught by him.

3. "It is truly extraordinary that a prophet of God, whom others warmly receive as a newly-arrived stranger, should be despised in the place where he was born."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "It was a stumbling to them, how he came by his wisdom and power; since he had not these things from men of learning, and could not have them from his relatives: and therefore, rather than believe he had them of himself, or from God, they chose to indulge at least a suspicion, that he had them from the devil." 
2. "if without the advantage of an education without human literature, and the instructions of men, he was able to expound the Scriptures, preach such doctrine, and deliver such words of wisdom, and confirm all this by miracles, and mighty works, they ought to have considered him as a divine person." 
3. "showing, that a prophet, or any teacher, or preacher, generally speaking, is more esteemed among strangers, who have no personal pique, nor prejudices against him, and who judge of him, not by what he has been, but by his present abilities, doctrine, and conduct, than among his countrymen."

### John Wesley:
1. They were offended at him â€” They looked on him as a mean, ignoble man, not worthy to be regarded. John 4:44; Luke 7:23.

Even though the proverb a prophet is not without honor except in his own country was well-known, it is still extraordinary that a prophet of God, who is warmly received everywhere else, would be despised in the place where he was born.
