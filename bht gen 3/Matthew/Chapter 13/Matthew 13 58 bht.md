# Matthew 13:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of Nazareth failed to fully embrace the ministry of Jesus and their disbelief prevented him from performing many miracles among them. Though he did heal a few sick individuals, their lack of faith limited his power. Without faith, prayer becomes formal and ineffective, leading to spiritual death and a lack of blessings. Jesus does not force his love or miracles upon us, and where there is no faith, there can be no mighty works. God's grace, however, triumphs over disbelief and demonstrates its power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "did not; could not do"
2. "On the identity, or not, of this preaching at Nazareth"
3. "related much earlier by Luke iv. 16 sq."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And he did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief."
2. "save that He laid His hands on a few sick folk, and healed them."
3. "See on :-."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It would have been useless to the great purposes of his mission to have worked miracles there."
2. "He did, therefore, only those things which were the proper work of benevolence, and which could not easily be charged on the devil."
3. "God requires faith. He hears only the prayers of faith. And when there is little true belief, and prayer is cold and formal, there the people sleep in spiritual death and are unblessed."

### John Calvin:
1. "But they willingly stupify themselves, so as to have no relish for it."
2. "For certainly unbelievers, as far as lies in their power, bind up the hands of God by their obstinacy."
3. "While we are endeavoring by every possible method to hinder the grace of God from coming to us, it rises victorious, and displays its efficacy in spite of all our exertions!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus does not force His love or blessings on us, and His miracles were not mere displays of Almighty Power. Where there was no faith, no moral condition to justify such displays, there our Lord â€˜could do no mighty worksâ€™ (Mark 6:5). Want of faith is always the great hindrance."
2. "The first view is the most natural one. Objections: (a.) It denies the perpetual virginity of Mary. But this is nowhere asserted, while Matthew 1:25 and Luke 2:7, suggest the contrary. (b.) Galatians 1:19, seems to intimate that James, our Lordâ€™s brother, was an Apostle, while this view involves the non-identity of this James with James the son of AlphÃ¦us, who undoubtedly was an Apostle."
3. "The view that Mary had other children furnishes an argument in favor of the historical character of the Gospels. Had the story of the miraculous conception been a fiction, the Evangelists, to give consistency to the tale, would have denied that our Lord had any brothers, instead of speaking of them without reserve."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Mighty works (Î´Ï…Î½Î±Î¼ÎµÎ¹Ï‚). Powers. The "disbelief" (Î±Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¹Î±Î½) of the townspeople blocked the will and the power of Jesus to work cures. 


### John Gill:
1. "Some he did, though not many; partly that they might be left inexcusable, and partly that it might not be said, he did not wish well, to his own country..."
2. "What he did, were not of the first class, and greatest note; he only 'laid his hands', as Mark says, upon a few sick folk, and healed them..."
3. "Their continued unbelief in him, notwithstanding his ministry and miracles among them, was matter of surprise to him; but here they are given as a reason why he did no more mighty works among them..."

### John Wesley:
1. He wrought not many mighty works, because of their unbelief â€” And the reason why many mighty works are not wrought now, is not, that the faith is not every where planted; but, that unbelief every where prevails.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus returned to his hometown of Nazareth, but the people there did not; could not do much to receive the fullness of his ministry. Despite the miracles and teachings they had heard about in other places, their disbelief hindered Jesus from performing many mighty works among them. Although he did lay his hands on a few sick individuals and heal them, his power was limited by their lack of faith. This lack of faith was a great hindrance, as Jesus does not force his love or blessings upon people. Without faith, prayer becomes cold and formal, and the people remain unblessed. The unbelief of the townspeople blocked both the will and the power of Jesus to work cures. Nevertheless, even in the face of unbelief, God's grace rises victorious and displays its efficacy.
