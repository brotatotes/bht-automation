- Attempt 1 BHT: Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee and Perea, heard about the fame and reports of Jesus. This is not surprising, considering the widespread recognition of Jesus' name. Herod's title of tetrarch signifies his rule over a fourth part of the kingdom. He was a light-minded and superstitious prince who had not thought much of Jesus up until this point, but now, through the extended labors of the Twelve, he finally hears of Him. The purpose of the Evangelists including this event is to emphasize that the name of Christ was celebrated everywhere, leaving no room for the Jews to claim ignorance.
