# Matthew 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The beheading of John the Baptist occurred during King Herod Antipas's feast, possibly at Machaerus or nearby. The girl's request, Give me here, suggests that the prison was in close proximity. The speculator, an executioner mentioned in Mark 6:27, likely played a role in beheading John. It is a mysterious and providential act that allowed a holy man to be at the mercy of an infamous harlot, a vain girl, and a drunken prince. Despite the injustice, belief in divine retribution remains, as God rewards His faithful servants in the hereafter for their earthly sufferings.
