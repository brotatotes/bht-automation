# Matthew 14:11 Commentary Help Text

The little girl in this account has been variously portrayed as a scorned woman, a lustful individual, and even as Kipling's female of the species.

However, what is apparent is that her deep-seated antagonism towards John the Baptist's truth led her to silence his voice, bringing about the stripping of her family's honors, wealth, and banishment from the kingdom.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The little girl in this verse has been portrayed as a scorned woman, a lustful individual, and even as Kipling's female of the species. These depictions, however, lack substantial evidence. Some suggest that the woman may have been a jealous and vindictive adulteress, as well as an immodest dancer influenced by her mother. Whatever the case may be, it is clear that her request to have John the Baptist's head was driven by a deep-rooted dislike for his words of truth. As a result, she not only silenced his voice but also brought about the downfall of her family.
