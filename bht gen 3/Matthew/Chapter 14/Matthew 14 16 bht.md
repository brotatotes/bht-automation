"We have no right, indeed, to expect that Christ will always follow this method of supplying the hungry and thirsty with food; but it is certain that he will never permit his own people to want the necessaries of life, but will stretch out his hand from heaven, whenever he shall see it to be necessary to relieve their necessities."
2. "Those who wish to have Christ for their provider, must first learn not to long for refined luxuries, but to be satisfied with barley-bread."
3. "To the same purpose is what follows, that he gave them the loaves, in order that in their hands the astonishing increase might take place, and that they might thus be the ministers of Christâ€™s divine power; for as if it had been of small importance that they should be eye-witnesses, Christ determined that his power should be handled by them."
