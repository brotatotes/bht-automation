# Matthew 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this scenario, the disciples' doubt and skepticism stand in stark contrast to Jesus' unwavering confidence and strength. Instead of acknowledging the divine power Jesus possesses, the disciples overlooked it and focused on their own limitations. Nonetheless, Jesus takes the limited resources they had mentioned â€” the five loaves and two fishes â€” and transforms them into something valuable and abundant. This reminds us of the importance of entrusting what little we have to Christ, for when we place it in His hands, He can multiply it beyond our expectations.
