# Matthew 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Haunted by guilt and fear, Herod was shaken by the news of John the Baptist's death. In the king's superstitious mind, the murdered prophet returned to life, appearing in the person of Jesus, as visions of John's severed head tormented his conscience. Herod believed that Jesus possessed supernatural powers, surpassing those of John, acquired through bodily resurrection. Filled with a mixture of fear and condescending curiosity, Herod longed to see Jesus, but his flawed perception hindered him from grasping Christ's true identity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The murdered prophet haunted his guilty breast like a specter and seemed to him alive again and clothed with unearthly powers in the person of Jesus."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was astonishing that, amidst the diversity of views which were suggested, the true interpretation did not occur to any one; more especially as the state of matters at that very time directed them to Christ."
2. "They are compelled to acknowledge that some divine power belongs to him, and yet they fall into their own fancies, and change him into the persons of other men. It is thus that the world is wont, in base ingratitude, to obliterate the remembrance of the favors which God has bestowed."
3. "With such blind terrors God frequently alarms wicked men; so that, after all the pains they take to harden themselves, and to escape agitation, their internal executioner gives them no rest, but chastises them with severity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This does not imply a belief in the transmigration of souls, nor prove that Herod was a Sadducee... it is the perplexed and terrified utterance of a guilty conscience."

3. "There were many conjectures about Jesus as a result of this tour of Galilee and Herod Antipas feared this one."

### John Gill:
1. "The guilt of which action rose in his mind, lay heavy on him, and filled him with horror and a thousand fears."
2. "Who now fears, what before he did not believe; and what he fears, he affirms."
3. "These miracles which were wrought by him, were convincing proofs of the truth of his resurrection, and of what he was able to do to him, and what he might righteously expect from him."

### John Wesley:
1. He is risen from the dead â€” Herod was a Sadducee: and the Sadducees denied the resurrection of the dead. But Sadduceeism staggers when conscience awakes.
