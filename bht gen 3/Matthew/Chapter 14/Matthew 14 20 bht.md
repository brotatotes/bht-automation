# Matthew 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Everyone had their portion and were filled. The pieces of bread, not the scraps, were distributed, and each of the twelve disciples had a basketful left over. The fragments that remained after satisfying such a vast multitude were twelve times larger than the original portions, serving as a striking proof of the miracle. This miracle was intended to reveal God's blessing and provision, reminding us that if we are indolent and ungrateful, the only obstacle to having a sufficiency of food is ourselves.
