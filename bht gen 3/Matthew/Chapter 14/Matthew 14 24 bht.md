## BHT:

It is only in the presence of Christ that they find comfort and peace amidst the storms.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "But the ship was now in the midst of the sea - John says they had sailed about 25 or 30 furlongs."

### John Calvin:
1. "When Christ permitted his disciples to be tossed about in a perilous condition, for a time, by an opposing storm, it was to fix their attention more powerfully on the assistance which he brought to them."
2. "Justly, therefore, are they now charged with stupidity in not immediately recollecting that heavenly power, having beheld, on the preceding day, so astonishing a proof of it, which ought to have been still before their eyes."
3. "This appears to have been added, not only as an aggravation of their fault, but as a warning to us respecting the corruption of our understanding, that we may seek from the Lord new eyes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Distressed (Î²Î±ÏƒÎ±Î½Î¹Î¶Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½). Like a man with demons (Matthew 8:29). One can see, as Jesus did (Mark 6:48), the boat bobbing up and down in the choppy sea. 


### John Gill:
1. "The ship in which the disciples were, was an emblem of the church of Christ, and of its state and condition in this world."
2. "The world is like a sea, for its largeness, and the abundance of nations and people in it, compared to many waters...and for its fickleness and inconstancy, changes and war being continually in it."
3. "In the mean while, whilst they are sailing through the sea of this world, they are often...tossed with tempests, and not comforted...and then is it most uncomfortable to them, when Christ is not with them."

### John Wesley:
1. In the evening â€” Learned men say the Jews reckoned two evenings; the first beginning at three in the afternoon, the second, at sunset. If so, the latter is meant here.
