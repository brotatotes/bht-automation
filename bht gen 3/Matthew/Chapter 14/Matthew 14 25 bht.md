### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In this account, the disciples were in their boat on the sea, and Jesus appeared to them by walking on the water, a clear display of His supernatural power. As the disciples were caught in a storm, Jesus came to them during the fourth watch of the night, between three and six in the morning. This late hour indicates that Jesus had spent most of the night alone on the mountain in prayer and that while the Master prayed, the disciples could not be lost. His purpose in walking on the water was to test their faith. The Jews divided the night into three watches, but it is unclear if this is the division being referred to here. Regardless, Jesus's ability to walk on the sea revealed His authority over the sea, echoing the description of the Almighty in Job 9:8, Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. It is worth noting that some scholars have contended that Jesus was simply walking along the beach, but this theory is inconsistent with Matthew's account.
