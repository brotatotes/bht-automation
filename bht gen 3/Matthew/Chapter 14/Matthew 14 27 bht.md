## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "But as terror had already overpowered their minds, he corrects that terror, lest it should hinder or abate their confidence: not that they could all at once lay aside fear and experience unmingled joy, but because it was necessary that the fear which had seized them should be allayed, that it might not destroy their confidence."
2. "...the effect which they produce on believers is here described to us as widely different. They cause inward peace and strong confidence to hold the sway over our hearts, that we may not yield to carnal fears."
3. "There are good reasons why the Lord frequently delays to bestow that deliverance which he has ready at hand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is I. An assurance, through a living voice, of His bodily presence."
2. "Be not afraid. The presence of Christ always brings with it this cheering injunction."

### John Gill:
1. "Be of good cheer, it is I, be not afraid: take heart, be of good courage, do not be affrighted at my appearance, from whom you have nothing to fear."
2. "Christ may be sometimes near his people, and they not know him;...persons have wrong apprehensions of him, and are filled with dread and fears, concluding they have no interest in him."
3. "When Christ makes himself known unto them, as the able and willing Saviour, and their Saviour and Redeemer, then, instead of dreading him as a judge, their fears vanish, their faith increases."
