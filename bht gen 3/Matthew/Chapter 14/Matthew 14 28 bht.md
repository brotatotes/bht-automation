2. "In many cases God promotes our interests better by refusing our requests; but at times he yields to us, that by experience we may be the more fully convinced of our own folly."
3. "The power of Christ shone more brightly in the person of Peter, when he admitted him as a companion, than if he had walked alone on the waters."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The occurrence is strikingly in accordance with Peterâ€™s impulsive character, â€˜almost a rehearsalâ€™ of the subsequent denial."
2. "Not the language of doubt Peterâ€™s fault lay in the words: bid me, etc., which betray a desire to outdare the other disciples."

1.  Upon the waters (ÎµÏ€ Ï„Î± Ï…Î´Î±Ï„Î±). The impulsiveness of Peter appears as usual. Matthew alone gives this Peter episode.

2. "bid me come unto thee on the water; thereby expressing great love and affection to Christ, being willing to come to him, though through danger, through storms and tempests; and also his strong faith in him, supposing it to be he; who, he knew, was as able to support his body on the water, as his own..." 
3. "...and yet much modesty, submission, and dependence; not willing to take a step without his order."
