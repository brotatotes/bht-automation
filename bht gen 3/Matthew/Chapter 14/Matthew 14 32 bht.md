When they had come into the boat, the wind grew weary and ceased, as if exhausted in the presence of its Master. This was another proof that the Son of God was with them. They worshipped him, acknowledging his divine power. The boat being immediately at the land where they were going could be attributed to either the wind driving them there or another miracle. The wind and sea obeyed Jesus, who is Lord of both.
