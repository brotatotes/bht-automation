1.  36.] On hem, see note on ch. ix. 20.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Were made perfectly whole [Î´Î¹ÎµÏƒÏ‰Î¸Î·ÏƒÎ±Î½] . The preposition dia, through or thorough, indicates complete restoration. 
The Rev. omits perfectly, because whole, in itself, implies completeness.

1. "A woman had been thus healed in the presence of a crowd... so that these people were not superstitious, but had strong faith."
2. "Christ's miracles were always performed so as to show a connection between Himself and the person cured, even though it were so slight a one as this touch."
3. "This is the fourth general description of our Lord's ministry; in each case... after a series of events grouped together without reference to accurate chronological order."

### John Gill:
1. "This they desired, partly to show the strength of their faith in him, that they doubted not of a cure, could they be admitted so near his person."
2. "Partly, to signify the sense of their unworthiness, to be in another way taken notice of by him, either by speaking to them, or putting his hands on them."
3. "Christ condescended to this their request, and perfectly cured all such of their diseases, of whatever kind they were, who, in the exercise of faith, touched the hem of his garment."
