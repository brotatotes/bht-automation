# Matthew 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. This saying emphasizes the fundamental truth that moral uncleanness is what truly defiles a person, not external things. The distinction between clean and unclean, upheld by the Mosaic law, is surpassed by this teaching. It is sin, originating from the heart and expressed through words and actions, that renders a person loathsome and abominable in the sight of God.
