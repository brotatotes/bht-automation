# Matthew 15:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The teaching of the Pharisees, not of divine planting but altogether human, is already doomed. It is likened to a plant that will be rooted up, reflecting the fate of their corrupt doctrine. The presence of false and corrupt religion should not deter us, as God promises to oppose and destroy whatever is not of divine origin. Those truly rooted in God will bear good fruit and will never be uprooted, unlike those who lack genuine faith and grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The plant is the teaching of the Pharisees, altogether of human, and not of divine planting."
2. "That this is so, is clear by 'let them alone' following, and by the analogy of our Lord's parabolic symbolism."
3. "Seed, plant, &c., are compared to doctrine, which however in its growth becomes identified with, and impersonated by, its recipients and disseminators."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted upâ€”They are offended, are they? Heed it not: their corrupt teaching is already doomed." 
2. "The garden of the Lord upon earth, too long cumbered with their presence, shall yet be purged of them and their accursed system."
3. "Whatsoever is not of the planting of My heavenly Father, the great Husbandman, shall share the same fate."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no reason to wonder if the doctrine of salvation shall prove deadly to the reprobate, because they are always carried headlong to the destruction to which they are doomed."
2. "By their own malice, they turn to their destruction all that is offered to them, however salutary it may be."
3. "It is beautifully expressed by the parable, that the cause of perdition does not lie in the doctrine, but that the reprobate who have no root in God, when the doctrine is presented to them, throw out their hidden venom, and thus accelerate that death to which they were already doomed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This refers to the teaching and traditions of the Pharisees, although the persons became identified with their false doctrine."
2. "It was a declaration of a purpose to oppose the Pharisees. To us it is a promise, with a terrible side indeed, but bidding us take courage when we see false and corrupt religion flourishing."
3. "'Shall be rooted up.'"

### John Gill:
1. "whatever doctrine is not delivered by God, or whatever ordinance is not instituted by him; whatever is not of heaven, but of man, of man's devising, and of human imposition [...] must be opposed and rejected; and sooner or later will be utterly rooted up, and destroyed."
2. "There are some plants, which are planted by Christ's Father, which is in heaven; [...] These are planted by the river of God's love, in the person of Christ, in the likeness of his death and resurrection [...] and are themselves planted in the courts of the Lord, in a Gospel church state; and being watered with the dews of grace, appear to be choice plants, plants of renown, pleasant ones, very fruitful, and which shall never perish, or be rooted, and plucked up."
3. "there are others [...] who pretend to much religion and holiness, make a show of the leaves of profession, but have not the fruit of grace; these get into churches, and are outwardly and ministerially planted there; but being never rooted in Christ, nor partake of his grace, in time they wither, and die away."

### John Wesley:
1. Every plant â€” That is, every doctrine.
