# Matthew 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Plato said, mortal things enter through our mouths, but immortal things flow out. While physical food nourishes our perishable bodies, the words we speak reflect the laws of our eternal souls. It is not what enters from the outside that defiles us, but the evil that stirs within our hearts and finds expression in our thoughts and actions. Christ calls us to use our intellect not for pride, but for discernment. May we guard against intellectual laziness and embrace the freedom from worldly bondage that these teachings proclaim.

2. "...whatsoever food a man takes in at his mouth, he swallows down, and it is received into his stomach; which, having performed its office, the grosser parts go down into the belly, and passing through the bowels, are evacuated into the vault, or privy, 'purging all meats'."
3. "nor can any part of what goes into a man defile him, because it only enters into the body, and passes through it..."

### John Wesley:
1. Are ye also yet without understanding â€” How fair and candid are the sacred historians? Never concealing or excusing their own blemishes.
