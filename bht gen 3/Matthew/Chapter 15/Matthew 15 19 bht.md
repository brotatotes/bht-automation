## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The first shape which the evil that is in the heart takes, when it begins actively to stir, is that of 'considerations' or 'reasonings' on certain suggested actions."
2. "covetousnesses'â€”or desires after more; 'wickednesses'â€”here meaning, perhaps, malignities of various forms; 'deceit, lasciviousness'â€”meaning, excess or enormity of any kind, though by later writers restricted to lewdness."
3. "How appalling is this black catalogue!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For all good and evil, whether in the body or in human nature, originates, as he declared, in the soul, and overflows from thence, as from the head into the eyes; and therefore, if the head and body are to be well, you must begin by curing the soul. That is the first thing."
2. "Thoughts [Î´Î¹Î±Î»Î¿Î³Î¹ÏƒÎ¼Î¿Î¹]. Lit., reasonings (compare Mark 9:33, Rev.), or disputings (Philippians 2:14), like the captious questioning of the Pharisees about washing hands."

### John Calvin:
1. "Out of the heart of man proceeds all that is sinful and that corrupts by its pollution."
2. "All sins proceed from the wicked and corrupt affections of the heart."
3. "An unholy heart pollutes the eyes by making them the ministers, or organs, of wicked desires."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, i.e., reasonings, purposes, not mere notions."
2. "The criminality of acts proceeds from the purpose; for these acts man is responsible."
3. "The plural form indicates that these sins are common and notorious."

### John Gill:
1. "The thoughts of sin are evil, are to be hated, forsaken, and for which men are accountable to God."
2. "[These include] all wicked imaginations, carnal reasonings, lustful desires, and malicious contrivances."
3. "An evil eye; of envy and covetousness."

### John Wesley:
1. First evil thoughts â€” then murders - and the rest.
Railings â€” The Greek word includes all reviling, backbiting, and evil speaking.
