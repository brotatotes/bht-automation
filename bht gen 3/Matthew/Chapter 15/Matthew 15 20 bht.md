# Matthew 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The things that defile a person extend beyond ceremonial impurity to encompass moral impurity as well. Striving for holiness is crucial, as actions that are inconsistent with holiness are considered common and profane. Such actions bring defilement to both the body and soul, resulting in guilt and exposing one to everlasting punishment. Conversely, eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person nor transgress any divine laws. Only through the blood of Christ can we be cleansed from the pollution and guilt of our actions, securing us from the punishment we rightfully deserve.

- Attempt 1 BHT: These are the things which defile a man, as our Lord summarizes in this discourse. Ceremonial impurity is insignificant compared with moral impurity, yet Christians are slow to learn this.

These actions bring a defilement on the whole person, body, and soul, fastening guilt and exposing one to everlasting punishment.
