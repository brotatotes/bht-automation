# Matthew 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To eat with unwashed hands may seem insignificant, but as our Lord says, it is the things that defile a man. Ceremonial impurity is outweighed by moral impurity, yet we are slow to learn this. The term ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½Î¿á¿–, meaning to make common or profane, highlights the separation between the Jews and Gentiles. These things are filthy and bring defilement to the whole man. Neglecting to wash one's hands before a common meal does not contract filth to the soul or guilt to the conscience; only the blood of Christ can cleanse us from these evils.
