## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason alleged by the disciples must be coupled with our Lord's unwillingness to be known, stated by St. Mark, and means, â€˜she will draw the attention of all upon us.â€™"
2. "Send her away does not necessarily imply granting her request, nor the contrary; but simply dismiss her, leaving the method to our Lord Himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 23. But he answered her not a word.
	And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for
	she crieth after usâ€”(Also see on :-.)


### Marvin Vincent:
1. Send her away. With here request granted; for, as Bengel exquisitely remarks, "Thus Christ was accustomed to send away."


### John Calvin:
1. "Here they bring before us her unshaken constancy; for the silence of Christ was a sort of refusal, and there is reason to wonder that she was not cast down by this trial, but her continuance in prayer was a proof of her perseverance."
2. "But as Christ has two ways of speaking and of being silent, it must be observed, that though he withheld at that time the words of his mouth, yet he spoke within to the mind of the woman, and so this secret inspiration was a substitute for the outward preaching."
3. "We see then that the design of Christâ€™s silence was not to extinguish the womanâ€™s faith, but rather to whet her zeal and inflame her ardor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By this unwonted silence our Lord would try her faith; and prove it to His disciples."
2. "Dismiss her. They did not mean: refuse her request."
3. "Their language was not selfish, but a recognition of the womanâ€™s importunate earnestness, perhaps of her faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The disciples greatly disliked this form of public attention, a strange woman crying after them."
2. "They disliked a sensation."
3. "Did they wish the woman sent away with her daughter healed or unhealed?"

### John Gill:
1. "This giving her no answer, either that he would, or would not help her, carried in it a tacit repulse of her, and a denial of assistance to her."
2. "The reason they give is, for she crieth after us; not only because she was troublesome to them, was importunate with them, and would take no denial from them: she followed them wherever they went; there was no getting rid of her."
3. "But also, because her case was so moving, was delivered in such an affecting manner, and her cries were piercing, that they could not bear them; and therefore entreat him, that he would relieve, and dismiss her."

### John Wesley:
1. He answered her not a word â€” He sometimes tries our faith in like manner.
