# Matthew 15:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The use of the term dogs in reference to the woman does not indicate any contempt; rather, it refers to tame and familiar household dogs. By calling the Gentiles little dogs who belong to their masters, Jesus is speaking honorably of them. This interaction serves as a test of the woman's faith and serves to emphasize the rejection of the Jews who refuse the blessings intended for them but are freely offered to those who seek them fervently.
