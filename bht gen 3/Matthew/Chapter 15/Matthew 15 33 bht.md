# Matthew 15:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' quick forgetfulness of the feeding of the five thousand is surprising and shows their lack of faith. Some scholars doubt the possibility of two similar miracles, but it is plausible that Jesus could perform them in different places. The disciples were concerned about the lack of bread and being in a deserted place, but they should have remembered Jesus' ability to provide abundantly. We should learn from their example and trust in God's past assistance, expecting His future provision even in difficult situations.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The disciples seemed to have quickly forgotten about the feeding of the five thousand, which is surprising considering it was a significant miracle. While some scholars question the idea of two similar miracles, it is plausible that Jesus could perform such miracles in different places. It's interesting to note how our own forgetfulness and lack of faith resemble the disciples' little faith in this situation. The disciples focused on the lack of bread needed and the fact that they were in a deserted place. However, given the previous miracle, they should have remembered that Jesus is capable of providing abundantly. This serves as a reminder for us to not be indifferent and to trust that the experience of God's past assistance can lead us to expect His future provision, even in seemingly impossible situations.
