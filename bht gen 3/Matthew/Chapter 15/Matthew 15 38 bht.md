## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Four thousand, instead of 'five thousand.' In this case the material miracle seems not to have been so great, as respects the number fed and the fragments remaining."
2. "All these variations, which show no gradation between the miracles, and betray no special design, prove that the Evangelists give true accounts of two distinct miracles."
3. "The Evangelists give true accounts of two distinct miracles."

### John Gill:
1. "This number of men, as well as of the baskets of fragments, clearly shows this to be a distinct miracle from the former of this kind." (Matthew 15:38)
2. "There the number of men were five thousand, here four thousand; there the quantity of food was five loaves and two fishes, here seven loaves and a few fishes." (Matthew 15:38)
3. "Though the quantity might be as large; since the word here used for a basket is not the same as there, and designs one of a larger size." (Matthew 15:38)
