# Matthew 15:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus arrived at Magadan, a place about which little is known. Some suggest that Magadan may actually be the same location as Magdala or Dalmanutha, both of which were nearby villages. On the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee, these villages were within Galilee again. It is worth noting that Mark refers to it as Dalmanutha. After being in Magadan, Jesus dismissed the people, possibly offering a prayer or exhortation, before continuing on His journey. One possibility is that He then went to Dalmanutha, which may have been another place with the same name.

- Attempt 5 BHT: After the feeding of the four thousand, Jesus and His disciples set sail for Magadan, a place about which not much is known. Some speculate that Magadan may have been a Sabbath-day's journey from Chamnath Gadara, while others suggest that Magadan and Dalmanutha were in the same vicinity. It is believed that Magadan was located on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee, in Galilee itself. Mark refers to this place as Dalmanutha. As they departed, Jesus dismissed the crowd, either with a prayer or words of exhortation. Ultimately, Magadan seems to have been a village near Magdala, north of Tiberias and on the western shore of the lake. Additionally, it is worth noting that Dalmanutha, mentioned in Mark, was likely another place with the same name near Jerusalem.
