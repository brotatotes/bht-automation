## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 4. For God commanded, saying, Honour
	thy father and motherâ€” ( :-). 
	
and, He that curseth father
	or mother, let him die the deathâ€” ( :-).


### Marvin Vincent:
1. Die the death [Î¸Î±Î½Î±Ï„Ï‰ Ï„ÎµÎ»ÎµÏ…Ï„Î±Ï„Ï‰] . The Hebrew idiom is, he shall certainly be executed. The Greek is, lit., let him come to his end by death.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that revileth, etc. Exodus 21:17. Our Lord quotes, not the promise in the Decalogue, but the penalty given elsewhere. â€˜Revileth,â€™ lit., â€˜speaketh evil of,â€™ comp. Mark 9:39, which shows that â€˜cursethâ€™ is too strong a term."
2. "Surely die. In the original Hebrew: â€˜dying he shall die;â€™ in the original Greek of this passage: â€˜let him end with death,â€™ both equivalent to: â€˜he shall surely die; â€˜this penalty is to be inflicted upon him."

### John Gill:
1. "Honour thy father and mother. This was a plain command of God, written with his own hand, and delivered by Moses to them; it was of a moral nature, and of eternal obligation."
2. "To be understood, not merely of that high esteem parents are to be had in by their children, and of the respectful language and gesture to be used towards them, and of the cheerful obedience to be yielded to them; but also of honouring them with their substance, feeding, clothing, and supplying them with the necessaries of life when they stand in need thereof."
3. "And which is a positive command of God, made as a fence for the former; and is to be understood, not only of giving abusive language to parents, but of slighting, as the Hebrew word signifies, and neglecting them, taking no notice of them, when needy and in distress, to supply their wants."

### John Wesley:
1. Honour thy father and mother â€” Which implies all such relief as they stand in need of. Exodus 20:12; 21:17.
