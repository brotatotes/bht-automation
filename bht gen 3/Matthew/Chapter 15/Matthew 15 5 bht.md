# Matthew 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders cunningly used the word Corban to avoid their obligation to support their parents. By declaring their possessions as offerings to God with this word, they claimed exemption from their familial responsibilities. However, Jesus denounced this practice, revealing their hypocrisy and the nullification of God's commandments due to their tradition. Their selfish pursuit of personal gain took precedence over their duty to honor and care for their parents, a stark contrast to true obedience to God.

1. "The plain and evident sense of the tradition before us, is this that when, upon application being made to a man by his parents, for support and sustenance, he makes a vow in such form as this, 'Corban, whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me' that is, whatsoever profit or advantage thou mightest have, or expect to have from me, let it be as 'Corban', as a gift devoted to God, that can never be revoked and converted to another use; or, in other words, I vow and protest thou shalt never have any profit from me, not a penny."
2. "Nay they expressly say that ◊†◊ì◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ó◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊¢◊ú ◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô ◊û◊¶◊ï◊î, 'vows fall upon things of a (divine) commandment', as well as upon things in a man's power, and that he is bound by them; so that without sin he cannot do what the law commands; insomuch, that if a man vows a vow, and that it may be ratified, a command must be made void, his vow must stand, and the command be abrogated."
3. "So truly and justly does Christ charge them with making the command of God of none effect, by their tradition."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest have been profited by me."
