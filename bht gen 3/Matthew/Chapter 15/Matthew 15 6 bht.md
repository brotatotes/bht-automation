# Matthew 15:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By prioritizing their own traditions and technicalities, the religious leaders of Jesus' time were voiding the authority of God's commandments. Though dedicating property to God is commendable, it should not come at the expense of honoring one's parents. The Pharisees' rejection of the fifth commandment and their reliance on empty rituals undermined the moral force of God's word. Unfortunately, this tendency to prioritize man-made traditions over direct commands from God is still present in modern-day Pharisaism. We must be cautious not to let church traditions lead us to deny God's direct commands.
