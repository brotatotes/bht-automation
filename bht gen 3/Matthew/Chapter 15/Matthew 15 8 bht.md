## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The portion of Isaiah from which this citation is made (ch, xxiv.â€”xxxv.) sets forth, in alternate threatenings and promises, the punishment of the mere nominal Israel, and the salvation of the true Israel of God."
2. "Its threats and promises are for all times of the Church."
3. "The particular event then foretold being but one fulfilment of those deeper and more general declarations of God, which shall be ever having their successive illustrations in His dealings with men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By putting the commandments of men on a level with the divine requirements, their whole worship was rendered vainâ€”a principle of deep moment in the service of God."
2. "The drivelling nature of their multitudinous observances is here pointedly exposed, in contrast with the manly observance of 'the commandment of God.'"
3. "It is implied that He had but given a specimen of the hideous treatment which the divine law received, and the grasping disposition which, under the mask of piety, was manifested by the ecclesiastics of that day."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Is far [Î±Ï€ÎµÏ‡ÎµÎ¹] . Lit., holds off from me.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "This people, etc. The briefer form is now the established reading. Early copyists inserted the full form."
2. "Their heart is far from me. In the Hebrew: â€˜Their heart they have removed far from me.â€™"
3. "Applicable first to the contemporaries of Isaiah, but descriptive of the unbelieving Jews in all ages, and, as our Lord declares, peculiarly â€˜apt â€˜at that time."

### John Gill:
1. "They approached the ordinances of God, and drew nigh to him, and attended him in outward worship; they prayed unto him publicly, and constantly, in the streets, in the synagogues, and temple, and with much seeming devotion and sanctity."
2. "They owned him to be their creator and preserver; they made their boast of him, and of their knowledge of him, as the one only living, and true God, and as the God of Israel; they brought their sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, even the fruit of their lips, unto him, for their many peculiar mercies, privileges, and favours, as a nation, church, and people, and with much seeming sincerity and affection."
3. "They had no true love to God, nor faith in him, nor fear of him; they were not at all concerned for his presence with them, or for communion with him, or for his honour and glory; their hearts were in the world, and after their covetousness."

### John Wesley:
1. Their heart is far from me â€” And without this all outward worship is mere mockery of God. Isaiah 29:13.
