## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The portion of Isaiah from which this citation is made (ch, xxiv.â€”xxxv.) sets forth, in alternate threatenings and promises, the punishment of the mere nominal Israel, and the salvation of the true Israel of God."
2. "Its threats and promises are for all times of the Church;â€”the particular event then foretold being but one fulfilment of those deeper and more general declarations of God."
3. "Shall be ever having their successive illustrations in His dealings with men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By putting the commandments of men on a level with the divine requirements, their whole worship was rendered vainâ€”a principle of deep moment in the service of God."
2. "The drivelling nature of their multitudinous observances is here pointedly exposed, in contrast with the manly observance of 'the commandment of God'."
3. "It is implied that He had but given a specimen of the hideous treatment which the divine law received, and the grasping disposition which, under the mask of piety, was manifested by the ecclesiastics of that day."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Is far [Î±Ï€ÎµÏ‡ÎµÎ¹] . Lit., holds off from me.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their heart is far from me." 
2. "Applicable first to the contemporaries of Isaiah, but descriptive of the unbelieving Jews in all ages."
3. "Peculiarly 'apt' at that time."

### John Gill:
1. "They approached the ordinances of God, and drew nigh to him, and attended him in outward worship; they prayed unto him publicly, and constantly, in the streets, in the synagogues, and temple, and with much seeming devotion and sanctity."
2. "But their heart is far from me; they had no true love to God, nor faith in him, nor fear of him; they were not at all concerned for his presence with them, or for communion with him, or for his honour and glory."
3. "They made religion a tool to their secular purposes, supposing gain to be godliness; sought the applause of men, and contented themselves with bodily exercise; having no regard to internal religion, powerful godliness."

### John Wesley:
1. Their heart is far from me â€” And without this all outward worship is mere mockery of God. Isaiah 29:13.
