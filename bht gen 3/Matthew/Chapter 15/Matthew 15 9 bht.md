# Matthew 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True worship is undermined when human authority and man-made traditions are elevated above God's commandments. Worship becomes empty and in vain when people substitute their own will and teachings for those of God. This will-worship draws upon them heavier condemnation as they neglect the true doctrines of the Bible and instead impose the orders and injunctions of men. By prioritizing the traditions of the elders over the commandments of God, they commit a heinous sin deserving of retribution.
