# Matthew 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples should have understood that Jesus was not speaking about physical bread when he mentioned the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The miracles he had performed should have made it clear to them that he was not concerned about earthly bread. It is surprising that they did not grasp the figurative and mystical nature of his words, and instead, thought that he was concerned about the literal bread they brought. It is as if they could not comprehend that Jesus' words went beyond the approval or disapproval of the Pharisees and Sadducees regarding literal leaven.
