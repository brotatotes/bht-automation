## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The A.V. has beyond doubt the right rendering of this reading: and the Son of Man is a pregnant expression, which we now know to imply the Messiahship in the root of our human nature, and which even then was taken by the Jews as = the Son of God."
2. "Some would render as if our Lord had said, 'Who say men that I am? the Son of Man?' i.e. the Messiah? but this is inadmissible, for the answer would not then have been expressed as it is, but affirmatively or negatively."
3. "Equally inadmissible is Olshausen‚Äôs rendering, ‚ÄòMe, who am, as ye are aware, the Son of Man?‚Äô an expression, Olshausen says, by which the disciples would be led to the idea of the Son of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This quiet and distant retreat Jesus appears to have sought with the view of talking over with the Twelve the fruit of His past labors, and breaking to them for the first time the sad intelligence of His approaching death."
2. "What are the views generally entertained of Me, the Son of man, after going up and down among them so long?"
3. "He had now closed the first great stage of His ministry, and was just entering on the last dark one. His spirit, burdened, sought relief in retirement, not only from the multitude, but even for a season from the Twelve."

### John Calvin:
1. "What do men think about Jesus the Son of Mary? He calls himself, according to custom, the Son of man, as much as to say, Now that clothed in flesh I inhabit the earth like other men, what is the opinion entertained respecting me?"
2. "The design of Christ was, to confirm his disciples fully in the true faith, that they might not be tossed about amidst various reports, as we shall presently see."
3. "It is for the sake of distinguishing between these two towns that Philippi is added to the name; for though it is conjectured by some to have been built on the same spot where the town of Dan formerly stood, yet, as it had lately been rebuilt by Philip the Tetrarch, it was called Philippi."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The parts of Cesarea Philippi. Mark: ‚Äòvillages.‚Äô Probably not the city itself, but retired localities in the neighborhood, better adapted for private intercourse." 
2. "Who do men say that the Son of man is? The common reading is an alteration to bring out more fully the implied thought: ‚ÄòI am the Son of man, the Messiah.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Caesarea Philippi (ŒöŒ±ŒπœÉŒ±œÅŒπŒ±œÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ¶ŒπŒªŒπœÄœÄŒøœÖ). Up on a spur of Mt. Hermon under the rule of Herod Philip."
2. "He asked (Œ∑œÅœâœÑŒ±). Began to question, inchoative imperfect tense."
3. "He was giving them a test or examination. The first was for the opinion of men about the Son of Man."

### John Gill:
1. "He calls himself 'the son of man', because he was truly and really man; and because of his low estate, and the infirmities of human nature, with which he was encompassed."
2. "His view in putting this question to them, was to make way for another, in order to bring them to an ingenuous confession of their faith in him."
3. "Christ speaks here of himself, according to his outward appearance, and the prevailing opinion of men concerning him; that he looked to be only a mere man, born as other men were; was properly a son of man, and no more."

### John Wesley:
