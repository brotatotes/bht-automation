## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The name Peter (not now first given, but prophetically bestowed by our Lord on His first interview with Simon, John i. 43) or Cephas, signifying a rock, the termination being only altered from Petra to Petros to suit the masculine appellation, denotes the personal position of this Apostle in the building of the Church of Christ."
2. "It is on Peter, as by divine revelation making this confession, as thus under the influence of the Holy Ghost, as standing out before the Apostles in the strength of this faith, as himself founded on the one foundation, Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. iii. 11â€”that the Jewish portion of the Church was built."
3. "The meaning of the promise is, that over the Church so built upon him who was by the strength of that confession the Rock, no adverse power should ever prevail to extinguish it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That thou art Peterâ€”At his first calling, this new name was announced to him as an honor afterwards to be conferred on him. Now he gets it, with an explanation of what it was meant to convey."
2. "My Church," says our Lord, calling the Church HIS OWN; a magnificent expression regarding Himself, remarks BENGELâ€”nowhere else occurring in the Gospels.
3. "It shall never perish." Some explain it of "the assaults of the powers of darkness"; but though that expresses a glorious truth, probably the former is the sense here.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The obvious reference of the word is to Peter. The emphatic this naturally refers to the nearest antecedent; and besides, the metaphor is thus weakened, since Christ appears here, not as the foundation, but as the architect."
2. "Both in Hebrew and in New Testament usage ejkklhsia implies more than a collective or national unity; rather a community based on a special religious idea and established in a special way."
3. "The expression Gates of Hades is an orientalism for the court, throne, power, and dignity of the infernal kingdom. Hades is contemplated as a mighty city, with formidable, frowning portals."

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ declares how highly he is delighted with the confession of Peter, since he bestows upon it so large a reward."
2. "Peter receives a twofold honor, the former part of which relates to his personal advantage, and the latter to his office as an Apostle."
3. "Against all the power of Satan the firmness of the Church will prove to be invincible, because the truth of God, on which the faith of the Church rests, will ever remain unshaken."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase refers to Peter, but as a confessor, as in Christ, representing the other Apostles."
2. "The Romanist view: Peter is referred to, but as the official head of the Twelve; as such the Bishop of Rome is his successor."
3. "Christ means His own Person. So Augustine (in later years) and many excellent commentators. This view claims that petros means a stone and petra a rock, so that Peter is a living stone from Christ the true rock, and whosoever would become a living stone, a â€˜petros,â€™ must make this true confession of Christ, the Rock, on whom as God and man the Church will be built."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What is the rock on which Christ will build his vast temple? Not on Peter alone or mainly or primarily. Peter by his confession was furnished with the illustration for the rock on which His church will rest. It is the same kind of faith that Peter has just confessed." 
2. "The perpetuity of this church general is guaranteed." 
3. "Christ's church will prevail and survive because He will burst the gates of Hades and come forth conqueror. He will ever live and be the guarantor of the perpetuity of His people or church."

### John Gill:
1. "By the church, is meant, not an edifice of wood, stones, c. but an assembly, and congregation of men and that not of any sort [...] but the elect of God, the general assembly and church of the first born, whose names are written in heaven."
2. "And these are the only persons which make up the true and invisible church of Christ in the issue, and are only fit to be members of the visible church; and all such ought to be in a Gospel church state, and partake of the privileges of it."
3. "But rather, it designs the doctrine Peter made a confession of; which, though it may be opposed by hell and earth, by Satan, and his emissaries, by the open force of persecutors, and the secret fraud of heretics, it may be brought into contempt by the scandalous lives of professors; and though the true professors of it may die off, yet truth itself always lives, and defies the power of death, and the grave."

### John Wesley:
1. "On this rock â€” Alluding to his name, which signifies a rock, namely, the faith which thou hast now professed; I will build my Church."
2. "And it is certain, that as he is spoken of in Scripture, as the only foundation of the Church, so this is that which the apostles and evangelists laid in their preaching."
3. "Shall not prevail against it â€” Not against the Church universal, so as to destroy it. And they never did. There hath been a small remnant in all ages."
