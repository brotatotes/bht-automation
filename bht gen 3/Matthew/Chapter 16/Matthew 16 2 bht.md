# Matthew 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Looking at the evening sky, a man says, Fine weather, and in the morning, Storm today. Christ rebukes their carnal and sensuous expectations, as they were excessively occupied with earthly advantages and cared little about anything heavenly. Recognizing the signs of the sky but failing to recognize the signs of the kingdom of God, they were blind to the manifest signs and miracles confirming Christ's Messiahship. With their misplaced priorities, Christ gives them no other answer than this.
