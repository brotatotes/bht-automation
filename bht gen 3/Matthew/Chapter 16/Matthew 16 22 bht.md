# Matthew 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's immediate rebuke of Jesus, after his exalted confession, exposes a moment of spiritual faith preceding the betrayal of carnal weakness. Despite his affectionate intentions, Peter's action is sharply rebuked as he presumptuously takes Jesus aside and confidently rejects God's plan.

This serves as a reminder to rely on the word of God for wisdom, rather than our own judgments or good intentions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression of spiritual faith may, and frequently does, precede the betraying of carnal weakness."
2. "Never is this more probable than when the mind has just been uplifted, as Peter's was, by commendation and lofty promise."
3. "It is this spirit of confident rejection of God‚Äôs revealed purpose which the Lord so sharply rebukes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Then Peter took him‚Äîaside, apart from the rest; presuming on the distinction just conferred on him; showing how unexpected and distasteful to them all was the announcement."
2. "and began to rebuke him‚Äîaffectionately, yet with a certain generous indignation, to chide Him."
3. "saying, Be it far from thee: this shall not be unto thee‚Äîthat is, 'If I can help it': the same spirit that prompted him in the garden to draw the sword in His behalf."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Took him apart to speak with him privately. Meyer renders, correctly, after he had taken him to himself. 'As if,' says Bengel, 'by a right of his own. He acted with greater familiarity after the token of acknowledgment had been given. Jesus, however, reduces him to his level.'" 
2. "Be it far from thee [ŒπŒªŒµœâœÇ œÉŒøŒπ] . Rev., in margin, God have mercy on thee. In classical usage, of the gods as propitious, gracious toward men, in consideration of their prayers and sacrifices. The meaning here is, may God be gracious to thee."
3. "Shall not be [ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑ ŒµœÉœÑŒ±Œπ] . The double negative is very forcible : 'Shall in no case be.' Rev. renders it by never."

### John Calvin:
1. "But so completely are men hurried on and driven headlong by inconsiderate zeal, that they do not hesitate to pass judgment on God himself, according to their own fancy."
2. "And here we learn what estimation in the sight of God belongs to what are called good intentions."
3. "It is on this account that Christ reproves it so sharply, and bruises it, as it were, with an iron hammer, to teach us that it is only from the word of God that we ought to be wise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be it far from thee, Lord, lit, ‚Äòpropitious to thee,‚Äô equivalent either to, God be favorable to thee, or spare thyself."
2. "This shall never be to thee. An over-confident declaration, betraying pride as well as opposition to the purpose of God (‚Äòmust go,‚Äô Matthew 16:21) revealed by our Lord."
3. "Peter was bold as confessor and as opposer, was impulsive, perhaps vain and ambitious. Moreover Satan is most busy in seducing us when we have been most highly exalted and favored by Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter took him (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ Œø Œ†ŒµœÑœÅŒøœÇ). Middle voice, 'taking to himself,' aside and apart, 'as if by a right of his own. He acted with greater familiarity after the token of acknowledgment had been given." 
2. "Peter here appears in a new character; a minute ago speaking under inspiration from heaven, now under inspiration from the opposite quarter."
3. "This shall never be (ŒøœÖ ŒºŒ∑ ŒµœÉœÑŒ± œÉŒø œÑŒøœÖœÑŒø). Strongest kind of negation, as if Peter would not let it happen. Peter had perfect assurance."

### John Gill:
1. "Peter took him, took him aside, by himself... to expostulate with him, and dissuade him from thinking and talking of any such things."
2. "He did it not out of passion and ill will, but out of tenderness and respect."
3. "He could not see how such an innocent person could be so used by the chief men of the nation; and that the Messiah... could be treated in such a manner."
