## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As it was Peter‚Äôs spiritual discernment, given from above, which made him a foundation-stone of the Church, so is it his carnality, proceeding from want of unity with the divine will, which makes him an adversary now."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Get thee behind me, Satan‚Äîthe same words as He had addressed to the Tempter; for He felt in it a satanic lure, a whisper from hell, to move Him from His purpose to suffer. So He shook off the Serpent, then coiling around Him, and 'felt no harm.' How quickly has the 'rock' turned to a devil!"
2. "Thou art an offence‚Äîa stumbling-block. Unto me‚Äî'Thou playest the Tempter, casting a stumbling-block in My way to the Cross. Could it succeed, where wert thou? and how should the Serpent's head be bruised?'"
3. "for thou savourest not‚Äîthou thinkest not. The things that be of God, but those that be of men‚Äî'Thou art carried away by human views of the way of setting up Messiah's kingdom, quite contrary to those of God.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Turned [œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÜŒµŒπœÇ] . Not toward Peter, but away from him."
2. "Thou art not, as before, a noble block, lying in its right position as a massive foundation - stone. On the contrary, thou art like a stone quite out of its proper place, and lying right across the road in which I must go - lying as a stone of stumbling."
3. "Thy thoughts and intents are not of God, but of men."

### John Calvin:
1. "Get thee behind me, Satan...Christ therefore throws his disciple to a distance from him, because, in his inconsiderate zeal, he acted the part of Satan." 
2. "Thou art an offense to me; for thou relishest not those things which are of God, but those which are of men...Let us learn not to be too much attached to our own views, but submissively to embrace whatever the Lord approves." 
3. "If we do not, of our own accord, resolve to shut ourselves out from the way of salvation by deadly obstacles, let us not desire to be wise in any other manner than from the mouth of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Get thee behind me, ‚Äòavaunt,‚Äô ‚Äòbegone.‚Äô Comp. chap. Matthew 4:10, where the same words are addressed to Satan himself."
2. "Thou art a stumbling-block unto me, or ‚Äòstone of stumbling.‚Äô Perhaps a further allusion to Peter‚Äôs name."
3. "Thou mindest not the things of God, i.e., as represented by Christ, not regarding God‚Äôs purpose in the foretold death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "None are more formidable instruments of temptation than well-meaning friends, who care more for our comfort than for our character" (Bruce).
2. "In Peter the banished Satan had once more returned" (Plummer).
3. "Thou art not, as before, a noble block, lying in its right position as a massive foundation stone. On the contrary, thou art like a stone quite out of its proper place, and lying right across the road in which I must go--lying as a stone of stumbling" (Morison).

### John Gill:
1. "But he turned....and said unto Peter, get thee behind me, Satan."
2. "Thou art an offence unto me."
3. "For thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Get thee behind me ‚Äî Out of my sight. It is not improbable, Peter might step before him, to stop him."
2. "Thou art acting the very part of Satan, both by endeavouring to hinder the redemption of mankind, and by giving me the most deadly advice that can ever spring from the pit of hell."
3. "The proper answer to such an adviser is, Get thee behind me: That otherwise he will be an offence to us, an occasion of our stumbling, if not falling: That this advice always proceeds from the not relishing the things of God, but the things of men."
