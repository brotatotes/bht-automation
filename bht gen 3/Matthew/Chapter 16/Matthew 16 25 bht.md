# Matthew 16:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever seeks to save their life will ultimately lose it, but those who are willing to lose their life for the sake of Christ will find true life. This may be perplexing since a suffering and dying Messiah does not align with our desires, but those who follow Christ must be prepared for the worst. By prioritizing Christ over worldly desires and being ready to endure even death for His sake, we open ourselves up to the highest and truest form of life.

"Whoever is desirous of preserving himself from troubles, reproaches, persecutions, and death; and takes such a method to do it, as by forsaking Christ, denying his Gospel, and dropping his profession of it; and by so doing, curries favour with men, in order to procure to himself worldly emoluments, honour, peace, pleasure, and life, shall lose it."
2. "He will expose himself to the wrath of God, to everlasting punishment, the destruction of soul and body in hell, which is the second death, and will be his portion."

1. "Whosoever will save his life â€” At the expense of his conscience: whosoever, in the very highest instance, that of life itself, will not renounce himself, shall be lost eternally."

3. "And whosoever will lose his life shall find it - What he loses on earth he shall find in heaven."
