# Matthew 16:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus's affirmation that some would witness the establishment and progress of His kingdom refers to the transformative impact of His new kingdom on earth, symbolizing His future glory. He emphasizes the climaxes and consummations of the kingdom of God, already present in the hearts of people, and the taste of the heavenly life some would experience before their own deaths. The apocalyptic symbolism plays a lesser role in His teaching, as the focus is on the power and progress of His kingdom and the manifestation of heavenly glory through His resurrection and the sending of the Holy Spirit.
