As they provoked God with their deliberate desire to tempt Him, He chose to leave them, seeing them as hardened and unworthy. Yet, there remains hope that the voice of the Gospel will be heard even among their spiritual adultery and blinded understanding.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Pharisees and Sadducees demanded a sign, just like they did previously when Jesus healed a demon-possessed man (Matthew 12:39). This repetition highlights the continuous nature of their disbelief and their desire to test God. Jesus, deeply grieved by their unbelief, sighed in his spirit, lamenting their blindness. He recognized that they were an adulterous and wicked generation, constantly seeking signs but never satisfied. Ultimately, Jesus left them, as they were hardened, perverse, and unworthy of further interaction. The hope remains that, after his resurrection, the voice of his Gospel would be clearly heard, even amidst their spiritual adultery and blinded understanding.
