# Matthew 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During their voyage, the disciples realized they had forgotten to take bread, which they usually bought at suitable places. This oversight may have been due to their absorption in Jesus' conversation with the Pharisees and Sadducees or the suddenness of Jesus' departure. Nonetheless, this incident served as an opportunity for Jesus to teach his disciples an important lesson.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This crossing of the lake was not the voyage to Magadan mentioned in ch. xv. 39, for after the dialogue with the Pharisees, Mark adds (viii. 13), 'entering into the ship again he departed to the other side.'" 
2. "They forgot to take bread; viz. on their land journey further." 
3. "This is also to be understood in Mark (viii. 14), who states their having only one loaf in the ship, not to shew that they had forgotten to take bread before starting, but as a reason why they should have provided some on landing."

### John Calvin:
1. "To make the matter more clear, let us examine closely the words of Christ." 
2. "But as Christ opposed the evils which then prevailed, and as he aroused the minds of his followers to guard against those which were the most dangerous, let us learn from his example to make a prudent inquiry what are the abuses that may now do us injury."
3. "Whoever desires to become honestly a disciple of Christ, must be careful to keep his mind pure from those leavens; and if he has already imbibed them, he must labor to purify himself till none of their polluting effects remain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The visit to Bethsaida on the way (Mark 8:22), at a time when our Lord was avoiding public notice, may have been for the purpose of obtaining a supply."
2. "It is improbable that this conversation took place during the voyage."
3. "Provisions were not indispensable for so short a voyage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Came (ŒµŒªŒ∏ŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ). Probably= "went" as in Luke 15:20 (ŒπœÅŒµ, not œÇŒµŒΩŒπœÅŒµ). So in Mark 8:13 Œ±œÄŒ∑ŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ."
2. "Forgot (ŒµœÄŒµŒªŒ±Œ∏ŒøŒΩœÑŒø). Perhaps in the hurry to leave Galilee, probably in the same boat by which they came across from Decapolis."


### John Gill:
1. "As they were either in the ship, or going from the shore to the said place, they recollected themselves, that they had forgotten to take bread."
2. "It seems, it was usual with the disciples to buy food at places most proper, and carry with them; since Christ often went into deserts and mountainous places, where provisions could not be had."
3. "This their forgetfulness to act according to their wonted method, might arise either from their being intent upon Christ's conversation with the Pharisees, and Sadducees, or from the suddenness of Christ's departure."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 8:14.
