# Matthew 16:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples had evidently forgotten the weighty lesson and miracles Jesus had shown them before. Jesus, aware of their intellectual dulness, asked four pungent questions as a reproach. Their lack of faith was evident, as they were troubled about bread even after witnessing miraculous provisions. This forgetfulness and lack of gratitude for God's power resulted in Jesus reproving them sharply. It is clear that those who have experienced God's power and yet still distrust it are convicted of unbelief. Jesus reassured them, reminding them of his ability to supply their needs if necessary.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. Not only had they forgotten these miracles, but the weighty lesson given them in ch. xv. 16â€“20. The reproof is much fuller in Mark, where see note.

### John Calvin:
1. "This ignorance might perhaps have been endured; but they are forgetful of a favor which they lately received, and do not consider that Christ has the remedy his power to hinder them from being compelled to pollute themselves by meat and drink, and therefore he reproves them sharply, as they deserved."
2. "And certainly it was shameful ingratitude that, after having seen bread created out of nothing, and in such abundance as to satisfy many thousands of men, and after having seen this done twice, they are now anxious about bread, as if their Master did not always possess the same power."
3. "From these words we infer that all who have once or twice experienced the power of God, and distrust it for the future are convicted of unbelief; for it is faith that cherishes in our hearts the remembrance of the gifts of God, and faith must have been laid asleep, if we allow them to be forgotten."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This avoids the incorrect notion, that He took some time to discover it."
2. "O ye of little faith. Words applied to them before (chap. Matthew 8:26; Matthew 14:31) on occasions of great weakness."
3. "After such miracles their cares were unbelieving."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus asks four pungent questions about the intellectual dulness." 
2. "Repeats his warning (Matthew 16:11)." 
3. "Every teacher understands this strain upon the patience of this Teacher of teachers."

### John Gill:
1. "O ye of little faith."
2. "Why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?"
3. "Distressing your minds, as if you should be famished and starved."

### John Wesley:
1. Why reason ye â€” Why are you troubled about this? Am I not able, if need so require, to supply you by a word?
