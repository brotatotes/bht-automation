## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The time of the transfiguration was probably night, for the following reasons... All the circumstances connected with the glorification and accompanying appearances would thus be more prominently seen."
2. "It was most likely one of the mountains bordering the lake."
3. "High up on its southern slopes there must be many a point where the disciples could be taken 'apart by themselves.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He designed to prepare them in an eminent degree for the work of the gospel ministry by the previous manifestations of his glory, and of his patience in suffering."
2. "Our Saviour prayed much. When he did it he chose to be alone. For this purpose he often ascended mountains or went into the deserts."
3. "There is something in the solitude and deep and awful stillness of a lofty mountain favorable to devotion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Taketh with him."
2. "Apart by themselves."
3. "Apart alone."

### John Calvin:
1. "I have no doubt whatever that Christ intended to show that he was not dragged unwillingly to death, but that he came forward of his own accord, to offer to the Father the sacrifice of obedience." 
2. "We are thus taught that he was subjected to death, because he wished it to be so; that he was crucified, because he offered himself."
3. "Our Lord reckoned it enough to select three witnesses, because that is the number which the Law has laid down for proving any thing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "After six days, Luke: 'about an eight days,' i.e., 'about a week.'"
2. "Peter and James and John his brother. His companions in Gethsemane (chap. Matthew 26:35; Mark 14:37), Peter the leader, James the first to suffer martyrdom, and John the beloved disciple who lingered longest on earth."
3. "The transfiguration probably took place in the night. 1. Jesus had gone up into the mountain to pray (Luke 9:28), which He usually did at night (Luke 6:12; Luke 21:37; Luke 22:39; Matthew 14:23-24). 2. The Apostles were heavy with sleep. 3. They did not descend till the next day (Luke 9:37) 4. The transfiguration itself could be seen to better advantage at night than in daylight. On Mount Hermon snow would be visible, adding a natural splendor to the scene."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This could be on the sixth day, but as Luke (Luke 9:28) puts it 'about eight days' one naturally thinks of a week as the probable time, though it is not important."
2. "These three disciples form an inner group who have shown more understanding of Jesus. So at Gethsemane."
3. "'The Mount of Transfiguration does not concern geography' (Holtzmann)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ did not bear the offence in mind, but freely forgave him, and still loved him."
2. "Such a number was taken, as being proper and sufficient to bear witness of the truth of the following account of Christ's transfiguration."
3. "Now the eternal Son of God is shown, in the confession of Peter, and in the illustrious demonstration of the Messiah."
