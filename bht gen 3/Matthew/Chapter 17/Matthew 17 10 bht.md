## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If this was not the coming of Elias, was he yet to come? If it was, how was it so secret and so short?" (Commentary)
2. "Our Lord speaks here plainly in the future, and uses the very word of the prophecy Mal. iv. 6." (Commentary)
3. "The double allusion is only the assertion that the Elias (in spirit and power) who foreran our Lordâ€™s first coming, was a partial fulfillment of the great prophecy which announces the real Elias (the words of Malachi will hardly bear any other than a personal meaning), who is to forerun His greater and second coming." (Commentary)

### John Calvin:
1. "No sooner is the resurrection mentioned than the disciples imagine that the reign of Christ is commenced... for they explain this word to mean that the world would acknowledge him to be the Messiah." 
2. "Perhaps, too, they cunningly and wickedly endeavored to lessen the authority of Christ by bringing forward Elijah... It may not usually be conjectured that this expedient was purposely resorted to by the scribes, in order to represent Christ as unworthy of confidence."
3. "We see how the Rabbins corrupt the pure word of God by their inventions... it is probable that the people had also embraced this foolish notion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If this was not the coming of Elijah, was he yet to come? If it was, how was it so secret and so short?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They had just seen Elijah, but Jesus the Messiah had come before Elijah."
2. "The scribes used Malachi 4:5."
3. "Jesus had also spoken again of his death (resurrection)."

### John Gill:
1. "Why then say the Scribes, that Elias must first come? That is, come before the Messiah comes; for certain it is, that this was the sense of the Scribes, as it was of the ancient Jews, and is still the opinion of the modern ones."
2. "They argued, that if he was the Messiah, Elias would be come; but whereas he was not come, therefore he could not be the Messiah."
3. "Or else the sense is, whereas they had seen Elias, and he was gone again, without making any public appearance in the nation, their question is, how came the Scribes to say, that he should come first?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Why then say the scribes, that Elijah must come first â€” Before the Messiah? If no man is to know of his coming?" 
2. "Should we not rather tell every man, that he is come, and that we have seen him, witnessing to thee as the Messiah?"
