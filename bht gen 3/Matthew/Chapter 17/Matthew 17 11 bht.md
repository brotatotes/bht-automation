## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cometh. Elijah cometh first. An abstract statement expressing the fact that Elijah's coming precedes in time the coming of the Messiah."
2. "It is a point of Jewish chronology; just as a teacher of history might say to his pupils, 'The Saxons and Danes precede the Normans in England.'"
3. "Elijah had already come in the person of John the Baptist."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ now declares that every thing which Malachi uttered was true, but that his prediction had been misunderstood and distorted from its true meaning."
2. "This does not mean that John the Baptist restored them perfectly, but that he conveyed and handed them over to Christ, who would complete the work which he had begun."
3. "And that no one might be distressed by a proceeding so strange, our Lord mentions that the Scripture contained predictions of both events, that the Redeemer of the world, and Elijah his forerunner, would be rejected by false and wicked teachers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Elijah indeed cometh. Our Lord confirms the view that Elijah should come."
2. "Shall restore or 'establish anew,' all things."
3. "The actual work of restoration was however the work of the Messiah, for which Elijah should prepare the way."

### John Gill:
1. "Elias truly shall first come: this is indeed a tenet of the Scribes, and it is also certain, that there is a prophecy in Malachi 4:5 of the coming of Elias; of one that goes under that name, not of Elias the Tishbite, in person, but of one that was to come in his power and spirit, and restore all things."
2. "The truest sense of the phrase is to be learned out of Malachi 4:6. 'He shall restore, ◊î◊©◊ô◊ë, he shall turn all things, the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers'; and as this is explained in Luke 1:17 'he shall turn the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, and make ready a people prepared for the Lord.'"
3. "They often speak of his purifying q of things, or pronouncing things pure, that were defiled; and among others, that he will purify bastards, and ◊ô◊©◊ô◊ë◊ù, 'restore them' to the congregation of the Lord."

### John Wesley:
1. Regulate all things ‚Äî In order to the coming of Christ.
