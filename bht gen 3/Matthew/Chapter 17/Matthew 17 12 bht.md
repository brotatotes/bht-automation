Just as the people in Jesus' time failed to recognize the significance of John the Baptist, they also failed to recognize Jesus himself, which ultimately led to John's death and would later result in the persecution of Jesus. John fulfilled the prophecy of Malachi as the Elijah who was to come, but the people remained ignorant of his true identity. Jesus warns that he too will suffer at the hands of those who reject him, echoing the disbelief and mistreatment experienced by John.
