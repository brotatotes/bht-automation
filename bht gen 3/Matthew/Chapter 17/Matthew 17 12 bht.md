# Matthew 17:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist fulfilled the promise in Malachi, as Jesus identifies him with the prophesied Elijah, even though John denied being the actual Elijah. The people did not recognize John, just as they do not know Jesus. Like unbelief followed persecution, they acted according to their own desires, not knowing John's true identity. The prophecy of Malachi was fulfilled in John as the forerunner of the Messiah, but the people failed to recognize him and the coming of the Messiah.
