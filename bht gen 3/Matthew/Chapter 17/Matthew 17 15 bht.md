# Matthew 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The boy in this case was the only son and suffered from epilepsy, which affected his ability to speak. The referred term lunatic implies being demented, and epileptic accurately describes the disease and its connection to the changes of the moon. The combination of possession and epilepsy posed a unique challenge. The father's desperate plea for mercy and compassion is understandable, as it was his own child who was afflicted. The evil spirit likely exploited the influence of the moon during the seizures.
