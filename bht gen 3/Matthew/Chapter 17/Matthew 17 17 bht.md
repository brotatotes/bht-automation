## BHT:
The disciples, included in the perverse generation, are reproved for their twisted beliefs and lack of faith. Jesus questions how long He must endure their unbelief and perversity, reminding them that all things are possible for those who believe. Their failure to cure and their susceptibility to being led astray demonstrate their disbelief. While the reprimand extends to the rebellious nation, the disciples, in particular, need to learn to trust and have faith in Jesus before His physical presence is no longer available to strengthen their faith.
