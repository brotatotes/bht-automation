# Matthew 17:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because of your little faith, you may struggle with unbelief. The disciples' small faith was less than a grain of mustard seed, lacking miracle faith and the power to overcome obstacles. However, even the smallest genuine faith can accomplish great things. If you have increasing, expanding faith that grows from small beginnings, you can undertake the most difficult tasks. Remember that faith is not about power over material things, but about spiritual empowerment and the glorification of God.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Because of your little faith, you may struggle with unbelief or a lack of trust. The disciples' small faith was like a grain of mustard seed, yet it lacked the power to perform miracles or overcome difficult circumstances, represented by the mountain in their path. However, if you have even the smallest genuine faith, you can accomplish great things. Your faith should be growing and strengthening from its small beginnings, not decreasing. This promise of power is not about material possessions but about spiritual empowerment. With faith as small as a mustard seed, you will not only be able to perform miracles, but also anything else that brings glory to God, expands His kingdom, upholds truth, and benefits humanity. Do not be discouraged if you cannot remove mountains in a literal sense; this phrase is a metaphor for overcoming great obstacles that seem impossible.
