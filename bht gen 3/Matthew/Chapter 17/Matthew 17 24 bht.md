# Matthew 17:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The temple tax mentioned here was not a compulsory tax like the one collected by the government, but more akin to a voluntary church-rate. Jesus overturning the tables of the money-changers was a direct attack on a powerful interest, as they were responsible for exchanging currency for the temple coin. By paying the tribute, Jesus demonstrated both his submission and his willingness to fulfill earthly obligations. The fact that they approached Peter instead of Jesus may be seen as a hint that the tax was overdue.

2. "It does not quite appear whether this payment was compulsory or not; the question here asked would look as if it were voluntary, and therefore by some declined." 
3. "Many Commentators both ancient and modern, and among them no less names than Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Jerome, and Augustine, seem to have missed the meaning of this miracle, by interpreting the payment as a civil one, which it certainly was not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Every male Israelite of age... was expected to pay annually for the temple-service a half-shekel or didrachm, about thirty-five cents."
