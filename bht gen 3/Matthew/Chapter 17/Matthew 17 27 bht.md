## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "that, notwithstanding this immunity, we (graciously including the Apostle in the earthly payment, and omitting the distinction between them, which was not now to be told to any), that we may not offend them, will pay what is requiredâ€”and shall find it furnished by Godâ€™s special providence for us."
2. "In the foreknowledge and power which this miracle implies, the Lord recalls Peter to that great confession (ch. xvi. 16), which his hasty answer to the collectors shews him to have again in part forgotten."
3. "The stater = four drachmasâ€”the exact payment required for two persons."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Notwithstanding, lest we should offendâ€”stumble."
2. "Go thou to the seaâ€”Capernaum, it will be remembered, lay on the Sea of Galilee."
3. "That take, and give unto them for me and theeâ€”literally, 'instead of Me and thee'; perhaps because the payment was a redemption of the person paid for (Exodus 30:12) â€”in which view Jesus certainly was 'free.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The only mention in the New Testament of fishing with a hook." 
2. "The A. V. is very inadequate, because Christ names a definite sum, the stater, which is a literal transcription of the Greek word, and represents two didrachmas, or a shekel."

### John Calvin:
1. "Throw a hook...that he had a more extensive dominion than all earthly kings, since he had even fishes for his tributaries."
2. "And we do not read that this was done more than once, because one proof was enough for his whole life."
3. "A stater was of the same value as a shekel, namely, four drachms or two didrachma."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The time was not ripe for asserting this freedom; our Lord was still 'under the law' for us."
2. "Our Lord here exhibits miraculous power, in drawing by the force of His will this fish to that place at that time, as well as foreknowledge of the event."
3. "Our Lord's humility and glory both appear here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He does not wish to create the impression that he and the disciples despise the temple and its worship."
2. "Here we have a miracle of foreknowledge. Such instances have happened."
3. "It is not stated that Peter actually caught such a fish though that is the natural implication."

### John Gill:
1. "This is following the example of Christ, who therefore said to Peter, go thou to the sea; of Tiberias, which was near this city, and cast an hook; a fisher's hook into it: and take up the fish that first cometh up, and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money."
2. "This was a wonderful instance of the omniscience of Christ, who knew there was in such a fish, such a piece of money, as exactly answered the present exigence, and that that would come first to Peter's hook; and of his omnipotence, if not in forming this piece of money immediately in the fish's mouth, as is thought by some, yet in causing this fish to come to Peter's hook first, and as soon as cast in."
3. "But why did not Christ pay for the other disciples, as well as for himself and Peter? It may be replied, that this money would pay for no more than two: but this is not a full answer; Christ could have ordered more money in the same way he did this: it may then be further said, that only he and Peter were looked upon as inhabitants of this place; and so the rest were not called upon here, but in their respective cities, where they might pay also, and, besides, were not now present."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet that, we may not offend them â€” Even those unjust, unreasonable men, who claim what they have no manner of right to: do not contest it with them, but rather yield to their demand, than violate peace or love." 
2. "How illustrious a degree of knowledge and power did our Lord here discover! Knowledge, penetrating into this animal, though beneath the waters; and power, in directing this very fish to Peter's hook, though he himself was at a distance!" 
3. "How must this have encouraged both him and his brethren in a firm dependence on Divine Providence."
