### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In the midst of this astounding vision, Peter, awakened from his sleep, was undoubtedly moved by the weightiness of Jesus' recent announcement. In the excitement of the moment, Peter proposed that they make temporary shelters for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah, not fully comprehending the significance of what he was saying. Though his intentions may have been sincere, it is clear that Peter's words were not to be taken too seriously. He longed to bask in the glory of the mountaintop experience, and his proposal to create separate tabernacles for each figure highlights his desire to cling onto this extraordinary moment. However, it is important to remember that such an arrangement would undermine the unity and fulfillment of the law and the prophets in Christ. The scene presents a reminder that the disciples' understanding was still incomplete and that the fullness of God's plan was yet to be revealed.
