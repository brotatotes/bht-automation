## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The hear him, and disappearance of the two heavenly attendants, are symbolically connected,â€”as signifying that God, who had spoken in times past to the Fathers by the Prophets, henceforth would speak by His Son." 
2. "That the Apostles did not enter the cloud, is shewn by the voice being heard out of the cloud."
3. "They feared as they entered into the cloud."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A cloud was the symbol of the divine presence... When, therefore, the disciples saw this cloud, they were prepared to hear the word of the Lord."
2. "This was the voice of God... This was spoken to confirm the disciples; to make known to them that it was their duty to hear Christ rather than any other... and to strengthen their faith in him when they should go forth to preach the gospel after he was shamefully put to death."
3. "After this, it was impossible for them to doubt that he was truly the Son of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "This cloud ought to serve us as a bridle, that our curiosity may not indulge in undue wantonness."
2. "When he makes a cloud to pass between Him and us, and invites us to himself by His voice, what madness is it to attempt to place Him before our eyes by a block of wood or of stone?"
3. "Christ is as truly heard at the present day in the Law and in the Prophets as in his Gospel; so that in him dwells the authority of a Master, which he claims for himself alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A luminous cloud, not dark like that on Sinai. It was analogous to the pillar of cloud by day and fire by night in the wilderness and to the Shekinah of the Old Testament; a symbol of the glory resting on the New Testament Church, separating between the holy and the unholy, and a type of the splendor of the New Jerusalem."
2. "A bright cloud could render them invisible as readily as a dark one."
3. "Obey Him, as well as listen to Him. Hear Him, more than law or prophecy (Moses and Elijah). Their remaining carnal Messianic hopes were thus opposed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Overshadowed (ÎµÏ€ÎµÏƒÎºÎ¹Î±ÏƒÎµÎ½). They were up in cloud-land that swept round and over them."
2. "This is (Î¿Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï‚ ÎµÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½). At the baptism (Matthew 3:17) these words were addressed to Jesus. Here the voice out of the bright cloud speaks to them about Jesus."
3. "Hear ye him (Î±ÎºÎ¿Ï…ÎµÏ„Îµ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï…). Even when he speaks about his death. A sharp rebuke to Peter for his consolation to Jesus about his death."

### John Gill:
1. "This cloud, which is said to be a 'bright' one, was a symbol of the divine presence, and a token of the love, grace, and favour of God; and expressive of the brightness and clearness of the Gospel dispensation, in distinction from the obscurity of the legal one."
2. "He was his beloved Son, when he was made flesh and dwelt among men, while submitting to ordinances, as to baptism, and obeying his Father's will, when covered with reproach, and full of sorrows; when he hung upon the cross, and laid down his life for his people; which he showed, by concealing nothing from him; by putting all things into his hands, and by appointing him the head of the church, the Saviour of the body, and the judge of quick and dead."
3. "This divine testimony, first his sonship is bore witness to, and then his several offices; which his sonship is the foundation of, and qualifies him to bear and execute. So that these words, 'hear ye him', most clearly point to Christ, as being this prophet, who is to be heard, and he only."

### John Wesley:
1. Hear ye him â€” As superior even to Moses and the prophets. See Deuteronomy 18:17.
