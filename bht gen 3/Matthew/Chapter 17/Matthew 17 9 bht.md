# Matthew 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were told to keep the vision of Moses and Elijah on the mountain to themselves, not because it was a mere illusion, but because Jesus intended for it to serve as a confirmation of his glory after his resurrection. Their understanding of Jesus' upcoming death and resurrection was limited, so the vision provided them with a powerful testimony of his divinity. Until the Son of Man had risen from the dead, it was not yet time to reveal the full significance of the vision to others who might not comprehend or accept it.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
