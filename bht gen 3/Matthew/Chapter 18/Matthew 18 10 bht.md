# Matthew 18:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus reveals that the angels who stand high in honor before God are entrusted with the care of His humble and meek disciples, both children in age and in grace. Despising these little ones implies looking down on them with a sense of superiority. However, we must remember that God's highest angels are devoted to the least subjects of His kingdom, constantly in the presence of the Father, attending to their needs and ensuring their well-being.
