# Matthew 18:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son of Man came to save the lost, exemplified by these little ones, and the angels serve as messengers to them. The Father Himself, above the Son of Man, holds His good pleasure. It is unreasonable and contemptuous to despise those whom the Son of God esteemed highly, who He loved enough to endure suffering and death, in order to obtain righteousness and everlasting salvation for them. Therefore, we should not reject them but instead esteem them for the sake of Christ, who sought to save the lost.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The angels are the servante and messengers of the Son of Man; and they therefore (for&c.) are appointed to wait on these little ones whom He came to save; and who, in their utter helplessness, are especially examples of that which was lost."
2. "Here,' remarks Stier, 'is Jacobâ€™s ladder planted before our eyes: beneath are the little ones;â€”then their angels;â€”then the Son of Man in heaven, in whom alone man is exalted above the angels, Who, as the Great Angel of the Covenant, cometh from the Presence and Bosom of the Father."
3. "Above Him again (ver. 14) the Father Himself, and His good pleasure."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost."
2. "A golden saying, once and again repeated in different forms."
3. "Since the whole object and errand of the Son of man into the world is to save the lost, take heed lest, by causing offenses, ye lose the saved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That reason is, that the Son of man came to seek and save them."
2. "It was the great object of his life; and, though they may be obscure and little in the eye of the world, yet that cannot be an object of contempt which the Son of God sought by his toils and his death."
3. "So all people are 'lost.' They are wicked, miserable wanderers from God. They are lost to piety, to happiness, to heaven. These Jesus came to save by giving his own life a ransom, and shedding his own blood that they might be recovered and saved."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the Son of man cometh Christ now employs his own example in persuading his disciples to honor even weak and despised brethren."
2. "It is in the highest degree unreasonable that we should disdainfully reject those whom the Son of God has so highly esteemed."
3. "We ought to esteem them not for the value of their virtues, but for the sake of Christ; and he who will not conform himself to Christâ€™s example is too saucy and proud."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse is omitted in the most ancient manuscripts."
2. "It seemed apt at this point, both in view of what follows, and as a reason for the admonition in Matthew 18:10, presenting Christâ€™s conduct in contrast to this 'despising.'"
3. "He came to save those altogether lost, such contempt repels those who are apparently on the path of salvation."

### John Gill:
1. "For the Son of man is come to seek that which was lost." 
2. "Christ, who is here meant by the Son of man, came into this world to save these persons; who were lost in Adam, and had destroyed themselves by their transgressions."
3. "Christ had so much love for them, as to come into this world, and endure the sorrows, sufferings, and death itself for them, who were not only little, but lost; and that to obtain righteousness and life for them, and save them with an everlasting salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. Another, and yet a stronger reason for your not despising them is, that I myself came into the world to save them. Luke 19:10.
