# Matthew 18:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone has offended you personally, the remedy lies in exercising caution and brotherly love. The first step is to seek private explanation by going to the person who hurt you, rather than waiting for them to apologize. Show them their fault and if they acknowledge and make reparation, you have done them a greater service than obtaining justice for yourself. If this approach fails, involve two or three witnesses to confirm the validity of your complaint and your brotherly spirit. If all else fails, regard them as no longer a fellow Christian.

2. "Go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone - This was required under the law, Leviticus 19:17. In the original it is 'go and reprove him.' Seek an explanation of his conduct, and if he has done wrong, administer a friendly and brotherly reproof."
3. "Thou hast gained thy brother - To gain means, sometimes, to preserve or to save. Here it means thou hast preserved him, or restored him, to be a consistent Christian. Perhaps it may include the idea, also, thou hast reconciled him to thyself - thou hast gained him as a Christian brother."

1. "Go [œÖœÄŒ±Œ≥Œµ] . Do not wait for him to come to you."

3. "The Rev. shew is better than tell, which implies merely naming the fault; whereas the injunction is, go and prove to him how he has erred."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ enjoins his disciples to forgive one another, but to do so in such a manner as to endeavor to correct their faults." (552)
2. "Christ recommends to his disciples a mutual love, which is widely distant from flattery; only he enjoins them to season their admonitions with moderation, lest, by excessive severity and harshness, they discourage the weak." (552)
3. "Nothing, therefore, is more appropriate than meekness, which reconciles to God those who had departed from him." (Commentary on Luke)

1. "This is spoken not to the apostles as such, but as believers in Christ; and concerns everyone that stands in the relation of a brother, or church member to each other, and only such."

3. "If he shall hear thee; patiently, take your reproof kindly, acknowledge his offence, declare his hearty sorrow for it, and desire it might be overlooked, and reconciliation made; thou hast gained thy brother."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever closely observes this threefold rule, will seldom offend others, and never be offended himself."
2. "Christ does here as expressly command all Christians who see a brother do evil, to take this way, not another, and to take these steps, in this order."
3. "Let him be to thee as the heathen - To whom thou still owest earnest good will, and all the offices of humanity."
