# Matthew 18:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first attempt of brotherly love is to heal the wound, to remove the offense, in secrecy, covering the sin. Yet, if the transgressor refuses to mend their ways, it may be necessary to involve legal witnesses to establish the truth. In cases where individuals shamelessly evade or excuse their actions, this method proves useful. Believers are then instructed to treat the unrepentant as outsiders until they undergo a change of heart. This process promotes unity within the Church while seeking restoration and growth.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The first step in resolving a conflict is to privately address the issue and seek reconciliation, aiming to cover the offense and restore the relationship. However, if the offending party refuses to acknowledge their wrongdoing, it may become necessary to involve additional witnesses to confirm the situation. The purpose of these witnesses is to provide sufficient legal testimony, establishing the truth of the matter. This approach is useful when dealing with individuals who shamelessly evade or excuse their improper actions, as it reinforces the seriousness of the situation.

This process allows for the preservation of unity within the Church while seeking restoration and growth.
