# Matthew 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a fellow believer refuses to hear your concerns and disregards the admonishment of the church, they should no longer be seen as a brother or sister, but as one outside the Christian community, just as the Jews considered the Gentiles and Publicans. This judgment is not made by the entire church, but by the local body of believers who have the authority to address such matters. Its purpose is not excommunication, but rather the restoration of the one who has strayed.

The purpose of this step is not to excommunicate, but rather to seek the restoration of the brother or sister who has strayed.
