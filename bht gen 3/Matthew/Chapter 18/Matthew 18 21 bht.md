# Matthew 18:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's question about the limit of forgiveness reflected his ignorance of its true meaning and the need for endless forbearance. His assumption that forgiving three times was generous demonstrated a lack of understanding. However, Jesus emphasized that forgiveness should have no bounds. While exercising judgment was still necessary, forgiveness entailed treating the offender as though the offense had never occurred, burying and forgetting it. This duty of forgiveness implies a watchful eye on the offender's future behavior to ensure genuine repentance and change.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Peter had probably been an object of special envy, and his forwardness in continually answering for all the rest would likely be cast up to himâ€”and if so, probably by Judas." 
2. "He wished to know how often and how long he was to stand it." 
3. "Is there to be a limit at which the needful forbearance will be full?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The mention of the duty of seeing a brother when he had offended us, implying that it was a duty to forgive him..."
2. "To forgive is to treat as though the offence was not committed - to declare that we will not harbor malice or treat unkindly..."
3. "...but that the matter shall be buried and forgotten."

### John Calvin:
1. "He asks, therefore, if it be proper frequently to forgive offenders; for, since the number seven is taken for a large number, the force of the adverb, ( á¼‘Ï€Ï„á½±ÎºÎ¹Ï‚) seven times, is the same as if he had said, 'How long, Lord, dost thou wish that offenders be received into favor? for it is unreasonable, and by no means advantageous, that they should, in every case, find us willing to be reconciled.' But Christ is so far from yielding to this objection, that he expressly declares that there ought to be no limit to forgiving." 
2. "But here another question arises. As soon as a man by words makes profession of repentance, are we bound to believe him? Were this done, we must of necessity go willingly and knowingly into mistake; for where will be discretion, if any man may freely impose on us, even to the hundredth offense? I answer, first, the discourse relates here to daily faults, in which every man, even the best, needs forgiveness... We must add, secondly, that Christ does not deprive believers of the exercise of judgment, so as to yield a foolish readiness of belief to every slight expression."
3. "Thirdly, It must be observed that, when any man, through his light and unsteady behavior, has exposed himself to suspicion, we may grant pardon when he asks it, and yet may do so in such a manner as to watch over his conduct for the future, that our forbearance and meekness, which proceed from the Spirit of Christ, may not become the subject of his ridicule."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question was a moral fruit of the previous discourse."
2. "The Rabbins said, three times; Peter increased the number to the sacred one of seven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter thought that he was generous as the Jewish rule was three times." 
2. "His question goes back to verse Matthew 18:15."
3. "The man who asks such a question does not really know what forgiveness means."

### John Gill:
1. "He instances in a brother, because it was such an one Christ had been speaking of; he makes no doubt of its being his duty to forgive him upon his repentance, and acknowledgment, but wanted to be reformed, how often this was to be done."
2. "Which was, as he might think, a large number; and especially, since it was double the number of times, that the Jewish doctors set for forgiveness."
3. "For thus they say, 'A man that commits a sin, the 'first' time they pardon him; the 'second' time they pardon him; the 'third' time they pardon him: the 'fourth' time they do not pardon."
