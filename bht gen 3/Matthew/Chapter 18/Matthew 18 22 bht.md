# Matthew 18:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to embody a forgiveness that is infinite, continuous, and everlasting.

Whether interpreting seventy times seven as 490 or 77, the essence remains the same - forgiveness has no bounds. We are to practice forgiveness qualitatively, not quantitatively, extending it generously and without restriction. Let us embrace the transformative power of unlimited forgiveness as examples of Christ's boundless grace and mercy in our interactions with others.
