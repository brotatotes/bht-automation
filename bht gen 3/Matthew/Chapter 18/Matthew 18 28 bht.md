# Matthew 18:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Forgiveness does not require a change of heart in the sinner. Offenses against others pale in comparison to our sins against God. In the case of a master and servant, both are equal. The debtor owed a small amount, yet the merciless creditor demanded payment. This reminds us to forgive, as sins against humans are insignificant compared to sins against God.
