# Matthew 18:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without being humble like a child, one cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Just as a child is naturally humble, we must choose to be humble as well. Those who are focused on selfish ambition are heading in the wrong direction and need to turn around. If we do not have an attitude of humility and let go of our desire for status and power, we will not even enter the Kingdom, let alone have a prominent place in it.

- Attempt 5 BHT: Unless one is humble like a child, they will not be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven. The picture presented by this verse is that of a complete turnaround, a conversion from selfish ambition to childlike humility. It is not a matter of being the greatest in the Kingdom, but rather of entering it at all. In order to do so, one must abandon their preconceived notions of greatness and worldly success. They must learn to drop their contentions for power and status, and instead adopt an attitude of lowliness and dependence on God. This turning away from self-centeredness and towards God is essential for entering into the Kingdom of grace.
