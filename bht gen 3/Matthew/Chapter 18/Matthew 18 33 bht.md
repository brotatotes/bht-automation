# Matthew 18:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The king in this parable puts a cap on the wicked slave, just as the slave did to the poor debtor. The duty of forgiveness is obvious, yet so often it is imperfectly performed. It is only reasonable and expected that those who have received mercy should show mercy themselves. The slave had the perfect example of pity and compassion set before him, which not only served as an example but also created an obligation for him to act in the same way.
