# Matthew 18:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who falls from a state of grace falls into a state of condemnation, overwhelmed with the debt of enmity to God. The motive of the parable can only be fully understood in light of the great act of Atonement. The severity of the treatment reflects the severe punishment demanded by such a case. Imprisonment here is not purgatorial but punitive, for the debtor could never pay back the vast debt. The parable serves to enforce mutual forgiveness among people, as those who have received full and free pardon are expected to extend forgiveness to others.

2. "He who falls from a state of grace falls into a state of condemnation, and is overwhelmed with â€˜all that debt,â€™ not of this or that actual sin formerly remitted, but of a whole state of enmity to God."
3. "Meyer well remarks, that the motive held up in this parable could only have full light cast on it by the great act of Atonement which the Lord was about to accomplish."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentorsâ€”more than jailers; denoting the severity of the treatment which he thought such a case demanded."
2. "Till he should pay all that was due unto him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Delivered him to the tormentors - The word 'tormentors' here probably means keepers of the prisons."
2. "Torments were inflicted on criminals, not on debtors."
3. "It is not probable that anything of this kind is intended, but only that the servant was punished by imprisonment until the debt should be paid."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To the tormentors [Î²Î±ÏƒÎ±Î½Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î±Î¹Ï‚]."
2. "Livy pictures an old centurion complaining that he was taken by his creditor, not into servitude, but to a workhouse and torture, and showing his back scarred with fresh wounds."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Papists are very ridiculous in endeavoring to light the fire of purgatory by the word till."
2. "Christ here points out not temporal death, by which the judgment of God may be satisfied, but eternal death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To the tormentors. Not simply â€˜jailersâ€™ but those who (among the ancient Romans) sought by legal tortures to find out whether the debtor had any concealed hoard. It adds the thought of actual punishment."
2. "Till he should pay. This condition â€˜is the strongest possible way of expressing the eternal duration of his punishmentâ€™ (Trench). The debt incurred by sin cannot decrease, but increases even in a state of punishment; the original debt, according to the parable, is so great that no human being can discharge it."
3. "The passage opposes both the doctrine of purgatory and that of the final restoration of unbelievers."

3. "But this is not purgatorial, but punitive, for he could never pay back that vast debt."

### John Gill:
1. "And his Lord was wroth.... Very angry, greatly incensed, and justly provoked at such inhuman treatment."
2. "but it is not an offer of pardon, that Christ, by his blood, has procured, and is exalted to give, but that itself; and this man had his debt, his whole debt forgiven him."
3. "the scope of the parable is to be attended to; which is to enforce mutual forgiveness among men, from having received full and free pardon at the hands of God; and that without the former, there is little reason to expect the latter."

### John Wesley:
1. "Imprisonment is a much severer punishment in the eastern countries than in ours."
2. "And shall we still say, but when we are once freely and fully forgiven, our pardon can never be retracted?"
3. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, So likewise will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."
