# Matthew 18:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Causing one of these little believers to stumble is gravely serious, with Jesus stating that it would be better for the offender to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned in the sea. The punishment of drowning with a millstone was practiced in the sea of Galilee and was considered the most dreadful, reserved for the most heinous criminals. This vivid imagery underscores the gravity of mistreating humble Christians, particularly children, as it can lead to severe consequences and everlasting destruction.
