# Matthew 18:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus recognizes the inevitableness of stumbling-blocks, traps, hindrances, and the connection between guilt and judgment. He does not absolve the man who sets the trap, but rather acknowledges that offenses will be the cause of woe and suffering in the world. False disciples who cause Christ's followers to stumble and lay burdens on their conscience will be responsible and punished. No plague will be more destructive than the alarm or desertion of many on account of offenses, and it is an evil that cannot be avoided.
