## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Evangelist has that he should put his hands on them, and pray (see Gen. xlviii. 14: Acts vi. 6), where the other two have only â€˜that He should touch them.â€™" (Author)

### John Calvin:
1. "This narrative is highly useful; for it shows that Christ receives not only those who, moved by holy desire and faith, freely approach to him, but those who are not yet of age to know how much they need his grace."

"From this rebuke and prohibition of the disciples, it looks plainly as if it had never been the practice of the Jews, nor of John the Baptist, nor of Christ and his disciples, to baptize infants; for had this been then in use, they would scarcely have forbid and rebuked those that brought them."

### John Wesley:
1. "That he should lay his hands on them."
