## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The spirit in which he came [...] seems to have been that of excessive admiration for Jesus as a man of eminent virtue, and of desire to know from Him by what work of exceeding merit he might win eternal life."
2. "This spirit He reproves, by replying that there is but One Good, and that the walking by His grace in the way of holiness is the path to life."
3. "This passage furnishes one of the most instructive and palpable cases of the smoothing down of apparent discrepancies by correcting the Gospels out of one another and thus reducing them to conformity."

### John Calvin:
1. "He did not come treacherously, as the scribes were wont to do, but from a desire of instruction; and, accordingly, both by words and by kneeling, he testifies his reverence for Christ as a faithful teacher."
2. "But, on the other hand, a blind confidence in his works hindered him from profiting under Christ, to whom, in other respects, he wished to be submissive."
3. "He therefore dreams of merits, on account of which he may receive eternal life as a reward due; and therefore Christ appropriately sends him to the keeping of the law, which unquestionably is the way of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This young ruler, who ran and kneeled to Christ (Mark 10:17), was an honest, earnest seeker after truth and life."
2. "But he was in error, as honest and earnest seekers may be."
3. "Whether a Pharisee or not, he thought to earn eternal life. Hence the passage must not be wrested in favor of legalism."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  What good thing (Ï„ Î±Î³Î±Î¸Î¿Î½). Mark (Mark 10:17) has the adjective "good" with "Teacher."
May have (ÏƒÏ‡Ï‰). Ingressive aorist subjunctive, "may get," "may acquire." 


### John Gill:
1. "This man was no Sadducee, he believed a future state; was a serious man, thoughtful about another world, and concerned how he should enjoy everlasting life."
2. "But was entirely upon a legal bottom, and under a covenant of works; and speaks in the language and strain of the nation of Israel, who were seeking for righteousness and life by the works of the law."
3. "He expected eternal life by doing some good thing, or things; and hoped, as the sequel shows, that he had done every good thing necessary to the obtaining it."

### John Wesley:
1. And behold one came â€” Many of the poor had followed him from the beginning. One rich man came at last. Mark 10:17; Luke 18:18.
