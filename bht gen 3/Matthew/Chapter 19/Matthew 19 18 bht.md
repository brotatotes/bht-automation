## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord gives this enumeration of the commandments to bring out the self-righteous spirit of the young man."

2. "The law must have been dead to him, when he vainly imagined that he was so righteous; for if he had not flattered himself through hypocrisy, it was an excellent advice to him to learn humility, to contemplate his spots and blemishes in the mirror of the law."
3. "I confess that we are nowhere commanded in the law to sell all; but as the design of the law is, to bring men to self-denial, and as it expressly condemns covetousness, we see that Christ had no other object in view than to correct the false conviction of the young man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Which? That is, of what kind."
