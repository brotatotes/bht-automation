## BHT:
Entering the kingdom of heaven is not an easy task, especially for the rich. It is hard, with difficulty, for a rich man to surrender his trust and confidence in his worldly possessions. The allure of wealth breeds pride and presumption, making it challenging to shift focus towards eternal treasures. While there have been few exceptions, putting trust in riches becomes an obstacle, often leading to intoxication and preventing the rich from entering the kingdom of heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "It is true indeed, that riches do not, in their own nature, hinder us from following God; but, in consequence of the depravity of the human mind, it is scarcely possible for those who have a great abundance to avoid being intoxicated by them."
2. "The rich are so swelled with pride and presumption, that they cannot endure to be reduced to the straits through which God makes his people to pass."
3. "The comparison of the camel, which is soon after added, is intended to amplify the difficulty; for it means that the rich are so swelled with pride and presumption, that they cannot endure to be reduced to the straits through which God makes his people to pass."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A rich man shall enter hardly, i.e., 'with difficulty,' into the kingdom of heaven."

3. "Them that trust in riches."
