# Matthew 19:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were astonished to hear that it is difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God, as they were still focused on their temporal views of the kingdom. This should be a cause for concern, as riches can hinder our entrance into God's kingdom. However, despite their astonishment, the disciples did not shy away from the teachings of Christ. We ought to tremble at the warnings of God, not discouraged, but rather awakened to the seriousness of the matter. It is worth considering that if rich men, with all their advantages, struggle to enter the kingdom, how much more difficult must it be for those who are poor.

2. "While they were struck with astonishment, they did not shrink from the doctrines of Christ."

3. "they might reason with themselves, that if rich men did not come into the kingdom of the Messiah, they would oppose him and his kingdom, with all their force and strength; and then what would become of such poor men as themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who then can be saved? â€” If rich men, with all their advantages, cannot? Who?"
