2. "Certainly, if some reward had not been reserved for the disciples, it would have been foolish in them to have changed their course of life."
3. "If we ever experience such uneasiness at delay, and if we are tempted by impatience, let us learn first to reflect on the comforts by which the Lord soothes the bitterness of the cup in this world, and next elevate our minds to the hope of the heavenly life; for these two points embrace the answer of Christ."
