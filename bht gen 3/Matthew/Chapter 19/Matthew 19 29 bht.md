# Matthew 19:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who willingly lose all for the sake of Christ will be rewarded not only in the next world, but also in this one, as they will receive a hundredfold return in value, if not in kind.

By prioritizing Christ over worldly things, believers experience abundant compensation and the incomparable joy of being in God's presence.
