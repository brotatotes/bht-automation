# Matthew 19:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, with sinister intentions, approached Jesus to test him on the contentious topic of divorce. They sought to provoke him into contradicting Moses or aligning with one of the rival schools on divorce. However, Jesus skillfully navigated their trap by emphasizing the unity of male and female in creation and the indissolubility of marriage. In doing so, he opposed the lenient stance of the Hillel school, which permitted divorce for any reason, and upheld the sanctity of the marital bond.

3.
