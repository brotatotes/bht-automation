# Matthew 19:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The original divine constitution of marriage is the union of one man and one woman, forming a bond that transcends a unity of spirit and soul. This union is a binding power, wherein the husband leaves his parents to be glued to his wife, forming one flesh. This sacred unity should not be broken by causeless divorces, as husbands ought to rule as heads without being tyrants, while wives yield modestly. Honoring and preserving the divine institution of marriage is paramount.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The essential bond of marriage consists not in unity of spirit and soul, but without which it still exists in all its binding power." 
2. "The wedded pair are ONE FLESH, i.e. ONE MAN within the limits of their united life in the flesh, for this world."
3. "And herein alone lies the justification of a second marriage, which in no way breaks off the unity of love in spirit with the former partner, now deceased."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus here sends them back to the original constitution of man as one pair, a male and a female; to their marriage, as such, by divine appointment." 
2. "...to the purpose of God, expressed by the sacred historian, that in all time one man and one woman should by marriage become one flesh." 
3. "This being God's constitution, let not man break it up by causeless divorces."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Shall cleave [Œ∫ŒøŒªŒªŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑œÉŒµœÑŒ±Œπ] . Lit., shall be glued. 
Shall be one flesh [ŒµœÉŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ ŒµŒπœÇ œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫Œ± ŒºŒπŒ±ŒΩ] . Lit., "into one flesh;" Wyc., two in one flesh.


### John Calvin:
1. "But if any man abandon his father, and shake off the yoke by which he is bound, no man will own such a monster; much less will he be at liberty to dissolve a marriage."
2. "But Christ, as I stated a little ago, applies it in a different manner to his purpose; namely, to show that whoever divorces his wife tears himself in pieces, because such is the force of holy marriage, that the husband and wife become one man."
3. "Let the husband rule, so as to be the head, and not the tyrant, of his wife; and let the woman, on the other hand, yield modestly to his commands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God says, Christ says, that the relationship between a man and his wife is closer, higher, and stronger, than even that between children and parents." 
2. "Notice: it is the man who leaves his parents." 
3. "The essential bond is the fact that the twain, by marriage, ‚Äòbecame one flesh,‚Äô one man within the limits of their united life in the flesh, for this world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall cleave (Œ∫ŒøŒªŒªŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑œÉŒµœÑŒ±). First future passive, 'shall be glued to,' the verb means."
2. "The twain shall become one flesh (ŒµœÉŒøŒΩœÑŒ± Œø Œ¥œÖŒø ŒµŒπœÇ œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫Œ± ŒºŒπŒ±ŒΩ). This use of ŒµŒπœÇ after ŒµŒπŒº is an imitation of the Hebrew."
3. "The frequency of it is due to the Hebrew and here the LXX is a direct translation of the Hebrew idiom."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase denotes that close union between a man and his wife, which is not to be dissolved for every cause, it being stricter than that which is between parents and children; for the wife must be cleaved unto, and father and mother forsaken." 
2. "Not that upon this new relation between man and wife, the former relation between parents and children ceases; nor does this phrase denote an entire separation from them, so as to have the affection alienated from them, or to be disengaged from all duty and obedience to them, and care and regard for them, for the future."
3. "And denotes that near conjunction, and strict union, between a man and his wife, the wife being a part of himself, and both as one flesh, and one body, and therefore not to be parted on every slight occasion; and has a particular respect to the act of carnal copulation, which only ought to be between one man and one woman, lawfully married to each other."

### John Wesley:
1. And said ‚Äî By the mouth of Adam, who uttered the words. Genesis 2:24.

This bond is not merely a unity of spirit and soul, but a binding power that exists within their united life in the flesh.
