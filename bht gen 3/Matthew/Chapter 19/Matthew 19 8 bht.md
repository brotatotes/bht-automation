## BHT:
Jesus affirms that Moses permitted divorce because of the hardness and sinfulness of the people, acknowledging the temporary and civil nature of this dispensation. While Moses allowed a relaxation of the marriage bond, it was not an approval but a means to prevent greater evils. The original divine ordinance of marriage has never been abrogated or superseded but continues to hold its force. Jesus' teaching exceeds the partisan views of the disputants, embracing the higher realm of ideal, universal, and eternal truth.
