# Matthew 19:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus introduces a significant shift in understanding when it comes to divorce. He asserts that divorce is only acceptable in the case of fornication, an act that ruptures the marriage covenant. This aligns with his prior teachings in the Sermon on the Mount. By allowing divorce for fornication, Jesus acknowledges the possibility of remarriage for the innocent spouse, while excluding it for the guilty party. In doing so, he surpasses the traditional legalistic approach of Hillel and Shammai, elevating the significance of marriage to a higher standard.
