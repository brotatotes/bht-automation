2. "Ah! blessed Saviour, on what a checkered career hast Thou entered here below! At Thy birth there was no room for Thee in the inn; and now all Judea is too hot for Thee."

2. "This flight is a part of the foolishness of the cross, but it surpasses all the wisdom of the world. That he may appear at his own time as the Savior of Judea, he is compelled to flee from it, and is nourished by Egypt, from which nothing but what was destructive to the Church of God had ever proceeded. Who would not have regarded with amazement such an unexpected work of God?"
3. "Joseph needed to be thus strengthened, so as to conclude with certainty, that God would not only conduct him in the journey, but that, during his banishment, God would be his constant protector... [so] he enjoyed serenity of mind during his sojourn in Egypt."

1. "The Magi may have communicated their suspicions or revelation (Matthew 2:12) to Joseph, to whom as the head of the family the present revelation is made, in a dream, again."
2. "Egypt, â€˜as near, as a Roman province and independent of Herod, and much inhabited by Jews, was an easy and convenient refugeâ€™ (Alford). In Alexandria, its chief city, the Old Testament had been translated into Greek, and there the Jewish and Greek religions and systems of thought were brought into contact, resulting in the philosophy of Philo and his followers."
3. "Until I tell thee, or, say to thee (what thou shalt do) / Will seek, more exactly, â€˜is about to seek.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The child is also mentioned before the mother, not only because of his divine nature and office, in respect to which he was her God and Saviour; but because it was the preservation of the child that was chiefly regarded, and for which the providence of God was particularly concerned." 
2. "Hence it appears to be lawful to flee from danger, from tyrants and persecutors, when the providence of God opens a way for escape."
3. "For though he was born to die for the sins of his people, his time was not yet come; he was to grow up to years of maturity, he was to be a preacher of the Gospel, to do many miracles and at last to lay down his life of himself, voluntarily, and not to be taken away from him without his knowledge and will."
