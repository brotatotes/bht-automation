## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It seems to have been a received axiom of interpretation (which has, by its adoption in the N.T., received the sanction of the Holy Spirit Himself, and now stands for our guidance), that the subject of all allusions, the represented in all parables and dark sayings, was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent and reign."
2. "The words are written in Hosea of the children of Israel, and are rendered from the Hebrew."
3. "That it might be fulfilled must not be explained away: it never denotes the event or mere result, but always the purpose."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying‚Äî"
2. "Our Evangelist here quotes directly from the Hebrew, warily departing from the Septuagint."
3. "Viewing the words in this light, even if our Evangelist had not applied them to the recall from Egypt of God's own beloved, Only-begotten Son, the application would have been irresistibly made by all who have learnt to pierce beneath the surface to the deeper relations which Christ bears to His people, and both to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The best chronologers have supposed that he died somewhere between two and four years after the birth of Christ, but at what particular time cannot now be determined."
2. "Nor can it be ascertained at what age Jesus was taken into Egypt. It seems probable that he was supposed to be a year old (see Matthew 2:16), and of course the time that he remained in Egypt was not long."
3. "That it might be fulfilled ... This language is recorded in Hosea 11:1. It there evidently speaks of God‚Äôs calling His people out of Egypt, under Moses. See Exodus 4:22-23. It might be said to be fulfilled in his calling Jesus from Egypt because the words in Hosea aptly expressed this also."

### John Calvin:
1. "When Israel was yet a child, I brought him out of that wretched bondage in which he had been plunged. He was formerly like a dead man, and Egypt served him for a grave; but I drew him out of it as from the womb, and brought him into the light of life.‚Äù
2. "And justly does the Lord speak in this manner; for that deliverance was a sort of birth of the nation. Then were openly produced letters of adoption, when, by the promulgation of the law, they became 'the Lord‚Äôs portion,' 'a royal priesthood, and a holy nation;' when they were separated from the other nations, and when, in short, God 'set up his tabernacle' to dwell in the midst of them."
3. "The grace and power of God became more illustrious, and his wonderful purpose was more distinctly seen, when light came out of darkness, and life out of hell."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It seems to have been a settled axiom of interpretation...that the subject of all allusions...was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent or reign." 
2. "The place of Egypt in history should not be forgotten... God did not forsake the Gentile world, though it forsook Him."
3. "His providential care was as really present in the formation of that civilization which issued from Egypt, as in the occurrences which led Israel and Jesus thither."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Joseph was warned in a dream to take Mary and the child along." 
2. "In Egypt Joseph was to keep Mary and Jesus till the death of Herod the monster." 
3. "Matthew quotes Hosea 11:1 to show that this was in fulfilment of God's purpose to call his Son out of Egypt."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the natural and unconstrained sense of these words, which justifies the Evangelist in his citation and application of them to Christ's going to Egypt, and his return from thence."
2. "who will be obliged to retire there for some time; I will make him king, set him upon the throne, who shall execute justice, and reign for ever and ever"
3. "This is the natural and unconstrained sense of these words, which justifies the Evangelist in his citation and application of them to Christ's going to Egypt, and his return from thence"

### John Wesley:
1. "That it might be fulfilled ‚Äî That is, whereby was fulfilled."
2. "Which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet ‚Äî on another occasion."
3. "Christ being in a far higher sense the Son of God than Israel."
