# Matthew 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fulfillment of the prophecy spoken by Jeremiah should not be narrowly interpreted, but rather understood within the traditional Jewish approach to prophetic fulfillment. The closely connected tribes of Judah and Benjamin are relevant to the prophecy, and the words spoken by Jeremiah effectively convey the sorrowful nature of the event. The mention of Rama, a neighboring town to Bethlehem, adds further meaning to the prophecy. Rachel symbolically represents the grieving mothers, their lamentation, weeping, and mourning expressing their deep sorrow. Although not an exact correspondence, the fulfillment appropriately applies to this tragic event.
