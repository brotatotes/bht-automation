## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "O ye mothers of Bethlehem! methinks I hear you asking why your innocent babes should be the ram caught in the thicket, while Isaac escapes. I cannot tell you, but one thing I know, that ye shall, some of you, live to see a day when that Babe of Bethlehem shall be Himself the Ram, caught in another sort of thicket, in order that your babes may escape a worse doom than they now endure."
2. "And if these babes of yours be now in glory, through the dear might of that blessed Babe, will they not deem it their honor that the tyrant's rage was exhausted upon themselves instead of their infant Lord?"
3. "That Babe of Bethlehem shall be Himself the Ram, caught in another sort of thicket, in order that your babes may escape a worse doom than they now endure."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The language and the image also aptly and beautifully expressed the sorrows of the mothers in Bethlehem when Herod slew their infant children. Under the cruelty of the tyrant almost every family was a family of tears, and well might there be lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning."
2. "We may remark here that the sacred writers were cautious of speaking of the characters of wicked people. Here was one of the worst men in the world, committing one of the most awful crimes, and yet there is not a single mark of exclamation; there is not a single reference to any other part of his conduct; there is nothing that could lead to the knowledge that his character in other respects was not upright."
3. "This is the nature of religion. It does not speak evil of others except when necessary, nor then does it take pleasure in it."

3. "Both were a prelude of the salvation which was shortly to arrive."

3. "Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans alike revere the spot, which is much frequented by 'pilgrims.'" (Commentary on Matthew 2:18)
