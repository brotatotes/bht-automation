# Matthew 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Magi, through their study of astrology, were led by a bright star to Bethlehem in search of the newborn King of the Jews. Though not Jews themselves, they recognized the significance of this celestial sign, believing it to be connected to the awaited Messiah. Their journey to honor him reflects the expectation of the whole world, and their homage signifies the reverence due to the exalted rank of the newborn King. As we contemplate their earnest pursuit, we are challenged to overcome our indifference and actively seek Christ, bowing before him in homage.
