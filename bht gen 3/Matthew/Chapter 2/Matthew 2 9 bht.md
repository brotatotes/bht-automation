## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If it is to be understood as standing over the house, and thus indicating to the magi the position of the object of their search, the whole incident must be regarded as miraculous."
2. "In a matter like astronomy, where popular language is so universally broad, and the Scriptures so generally use popular language, it is surely not the letter, but the spirit of the narrative with which we are concerned."
3. "It is surely not the letter, but the spirit of the narrative with which we are concerned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yet God ordered this too, lest the news should be blabbed, and reach the tyrant's ears, before the Babe could be placed beyond his reach. Thus are the very errors and crimes and cold indifferences of men all overruled." 
2. "implying apparently that it had disappeared in the interval."
3. "Surely this could hardly be but by a luminous meteor, and not very high."

### John Calvin:
1. "It displayed wicked ingratitude that, for the sake of the salvation which had been offered to them, they were unwilling to undergo any risk, and cared less about the grace of God than about the frown of a tyrant."
2. "The whole nation, I have lately showed, was so degenerate, that they chose rather to be oppressed with the yoke of tyranny, than to submit to any inconvenience arising from a change."
3. "If God had not fortified the minds of the Magi by his Spirit, they might have been discouraged by this state of things. But the ardor of their zeal is unabated; they set out without a guide."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The theory of a miraculous star easily explains the statement of this verse, and if we were told that the star stood over the house, then no other explanation will suffice." 
2. "The astronomical theory thus explains the passage: The most remarkable conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn took place in May, and would be visible before sunrise ( i.e., in the east), five months afterwards, a sufficient time to perform the journey."
3. "Being near the zenith it would seem to go before them on their way."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Imperfect tense, kept on in front of them, not as a guide to the town since they now knew that, but to the place where the child was." 
2. "The stall where the cattle and donkeys stayed may have been beneath the inn in the side of the hill."
3. "Justin Martyr says that it was in a cave."

### John Gill:
1. "Lo, to their great surprise and joy, the star, which they saw in the east, then appeared."
2. "This star had a motion, kept pace with them, and was a guide unto them, till it and they came to the place where Christ was."
3. "The appearing of this star, and then its disappearing for a time, agree, in some measure, with the account the Jews give of the star which they expect will be seen at the coming of the Messiah."
