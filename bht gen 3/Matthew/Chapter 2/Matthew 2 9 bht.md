### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

"It looks as if it had been only seen at the time of Christ's birth, and when they were in their own country; for both here, and in Matthew 2:2 they are only said to have seen it 'in the east', that is, when they were in the east country; so that it seems from that time they had had no sight of it, not while they were on their journey, nor at Jerusalem; nor was it necessary they should."
 
2. "This star had a motion, kept pace with them, and was a guide unto them, till it and they came to the place where Christ was; and then it stood directly over the house, so that they had no need to inquire of any person for him."
3. "The appearing of this star, and then its disappearing for a time, agree, in some measure, with the account the Jews give of the star which they expect will be seen at the coming of the Messiah."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The wise men followed the star, which may have guided them to the specific location in Bethlehem where the young child was.

God orchestrated the appearance and disappearance of the star to ensure the safety of the child and to prevent Herod from discovering his whereabouts. It is speculated that the star was a luminous meteor, possibly a miraculous sign. The star not only guided the wise men to the town, but it also led them to the place where the child was.
