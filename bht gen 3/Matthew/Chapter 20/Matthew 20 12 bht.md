### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: These workers who have borne the burden and heat of the day, during a scorching east wind, express their discontent, believing it to be unjust that those who have worked shorter and easier hours be made equal to them. Their complaint seems well-founded, as they have endured a whole day's work under the intense heat and toiled heavily. However, this grudging attitude towards those who obtain salvation or glory in a short amount of time is a flawed perspective. In God's eyes, there is no difference or distinction between those who have labored long and endured hardships and those who have entered the fold later or with less tribulation.
