# Matthew 20:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These laborers, who have worked only for a short period in the cool of the evening, dare to complain that we, who have endured the burden and heat of the day, are equal to them. This protest arises from a perceived injustice, as we have toiled for a full day, facing the scorching sirocco wind and its detrimental effects on the crops. Such grievances stem from the mistaken belief that salvation is earned through works, failing to acknowledge that God purifies hearts through faith, granting equal happiness to those who are equally holy.
