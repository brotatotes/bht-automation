# Matthew 20:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus addresses the workers as Friend, it carries a deeper meaning than a simple friendly word. He uses the same term to refer to those lacking the wedding garment or when confronting Judas. By reminding the workers that they agreed to a specific payment, Jesus implies that it is not unjust to give others the same. Christians have the freedom to distribute their resources as they see fit, as long as they fulfill their obligations. Ultimately, it is God who decides and His ways are righteous.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "So, if Christians are just, and pay their lawful debts, and injure no one, the world has no right to complain if they give the rest of their property to the poor, or devote it to send the gospel to the pagan, or to release the prisoner or the captive."
3. "They are answerable, not to people, but to God, and infidels, and worldly people, and cold professors in the church have no right to interfere."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When Jesus says Friend to the workers who had labored the longest in Matthew 20:13, the term carries more weight than just a friendly word. It is a reminder of the solemnity of the situation, as it is used elsewhere in the Bible to address those who are lacking the required garment or even to confront Judas. Jesus is reminding the workers that they had agreed to work for a denarius, so it would not be unjust to give others the same payment. Christians, too, have the freedom to distribute their resources as they see fit, as long as they fulfill their obligations justly. Ultimately, God is the one who decides and He is righteous in His ways.
