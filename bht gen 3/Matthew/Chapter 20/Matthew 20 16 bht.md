## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The last were first, as equal to the first; first, in order of payment; first, as superior to the first (no others being brought into comparison), in that their reward was more in proportion to their work, and not married by a murmuring spirit."
2. "The first were last in these same respects."
3. "while multitudes are called into the vineyard, many, by murmuring and otherwise disgracing their calling, will nullify it, and so, although first by profession and standing, will not be of the number of the elect"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Take heed lest by indulging the spirit of these murmurers at the penny given to the last hired, ye miss your own penny, though first in the vineyard; while the consciousness of having come in so late may inspire these last with such a humble frame, and such admiration of the grace that has hired and rewarded them at all, as will put them into the foremost place in the end."
2. "Many receive the invitations of the Gospel whom God has never 'chosen to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.' But what, it may be asked, has this to do with the subject of our parable? Probably thisâ€”to teach us that men who have wrought in Christ's service all their days may, by the spirit which they manifest at the last, make it too evident that, as between God and their own souls, they never were chosen workmen at all."
3. "The 'calling' of which the New Testament almost invariably speaks is what divines call effectual calling, carrying with it a supernatural operation on the will to secure its consent. But that cannot be the meaning of it here; the 'called' being emphatically distinguished from the 'chosen.' It can only mean here the 'invited.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many that, in the order of time, are brought last into the kingdom, shall be first in the rewards." 
2. "Higher proportionate rewards shall be given to them than to others."
3. "He makes some more useful than others, without regard to the time which they serve, and he will reward them accordingly."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ only meant to say that every one who has been called before others ought to run with so much the greater alacrity, and, next, to exhort all men to be modest, not to give themselves the preference above others, but willingly to share with them a common prize." 
2. "But that they might not be carried away by ambition or vain confidence in themselves, it was necessary also to remind them that others, who would long afterwards be called, would be partakers of the same glory." 
3. "God is not limited to any person, but calls freely whomsoever He pleases, and bestows on those who are called whatever rewards He thinks fit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The parable, therefore, illustrates the truth that the order in the calling of individuals and nations will in many (not all) cases be reversed in their final position in heaven."
2. "An encouragement to those called late in life; a solemn warning to those called early, urging them to be humble, and ever mindful of their unworthiness before God, lest they be overtaken by others or forfeit their reward altogether."
3. "Many are called to be heirs of salvation, yet few chosen to be preeminent. Free grace within the Church is thus indicated."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The last first and the first last."
2. "After all one's work does not rest solely on the amount of time spent on it."
3. "In twenty-eight years [he] wrought more than many studious scholars in a hundred years."

### John Gill:
1. "So the last shall be first, and the first last...." 
2. "And even but a few of those that are outwardly called, are inwardly and effectually called by the powerful grace of God, out of darkness into marvellous light..."
3. "I have seen the children of the world to come, 'and they are few'."

### John Wesley:
1. "So the last shall be first, and the first last â€” Not only with regard to the Jews and Gentiles, but in a thousand other instances."
2. "For many are called â€” All who hear the Gospel; but few chosen - Only those who obey it."
3. "Only those who obey it."
