# Matthew 20:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The denarius, valued at around seventeen cents during Tiberius' time, was regarded as generous pay for a day's work. The word 'denarius' often conveys the idea of a liberal or large amount. The agreement between the laborers and the householder was based on the demand and promise. Though rewards are expected, the parable teaches that God's grace is freely given. The jealousy of the first laborers symbolizes the prejudice of the Jews against the Gentiles, who received more than they could ask for by working diligently without a fixed agreement.
