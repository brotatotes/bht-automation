# Matthew 20:21 Commentary Help Text

The disciples' request to sit on the right and left hand of Jesus in his kingdom was influenced by their understanding that these positions were places of honor and authority.

While their ignorance was evident, their request also displayed a seed of true faith. Nevertheless, their misguided ambition teaches us the importance of praying for continual direction and a fixed focus on the proper object.
