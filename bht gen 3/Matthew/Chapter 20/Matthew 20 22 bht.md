# Matthew 20:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, in their ignorance and self-confidence, made a selfish request to be exalted before being abased. They were blinded by their ambition, not understanding the nature of Christ's kingdom. They failed to realize the bitter cup of suffering that Jesus had to drink and the sea of sorrows and sufferings he would be plunged into. Instead of seeking worldly grandeur, the disciples were urged to consider the bitter cup and the baptism of suffering that Jesus had to undergo, as all who share in his kingdom must also share in his sufferings.
