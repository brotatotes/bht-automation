### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: As Jesus approached the two blind men between the towns, they cried out for mercy. Though Mark and Luke only mention one blind man, Bartimaeus, their narratives align so closely that it is reasonable to consider them to be different accounts of the same event. Perhaps the noise of the crowd prevented the blind man from being heard initially, prompting him to position himself in the way as Jesus departed from the city. In this way, the blind man's affliction became all the more remarkable, given that his condition was well-known. Jesus' departure from Jericho with his disciples was accompanied by a great multitude, some perhaps expecting him to establish his kingdom.
