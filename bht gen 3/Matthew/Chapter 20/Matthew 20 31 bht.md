The blind men cried out, Son of David, have mercy on us! The multitude attempted to silence them, perhaps fearing annoyance to Jesus.

However, we must learn from the blind men's example and persistently cry out to Jesus, the Son of David, for our faithfulness will lead to the cure we seek.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The blind men cried out, Son of David, have mercy on us! But the multitude tried to silence them, perhaps thinking they would annoy Jesus. Interestingly, the same cry of Son of David had been heard before from blind men in this Gospel. It seems that in this instance, the multitude silenced them out of weariness or annoyance, though they themselves would soon be raising the same cry as they entered Jerusalem. It's surprising that the disciples, who should have known better, would want to drive these wretched men away from Christ. It's a reminder that sometimes those who profess the name of Christ can hinder our approach to Him. But we must persevere in prayer, overcoming every obstacle and growing bolder and more resolute in our faith, just as these blind men did. We should cry out to Jesus, the Son of David, all the more, for our persistent faith will lead to the cure we seek.
