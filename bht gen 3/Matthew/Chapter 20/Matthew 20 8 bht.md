# Matthew 20:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As evening approached, the Lord of the vineyard instructed his steward to call the laborers and give them their hire, adhering to the Jewish custom of paying at the end of the day. The steward's order to pay the last hired first is a remarkable direction that points to the day of final account and the fulfillment of Jesus' words, the first shall be last, and last first. This parable highlights that eternal life is not earned, but rather a free gift from God through Christ.

3. "Beginning with the last that was called and sent into the vineyard, and so proceeding on to the next to them; giving them their wages as he went along, till he came to the first, who were early in the morning hired into this service; intimating, that some such method will be taken in the introducing of the saints into the kingdom of the Messiah here, and into his everlasting kingdom hereafter; whereby that saying of our Lord's which occasioned this parable, will be also fulfilled, 'the first shall be last, and last first'."
