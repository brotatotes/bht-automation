# Matthew 20:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When those who were hired at the eleventh hour came, they received a full day's wages, much more than they expected. There was no agreement on how much they should be paid, only that justice should be done. This shows that God does not measure His reward based on the length of a person's life, but rather on their fidelity and service. Just as these laborers all received the same payment, so too do all believers, whether early or late, have an equal title to eternal life.
