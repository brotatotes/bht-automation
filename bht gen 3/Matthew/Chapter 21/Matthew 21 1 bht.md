# Matthew 21:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus came to Bethphage, known as the 'house of unripe young figs', and later reached Bethany. He ascended the Mount of Olives, covered in olive trees, from where he would overlook Jerusalem. This deliberate action by Jesus was a significant moment, serving as a final call to the people of Jerusalem. Riding into the city on a borrowed donkey, with his disciples using their garments as a makeshift saddle, may have seemed meager. Nevertheless, even in this humble state, God honored his Son beyond the splendor of any adorned king.

3. "In order, therefore, that the mean aspect of Christ may not hinder us from perceiving in this exhibition, his spiritual kingdom, let us keep before our eyes the heavenly prediction, by which God conferred more honor on his Son under the revolting aspect of a beggar, than if he had been decorated with all the dazzling ornaments of kings."

2. "Both Mark and Luke speak of Christ's coming 'unto Bethphage and Bethany' as if Bethphage was reached first."
3. "Mount of Olives, the Mount of Olive trees, the mountain covered with olive trees."
