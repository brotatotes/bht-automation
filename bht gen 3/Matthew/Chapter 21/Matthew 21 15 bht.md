1. The circumstance that the children were crying â€˜Hosanna to the Son of Davidâ€™ in the temple, seems to me to fix this event, as above, on the of the triumphal entry.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is probable that, as the crying out was not diminished, and as even the children now joined in it, the scribes and priests were roused to still fiercer indignation, and then commenced a new attack on Christ."
2. "Now we know how eagerly they contended for their authority; for the object to which their zeal carried them was, that the tyranny, which they had once claimed, might continue to be enjoyed by them."
3. "But as the truth is wickedly suppressed by those who ought to have been its lawful witnesses, it is not wonderful if God raise up others, and â€” to their shame â€” make choice of children."
