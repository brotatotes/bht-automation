# Matthew 21:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The praise of children is a powerful reflection of God's providence, as the miraculous energy of His Spirit shines through their innocent voices. When Jesus quoted Psalm 8:2 in response to the Pharisees' criticism, he affirmed that God's power is not limited to the eloquence of learned scholars, but can be proclaimed even by infants. This rebuke left the Pharisees without a response, for they understood that they were being reproached for their narrow-mindedness and pretentiousness. Through the voices of children, God's strength is perfected in their weakness, and His praise becomes all the more glorious.
