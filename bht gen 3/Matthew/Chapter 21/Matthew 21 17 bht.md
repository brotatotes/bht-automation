# Matthew 21:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fig-tree symbolizes the Jewish people, who were full of hollow professions of faith but lacked true fruit. Some argue that although the narrative doesn't explicitly suggest a parabolic meaning, it may have originated from a parable Jesus spoke. Bethany, the home of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, offered solace to Jesus during this significant time. Leaving behind the disobedient city, Jesus sought refuge in a haven of obedience where his faithful disciples resided.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fig-tree was THE JEWISH PEOPLEâ€”full of the leaves of an useless profession, but without fruit:â€”and further, all hypocrites of every kind, in every age."
2. "It is true, as De Wette observes, that no trace of a parabolic meaning appears in the narrative (and yet strangely enough, he himself a few lines after, denying the truth of the miracle, accounts for the narrative by supposing it to have arisen out of a parable spoken by our Lord)."
3. "We must remember that this miracle was wholly typical and parabolical."

### Philip Schaff:
