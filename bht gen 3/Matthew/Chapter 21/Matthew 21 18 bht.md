## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "I take for granted that Christ did not pretend hunger, but was actually hungry..."
2. "Certainly it was not the fury of passion that led him to curse the tree... but as hunger was troublesome to him according to the feeling of the flesh, he determined to overcome it by an opposite affection; that is, by a desire to promote the glory of the Father..."
3. "He intended, however, to present in this tree an outward sign of the end which awaits hypocrites, and at the same time to expose the emptiness and folly of their ostentation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To give point to the incident, Matthew, unites the two morning walks from Bethany (on Monday and Tuesday)."
2. "An actual physical want; it may have been occasioned by His leaving Bethany very early in His zeal to purify the temple where He had seen the abuses as He looked about on the previous evening."
3. "Human want and Divine power are exhibited simultaneously...This hunger may symbolize His longings for some better fruit from His chosen people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
