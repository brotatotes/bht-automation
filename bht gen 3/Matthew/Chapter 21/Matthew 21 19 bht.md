## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was the practice to plant fig-trees by the road-side, because it was thought that the dust, by absorbing the exuding sap, was conducive to the production of the fruit."
2. "one fig tree, i.e. a solitary fig-tree."
3. "a solitary fig-tree."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Presently, in popular speech, has acquired something of a future force."
2. "The rendering here was correct in the older English sense of instantly."
3. "So constantly in Shakspeare: 'Presently? Ay, with a twink.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us learn from this what is the meaning of the word curse, namely, that the tree should be condemned to barrenness; as, on the other hand, God blesses, when by his voice he bestows fertility."
2. "It appears more clearly from Mark, that the fig-tree did not instantly wither, or, at least, that it was not observed by his disciples, until they saw it next day stripped of leaves."
3. "as Christ replies in the plural number, it may naturally be inferred that one put the question in the name of all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The solitary tree was a figure of Israel set by itself; the leaves represented the hypocritical pretensions to sanctity, the barrenness the lack of real holiness." 
2. "A miracle of punishment, both a parable and prophecy in action: a 'parable,' teaching that false professors will be judged; a 'prophecy' in its particular application to the Jews."
3. "The curse was for falsehood as well as barrenness. The true fruit of any people before the Incarnation would have been to own that they had no fruit, that without Christ they could do nothing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "On you no fruit shall ever grow again" (Weymouth).
2. "The double negative Î¿Ï… Î¼Î· with the aorist subjunctive (or future indicative) is the strongest kind of negative prediction."
3. "It was a vivid object lesson."

### John Gill:
1. "Though it was 'afar off', as Mark says, yet being hungry, he made up to it, expecting, from its promising appearance, to find fruit on it."
2. "This fig tree was 'in the way'; by the road side, and probably had no owner; was common to anybody, and so no injury was done to any person by losing it."
3. "This tree was an emblem of the Jews: Christ being hungry, and very desirous of the salvation of men, came first to them, from whom... much fruit of righteousness might have been expected; but, alas! he found nothing but mere words, empty boasts, an outward show of religion."
