# Matthew 21:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus instructed His disciples to go to a nearby village, likely Bethany, and acquire a young donkey and its mother for Him to ride on. Mark and Luke mention only the colt because it was the animal that Jesus actually rode. The presence of the mother would make the colt calmer and more willing to be ridden. This act of riding the donkey and the colt was significant of Christ's royal authority and was divinely directed by God. The donkey and the colt also symbolize the Jewish people and the Gentiles, respectively, bringing salvation to both groups.
