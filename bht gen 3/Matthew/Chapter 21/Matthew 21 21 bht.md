# Matthew 21:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True faith, demonstrated by Jesus alone, was the wellspring of His miraculous works. Although we may never achieve such unwavering faith, even a fraction of it possesses remarkable power in obtaining answers from God through prayer. Trust, confidence, and a firm belief in God's ability to perform beyond natural means are essential. The fig-tree, serving as a symbol, represents Israel's religious pretense without genuine godliness. Similarly, the mention of the mountain echoes the parable of the sycamine tree, emphasizing the importance of a resolute faith for accomplishing extraordinary acts in service to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That truest and highest faith, which implies a mind and will perfectly in unison with that of God, can, even in its least degree, have been in Him only who spoke these words." 
2. "And by it, and its elevating power over the functions and laws of inferior natures we may reverently believe that His most notable miracles were wrought."
3. "Though we cannot reach this faith in its fulness, yet every approach to it shall be endued with some of its wonderful powerâ€”in obtaining requests from God."

### John Calvin:
1. "But this benefit derived from Christ is that on which Paul chiefly dwells, when he says that by the faith of him we have boldnessto approach to God with confidence."
2. "This passage shows also that the true test of faith lies in prayer."
3. "Christ demands a firm and undoubting confidence of obtaining an answer; and whence does the human mind obtain that confidence but from the word of God?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such faith also could perhaps exist only in Christ Himself, but as it was approximated by the disciples their power would correspond."
2. "The latter reference suggests that they in their faith should bring about the destruction of the Jewish theocracy. Punitive power is spoken of; hence the faith required forbids arbitrariness and also an unforgiving spirit."
3. "This promise has a spiritual application to all believers, but gives no encouragement to fanatical attempts at working miracles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Doubt not, the opposite of 'faith,' trust, confidence."
2. "The cursing of the fig-tree has always been regarded as of symbolic import, the tree being in Christ's mind an emblem of the Jewish people, with a great show of religion and no fruit of real godliness."
3. "Certainly 'this mountain' is a parable and one already reported in Matthew 17:20 (cf. sycamine tree in Luke 17:6)."

### John Gill:
1. "Have faith in God, that he will enable you to perform whatsoever ye shall desire; which must be understood, not of spiritual faith in the promises of God, and person of Christ, but of the faith of miracles, or faith in the power of God to perform things that are above the strength of nature."
2. "There must be no hesitation in the mind, no reasoning upon the thing, how it can be performed; the mind must not be divided between the power and will of God, and the difficulties and discouragements which attend the case, but must believe in hope against hope, with a full persuasion of accomplishment."
3. "His sense is, that, had they faith, they should be able not only to do such lesser miracles, as, comparatively speaking, the withering of the fig tree was, but they should be able to perform things much more difficult and surprising, whenever the good of the souls of men, the propagation of the Gospel, and the glory of God required them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whence we may learn, that one great end of our Lord in this miracle was to confirm and increase their faith..."
2. "...another was, to warn them against unfruitfulness."
