## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 23. By what authority doest thou
	these things!â€”referring particularly to the expulsion of the
	buyers and sellers from the temple, 
	
and who gave thee this
	authority?


### John Calvin:
1. "They do not debate with him as to the doctrine itself, whether it was true or notâ€”for already had they often enough attacked him in vain on that questionâ€”but they raise a dispute as to his calling and commission."
2. "They act maliciously and wickedly in inquiring whence he came, as if they had been ignorant of all that he had done."
3. "What could be more unreasonable than that, after seeing the hand of God openly displayed in curing the lame and blind, they should doubt if he were a private individual who had rashly assumed this authority?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By what authority doest thou these things! Referring both to His teaching there, and to His cleansing of the temple on the previous day. They were the proper persons to challenge His authority."
2. "And who gave thee, etc. 'Even if you assume to be a prophet, who sent you?' A hint at the old charge of Satanic power."
3. "A hint at the old charge of Satanic power."

### John Gill:
1. "The principal members of it, if not the whole sanhedrim, came in a body together, if possible, by their presence and authority, to daunt Christ, discourage his ministry, bring it into contempt with the people, and stop his proceedings and success."
2. "They do not object to his doctrines, or dispute whether they were true or false; nor examine his miracles, whether they were of God, or of the devil: in these points they might fear he would be able to put them to silence and confusion, of which some of them had had an experience before; but they proceed in another way, in which they might hope for success, and attack him about his commission and authority under which he acted, whether he pretended to derive his authority from God, or from men."
3. "Should he say that God gave him the authority to do these things, they would charge him with enthusiasm and blasphemy, urging, that it was wickedness and presumption any man to pretend to be sent immediately from God; since the order of the priesthood, and of teaching was fixed, and none were to take upon them the office of a priest, or of a teacher of the people, but by their appointment."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who thought he violated their right: and the elders of the people."
2. "These, with the chief priests, seem purposely to have appeared in a considerable company, to give the more weight to what they said, and if need were, to bear a united testimony against him."
3. "By what authority dost thou these things â€” Publicly teach the people!"
