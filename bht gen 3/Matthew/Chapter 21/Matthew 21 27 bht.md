# Matthew 21:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reply of Neither tell I you from our Lord is a response not only to their words but also to their inward thoughts and disregard for the truth. This response displays the composure and wisdom of our Lord, who takes advantage of their surprise and silence to proceed with two parables. Their deliberate lie and opposition against their own conscience showcases their ignorance. Since they failed to provide a direct answer, our Lord sees no obligation to reveal his authority and the source from whence he had it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. The neither tell I you of our Lord is an answer, not to their outward words, ‚Äúwe cannot tell,‚Äù but to their inward thoughts, ‚Äúwe will not tell.‚Äù

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the truth itself they cared nothing whatever." 
2. "What composure and dignity of wisdom does our Lord here display."
3. "Taking advantage of the surprise, silence, and awe produced by this reply, our Lord followed it up immediately by the two following parables."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We know not. A falsehood; as Matthew 21:25-26, show."
2. "Christ answers their thought: we will not tell. This refusal is similar to that made when a sign from heaven was demanded (chap. Matthew 12:38 ff.)."
3. "The answer assumes their proven and confessed incompetency to decide on the authority of a prophet, and consequently His superiority to their questioning. Such a defeat increased their opposition."

### John Gill:
1. "They chose rather therefore to speak against their own consciences, and tell a wilful lie, and incur the reproach of ignorance."
2. "But now being reduced to this wretched condition, contrary to their office and character, declare they did not know, and could not tell from whence John had his commission, and who gave him his authority."
3. "Since, according to the proposal of Christ, and the agreement he entered into with them, they did not give him a direct answer to his question, he looked upon himself under no obligation to inform them, what was his authority, and from whence he had it."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither tell I you ‚Äî Not again, in express terms: he had often told them before, and they would not believe him.
