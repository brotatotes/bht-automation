# Matthew 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even the lowliest creatures can serve the Lord, regardless of decorum. The disciples sent to retrieve the animals were likely Peter and John and the term Lord refers to a Master or Ruler, not Christ's divine nature. The Christians boldly claim this word for Christ, as Jesus uses it to refer to Himself. The phrase The Lord hath need of them can be understood as both the master's need and Jesus, the Master's need. This reveals the Lord's omniscience and authority over all things.
