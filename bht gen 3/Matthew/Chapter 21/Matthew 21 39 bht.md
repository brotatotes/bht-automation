## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is partly to be understood of our Lord being given up to the heathen to be judged."
2. "but also literally, as related by all three Evangelists."
3. "In Mark the order is different, 'they killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 39. And they caught him, and cast
	him out of the vineyardâ€”compare :- ("without the gateâ€”without the camp");
	1 Kings 21:13; John 19:17.
	
and slew him.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Cast him forth out of the vineyard. This refers either to the excommunication which preceded death, or to the crucifixion outside the gates of Jerusalem; perhaps to both, the latter being a result of the former. Mark inverts the order."
2. "And slew him. Our Lord here recognizes the fixed purpose of the rulers to kill Him. Yet there is still love in the warning."

### John Gill:
1. "This regards their apprehending of Christ in the garden, by a band of soldiers and officers, sent by the chief priests and Pharisees, who with swords and staves took him, bound him, and led him away."
2. "but rather, to the delivery of him to those, that were without the vineyard of the Jewish church and nation, to the Gentiles; to be mocked, scourged, and put to death by them."
3. "for though the sentence of death was pronounced on him by Pilate, an Heathen governor, and was executed by the Roman soldiers; yet it was through the instigation and at the pressing importunity of these husbandmen, the Jewish rulers."
