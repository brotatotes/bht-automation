## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse is quoted with the same signification in Acts iv. 11: 1 Pet. ii. 6, 7, where also the cognate passage lsa. xxvii. 16 is quoted, as in Rom. ix. 33." (Quote 1)
2. "The builders answer to the husbandmen, and the addition is made in this changed similitude to shew them that though they might reject and kill the Son, yet He would be victorious in the end." (Quote 2)
3. "The corner-stone binds together both walls of the building; so Christ unites Jews and Gentiles in Himself. See the comparison beautifully followed into detail, Eph. ii. 20â€“22." (Quote 3)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did ye never read in the scriptures..." 
2. "The stone which the builders rejected, &c.â€”A bright Messianic prophecy..."
3. "He recurs to it in his first epistle..."

### John Calvin:
1. "The amount of it therefore is, that the kingdom of God will be founded on a stone, which the builders themselves will reject as unsuitable and useless; and the meaning is, that the Messiah, who is the foundation of the safety of the Church, will not be chosen by the ordinary suffrages of men, but that, when God shall miraculously raise him up by a secret and unknown power, the rulers, to whom has been committed the care of the building, will oppose and persecute him."
2. "How fiercely soever he may be assailed by those who appear to possess honor and dignity, he will nevertheless remain in his own rank, and will abate nothing on account of their wicked contempt. In short, the authority of God will prevail, that he may be the elect and precious stone, which supports the Church of God, his kingdom and temple."
3. "For nothing is more unreasonable than that the members should rise up against the head, the vine-dressers against the proprietor, the counselors against their king, and that the builders should reject the foundation of the building."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The builders rejected. The rulers of the Jews (â€˜the husbandmenâ€™), whose duty it was to build up the spiritual temple, now addressed in rebuke and warning."
2. "The head of the corner. The most important foundation stone, joining two walls. A reference to the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ (as in Ephesians 2:19-22) may be included, but the main thought is, that the Messiah, even if rejected by the â€˜builders,â€™ should become the corner-stone of the real temple of God."
3. "This head of the comer was from the Lord, etc. â€˜Thisâ€™ must grammatically refer either to â€˜headâ€™ or â€˜comer.â€™ Others understand it as â€˜this thing,â€™ this exaltation of the despised one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The stone which [the builders] rejected... A most telling quotation." 
2. "These experts in building God's temple had rejected the corner-stone chosen by God for his own house."
3. "But God has the last word and sets aside the building experts and puts his Son as the Head of the corner."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the sure, firm, and everlasting foundation, which God has laid in Zion, and the only one of any avail; nor can any other be laid to any purpose; and if he is neglected, and laid aside, in the ministration of the word, the building which men endeavour to rear, or exhort unto, will come to nothing."
2. "Whoever build on him are safe, and on nothing else."
3. "Christ is the foundation, on which the church, and every believer, are built, and therefore will abide; for the gates of hell cannot prevail against them."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is become the foundation of the Church, on which the whole building rests." 
2. "He is the principal corner stone, for uniting the Gentiles to it." 
3. "The chief corner stone of a house supports and links its two sides together."
