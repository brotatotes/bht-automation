## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Hosanna, meaning 'save now,' a formula originally of supplication, but conventionally of gratulation."
2. "May it be in heaven!"
3. "Luke has 'the king that cometh,' John 'the king of Israel that cometh.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hosanna in the highest - This may mean either 'Hosanna in the highest, loftiest strains,' or it may be for a prayer to God 'Save now, O thou that dwellest in the highest heaven, or among the highest angels.'"
2. "Perhaps the whole song of hosanna may be a prayer to the Supreme God, as well as a note of triumphant acclamation: 'Save now, O thou supremely great and glorious God; save by the Messiah that comes in thy name.'"
3. "The word 'peace' is used here as significant of joy, triumph, exultation at this event. There will be increased peace and rejoicing in heaven from the accession of the redeemed: there will be augmented glory - new songs of praise 'among the highest angels.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Hosanna. O save !


### John Calvin:
1. "For, though he speaks there of his own kingdom, yet there is no reason to doubt that he principally looks, and intends others to look, to the eternal succession, which the Lord had promised to him."
2. "And certainly, as it is the will of God to reign only in the person of his Son, when we say, May thy kingdom come, under this petition is conveyed the same thing which is expressed more clearly in the psalm."
3. "Now as it was mean and uneducated men by whom the kingdom of Christ was called the kingdom of David, let us hence learn that this doctrine was at that time well known, which in the present day appears to many to be forced and harsh, because they are not well acquainted with Scripture."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Gradually the long procession swept up over the ridge where first begins 'the descent of the Mount of Olives' toward Jerusalem... It was at this precise point that the shout of triumph burst forth from the multitude"
2. "Hosanna. The Greek form of a Hebrew word found in Psalms 118:25, meaning: 'Save now,' or 'give thy salvation.'"
3. "Hosanna in the highest, i.e., May our Hosanna be ratified in heaven... The crowd with enthusiasm thus nail Him as the Messiah, probably cherishing political hopes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hosanna to the Son of David (HÎ¿ÏƒÎ±Î½Î½Î± Ï„Ï‰ Ï…Î¹Ï‰ Î”Î±Ï…ÎµÎ¹Î´). They were now proclaiming Jesus as the Messiah and he let them do it."

3. ""Hosanna in the highest" (heaven) as well as here on earth."

### John Gill:
1. "By calling Jesus the Son of David, they owned and proclaimed him to be the Messiah; this being the usual title by which the Messiah was known among the Jews."
2. "The true sense and meaning of it here appears to be this; that the multitude that attended Christ to Jerusalem, as they went along, sung songs of praise to him, as the true Messiah."
3. "Let not only all salvation, happiness, and prosperity attend the Messiah, David's son, here on earth, but all glory and felicity in the highest heavens, above which he will be exalted."

### John Wesley:
1. "The multitudes cried, saying â€” Probably from a Divine impulse; for certainly most of them understood not the words they uttered."
2. "Hosanna â€” (Lord save us) was a solemn word in frequent use among the Jews. The meaning is, 'We sing hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is he, the Messiah, of the Lord. Save. Thou that art in the highest heavens.'"
3. "Our Lord restrained all public tokens of honour from the people till now, lest the envy of his enemies should interrupt his preaching before the time."
