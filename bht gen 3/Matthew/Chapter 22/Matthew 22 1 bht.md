## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "He made a still further statement, to show how the gospel would be received and treated by them."
2. "The real answer here, as is frequently the case in the New Testament, refers to what was passing in the mind, or to the conduct of those who were addressed, not to what they said."
3. "He answered or made reply to the Pharisees, who had been enraged at him for what he had already spoken to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "But we must attend to Lukeâ€™s narrative, who says that, when one of those who sat at table with him said, Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdom of God, Christ took occasion from it to upbraid the Jews with ingratitude."
2. "Still, I do not look upon it as having been spoken in derision; but, as persons who have a moderate knowledge of the faith, and are not openly wicked, are in the habit of indulging, amidst their cups, in idle talk about eternal life, I think that this man threw out a remark about future blessedness, in order to draw out some observation in return from Christ."
3. "And his words make it manifest, that he had nothing in view beyond what was gross and earthly; for he did not employ the phrase, eat bread, as a metaphor for enjoy eternal life, but appears to have dreamed of I know not what state, filled with prosperity and abundance of all things."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 22:1. Answered. See above.
	
 Again in parables; not necessarily, in a number of parables, but in parabolic discourse.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Some regard it as not spoken by Jesus at all, but an effort on the part of the writer to cover the sin and fate of the Jews, the calling of the Gentiles, and God's demand for righteousness."
2. "But that is a gratuitous indictment of Matthew's report which definitely locates the parable here by Ï€Î±Î»Î¹Î½."
3. "But here again it is like Jesus and suits the present occasion."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus answered and spake unto them again...Not to the multitude only, but to the chief priests, elders, Scribes, and Pharisees." 
2. "They might not leave him until they had heard that, which is spoken with much the same design as the former, and might increase their resentment the more."
3. "He spake by parables, similitudes, and comparisons, taken from earthly things, and against whom he directed the following one."
