# Matthew 22:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the final and separating judgment of the Church, the coming of the King is a solemn expression of the omniscient inspection of every professed disciple. Every trying and sifting judgment adumbrates this future proclamation of true character. The guests of the King must wear the wedding garment, signifying the righteousness given by God in Christ. Refusing this garment shows contempt for the gospel's provision and leads to expulsion and punishment. This call to wear the dress that befits the heavenly palace is a condition for remaining permanently in the house of the Lord.

### John Calvin:
1. "But now he threatens that, out of this very number, those who bring reproach upon the Church will be expelled; for God invites all indiscriminately by the Gospel, and thus many unholy and abominable persons creep in, who, though for a time they are admitted along with others, yet, when God reviews the guests, will be thrown out and dragged to punishment."

3. "This man had not on this garment, this robe of righteousness; it was not imputed to him; he had no knowledge of it; or if he had any, it was only a speculative one; he had no true faith in it; he had never put on Christ, as the Lord his righteousness."
