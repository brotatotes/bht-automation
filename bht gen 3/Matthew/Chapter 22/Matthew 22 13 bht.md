# Matthew 22:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servants mentioned here are not the same as those mentioned before; they are angels. Rather than being a representation of his state at present, the binding of the feet and hands may signify that escape from the outer darkness is impossible. The outer darkness is a dreadful place, where the unworthy are not only excluded from the joy and delight of the heavenly kingdom, but are also subjected to the horrors of darkness. The punishment awaiting them is marked by weeping and gnashing of teeth.

2. "To be 'outside' at all‚Äîor, in the language of Matthew 25:30‚Äîto be 'without' the heavenly city, excluded from its joyous nuptials and gladsome festivities‚Äîis sad enough of itself, without anything else." 
3. "But to find themselves not only excluded from the brightness and glory and joy and felicity of the kingdom above, but thrust into a region of 'darkness,' with all its horrors, this is the dismal retribution here announced, that awaits the unworthy at the great day."
