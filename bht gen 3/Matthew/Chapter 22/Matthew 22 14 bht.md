# Matthew 22:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus teaches that many are called, but few are chosen. This distinction highlights that not all who are invited will be among the chosen few. It is not sufficient to merely belong to a church or profess faith externally; genuine faith is required to be chosen by God. Each person should examine themselves to ensure they are genuinely part of God's chosen people, rather than relying on empty titles of faith.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse reminds us that while many are called, only a few are chosen. There is a distinction between those who are called and those who are chosen. It is not enough to simply have an external profession of faith; one must truly believe and show themselves to be a real Christian. This distinction between the called and the chosen is made clear, as not everyone who is invited will pass through the two stages of sifting and prove to be the chosen ones of God. Therefore, it is important for each individual to examine themselves and ensure that they are truly one of the chosen guests, rather than relying on an empty title of faith.
