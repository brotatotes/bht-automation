# Matthew 22:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, Jesus teaches us that within the visible Church, there are those who have been called but do not possess true faith. They are like guests who lack the wedding garment. This reminds us that although many are called to follow Christ, only a few are chosen by God. It is important for us to examine ourselves and not rely on our outward profession of faith, as it does not guarantee our place among God's chosen people.
