### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "The allusion is to a practice customary among men, that those who intended to make a marriage drew up a list of the persons whom they intended to have as guests, and afterwards sent invitations to them by their servants. In like manner, God elected the Jews in preference to others, as if they had been his familiar friends, and afterwards called them by the prophets to partake of the promised redemption, which was, as it were, to feast at a marriage."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was Christâ€™s marriage, i.e., with His covenant people, according to the imagery of the Old Testament."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The plural, as here (Matthew 22:2; Matthew 22:3; Matthew 22:4; Matthew 22:9), is very common in the papyri for the wedding festivities (the several acts of feasting) which lasted for days, seven in Judges 14:17."
2. "The very phrase here, Î³Î±Î¼Î¿Ï…Ï‚ Ï€Î¿Î¹ÎµÎ¹Î½, occurs in the Doric of Thera about B.C. 200."
3. "The singular Î³Î±Î¼Î¿Ï‚ is common in the papyri for the wedding contract, but Field (Notes, p. 16) sees no difference between the singular here in Matthew 22:8 and the plural (see also Genesis 29:22; Esther 9:22; Macc. 10:58)."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of which is to express the great love of God the Father, who is represented by this certain king, in espousing any of the children of men to his own son."
