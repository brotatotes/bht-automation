# Matthew 22:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The coin shown to Christ was likely a Roman coin with the image and name of Tiberius Caesar on it. The Rabbis had a saying that wherever any king's money is accepted, that king is considered lord. The Jews had a strong dislike for coins with images, and earlier Herods avoided putting their own image on them. However, Tetrarch Philip introduced the image of Caesar on strictly Jewish coins, and Herod Agrippa I followed suit. Therefore, the coin shown to Christ was most likely stamped in Rome with the image and name of Tiberius Caesar on it.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse in Matthew 22:20 refers to a coin that was shown to Christ, which had the image and superscription of Tiberius Caesar on it. This was a significant detail because it was a saying among the Rabbis that wherever a king's money is accepted, that king is considered lord. The Romans were known to have their images on coins, but the Jews had a strong dislike for this practice, so the earlier Herods did not include their own images on coins. However, Tetrarch Philip and later Herod Agrippa I introduced the image of Caesar on Jewish coins. Therefore, the coin shown to Christ was most likely struck in Rome and had the image of Tiberius Caesar on it.
