# Matthew 22:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Sadducees, who deny the resurrection and immortality of the soul, mockingly question Jesus to ridicule both the doctrine and Christ Himself. Their hatred of the Gospel causes them to align with those who seek its destruction. Yet, their denial of God's promises and the eternal consequences for the wicked reveals their narrow-mindedness. Not only do they oppose the resurrection, but they also reject the existence of angels, spirits, and the immortality of the soul. Their absurdity is evident in their limited view of truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "And so fierce is the hatred with which the Papists burn against the Gospel, that they willingly support Epicureans, Libertines, and other monsters of that description, provided that they can avail themselves of their aid for accomplishing its destruction."
2. "How the sect of the Sadducees originated we have explained under another passage. Luke assures us that they denied not only the final resurrection of the body, but also the immortality of the soul."
3. "But as the reward of the godly, and likewise the punishment due to the wicked, were limited by them to the present life, even though there had been truth in their assertion, that every man is now treated impartially according to his merit, yet it was excessively absurd to restrict the promises of God within such narrow limits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is no resurrection." 
2. "A scoffing question, in ridicule of the doctrine and of Christ Himself."
3. "Errorists often think that opposition to their opponents is agreement with them."

### John Gill:
1. "The Sadducees were a distinct sect, both from the Pharisees and the Herodians."
2. "They denied that there were angels and spirits, and the immortality of the soul; they affirmed, that the soul died with the body, and that there was no future state."
3. "They were desirous of entering into a controversy with him about it."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 12:18.
