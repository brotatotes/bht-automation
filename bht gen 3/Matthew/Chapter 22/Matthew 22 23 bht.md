# Matthew 22:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Sadducees, who formed a distinct sect, denied angels, spirits, and the immortality of the soul, as well as the resurrection. They sought to ridicule Christ's teaching by scoffing at the idea of resurrection. However, their opposition only highlighted their own foolishness and contempt for the truth. Through this, the Lord justly punished their divisive actions and contemptuous rejection of His doctrine, while also demonstrating the absurdity of their belief that humans, created in the image of God, would be extinguished in death like animals.
