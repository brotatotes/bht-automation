## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These δοῦλοι are not the Prophets, not the same as the servants in ch. Matthew 21:34, as generally interpreted: the parable takes up its ground nearly from the conclusion of that former, and is altogether a New Testament parable."
2. "The office of these δοῦλοι ('κλήτορες, δειπνοκλήτορες, vocatores, invitatores,' Webst. and Wilk.) was καλέσαι τοὺς κεκλημένους, to summon those who had been invited, as was customary."
3. "These first δοῦλοι are then the first messengers of the Gospel, John the Baptist, the Twelve, and the Seventy, who preached, saying ‘The Kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ And even our Lord Himself must in some sort be here included, inasmuch as He μορφὴν δοὺλου ἔλαβεν, and preached this same truth, with however the weighty addition of δεῦτε πρός με."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "representing all preachers of the Gospel."
2. "the Jews, who were 'bidden,' from the first choice of them onwards through every summons addressed to them by the prophets to hold themselves in readiness for the appearing of their King."
3. "the issue of the whole ministry of the Baptist, our Lord Himself, and His apostles thereafter, too sadly showed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The messengers that God has sent to invite people to his kingdom."
2. "All the difficulty that sinners ever labor under in regard to salvation is in the will."
3. "It is a fixed determination not to come and be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To call them that were bidden [καλεσαι τους κεκλημενους]. Perhaps an unconscious play on the words, lost in both A. V. and Rev., to call the called." 
2. "This was according to the Oriental custom of sending a messenger, after the invitations have been issued, to notify the invited guests that the entertainment is prepared."
3. "Thus Esther invites Haman to a banquet on the morrow, and, at the actual time, the chamberlain comes to bring him to the feast (Esther 5:8; Esther 6:14)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In this prophetic parable, not the prophets but the first messengers of the gospel."
2. "Those ‘bidden’ were the Jews. The second invitation was a summons to expected guests, rather than an invitation."
3. "The first servants, whose message was rejected, were John the Baptist, Christ, and His disciples up to this time."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To call them that were bidden... to call the called." 
2. "It was a Jewish custom to invite a second time the already invited... The prophets of old had given God's invitation to the Jewish people. Now the Baptist and Jesus had given the second invitation that the feast was ready." 
3. "This negative imperfect characterizes the stubborn refusal of the Jewish leaders to accept Jesus as God's Son... This is 'The Hebrew Tragedy'."

### John Gill:
1. "They were called by the name of God, and called the people of God, and the children of God, and were the children of the kingdom; and were called to many valuable and external privileges."
2. "It shows the insolence and ingratitude of men, their natural aversion to the Gospel, and the ordinances of it; the depravity of the will of man, with respect to things spiritual and evangelical."
3. "But besides this, there is a bare external call to the sons of men, through the preaching of the word; which is not to make their peace with God, a thing impossible to be done by them, and which is contrary to the Gospel, and reflects dishonour on Christ, the peacemaker."

### John Wesley:
1. Them that were invited — Namely, the Jews.
