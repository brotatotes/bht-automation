## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord here testifies of the conscious intent of God in speaking the words. God uttered them, He tells us, to Moses, in the consciousness of the still enduring existence of His peculiar relation to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
2. "The words 'I am thy God' imply a covenant; there is another side to them: 'thou art Mine' follows upon 'I am thine.' When God therefore declares that He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, He declares their continuance, as the other parties in this covenant."
3. "Thus the burden of the Law, 'I AM THE LORD THY GOD,' contains in it the seed of immortality, and the hope of the resurrection."

### John Gill:
1. "Hence, in opposition to this notion of the Sadducees, the other Jews say, 'Though a man confesses and believes that the dead will be raised, yet that it is not intimated in the law, he is a heretic; since it is a fundamental point, that the resurrection of the dead is of the law.'"  
2. "Says R. Simai, from whence is the resurrection of the dead to be proved out of the law? From Exodus 6:4 as it is said, 'I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan: to you' it is not said, but 'to them'; from hence then, the resurrection of the dead may be proved out of the law."
3. "Thus our Lord having to do with the same sort of persons, fetches his proof of the doctrine of the resurrection out of the law, and from a passage which respects the covenant relation God stands in to his people, particularly Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and which respects not their souls only, but their bodies also, even their whole persons, body and soul."

### John Wesley:
1. "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." 
2. "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not dead, but living." 
3. "Therefore, the soul does not die with the body."
