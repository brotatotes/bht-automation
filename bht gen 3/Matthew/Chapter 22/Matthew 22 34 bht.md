## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Put to silence [ÎµÏ†Î¹Î¼Ï‰ÏƒÎµÎ½] . There is a kind of grim humor in the use of this word : he had muzzled the Sadducees. Compare ver. 12.


### John Calvin:
1. "They all agree in this, that the scribe put a question for the sake of tempting Christ; but he who is described by Matthew and Mark goes away with no bad disposition; for he acquiesces in Christâ€™s reply, and shows a sign of a teachable and gentle mind: to which must be added, that Christ, on the other hand, declares that he is not far from the kingdom of God."
2. "Let us now see what was the occasion that led this scribe to put a question to Christ. It is because, being an expounder of the Law, he is offended at the doctrine of the gospel, by which he supposes the authority of Moses to be diminished. At the same time, he is not so much influenced by zeal for the Law, as by displeasure at losing some part of the honor of his teaching."
3. "In the form of the question, too, Luke differs somewhat from Matthew and Mark; for, according to him, the scribe inquires what men must do to obtain eternal life, but according to the other two Evangelists, he inquires what is the chief commandment in the law. But the design is the same, for he makes a deceitful attack on Christ, that, if he can draw any thing from his lips that is at variance with the law, he may exclaim against him as an apostate and a promoter of ungodly revolt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 22:34. But the Pharisees hearing. Even their gratification at the defeat of their usual opponents, the Sadducees (Mark 12:28; Luke 20:0, did not diminish their enmity. Hence a renewal of the assault.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He had put the Sadducees to silence (ÎµÏ†Î¹Î¼Ï‰ÏƒÎµÎ½ Ï„Î¿Ï…Ï‚ Î£Î±Î´Î´Î¿Ï…ÎºÎ±Î¹Î¿Ï…Ï‚). Muzzled the Sadducees."
2. "The Pharisees could not restrain their glee though they were joining with the Sadducees in trying to entrap Jesus."
3. "Gathered themselves together (ÏƒÏ…Î½Î·Ï‡Î¸Î·ÏƒÎ±Î½ ÎµÏ€ Ï„Î¿ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿). First aorist passive, were gathered together."

### John Gill:
1. "His credit with the people would increase yet more and more."
2. "They gathered together at some certain house, where they consulted what to do."
3. "They seemed to have fixed on this method, that one among them...should put a question to him relating to the law, which was then agitated among them, the solution of which was very difficult."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 12:28; Luke 10:25.
