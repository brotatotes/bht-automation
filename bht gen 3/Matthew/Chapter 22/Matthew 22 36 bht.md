# Matthew 22:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Which kind of command is great in the law? That is, what kind of a commandment must it be to constitute it a great one? He wanted to know the principle upon which a commandment was to be regarded as a great commandment. The question was not which of the laws was the greatest, but about the whole body of the law, moral and ceremonial, delivered by Moses. In this multiplicity of opinions, Christ's is desired on this subject, though with no good intention.

### John Gill:
1. "The question is not which of the laws was the greatest, the oral, or the written law:... but the question was about the written law of Moses; and not merely about the decalogue, or whether the commands of the first table were greater than those of the second... but about the whole body of the law, moral and ceremonial, delivered by Moses."
2. "Some thought the commandment of the sabbath was the greatest... Others give the preference to circumcision... Others say of the 'phylacteries', that the holiness of them is the greatest of all... and even of the fringe upon the borders of their garments, others observe, that a man that is guilty of that command, is guilty of all others, and that single precept is equal to all the rest."
3. "In this multiplicity of opinions, Christ's is desired on this subject, though with no good intention."
