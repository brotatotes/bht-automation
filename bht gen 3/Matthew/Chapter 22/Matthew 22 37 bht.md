## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "For, though it is divided into two tables, the first of which relates to the worship of God, and the second to charity, Moses properly and wisely draws up this summary, that the Jews may perceive what is the will of God in each of the commandments."
2. "But as the wicked and sinful inclinations of the flesh draw us aside from what is right, Moses shows that our life will not be regulated aright till the love of God fill all our senses."
3. "It now appears from this summary that, in the commandments of the Law, God does not look at what men can do, but at what they ought to do; since in this infirmity of the flesh it is impossible that perfect love can obtain dominion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole is a demand for supreme affection."
2. "The first refers to 'the whole energy of the reason and the intellect; soul, 'the whole energy of sentiment and passion; mind, 'the whole energy of thought and will in its manifestation.'"
3. "With all thy strength,' which refers more especially to the manifestations of thought and will."

### John Gill:
1. "thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; that is, with all the powers and faculties of the soul, the will, the understanding, and the affections; in the most sincere, upright, and perfect manner, without any dissimulation and hypocrisy."
2. "and though this is now the case of man, yet his obligation to love the Lord in this manner is still the same; and when the Spirit of God does produce the grace and fruit of love in his soul, he does love the Lord sincerely."
3. "And certain it is, that as God is to be loved in the strongest manner we are capable of, and with all we have, and are; so always, at all times, under all dispensations of his providence, and upon all accounts, and for all he does towards, in, upon, and for us."

### John Wesley:
1.  Deuteronomy 6:5.
