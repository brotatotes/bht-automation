# Matthew 22:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandment to love our neighbors is like the first, as it depends on it. Our love for God should be reflected in our love for others. While we are called to love our neighbors, we should not place this above our love for God. Our love for others should not merely mirror how we love ourselves, but how we ought to love ourselves. Genuine love for others stems from the love of God, as it is impossible for His love to reign without producing kindness and care for others.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The commandment to love our neighbors is like the first, because it depends on it. Our supreme love to God should manifest itself in our love for others. However, we must be careful not to prioritize the second commandment over the first. While we are indeed called to love our neighbors, we should love them not just as we love ourselves, but as we ought to love ourselves. This means loving them in the same manner, but not necessarily to the same degree. The love of God should naturally lead to brotherly kindness among men, for it is impossible for the love of God to reign without producing this love for others. In fact, charity is declared to be the bond of perfection and the fulfilling of the law. Christ simplifies all the commandments to two: love for God and love for our neighbors. Therefore, we should strive to love our neighbors sincerely and wholeheartedly, with the intent of their well-being and God's glory.
