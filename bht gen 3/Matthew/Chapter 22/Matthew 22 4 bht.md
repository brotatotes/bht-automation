# Matthew 22:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable in question teaches us that the slaying of the Lord is not the fault of those who were invited, but rather something mentioned to emphasize the significance of the feast. The meal referred to is not dinner, but rather a noon-time breakfast that marked the beginning of marriage festivities. The invitation to the feast can be seen as a metaphor for the Gospel call after Christ's death and resurrection, inviting all to partake. This invitation is urgent and all-encompassing, symbolizing the readiness of all things due to the sacrifice of Christ.

2. "Both sides of the truth may be included in the parable, as they are in Acts ii. 23, and indeed wherever it is set forth." (24 words)
3. "The meal designated is not that which we understand by dinner, but the meal at noon, with which the course of marriage festivities began." (25 words)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Other servants - Who might press it on their attention. So God repeats his message to sinners when they reject it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Dinner [Œ±œÅŒπœÉœÑŒøŒΩ] . Not the principal meal of the day, but a noon - breakfast; luncheon."
2. "Fatlings [œÉŒπœÑŒπœÉœÑŒ±] . From sitov, corn, grain, or food generally. Properly animals especially fed up or fatted for a feast."

### John Calvin:
1. "But now Christ told them that, at the very hour, fresh messengers were sent to entreat them to come with haste; for the first invitation which he mentions includes all the former prophecies, down to the publication of the Gospel."
2. "For this reason, he charges the ancient people with nothing more than contempt and pride, but says, that the servants who had been last sent, and who arrived at the hour of supper, were abused or slain."
3. "And thus it usually happens, that ungodly men break out into fiercer rage against God, in proportion to the earnestness with which he invites them to salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The series of wedding feasts began with a dinner, preceding the actual marriage. It refers to the beginning of privileges, which culminate in 'the marriage supper of the Lamb.'" 
2. "Although the guests were the subjects of the king, whom He might constrain, He invites them even with urgency, to become guests and friends."
3. "This thought of Christ as slain is necessarily included, when a distinctly evangelical sense is put upon the phrase: all things are ready."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "What privileges the patriarchs and prophets, and the people of the Jews enjoyed, in the morning of the world, before the coming of Christ, who made the bright and full day of the Gospel, were but as a 'breakfast', a short meal; the means of grace were not so rich and plentiful, and their knowledge of spiritual things not so large..."
3. "This shows the completeness and perfection of the Gospel dispensation, this being that better thing, which God has provided for his people in the last times, that former saints might not be perfect without them."

### John Wesley:
1. Fatlings ‚Äî Fatted beasts and fowls.
