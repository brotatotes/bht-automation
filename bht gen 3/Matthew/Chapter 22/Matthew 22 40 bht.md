# Matthew 22:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The challenge arises from understanding Christ as the Son of David in a worldly political sense, yet the solution lies in recognizing the incarnate Godhead of Christ, which the people were unaware of.

Living a holy and upright life involves both worshiping God and demonstrating charity towards others. These two commandments hold foremost importance but are not the sole components of faith. All the law and prophets align and depend on them for guidance.
