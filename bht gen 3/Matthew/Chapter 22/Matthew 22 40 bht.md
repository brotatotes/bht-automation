### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse reminds us that the law and the prophets, the entirety of God's ancient revelation of His will, are summed up in the command to love God and our neighbors. This command is not simply a worldly, political interpretation of the title Son of David, which the scribes understood. Instead, the solution lies in recognizing the incarnate Godhead of Christ, of which they were ignorant. The cardinal precepts of the law and the prophets are undergirded by a common principle, with no contradiction between them. The sum of a holy and upright life is found in loving God and loving others, and this command is the fulfillment of the law. It is impossible to separate the command to love from the teachings of the law and prophets; they are intimately connected and dependent on one another.
