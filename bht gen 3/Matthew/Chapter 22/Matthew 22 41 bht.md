## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now while the Pharisees were gathered together. Probably as they gathered after the last attack."
2. "Jesus asked them. Fuller and more exact than Mark and Luke, who seem to imply that the question was put concerning the scribes."
3. "This probably took place while His audience was changing: the Pharisees were about to withdraw, no longer daring to question Him; and 'the multitude' (Mark 12:37) beginning to take the vacated places."

### John Gill:
1. "Salvation was not by the law, and the works of it, which they set up for doctors and interpreters of, and advocates for, but by the Messiah, who was promised to their fathers, and they expected."
2. "Christ directs his discourse not to him individually, but to all the Pharisees before he parted with them, and puts a question to them, in his turn; and which would lead on to another they could not answer, and they must therefore leave him once more with great shame and confusion."
3. "Suggesting by it, that salvation was not by the law, and the works of it, which they set up for doctors and interpreters of, and advocates for, but by the Messiah, who was promised to their fathers, and they expected."
