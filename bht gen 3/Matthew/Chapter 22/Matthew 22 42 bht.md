## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "For from the very commencement Satan endeavored, by all the arts which he could devise, to put forward some pretended Christ, who was not the true Mediator between God and men."
2. "But in this manner the hope of future and eternal life, as well as spiritual righteousness, was abolished."
3. "Now as the hour of his death was already approaching, the Lord himself intended to attest his divinity, that all the godly might boldly rely on him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What think ye of the Christ? 'The Messiah.' The Pharisees included the acknowledged interpreters of the Old Testament."
2. "This incompleteness is then proven. On this one-sided view of the Messiah, as a descendant of David, the king and warrior, their false political hopes had been based."
3. "What they thought of Him, He does not ask them. Since He has been abundantly proven to be 'the Christ,' the question comes to us in this form, as an all-important one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By his pungent question about the Messiah as David's son and Lord he really touches the problem of his Person (his Deity and his Humanity)."
2. "Probably the Pharisees had never faced that problem before."
3. "They were unable to answer."

### John Gill:
1. "If this question was put to some persons, it would appear, that they have no thoughts of Christ at all."
2. "Only believers in Christ have a good thought of him, to their own joy and comfort."
3. "Such think often, and well, of the dignity of Christ's person, of the excellency and usefulness of his offices, of the virtue of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, and of the sufficiency of his grace for them."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 20:41.
