### John Gill:
1. "if he is a mere man, if he is only the son of David, according to the flesh, if he has no other, or higher descent than from him, how comes it to pass, that David, under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, by which he wrote his book of Psalms, see 2 Samuel 23:1 where the passage, after cited, stands, to call him Lord"

3. "the phrase 'in spirit', is not to be connected with the word Lord; as if the design of it was to show, that the Messiah was Lord, or God, in spirit, or with respect to his divine nature, but, with the word 'call', expressing the influence of the Spirit of God, under which David wrote"

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: This declaration by our Lord in Matthew 22:43 highlights the inspiration of the prophetic Scriptures. It marks the end of the Pharisees' attempts to trap Jesus with questions and introduces a new scene. David, under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, calls the Messiah Lord, implying superiority. The phrase in spirit is not to be connected with the word Lord to prove the divinity of the Messiah, but rather shows the influence of the Spirit of God under which David wrote. Therefore, if Jesus is merely a human descendant of David, how can David call him Lord, suggesting that he is a greater person, one superior in nature and dignity? This challenges the idea of Jesus being just the son of David and affirms his divine nature and authority.
