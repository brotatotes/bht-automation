# Matthew 22:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, and all those who sought to discredit and harm Jesus, were silenced and would not dare to question Him any longer. They were faced with a dilemma - to acknowledge the deity of the Messiah or to confess their ignorance. Refusing to do either, they chose silence. From this point forward, Jesus was freed from the continuous harassment of those who sought to trap Him in His words. It became clear that Pharisaical Judaism and Christ were forever at odds, and the hostility towards Jesus intensified.
