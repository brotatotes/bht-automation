3. "œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ œÄœåŒªŒπŒΩ Œ±·Ωê.] no longer His, but their city. Compare ·ΩÅ Œø·º∂Œ∫ŒøœÇ ·ΩëŒº·ø∂ŒΩ ch. Matthew 23:38. This is a startling introduction of the interpretation into the parable; we knew not before that they had a city."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Armies (œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒ±). Bands of soldiers, not grand armies. 


### John Gill:

2. "But now his wrath was kindled very much, and was poured out like fire, and there was no standing before it"
3. "A worse punishment than this, even the vengeance of eternal fire, may all the neglecters of the Gospel, and persecutors of the ministers of it expect"

### John Wesley:
