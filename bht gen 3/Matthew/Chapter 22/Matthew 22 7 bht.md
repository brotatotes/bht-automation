## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The occurrence of this verse before the opening of the Feast to the Gentiles has perplexed some interpreters: but it is strictly exact."
2. "His armies. The Roman armies; a similar expression for the unconscious instruments of God‚Äôs anger is used."
3. "Their city. No longer His, but their city. This is a startling introduction of the interpretation into the parable; we knew not before that they had a city."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But when the king [...] heard thereof, he was wroth [...] at the affront put both on His Son, and on Himself who had deigned to invite them."
2. "The Romans are here styled God's armies, just as the Assyrian is styled 'the rod of His anger', as being the executors of His judicial vengeance."
3. "Ah! Jerusalem, once 'the city of the Great King', and even up almost to this time; but now it is 'their city'‚Äîjust as our Lord, a day or two after this, said of the temple, where God had so long dwelt, 'Behold your house is left unto you desolate'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were murderers, having slain the prophets; and God was about to send forth the armies of the Romans under his providential direction, and to burn up their city."
2. "Wroth - Angry; displeased."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Armies [œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒ±] . Not in our grand sense of armies, but troops, soldiers. Compare Luke 23:11, where the word is rendered men of war; Rev., soldiers.


### John Calvin:
1. "Both concur in stating, that those who did not come at the appointed time were shut out, and deprived of the honor of being present at the banquet."
2. "But this doctrine applies equally to us; for the same destruction which Christ denounces against the Jews awaits all the ungodly, who violently oppose the ministers of the Gospel."
3. "Those who are so entirely occupied with earthly cares, as to set no value on the divine invitation, will at length perish miserably in famine and want; and therefore, whenever God calls us, let us be prepared and ready to follow."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He sent his armies. The Roman armies which destroyed Jerusalem were the unconscious instruments of God‚Äôs (the king‚Äôs) wrath."
2. "Destroyed these murderers. Both the indifferent and hostile, alike guilty."
3. "Burned their city. Jerusalem is meant, no longer His, but ‚Äòtheir city.‚Äô The destruction precedes the invitation to the Gentiles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Armies (œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑŒ±). Bands of soldiers, not grand armies. 


### John Gill:
1. "Christ, when he was here on earth, was sometimes provoked by the Jews, through their unbelief, their obstinacy, and the hardness of their hearts and was angry with them, being grieved for them..."
2. "...but the time of his vengeance was not yet come, more patience and forbearance were to be exercised towards them."
3. "and by removing the sceptre from them, and all show of dominion and government, made it fully appear that he, the Messiah, was come."

### John Wesley:
1. The king sending forth his troops ‚Äî The Roman armies employed of God for that purpose.
Destroyed those murderers ‚Äî Primarily the Jews.
