While publicly exposing the vices of the scribes, Jesus aimed to prevent the spread of their corruption without inciting envy against them. It was important to Jesus that the people did not abandon reverence for the Law due to the teachers' misconduct, but rather understood the need to differentiate between what should be observed and what shouldn't.
