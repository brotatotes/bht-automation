# Matthew 23:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The precept in question reminds us that the true observance of a teaching requires more than superficial compliance. Additionally, the one who claims to be the servant of the servants of God has actually violated this principle. It is worth noting that the term servant here refers specifically to a minister rather than a general servant. Thus, those who hold prominent positions among believers are called to demonstrate their status through humble acts of service. In the Church, the highest honor is not attained through authority, but through selfless service to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It may serve to shew us how little the letter of a precept has to do with its true observance..."
2. "...he who of all the Heads of sects has most notably violated this whole command, and caused others to do so, calls himself â€˜servus servorum Deiâ€™ ( 'servant of the servants of God')." 
3. "It must be noted (see margin) that the word here rendered 'servant' in the A.V., is not that usually so translated... but diaconos, which is in the same version rendered minister in chap. xx. 26."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 11. But he that is greatest among
	you shall be your servantâ€”This plainly means, "shall show
	that he is so by becoming your servant"; as in :-, compared with Mark 10:44.


### John Calvin:
1. "The highest honor in the Church is not government, but service."
2. "Whoever keeps himself within this limit, whatever may be the title which he bears, takes nothing away either from God or from Christ."
3. "He strictly forbids his followers to aspire or desire to rise any higher than to enjoy brotherly intercourse on an equal footing under the heavenly Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The greater among you shall be your servant." - Not, 'shall be called.' The Pope, whose usual title is a violation of Matthew 23:9, is called: 'Servant of servants.'
2. "The greater among you," implies a difference among Christians, but not that one is the 'greatest.' 
3. "The greater have always been those who ministered."

### John Gill:
1. "Service is the way to honor; he that would be most esteemed ought to do the most work." 
2. "The man that has the most grace, and the greatest gifts, ought to employ them for the use and benefit of others." 
3. "Christ here seems to have regard to that vain spirit, which appeared among them; and his view is, to check and restrain it."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 20:26.
