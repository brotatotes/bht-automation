## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord forbade all swearing to His own disciples, ch. v. 34; and by the very same reasoningâ€”because every oath is really and eventually an oath by Godâ€”shews these Pharisees the validity and solemnity of every oath."
2. "This subterfuge became notorious at Rome."
3. "See citation in my Gr. Test."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Woe unto you, ye blind guides." - Striking expression this of the ruinous effects of erroneous teaching.
2. "Our Lord, here and in some following verses, condemns the subtle distinctions they made as to the sanctity of oathsâ€”distinctions invented only to promote their own avaricious purposes."
3. "It should have been rendered, 'he is a debtor,' as in Matthew 23:1."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is nothing - It amounts to nothing - it is not binding."
2. "The gold of the temple - Either the golden vessels in the temple - the candlestick, etc.; or the gold with which the doors and other parts of the temple were covered; or the gold in the treasury. This, it seems, they considered far more sacred than any other part of the temple, but it is not known why."
3. "He is a debtor - He is bound to keep his oath. He is guilty if he violates it."

### John Calvin:
1. "As ambition is almost always connected with hypocrisy, so the superstitions of the people are usually encouraged by the covetousness and rapacity of pastors."
2. "There is nothing to which men are more prone than to fall away from the pure worship of God: and therefore, under the covering of this veil, it was easy for Satan to withdraw from the contemplation of God those who were too strongly inclined to foolish imaginations."
3. "And yet the Papists were not ashamed to prostitute the sacred name of God to a mockery still more detestable; for they reckon it of more importance to touch a morsel of a stinking carcass, than to peruse the sacred volume of the Old and New Testaments, or even to raise their hands towards heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye blind guides. Wilfully blind, self-deluded (â€˜fools and blind,â€™ Matthew 23:17), they persisted in leading others astray."
2. "By the temple. A common oath, comp. chap. Matthew 5:34-37, where kindred oaths are referred to, and all swearing forbidden."
3. "This they regarded as a binding oath. Whatever their reason may have been, the Pharisees thus put the gold above the temple. A sign of covetousness, and of a tendency to exalt church ornaments above the house of God itself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye blind guides (Î¿Î´Î·Î³Î¿ Ï„Ï…Ï†Î»Î¿). Note omission of 'Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites' with this third woe." 
2. "They split hairs about oaths, as Jesus had explained in Matthew 5:33-37, between the temple and the gold of the temple."
3. "He owes his oath, is bound by his oath. A.V., is guilty , is old English, obsolete sense of guilt as fine or payment."

### John Gill:
1. "Woe unto you, you blind guides,.... Meaning the same persons, the Scribes and Pharisees, as before, though not named, who pretended to be 'guides of the blind', Romans 2:19 but were themselves blind, and so very unfit to be guides of others."
2. "which say, whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; meaning either that it was no sin to use such an oath, or it was not binding upon a man: he might choose whether he would abide by what he swore by the temple he would do; and thus they ignorantly, and wickedly encouraged vain swearing and perjury."
3. "But whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is guilty; or is bound, or is a debtor, to make good his oath; he cannot be excused, but must be obliged to fulfill it; or if he does not, he is guilty of perjury."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wo to you, ye blind guides â€” Before he had styled them hypocrites, from their personal character: now he gives them another title, respecting their influence upon others." 
2. "Both these appellations are severely put together in the23d and Matthew 23:23,2525th verses; and this severity rises to the height in the33d verse." 
3. "He is bound â€” To keep his oath."
