# Matthew 23:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus speaks of swearing by the altar, temple, or heaven, he is not condoning the act itself. Rather, he wants people to understand the gravity of their oaths. By reminding them that all of these things are connected to God and His holiness, Jesus emphasizes that any oath made through them is ultimately an appeal to God. Therefore, one should be mindful that such oaths carry weight and are binding. It is not just the object or place being sworn by, but also everything associated with it, including the gifts and offerings presented there.
