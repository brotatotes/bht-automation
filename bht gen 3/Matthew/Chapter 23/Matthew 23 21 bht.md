# Matthew 23:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The dwelling of God in the Temple is remarkable, as He had not done so since the Captivity. In the first temple, God manifested Himself through visible symbols and glory, but the second temple's status regarding His presence is ambiguous. Swearing by the temple is akin to swearing by God Himself, as it is His dwelling place. This type of oath is sacred and binding, for it is only God who can bear witness to its truth or falsehood. The Pharisees, despite claiming to teach about God, had forgotten the true significance of the temple.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse talks about the dwelling of God in the Temple, which is interesting because God had not dwelt in the Temple since the Captivity. In the first temple, God showed Himself through visible symbols and glory, but nothing is affirmed or denied about God's presence in the second temple. It is important to remember that an oath by the temple is equivalent to an oath by God himself, as the temple is the dwelling place of God. Therefore, such an oath is sacred and binding, since only God can be the witness of the truth. This highlights the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, who claimed to teach about God but forgot the true meaning of the temple and its significance.
