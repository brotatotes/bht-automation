# Matthew 23:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord points out that the Pharisees meticulously tithed even the smallest herbs but neglect the weightier matters of justice, mercy, and faith. Jesus' criticism is not aimed at tithing itself, but at the Pharisees' tendency to prioritize minor regulations over more significant moral responsibilities. This reminds us of the importance of upholding all commandments without detaching or neglecting any, as they are interwoven with each other. We are called to prioritize justice, mercy, and faith while also paying attention to the details of the law.
