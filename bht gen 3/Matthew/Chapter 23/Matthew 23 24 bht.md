# Matthew 23:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blind guides in this section strain out a gnat, meticulously filtering their wine to avoid consuming unclean insects. However, they neglect the weightier matters of judgment, mercy, and faith. Their hypocrisy is evident as they meticulously follow minor details but disregard their own sins of deceit, oppression, and impurity. Their actions, straining out a crumb while swallowing a whole loaf, demonstrate their inconsistency and deserve the rebuke of being blind guides leading others astray.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye blind guides, which strain out." 
2. "It was the custom...to strain their wine, vinegar, and other potables through linen or gauze."
3. "To this custom of theirs our Lord here refers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To strain out a gnat; and so it is printed in some of the earlier versions, and so it was undoubtedly rendered by the translators."
2. "You Jews take great pains to avoid offence in very small matters, superstitiously observing the smallest points of the law, like a man carefully straining out the animalculae from what he drinks, while you are at no pains to avoid great sins - hypocrisy, deceit, oppression, and lust - like a man who should swallow a camel."
3. "He eats an elephant, and is suffocated with a gnat."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strain at is an old misprint perpetuated. Hence the Rev. correctly, as Tynd., strain out."
2. "Insects were ceremonially unclean (Leviticus 11:20, Leviticus 11:23, Leviticus 11:41, Leviticus 11:42), so that the Jews strained their wine in order not to swallow any unclean animal."
3. "Swallow [ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Ï€Î¹Î½Î¿Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚] . The rendering is feeble. It is drink down [ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±] ; gulp."

### John Calvin:
1. "They act as absurdly as if a man were to strain out a small crumb of bread, and to swallow a whole loaf."
2. "Nothing therefore could be more ridiculous than to strain out the wine or the water, so as not to hurt the jaws by swallowing a gnat, and yet carelessly to gulp down a camel."
3. "But it is evident that hypocrites amuse themselves with such distinctions; for while they pass by judgment, mercy, and faith, and even tear in pieces the whole Law, they are excessively rigid and severe in matters that are of no great importance; and while in this way they pretend to kiss the feet of God, they proudly spit in his face."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Strain out the gnat, i.e., to filter wine, so as to avoid swallowing a gnat."
2. "And swallow the camel, i.e., indulge in the greatest impurities."
3. "The reality of Pharisaic sin exceeds the figure."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Strain out the gnat...By filtering through (Î´Î¹Î±), not the 'straining at' in swallowing so crudely suggested by the misprint in the A.V."
2. "Swallow the camel...Gulping or drinking down the camel. An oriental hyperbole like that in Matthew 19:24."
3. "Both insects and camels were ceremonially unclean (Leviticus 11:4; Leviticus 11:20; Leviticus 11:23; Leviticus 11:42). 'He that kills a flea on the Sabbath is as guilty as if he killed a camel' (Jer. Shabb. 107)."

### John Gill:
1. "These men would not, on any consideration, be guilty of such a crime, as not to pay the tithe of mint, anise, and cummin, and such like herbs and seeds; and yet made no conscience of doing justice, and showing mercy to men, or of exercising faith in God, or love to him."
2. "Just as many hypocrites, like them, make a great stir, and would appear very conscientious and scrupulous, about some little trifling things, and yet stick not, at other times, to commit the grossest enormities, and most scandalous sins in life."
3. "To strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel, became at length a proverb, to signify much solicitude about little things, and none about greater."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye blind guides, who teach others to do as you do yourselves, to strain out a gnat - From the liquor they are going to drink!"
2. "Swallow a camel - It is strange, that glaring false print, strain at a gnat, which quite alters the sense, should run through all the editions of our English Bibles."
