# Matthew 23:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your hearts are not temples of the living God, but graves of corruption. Just as one might unknowingly walk over a hidden grave and contract ceremonial defilement, the Pharisees' outward appearance concealed their internal pollution. They were like whitened sepulchers, presenting a beautiful image on the outside while harboring dead bones and uncleanness within. Their hypocrisy, envy, pride, lust, and malice were appropriately depicted by the corruption within a whited tomb. They may have appeared righteous, but their hearts were full of deceit and iniquity.
