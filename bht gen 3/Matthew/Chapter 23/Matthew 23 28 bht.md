# Matthew 23:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their religion was nothing more than a facade, a superficial whitewash that barely covered the corruption within. Their outward righteousness was a sham, for their hearts were filled with opposition to God's law. Like Sarah and Leah, they pretended to be righteous, but in reality, they were the dyed or colored ones. Their display of righteousness was only for the eyes of men, not for God, who sees through the external and knows the secret wickedness lurking within. Their hearts were not temples of the living God, but graves of pestilent corruption, their religion a mere illusion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Your heart is not a temple of the living God, but a grave of pestilent corruption: not a heaven, but a hell."
2. "And your religion is but the whitewash hardly skin-deep."
3. "Their outward righteousness was put on, their hearts were really opposed to God‚Äôs law."

### John Gill:
1. "They were what Hagar, as the Jews say, charged her mistress with being; for so they interpret these words, 'her mistress was despised in her eyes,' Genesis 16:4 b. 'She said, this Sarah is not secretly, what she is openly; she appears ◊õ◊ê◊ô◊ú◊ï ◊î◊ô◊ê ◊¶◊ì◊ß◊™, 'as if she was righteous' and she is not righteous.'"
2. "The same they say of Leah. This was a misrepresentation; but the representation Christ gives of these men, is right; they were of that sort of the Pharisees, which they call ◊î◊¶◊ë◊ï◊¢◊ô◊ü, 'the dyed', or 'colored' ones."
3. "But this outward show and appearance of righteousness, was only 'unto men', not unto God: they did not appear so to him, who is the searcher of hearts, and knows what is in man, and knew all the secret wickedness that was in them."
