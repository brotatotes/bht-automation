# Matthew 23:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious teachers seated on Moses' authority, while able to command adherence to the Law of Moses, do not align their teachings with their actions. Though their interpretations of the law are generally correct, their lives defy their teachings. Nevertheless, Jesus does not intend to defend or endorse their traditions. Instead, he reminds the people to obey God's law rather than emulate the flawed behavior of these teachers. Thus, it is crucial to recognize their authority but refrain from imitating their hypocritical practices.
