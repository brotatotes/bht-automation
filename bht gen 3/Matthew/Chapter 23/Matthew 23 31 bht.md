# Matthew 23:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees were witnesses to themselves, acknowledging that they were the children of those who killed the prophets. Their actions and hypocrisy demonstrated that they inherited the same spirit and principles as their ancestors. The Pharisees, in their attempts to appear pious, failed to truly understand their own condition and the gravity of their fathers' crimes. Their acknowledgment of their ancestors' actions was not meant to reproach them, but rather to elevate their own character. However, their practices exposed their true nature, aligning them morally and spiritually with their predecessors.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye be witnesses unto yourselves - The emphasis, here, lies in the words 'to yourselves.' It is an appeal to their conscience."
2. "It was not by their building the tombs that they were witnesses that they were the children of those who killed the prophets; but that, in spite of all this pretence of piety, under all this cloak of profession, they knew in their consciences, and were witnesses to themselves, that it was mere hypocrisy."
3. "Children of them... - Resembling them; approving their conduct; inheriting their feelings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "You acknowledge the sins of your fathers, but hypocritically deny your own, adding hypocrisy to impiety."
2. "Ye witness to yourselves, your own consciences condemning you, that ye are the sons (morally as well as naturally) of them that slew the prophets."
3. "Doing this in appearance only, the Pharisees showed that they had no true conception of either their own condition, or the crime of their fathers."

### John Gill:
1. "For what they said was a plain acknowledgment, and a full confession, what their fathers had done, and whose offspring they were."
2. "They plainly owned, that their fathers killed the prophets, and that they descended from them; though they meant not so much to reproach their ancestors, as to give themselves a greater character."
3. "Their practices showed them to be of the same spirit and principles with their progenitors."
