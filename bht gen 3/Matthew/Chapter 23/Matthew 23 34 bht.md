### Henry Alford:
1. "Since ye are bent upon filling up the iniquities of your fathers, in Godâ€™s inscrutable purposes ye shall go on rejecting His messengers."
2. "These words are nowhere written in Scripture, nor is it necessary to suppose that to be our Lordâ€™s meaning."
3. "He speaks this as Head of His Church, of those whom He was about to send."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I am sending," that is, "am about to send."
2. "It is simply an announcement of a purpose of the Divine Wisdom, in the high style of ancient prophecy, to send a last set of messengers whom the people would reject, and rejecting, would fill up the cup of their iniquity."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "To put down this foolish boasting, Christ not only affirms that they do not excel other nations on the ground of having received from God distinguished prophets and expounders of his Wisdom, but maintains that this ilk requited favor is a greater reproach, and will bring upon them a heavier condemnation."
2. "The word of God, indeed, in itself and by its own nature, brings salvation, and invites all men indiscriminately to the hope of eternal life; but as all are not inwardly drawn, and as God does not pierce the ears of anyâ€”in short, as they are not renewed to repentance or bent to obedience, those who reject the word of God render it, by their unbelief, deadly and destructive."
3. "But it is asked, How does he declare that the prophecies will turn to the destruction of the Jews, while his adoption still continued to be in force towards that nation? I reply, As but a small portion embraced the word by faith for salvation, this passage relates to the greater number or the whole body; as Isaiah, after having predicted the general destruction of the nation, is commanded to seal the law of God among the disciples."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sending of messengers of salvation, the multiplication of privileges, hastens the doom of the hardened."
2. "The Old Testament teachers had been treated in the same way, and the prediction indicates that they too had been sent by Christ."

2. "The persons designed by 'prophets', 'wise men', and 'Scribes', are his apostles."
3. "And some of them ye shall kill; and crucify; and some of them ye shall scourge in your synagogues; and persecute them from city to city."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold, I send - Is not this speaking as one having authority?" 
2. "Prophets - Men with supernatural credentials: Wise men - Such as have both natural abilities and experience; and scribes - Men of learning."
3. "But all will not avail."
