# Matthew 23:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The judgment that awaits the Jewish people is not a sudden outburst of God's anger, but a culmination of their long history of unrighteousness. The murder of Abel marked the beginning of a struggle between righteousness and wickedness, while the killing of Zechariah in the sanctuary served as a warning of the dire consequences to come. The Jews, chosen by God, turned away from Him and His messengers, becoming vessels of wrath. The impending judgment is the result of their cumulative crimes and their refusal to heed God's warnings.
