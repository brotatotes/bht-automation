### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse reveals that this generation will face the consequences of their accumulated iniquity and be subject to a devastating judgment. Just as in the past, when the Amorites experienced the full force of God's retribution, and during the French Revolution when a similar principle was demonstrated, Christ's contemporaries would bear the weight of God's wrath. This punishment was not individual, but rather national, imposed on the entire generation as the culmination of a long line of hypocrisy and persecution. Forty years later, the destruction of Jerusalem would fulfill Christ's prophecy, with the guilt of their actions being imputed and the punishment finally inflicted upon the nation.
