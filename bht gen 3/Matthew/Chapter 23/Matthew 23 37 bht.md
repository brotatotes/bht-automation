# Matthew 23:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How often would I have gathered the people of Jerusalem, desiring to protect and save them, like a mother hen gathers her chicks under her wings. The tears shed by our Lord over their stubbornness reveal the freedom of man's will to resist the grace of God. Despite Jerusalem's rejection, God's compassion for His people remains, even in the face of imminent destruction by the Roman armies. He longs to shelter and save them, just as the ancient rabbins spoke of those who sought refuge under the wings of the Shekinah.

"Thou who oughtest to have been a faithful guardian of the word of God, a teacher of heavenly wisdom, the light of the world, the fountain of sound doctrine, the seat of divine worship, a pattern of faith and obedience, art a murderer of the prophets, so that thou hast acquired a certain habit of sucking their blood."
2. "It is an amazing and unparalleled instance of love, that he did not disdain to stoop to those blandishments, by which he might tame rebels into subjection."

"Christ here speaks as a man, and the minister of the circumcision, and expresses a human affection for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and a human wish and will for their temporal good, which he very aptly signifies by the hen, which is a very affectionate creature to its young, and which it endeavors to screen from danger by covering with its wings."
3. "The plain meaning of the text is the same with that of Matthew 23:13 and consequently is no proof of men's resisting the operations of the Spirit and grace of God; but only shows what obstructions and discouragements were thrown in the way of attendance on the external ministry of the word."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 13:34.
