# Matthew 23:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How often would I have gathered, said the Lord, my people under my wing, offering them messages of repentance and mercy. The tears of our Lord testify to man's will to resist God's grace, as Jerusalem did. I longed to gather them like a mother hen does with her chicks, protecting and saving them. It is a mysterious word, the resistance of such patient love and the liberty of self-undoing. Yet, they would not.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The tears of our Lord over the perverseness of Jerusalem are witnesses of the freedom of man‚Äôs will to resist the grace of God."
3. "ye would not" - See Isa. xxviii. 12; xxx. 15.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How ineffably grand and melting is this apostrophe! It is the very heart of God pouring itself forth through human flesh and speech."
2. "Under His great Mediatorial wing would He have 'gathered' Israel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. O Jerusalem ... - See the notes at Luke 19:41-42.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Hen [ŒøœÅŒΩŒπœÇ] . Generic : bird or fowl; but hen is used generically of the mother - bird of all species. 


### John Calvin:
1. "Yet Christ had likewise the intention to obviate the scandal which soon after arose, that believers, when they saw him basely put to death at Jerusalem, might not be confounded by the novelty of such an exhibition."
2. "This shows us what value we should attach to places. There never certainly was a city in the world on which God bestowed such magnificent titles, or such distinguished honor; and yet we see how deeply it was sunk by its ingratitude."
3. "Hence came dispersions so frequent, that they scarcely remained at rest for a single moment under the wings of God, as we see in the present day a certain wildness in the world, which has indeed existed in all ages; and, therefore, it is necessary that God should recall to himself those who are wandering and going astray."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A mighty emotion of compassion follows the stem language of denunciation; both are aroused by guilt."
2. "Our Lord speaks of His own merciful desires in the past, in the Old Testament times and in His ministry on earth."
3. "The matter was decided, and that by the free-will of the people themselves. As a whole the city had rejected, and would yet more cruelly reject Him; though many individuals might be saved."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "How often did I long to gather to myself (double compound infinitive)."
2. "The same verb (ŒµœÄŒπœÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥Œµ) is used of the hen with the compound preposition œÖœÄŒøŒ∫Œ±œÑœâ."
3. "Everyone has seen the hen quickly get together the chicks under her wings in the time of danger."

### John Gill:
1. "How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"
2. "Christ here speaks as a man, and the minister of the circumcision, and expresses an human affection for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and an human wish, and will for their temporal good."
3. "Had Christ expressed his desire to have gathered the heads of the people to him, the members of the Jewish sanhedrim, the civil and ecclesiastical rulers of the Jews: or had he signified how much he wished, and earnestly sought after, and attempted to gather Jerusalem, the children, the inhabitants of it in common, and neither of them would not; it would have carried some appearance of the doctrine of free will, and have seemed to have countenanced it, and have imputed the non-gathering of them to their own will."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 13:34.

- Attempt 1 BHT: How often would I have gathered, said the Lord, my people under my wing, offering them messages of repentance and mercy. It breaks my heart to witness the perverseness of Jerusalem, to see how they resolutely resisted the grace and love I extended to them. Oh, the depth of this apostrophe! It is the very heart of God pouring itself forth through human flesh and speech. I longed to gather them, to enfold them in my protective embrace like a mother hen gathering her chicks. Yet, they would not. Even though the prophets had foretold of this resistance, it is still a mysterious and unfathomable mystery how love can be rejected and the freedom of self-undoing embraced.
