# Matthew 23:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us depart hence, said primarily of the temple, then of Jerusalem, and then of the whole land in which ye dwell. Behold, your houseâ€”the temple, beyond all doubt; but their house now, not the Lord's. It is in vain for them to boast of the presence of God, whom they had driven away by their crimes. The temple, formerly the house of God, is now only theirs, abandoned by God, their crimes leading to its desolation and the destruction of the city they dwell in.
