# Matthew 23:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees are rebuked for enforcing burdensome observances that they themselves do not practice. These burdens, referring to the rigor and ritualism of the law, were imposed on others without any sympathy or willingness to bear them. The Pharisees were hypocritical and inconsistent, enforcing strict observance while failing to follow the law themselves. By making religion a heavy burden without offering spiritual guidance or example, they displayed their heartless rigor and shameless inconsistency.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The burdens then are not, as so often misinterpreted, human traditions and observances;â€”but the severity of the law, which they enforce on others, but do not observe."
2. "The irksomeness and unbearableness of these rites did not belong to the Law in itself, as rightly explained, but were created by the rigour and ritualism of these men, who followed the letter and lost the spirit."
3. "Who spent all their labour in enforcing and amplifying ceremonies."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne... but they themselves will not move them." 
2. "Referring not so much to the irksomeness of the legal rites, though they were irksome enough, as to the heartless rigor with which they were enforced."
3. "Men of shameless inconsistency."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The â€˜heavy burdensâ€™ refer not here to the traditions and foolish customs of the Pharisees, for Jesus would not command the people to observe them."
2. "The Pharisees were rigid in requiring that all the people should pay the taxes, give of their property, comply with every part of the law with the utmost rigor, yet they indulged themselves, and bore as little of the expense and trouble as possible."
3. "With one of their fingers - In the least degree. They will not render the least aid."

### John Calvin:
1. "That the Law of God should be called a heavy and intolerable burden is not wonderful, and more especially in reference to our weakness."
2. "Christ reproves the stern and rigid manner of teaching which was usually followed by those proud hypocrites."
3. "It is impossible to imagine anything that can exceed the insolence in commanding, or the cruelty, of stupid despisers of God, because they give themselves no concern about the difficulty of doing those things from which they relieve themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They so presented the correct law as to make its precepts heavy burdens, like loads, packs on beasts of burden."
2. "Imposing such burdens, they did not in the least lighten them by spiritual precept or example."
3. "A fourfold rebuke: 1. they make religion a burden; 2. an intolerable burden; 3. they lay it upon the shoulders of others; 4. they leave it untouched themselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  With their finger (Ï„Ï‰ Î´Î±ÎºÏ„Ï…Î»Ï‰ Î±Ï…Ï„Ï‰Î½). A picturesque proverb. They are taskmasters, not burden-bearers, not sympathetic helpers. 


### John Gill:
1. "The binding of these heavy things, means the imposing them on men, obliging them to observe them very strictly, under great penalties, should they omit them."
2. "They were so slothful and indolent themselves, that though they strictly enjoined the observance of their numerous and unwritten traditions on the people, yet in many cases, where they could without public notice, they neglected them themselves, or at least, made them lighter and easier to them."
3. "Such crafty wicked men were Scribes and Pharisees; though R. Meir pretended that he made things 'light' to others and 'heavy' to himself."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 11:46.
