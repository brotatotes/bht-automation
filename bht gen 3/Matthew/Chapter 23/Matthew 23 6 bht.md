# Matthew 23:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At feasts and in synagogues, people vied for the highest honor by desiring the uppermost rooms or chief seats. However, Jesus teaches that this honor belongs to Him alone, and it would be unjust to attribute it to humans. Taking the lowest place may seem humble, but if done out of a desire to be exalted, it still reflects a love for honor. Christ reminds us that we are all brethren, and no one has the right to hold a position of mastery over others.
