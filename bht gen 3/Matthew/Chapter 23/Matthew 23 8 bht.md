## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To understand and follow such commands in the slavery of the letter, is to fall into the very Pharisaism against which our Lord is uttering the caution."
2. "The Teacher is probably not Christ, as supplied here in the received text, but the Holy Spirit, only not here named, because this promise was only given in private to the disciples."
3. "They are all brethren: all substantially equalâ€”none by office or precedence nearer to God than another; none standing between his brother and God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 8. But be not ye called Rabbi; for
	one is your Masterâ€”your Guide, your Teacher.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were on a level; they were to be equal in authority; they were brethren; and they should neither covet nor receive a title which implied either an elevation of one above another."
2. "Everything which would tend to make a distinction among them or destroy their parity - everything which would lead the world to suppose that there were ranks and grades among them as ministers, they were to avoid."
3. "It makes a distinction among ministers. It tends to engender pride and a sense of superiority in those who obtain it, and envy and a sense of inferiority in those who do not; and the whole spirit and tendency of it is contrary to the 'simplicity that is in Christ.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But be not ye called Rabbi. But this prohibition includes all the manifestations of religious pride spoken of, since it prohibits the pride itself."
2. "For one is your Master, or, â€˜Teacher.â€™ The word â€˜Christâ€™ is to be omitted here. Because One is our Teacher, all are our brethren; hence the prohibition â€˜against loving, and in any religious matter, using such titles, signifying dominion over the faith of othersâ€™ (Alford)."
3. "Not the title, but the spirit which claims authority in teaching, is forbidden."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Do not seek to be called (ingressive aorist subjunctive), if others call you this it will not be your fault."
2. "This is not far from the Master's meaning."
3. "Rabbi means 'my great one,' 'my Master,' apparently a comparatively new title in Christ's time."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not be ambitious of any such title, fond of it, or affect it, or be elated with it, should it be given you; nor look upon yourselves as men of power and authority over others." 
2. "One is your master, even Christ... who had all power in heaven and in earth, to make laws, appoint ordinances, and oblige men to receive his doctrines, and obey his commands." 
3. "All ye are brethren... and so have no superiority one over another: this may regard the disciples, both as believers and Christians, partakers of the same grace, and standing in the same relation to God, Christ, and one another."
