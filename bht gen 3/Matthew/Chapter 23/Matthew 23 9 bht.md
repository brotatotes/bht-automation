# Matthew 23:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus warns against designating anyone on earth as father, reserving that title for God alone. This caution is not a condemnation of all titles used to distinguish church leaders; rather, it serves as a reminder to avoid seeking ecclesiastical superiority and to retain humility. The focus is on recognizing God as the ultimate Father, the source of all life and truth, and not bestowing titles that belong to Him. We should not assume authoritative power over others, but rather submit to the authority of our Father in heaven.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Name not any Father of you on earth."
2. "No 'Abba' or 'Papa'."
3. "See the account of the funeral of John Wesley, Coke and More‚Äôs Life, p. 441, and the opening of the Author‚Äôs dedication of the book."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven." 
2. "To construe these injunctions into a condemnation of every title by which Church rulers may be distinguished from the flock which they rule, is virtually to condemn that rule itself."
3. "Let us see to it that we retain the full spirit of this warning against that itch for ecclesiastical superiority which has been the bane and the scandal of Christ's ministers in every age."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this sense it belongs eminently to God, and it is not right to give it to people." 
2. "Christian brethren are equal. Only God has supreme authority. He only has a right to give laws; to declare doctrines that shall bind the conscience; to punish disobedience."
3. "Christ taught them that the source of all life and truth was God, and they ought not to seek or receive a title which properly belongs to him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Father [œÄŒ±œÑŒµœÅŒ±] . Aimed at those who courted the title Abba, or Father. Compare the title Papa - Pope.


### John Calvin:
1. "And call no man on earth your Father. He claims for God alone the honor of Father."
2. "The true meaning therefore is, that the honor of a father is falsely ascribed to men, when it obscures the glory of God."
3. "All the degrees of relationship depend on God alone through Christ, and are held together in such a manner that, strictly speaking, God alone is the Father of all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It rather forbids honoring any one as an absolute spiritual authority, because this opposes the authority of our Father in heaven."
2. "Compare the Papal usage in all its forms of priesthood from the one Father (Papa) claiming infallibility, to the parish priest, or 'Father,' claiming infallibility derived from that source."
3. "Nor are titles of respect to the aged forbidden. Stephen (Acts 7:2) began his defence: ‚ÄòBrethren and fathers,‚Äô and Paul too calls himself the spiritual father of the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 4:15), speaks of Timothy as his son in the faith (1 Timothy 1:2; comp. Titus 1:4; 1 Peter 5:13)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Abba was not commonly a mode of address to a living person, but a title of honour for Rabbis and great men of the past."
2. "Certainly the ascription of 'Father' to pope and priest seems out of harmony with what Jesus here says."
3. "Jesus often leaves the exceptions to be supplied."

### John Gill:
1. "Our Lord does not mean, by any of these expressions, to set aside all names and titles, of natural and civil distinction among men, but only to reject all such names and titles, as are used to signify an authoritative power over men's consciences, in matters of faith and obedience; in which, God and Christ are only to be attended to."
2. "Christ's sense is, that he would have his disciples not fond of any titles of honour at all; and much less assume an authority over men, as if they were to depend on them, as the founders of the Christian religion, the authors of its doctrines and ordinances; and to take that honour to themselves, which did not belong to them."
3. "For one is your Father, which is in heaven; who is so, both by creation and adoption, and is possessed of all paternal authority; and is to be honoured and obeyed by all; from whom all wisdom and knowledge is derived, and who has the care and government of all in heaven and in earth."
