# Matthew 24:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Leaving the temple after his public teaching, Jesus and the disciples couldn't help but admire the magnificent buildings and the great stones of polished marble that adorned the iJeron. The disciples were both familiar with and captivated by the temple's beauty, comparing it to a snow mountain. Little did they know that Jesus would never return, and the temple would soon be desolate. The disciples marveled at the immense stones, some measuring 45 cubits in length, 5 in height, and 6 in breadth, as well as the ongoing construction of outer structures.
