## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is to many a stone of offense, on which some dash themselves, or by meeting which some are thrown back, and others fall away."
2. "In this expression Christ appears to me to include many kinds of troubles; for not only do they that had entered into the right course fall away, but many are exasperated against Christ; others, forgetful of moderation and justice, break out into rage; others grow profane, and lose every feeling of piety; and others, amidst the confusion which prevails, take upon themselves a liberty to commit crimes."
3. "It is an exceedingly violent temptation, and difficult to overcome."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "When they saw the apostles, some of them beaten, and imprisoned; others put to death, and others forced to fly from place to place... would be discouraged hereby, and stumble at the cross; and fall off from the faith of the Gospel, and the profession of it."
2. "The apostates, who would fall off from the Christian religion, would prove treacherous to true believers, and give in their names to the persecutors...that they might take them, or deliver them into their hands themselves."
3. "These apostates should hate them [true believers], in whose communion they before were, and to whom they belonged; and even to a very great degree of hatred, as it often is seen, that such who turn their backs on Christ, and his Gospel, prove the most bitter enemies, and most violent persecutors of its preachers and followers."

### John Wesley:
1. "But hold ye fast faith... in spite of false prophets: love, even when iniquity and offences abound..."
2. "And hope, unto the end... He that does so, shall be snatched out of the burning."
3. "The generality of those who love God will... leave their first love."
