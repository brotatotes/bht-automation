# Matthew 24:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love and trust among Christians may grow cold because of the iniquity that fills the world. This chilling effect, pictured as a spiritual energy blighted by a malign wind, is caused by a combination of immorality and the blending of heathen licentiousness with the profession of Christianity. This prophecy speaks of a loss of love and a rise in mutual hatred and suspicion among believers. Despite this, it is comforting to know that amidst the prevailing iniquity, there will always be those whose love for Christ and his Gospel remains unwavering.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But perhaps we ought to have regard to the past tense of the verb in the original, and interpret, â€˜because the iniquity is filled up,â€™ on account of the horrible state of morality, the love and mutual trust of the generality of Christians shall grow cold."
2. "Even the Church itself is leavened by the distrust of the evil days."
3. "It is against this iniquity especially that James, in his Epistle, and Jude, in more than the outward sense the brother of James, were called on to protestâ€”the mixture of heathen licentiousness with the profession of Christianity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'iniquity' here seems to include the cruelty of the Jews and Romans in their persecutions; the betraying of Christians by those who professed to be such; and the pernicious errors of false prophets arid others."
2. "The effect of all this would be, that the ardor of feeling of many Christians would be lessened."
3. "The fear of death, and the deluding influence of false teachers, would lessen the zeal of many timid and weak professors; perhaps, also, of many real but feeble Christians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is not the love of many people only that shall be chilled, but of the many, the majority, the great body."
2. "The picture is that of spiritual energy blighted or chilled by a malign or poisonous wind."
3. "The force of Christ's saying."

### John Calvin:
1. "For in consequence of the superior clearness with which the light of the gospel discovers the malice of men, even good and properly regulated minds grow cool, and almost lose the desire to exercise benevolence."
2. "But we must observe the source of this evil, which Christ points out, namely, that many lose courage, because through their weakness they are unable to stem the flood of iniquity which flows on every hand."
3. "Christ warns believers that they must surmount this obstacle, lest, overcome by bad examples, they apostatize."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A horrible state of immorality prevailed in the first century, and the false teachers endeavored to join it with Christian profession; the inevitable result was a coldness, a dying out of Christian love."
2. "So far as we know, this was not literally fulfilled in the first century. We infer that the entire fulfilment will come in with the great Apostasy (2 Thessalonians 2:3-8)."
3. "The principle is: wickedness destroys love; immorality eats out the heart of Christianity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Spiritual energy blighted or chilled by a malign or poisonous wind."
2. "Love of the brotherhood gives way to mutual hatred and suspicion."

### John Gill:
1. "And because iniquity shall abound... the consequence of which would be, the love of many shall wax cold."
2. "This would be the case of many, but not of all; for in the midst of this abounding iniquity, there were some, the ardour of whose love to Christ, to his Gospel, and to the saints, did not abate."
3. "This might be true of such, who were real believers in Christ; who might fall under great decays, through the prevalence of iniquity; since it does not say their love shall be lost, but wax cold."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In this verse, it is suggested that the love and mutual trust of Christians will grow cold because of the horrible state of morality and the blending of heathen licentiousness with the profession of Christianity. The picture painted here is one of spiritual energy being blighted or chilled by a malignant or poisonous wind, resulting in the love of the brotherhood giving way to mutual hatred and suspicion. This chilling effect on love and trust is attributed to the cruelty of persecutions, the betrayals by fellow Christians, the influence of false teachers, and the prevailing immorality of the times. While this prophecy may not have been literally fulfilled in the first century, it is believed that it will find complete fulfillment in the future during the great Apostasy. The principle we can draw from this is that wickedness and immorality have the power to destroy love and eat away at the heart of Christianity. However, amidst the abounding iniquity, there will always be some whose love for Christ and for his Gospel remains steadfast.
