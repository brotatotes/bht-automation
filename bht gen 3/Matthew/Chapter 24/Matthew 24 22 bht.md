## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If God had not in his mercy shortened (by His decree) those days...the whole nation (in the ultimate fulfilment, all flesh) would have perished." 
2. "It appears that besides the cutting short in the Divine counsels, which must be hidden from us, various causes combined to shorten the siege." 
3. "Some such providential shortening of the great days of tribulation, and hastening of Godâ€™s glorious Kingdom, is here promised for the latter times."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No flesh be saved - None of the nation would be preserved alive. All the inhabitants of Judea would perish." 
2. "But for the electâ€™s sake - The 'elect' here doubtless means 'Christians.'"
3. "The designs of wicked people, intended by them for the destruction of the people of God, are intended by God for the good of his chosen people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Should be shortened... a very picturesque word... literally, to dock, to cut off, leaving a stump." 
2. "As a fact, various causes did combine to shorten the siege... the Jews, absorbed in their party strifes, had totally neglected preparations to stand a siege... the magazines of corn and provisions were burnt before the arrival of Titus."
3. "Titus himself confessed that God was against the Jews, since otherwise neither his armies nor his engines would have availed against their defenses."

### John Calvin:
1. "This affords us a striking proof of the judgment of God when he afflicts his visible Church to such a degree, that we would be ready to conclude that it had altogether perished; and yet, in order to preserve some seed, he miraculously rescues from destruction his elect, though few in number, that, contrary to expectation, they may escape from the jaws of death."
2. "Thus, in punishing the Jews, the wrath of God burned to an extent which was truly awful, and yet, contrary to the expectation of men, he restrained it in such a manner, that not one of the elect perished."
3. "Away then with human merits, when our attention is directed exclusively to the good pleasure of God, that the distinction between some persons and others may depend solely on this, that those who have been elected must be saved."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Except those days had been shortened, etc. (A prophetic past tense.) Various causes did combine to shorten the siege of Jerusalem, so that the Christians in the neighboring place of refuge were not so much exposed."
2. "Titus himself confessed that he owed his victory to God, who took the fortifications of the Jews."
3. "But the strong language of the verse and the prophecy of Daniel (chap. Matthew 12:1) which is here alluded to, point to a providentia interposition in the great days of tribulation which are to come in the last times. The shortening of the days will be the hastening of the Lordâ€™s coming."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Had been shortened (ÎµÎºÎ¿Î»Î¿Î²Ï‰Î¸Î·ÏƒÎ±Î½). From ÎºÎ¿Î»Î¿Î²Î¿Ï‚, lopped, mutilated, as the hands, the feet. It is a second-class condition, determined as unfulfilled. It is a prophetic figure, the future regarded as past."
2. "For the elect's sake (Î´Î¹Î± Ï„Î¿Ï…Ï‚ ÎµÎºÎ»ÎµÎºÏ„Î¿Ï…Ï‚). See Matthew 22:14 for another use of this phrase by Jesus and also Matthew 24:31."
3. "The siege was shortened by various historical events like the stopping of the strengthening of the walls by Herod Agrippa by orders from the Emperor, the sudden arrival of Titus, the neglect of the Jews to prepare for a long siege."

2. "If these days had been continued a little longer, there had not been a Jew left in all the land."
