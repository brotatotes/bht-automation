# Matthew 24:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When trouble arises, false prophets offer their own solutions, leading many to cry out, Lo, here! However, it is crucial to discern the true Christ from those pretending to be the Messiah. While the disciples expected an immediate second Advent, we should not be deceived by plausible pretensions. Falsehoods disguised in the name of God only deepen our despair and close the door to repentance. We must not be swayed by the tempting promises of false Messiahs, as they lead to madness and despair.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When false prophets create trouble, false Christs offer their own solutions to the problems. These deluded victims cry out, Lo, here! as these false Messiahs emerge with their promises of deliverance from the world's ills. In the context of the Jews expecting the Messiah to deliver them from Roman oppression, it is important for believers to discern the true Christ from those claiming to be the Messiah. The disciples initially believed that the second Advent would immediately follow, but this verse does not negate the idea of Christ's visible personal coming. We must not be deceived by falsehoods disguised in the name of God, for they lead to despair and madness. The presence of miracles does not guarantee truth, as the Spirit distinctly marked the miracles by which the Law and the Gospel were authenticated. Just as during the time of the siege, false Messiahs sprung up and incited people to stay rather than flee or surrender. Even after the city was destroyed, others continued to claim to be the Messiah. Therefore, when someone declares, Lo! here is Christ, or there, we must not believe it.
