# Matthew 24:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False Messiahs will avoid public scrutiny by claiming to be the Messiah in secluded places like the desert or inner chambers. They will act as the Great Unseen and Unknown, deceiving people with their claims. Jesus warns against following these false Messiahs and advises against believing those who say that the Messiah is hidden in specific locations. The caution here is to avoid falling into fanaticism, superstition, and the dangerous path of these impostors, as the true Messiah has already come and revealed himself to Israel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Behold, he is in the desert - The Jews had formed the expectation that the Messiah would appear suddenly from some unexpected quarter; hence, many would be looking to desert places, expecting that he would come from them." 
2. "Go not forth - Do not follow them; they will only deceive you."
3. "In secret chambers - Concealed in some house, or some retired part of the city. Many would, doubtless, pretend that the Messiah was concealed there, and, either for the purpose of encouraging or deceiving the people, would pretend that they had discovered him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. In the desert - Secret chambers. Rev., wilderness - inner chambers. Both retired places, indicating that the false Messiahs will avoid public scrutiny.


### John Calvin:
1. "For we know that the false Christs â€”in accordance with the gross and foolish hope of that nationâ€”drew along with them as large bodies of men as they could collect into the recesses of the desert, or into caverns, or other places of retirement, in order to throw off the yoke of the Roman government by force and by arms."
2. "The meaning therefore is, that every one who collects his forces into a secret place, in order to regain the freedom of the nation by arms, falsely pretends to be the Christ; for the Redeemer is sent to diffuse his grace suddenly and unexpectedly through every quarter of the world."
3. "And, indeed, this astonishing rapidity, with which the gospel flew through every part of the world, was a manifest testimony of divine power. For it could not be the result of human industry, that the light of the gospel, as soon as it appear, darted from one side of the world to the opposite side like lightning."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold, he is in the wilderness, whither the impostors led their followers."
2. "Behold, he is in the inner chambers, teaching in private, proposing some scheme of deliverance."
3. "The caution then is against enthusiasm, superstition, and fanaticism, in the days of the waiting Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the wilderness. Like Simon son of Gioras."
2. "In the inner chambers. Like John of Giscala."
3. "False Messiahs act the role of the Great Unseen and Unknown."

### John Gill:
1. "Should they affirm, that the Messiah is in such a wilderness, in the wilderness of Judea, or in any other desert place, do not go out of the places where you are to see, or hear, and know the truth of things; lest you should, in any respect, be stumbled, ensnared, and brought into danger."
2. "Or should others say behold, or for certain, the Messiah is in some one of the secret and fortified places of the temple; where, during some time of the siege, were John and Eleazar, the heads of the zealots; do not believe them."
3. "The true Messiah is come, and has showed himself to Israel; and even the giving out these things discovers a consciousness, and a conviction that the Messiah is come."
