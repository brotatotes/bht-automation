# Matthew 24:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False messiahs will hide in the desert or secret chambers to avoid public scrutiny. The caution is against enthusiasm, superstition, and fanaticism, as these impostors lead followers into the wilderness with private schemes of deliverance. However, the true Messiah will extend his kingdom to the ends of the world, far beyond the limited boundaries of Judea. It is important not to be deceived by those who claim the Messiah can only be found in secret chambers. The true Messiah has already come and revealed himself to Israel.
