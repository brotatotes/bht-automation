## BHT:
The coming of the Lord will be a plain, unmistakable fact, like the lightning which lightens both ends of the heaven at once and is seen of all. It will not be connected with some particular place, but will manifest itself and be recognized over the whole world. His coming will be sudden and all-pervading, unmistakable and fearful, visible too, like the lightning. This prediction can only be fulfilled by a personal coming of Christ.
