# Matthew 24:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Wherever corruption exists, there will be a gathering of destruction and judgment. The carcass represents the fallen body, the moral corruption that attracts the vultures or eagles of vengeance. Just as the Roman eagles appeared in the destruction of Jerusalem, so will God's swift messengers of judgment come in the last days when the world's iniquity is full. This principle of gathering for destruction applies universally, as seen in God's dealings throughout history.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stress is on wheresoever and there, pointing out the universality."
2. "First, at Jerusalem: where the corrupting body lies, thither shall the vultures gather themselves together, coming as they do from far on the scent of prey."
3. "Secondly, in its final fulfilment,â€”over the whole world;â€”for that is the carcase now, and the eagles the angels of vengeance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Wherever wicked people are, there will be assembled the instruments of their chastisement."
2. "The providence of God will direct them there, as the vultures are directed to a dead carcass."
3. "He would come, by means of the Roman armies, as 'certainly;' as 'suddenly,' and as unexpectedly as whole flocks of vultures and eagles, though unseen before, see their prey at a great distance and suddenly gather in multitudes around it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Carcase [Ï€Ï„Ï‰Î¼Î±] . From piptw, to fall. Originally a fall, and thence a fallen body; a corpse." 
2. "The griffon vulture is meant, which surpasses the eagle in size and power."
3. "In the Russian war vast numbers were collected in the Crimea, and remained until the end of the campaign in the neighborhood of the camp, although previously scarcely known in the country."

### John Calvin:
1. "For whence comes the dispersion, but that many depart from Christ, in whom alone our strength lies?"
2. "This ought to be carefully observed; for Christ does not restrict us...but employs this method alone for binding his Church together."
3. "I attach as little value to the ingenuity of other commentators...it would be disgraceful in believers not to assemble to the Author of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'carcass' represents moral corruption ; the 'eagles,' God's means of certain punishment when the time is ripe." 
2. "The context points to two special occasions: 1 . The destruction of Jerusalem when the Roman 'eagles' appeared as ministers of vengeance; 2 . the last days when the cup of the world's iniquity shall be full and God's swift messengers of judgment (â€˜the angelsâ€™) shall come." 
3. "Yet the principle is of universal application, and has been again and again exemplified in God's dealings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Carcase (Ï€Ï„Ï‰Î¼Î±). As in Matthew 14:12, the corpse. Originally a fallen body from Ï€Î¹Ï€Ï„Ï‰, to fall, like Latin cadaver from cado, to fall." (Commentary)
2. "The proverb here as in Luke 17:37, is like that in Job 39:30; Proverbs 30:17." (Commentary)
3. "Eagles (Î±ÎµÏ„Î¿). Perhaps the griffon vulture, larger than the eagle, which (Aristotle) was often seen in the wake of an army and followed Napoleon's retreat from Russia." (Commentary)

### John Gill:
1. "Not Christ, as he is held forth in the Gospel, crucified and slain, through whose death is the savour of life, and by whom salvation is..."
2. "But here the Roman armies are intended, whose ensigns were eagles; and the eagle still is, to this day, the ensign of the Roman empire."
3. "The Persic version, contrary to others, and to all copies, renders it 'vultures'. Though this creature is of the same nature with the eagle, with respect to feeding on carcasses."

### John Wesley:
1. "Expect not any deliverer of the Jewish nation; for it is devoted to destruction." 
2. "It is already before God a dead carcass, which the Roman eagles will soon devour." 
3. "There will the eagles be gathered together."
