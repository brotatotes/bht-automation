# Matthew 24:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the time of Jesus' second coming, a definite declaration of time will be given as a sign, possibly the sign of the Cross. The sign of the Son of Man in heaven may refer to Jesus Himself. The wicked will mourn for rejecting the Savior, while Jesus will come with power, manifesting in the destruction of Jerusalem. It is important to recognize the coming of Christ, rather than knowing the specific sign in advance. All races and peoples will join in lamentation out of terror and foreboding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This then, so emphatically placed and repeated, is a definite declaration of time,â€”not a mere sign of sequence or coincidence..." 
2. "It is quite uncertain what the sign shall be:â€”plainly, not the Son of Man Himself, as some explain it..." 
3. "On the whole I think no sign completely answers the conditions, but that of the Cross..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The disciples had asked him Matthew 24:3 what should be the sign of his coming, and â€˜of the end of the world.â€™ In his answer he has reference to both events, and his language may be regarded as descriptive of both."
2. "All the wicked shall mourn at the prospect of their doom, Revelation 1:7. The cause of their wailing at the day of judgment will be chiefly that they have pierced, killed, rejected the Savior, and that they deserve the condemnation that is coming upon them, John 19:37; Zechariah 12:12."
3. "With power - Power, manifest in the destruction of Jerusalem, by the wonders that preceded it, and by the overturning of the temple and city. In the day of judgment, power manifest by consuming the material world 2 Peter 3:7, 2 Peter 3:10, 2 Peter 3:12; by raising the dead John 5:29-30; 1 Corinthians 15:52; by changing those who may be alive when he shall come - that is, making their bodies like those who have died, and who have been raised up 1 Thessalonians 4:17; 1 Corinthians 15:52; by bringing the affairs of the world to a close, receiving the righteous to heaven Matthew 25:34; 1 Corinthians 15:57, and sending the wicked, however numerous or however strong, down to hell, Matthew 25:41, Matthew 25:46; John 5:29."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Mourn [ÎºÎ¿ÏˆÎ¿Î½Ï„Î±Î¹] . Stronger : beat their breasts in anguish.


### John Calvin:
1. "The confused mixture of things which we now perceive does certainly, on the one hand, darken our minds, and, on the other hand, bury the grace of Christ, and make it almost vanish from our sight."
2. "Perceiving that the greater part of men would despise his doctrine and oppose his reign, he threatens also against all nations mourning and lamentation."
3. "He alludes, I think, to Zechariah 12:11, where God, informing them that a striking display of his judgment will soon be made, declares that there will be lamentation in every family, such as is not usually seen at the funeral of a first-born son."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The important matter is to recognize it when it comes, not to know in advance what it will be."
2. "All races and peoples shall join in one chorus, first of great and solemn lamentation ; not necessarily of real penitence, though that is not excluded, but rather of terror, occasioned by the events which have occurred and the foreboding of what is to follow."
3. "The safest opinion is, that a Personal coming of Christ is here meant, to take place after the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (Luke 21:24), and to be preceded by great catastrophes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The sign of the Son of Man in heaven...many theories have been suggested...Bruce sees a reference to Daniel 7:13 'one like the Son of man' and holds that Christ himself is the sign in question." 
2. "This is certainly possible. It is confirmed by the rest of the verse: 'They shall see the Son of man coming.'"
3. "The Jews had repeatedly asked for such a sign...as in Matthew 12:38; Matthew 16:1; John 2:18."

### John Gill:
1. "And then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven...not the sign of the cross appearing in the air, as it is said to do in the times of Constantine..."
2. "But the son of man himself: just as circumcision is called the sign of circumcision..."
3. "And it may be observed, that the other evangelists make no mention of the sign, only speak of the son of man..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven â€” It seems a little before he himself descends."
2. "The sun, moon, and stars being extinguished, (probably not those of our system only...)"
3. "The sign of the Son of man (perhaps the cross) will appear in the glory of the Lord."
