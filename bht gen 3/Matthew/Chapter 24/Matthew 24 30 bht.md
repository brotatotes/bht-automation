## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is quite uncertain what the sign shall be:‚Äîplainly, not the Son of Man Himself, nor any outward marks on His body."
2. "This is manifestly some sign in the Heavens, by which all shall know that the Son of Man is at hand."
3. "On the whole I think no sign completely answers the conditions, but that of the Cross."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sign of the Son of man - The ‚Äòevidence‚Äô that he is coming to destroy the city of Jerusalem. It is not to be denied, however, that this description is applicable also to his coming at the day of judgment."
2. "All the tribes of the earth mourn - That is, either all the ‚Äòtribes or people‚Äô of the land of Judea shall mourn at the great calamities coming upon them, or all the nations of the world shall wail when he comes to judgment."
3. "With power - Power, manifest in the destruction of Jerusalem, by the wonders that preceded it, and by the overturning of the temple and city."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Mourn [Œ∫ŒøœàŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ] . Stronger : beat their breasts in anguish.


### John Calvin:
1. "The confused mixture of things which we now perceive does certainly, on the one hand, darken our minds, and, on the other hand, bury the grace of Christ, and make it almost vanish from our sight."
2. "He threatens also against all nations mourning and lamentation; because it is proper, that by his presence he should crush and destroy the rebels, who, while he was absent, despised his authority."
3. "For it is no slight ground of offense to see the ungodly living without concern, because they think that their mockery of God will remain unpunished; and again, there is nothing to which we are more prone than to be captivated by the allurements of the prosperity which they enjoy, so as to lose the fear of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The important matter is to recognize it when it comes, not to know in advance what it will be."
2. "All races and peoples shall join in one chorus, first of great and solemn lamentation ; not necessarily of real penitence, though that is not excluded, but rather of terror, occasioned by the events which have occurred and the foreboding of what is to follow."
3. "The safest opinion is, that a Personal coming of Christ is here meant, to take place after the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (Luke 21:24), and to be preceded by great catastrophes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The sign of the Son of Man in heaven (œÑŒø œÉŒ∑ŒºŒµŒπŒøŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ œÖŒπŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÖ ŒµŒΩ ŒøœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩœâ). Many theories have been suggested like the cross in the sky, etc."
2. "Bruce sees a reference to Daniel 7:13 'one like the Son of man' and holds that Christ himself is the sign in question (the genitive of apposition). This is certainly possible."
3. "The Jews had repeatedly asked for such a sign (Broadus) as in Matthew 12:38; Matthew 16:1; John 2:18."

### John Gill:
1. "And then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven...but the son of man himself."
