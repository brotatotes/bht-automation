# Matthew 24:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the son of man comes, there will be a great sound of a trumpet, symbolizing the gathering of God's people. This is not the great Trumpet of the general Resurrection, but rather a summoning of Jehovah's people before their king. Like the blowing of trumpets in ancient times, this signal calls the hosts of Israel to march as to war, but in this case, it is a call to gather the scattered believers from all parts of the earth.
