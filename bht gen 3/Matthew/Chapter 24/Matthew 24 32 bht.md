# Matthew 24:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fig tree serves as a parable, its branches and leaves indicating the approaching summer. Just as the fig tree's shoots are broken off for grafting, the multitudes strewed branches for the Lord. The putting forth of leaves and fruit signifies the future revival of the Jewish people, contrasting with the cursed barren fig tree. Examining this natural phenomenon helps us discern the nearing destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world. Through the Church's afflictions, the Lord prepares his people for the coming immortal glory.
