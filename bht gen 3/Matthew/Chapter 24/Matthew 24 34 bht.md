# Matthew 24:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fig-tree's putting forth symbolizes the revival of the Jewish race that will not pass away until all is fulfilled. Generation means a race or family, not the present generation. The prophecy extends to the end of all things, not just the destruction of Jerusalem. Some argue that generation means a literal generation of 30 or 40 years, fulfilled by the destruction of Jerusalem, while others interpret it as a reference to the race and extend it to all believers. However, it is clear that the prophecy primarily pertains to the impending destruction of Jerusalem, fulfilled within about forty years.

- Attempt 3 BHT: The fig-tree's revival signifies the future of the Jewish race, which will endure until the fulfillment of all things. Generation in this context refers to a race or family of people, not the current generation. The continuous use of pass away suggests that the prophecy extends beyond the present generation and carries on to the end of all things. While some argue for a literal 30 or 40-year generation, fulfilled by the destruction of Jerusalem, others interpret it as a reference to the race and include all believers. Nonetheless, it is evident that the prophecy primarily relates to the forthcoming destruction of Jerusalem, which occurred within approximately forty years.
