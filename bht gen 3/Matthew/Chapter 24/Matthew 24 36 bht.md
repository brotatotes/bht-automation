# Matthew 24:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We must resist attempts to soften or explain away the truth that only the Father knows the day or hour when these things will come. Even Jesus, in His humility, did not know the precise time during His earthly life. This divine ignorance serves as a warning against our own chronological curiosity, reminding us to confine ourselves within the limits of God's Word. Let us submit to the same ignorance that the Son of God willingly endured. The exact time of the day and hour remains unknown to all, even the angels of heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All attempts to soften or explain away this weighty truth must be resisted."
2. "He knows it not as regards us, which, however well meant, is a mere evasion."
3. "In the course of humiliation undertaken by the Son, in which He increased in wisdom, learned obedience, uttered desires in prayer, this matter was hidden from Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But of that day and hour - Of the precise time of the fulfillment."
2. "The 'general signs' of its approach have been given, as the budding of the fig-tree is a certain indication that summer is near; but 'the precise time' is not indicated by these things."
3. "He now replies to them by saying that the precise time would not be foretold."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought therefore to be on our guard, lest our anxiety about the time be carried farther than the Lord allows; for the chief part of our wisdom lies in confining ourselves soberly within the limits of Godâ€™s word."
2. "And surely that man must be singularly mad, who would hesitate to submit to the ignorance which even the Son of God himself did not hesitate to endure on our account."
3. "For, first, it is prodigious folly to assert that the ignorance which is ascribed to angels proceeds from sin; but they discover themselves to be equally foolish on another ground, by not perceiving that Christ clothed himself with our flesh, for the purpose of enduring the punishment due to our sins."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ did not know the day and hour of His future coming since Matthew 24:37 shows that this is referred to."
2. "This seems to be a voluntary self-humiliation in knowledge, a part of Christâ€™s emptying of Himself."
3. "His voluntarily not knowing, or â€˜sacred unwillingness to know,â€™ the day of judgment during the days of His flesh, is a warning against chronological curiosity and mathematical calculation in the exposition of Scripture prophecy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not even the Son... But the Father only." 
2. "No one but the Father knows the day or the hour when these things will come to pass." 
3. "It is just as easy to attribute ignorance to modern scholars with their various theories as to Jesus who admits his ignorance of the date, but not of the character of the coming."

### John Gill:
1. "...the exact and precise time was not known...of the day and hour no man knows..."
2. "...those who have lived since, and were eyewitnesses of it, are not agreed on what day of the month it was..."
3. "...no, not the angels of heaven...nor the son...but my Father only..."

### John Wesley:
1. "But of that day â€” The day of judgment; Knoweth no man" 
2. "Not while our Lord was on earth"
3. "Yet it might be afterward revealed to St. John consistently with this"
