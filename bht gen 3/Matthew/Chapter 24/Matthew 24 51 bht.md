## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression here is perhaps not without a symbolical reference also to that dreadful sundering of the conscience and practice which shall be the reflective torment of the condemned."
2. "By the mingling and confounding of which only is the anomalous life of the wilful sinner made in this world tolerable."
3. "The punishment of cutting, or sawing asunder: see Dan. ii. 5; iii. 29: Sus. ver. 59: see also Heb. iv. 12; xi. 37."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A fearful separating of the conscience and the conduct, so that the condemning power of the former is a constant scourge against the continued evil of the latter."
2. "Unfaithfulness, especially in the ministry, will suffer the worst punishment."
3. "The future punishment is of the same character for all, even though there be degrees of it."

### John Gill:
1. "He shall separate soul and body by death; he shall take away all his gifts and talents from him; and remove him from his place and office, and from the church of God, and communion of the saints, and out of this world."
2. "Some think the allusion is to the cutting up of the sacrifices, and dividing them into pieces; and the sense is, that this wicked servant should have no share in the sacrifice of Christ; but should fall himself a victim to divine justice, and be used as sacrifices were; or, in other words, be severely punished for his sins."
3. "Such as make a profession of him, and have only a form of godliness, without the power of it, and are wicked and hypocritical men, will share the same fate with those that believe not; and the portion of these is the lake which burns with fire and brimstone."

### John Wesley:
1. "The worst of sinners, as upright and sincere as he was once."
2. "No hypocrisy can be baser than to call ourselves ministers of Christ, while we are the slaves of avarice, ambition, or sensuality."
