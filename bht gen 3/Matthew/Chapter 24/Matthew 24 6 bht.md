# Matthew 24:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be watchful for the wars and rumours of wars, but do not be scared out of your wits by them. The prophecy must be interpreted in relation to the threats of war against the Jews and the commotions throughout the empire, rather than being a cause of terror. It is a prediction of unexampled convulsions before the second coming of Christ, but not an immediate end. The end is not yet, but these events serve as a reminder to stay vigilant and not be led astray.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
