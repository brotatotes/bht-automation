3. "[See the note at the end of the chapter.]"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Besides being inconsistent with the general tenor of such language, and particularly the solemn moral of the whole (Matthew 7:23- :), it is a kind of criticism which tampers with some of the most awful warnings regarding the future."
2. "If it be asked why unworthy guests were admitted to the marriage of the King's Son, in a former parable, and the foolish virgins are excluded in this one, we may answer... that those festivities are celebrated in this life, in the Church militant; these at the last day, in the Church triumphant."
3. "To those, even they are admitted who are not adorned with the wedding garment; but to these, only they to whom it is granted to be arrayed in fine linen clean and white, which is the righteousness of saints."

2. "Applied to professing Christians, having only a profession of religion, but no real piety, it means, I do not know or acknowledge you as Christians."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Verily I say unto you, I know you not; which must be understood in consistence with the omniscience of Christ: he knew their persons, conduct, and state; he knew they were foolish virgins, graceless professors..."
2. "...he never knew them to believe in him, or love him; nor ever exalt his person, blood and sacrifice..."
