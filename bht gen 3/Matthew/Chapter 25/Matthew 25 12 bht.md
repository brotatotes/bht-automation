# Matthew 25:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable teaches that being admitted to the wedding feast requires not only faith, but also true righteousness, symbolized by the wedding garment. The phrase I know you not does not imply lack of knowledge, but rather lack of approval and acknowledgment. Those who are admitted to the feast have been chosen and loved by Christ, whereas the foolish virgins were graceless professors who made no account of Him. Their exclusion serves as a consequence of their negligence and absence of genuine faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Observe here, I know you not is very different, as the whole circumstances are different, from 'I never knew you,' in ch. vii. 23..."
2. "...where the 'Depart from me' binds it to our ver. 41, and to the time of the final judgment, spoken of in that parable."
3. "[See the note at the end of the chapter.]"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If it be asked why unworthy guests were admitted to the marriage of the King's Son, in a former parable, and the foolish virgins are excluded in this one, we may answer, in the admirable words of GERHARD, quoted by TRENCH, that those festivities are celebrated in this life, in the Church militant; these at the last day, in the Church triumphant."
2. "To those, even they are admitted who are not adorned with the wedding garment; but to these, only they to whom it is granted to be arrayed in fine linen clean and white, which is the righteousness of saints."
3. "To those, men are called by the trumpet of the Gospel; to these by the trumpet of the Archangel; to those, who enters may go out from them, or be cast out; who is once introduced to these never goes out, nor is cast out, from them any more: wherefore it is said, 'The door is shut.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I know you not - You were not in the company of those who attended me to the marriage-feast, and are unknown to me."
2. "Applied to professing Christians, having only a profession of religion, but no real piety, it means, I do not know or acknowledge you as Christians."
3. "The word 'know' is often used in the sense of approving, loving, acknowledging as real friends and followers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I know you not." 
2. "The refusal is definite and apparently final."
3. "The lesson respects the blessedness of endurance unto the end, of keeping the light bright for the coming of the Bridegroom, however delayed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I know you not (Î¿Ï…Îº Î¿Î¹Î´Î± Ï…Î¼Î±Ï‚). Hence there was no reason for special or unusual favours to be granted them."
2. "They must abide the consequences of their own negligence."

### John Gill:
1. "Verily I say unto you, I know you not; which must be understood in consistence with the omniscience of Christ: he knew their persons, conduct, and state; he knew they were foolish virgins, graceless professors, who had made no account of him and his righteousness."
2. "They were none of the people whom he foreknew, or knew as his own, and loved with an everlasting love; he never knew them as his father's choice in him, or as his father's gift to him; he never knew them in the everlasting covenant, or as his sheep, for whom he died."
3. "He never knew them to believe in him, or love him; nor ever exalt his person, blood and sacrifice, at his table, nor do any good work with a single eye to his glory; he never approved of them, liked their persons, or their conduct; or ever owned them as the true companions, either of his bride, or of himself."
