## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We have this parable and the preceding one alluded to in very few words by Mark xiii. 34â€“36."
2. "In it we have the active side of the Christian life, and its danger, set before us, as in the last the contemplative side."
3. "The parable is still concerned with Christians (his own servants), and not the world at large."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the kingdom of heaven is as a manâ€”The ellipsis is better supplied by our translators in the corresponding passage of Mark...[For the Son of man is] as a man."
2. "Between master and slaves this was not uncommon in ancient times. Christ's 'servants' here mean all who, by their Christian profession, stand in the relation to Him of entire subjection."
3. "His 'goods' mean all their gifts and endowments, whether original or acquired, natural or spiritual...Christ has a claim to everything which belongs to His people, everything which may be turned to good, and He demands its appropriation to His service."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the parable is to teach that those who improve their talents or faculties in the cause of religion...shall be proportionally rewarded."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The kingdom of heaven is as when."
2. "This Parable of the Talents is quite similar to the Parable of the Pounds in Luke 19:11-28, but they are not variations of the same story."
3. "Some scholars credit Jesus with very little versatility."

### John Gill:
1. "For [the kingdom of heaven] is as a man travelling... this man is said to travel into a far country; by which heaven is designed."
2. "By 'his own servants' are meant... ministers of the word, who are eminently the servants of Christ, his own..."
3. "And delivered unto them his goods; the Gospel, that rich treasure of divine truths, the dispensation of it, and gifts to preach it; all which are Christ's goods and his gifts, and not man's."
