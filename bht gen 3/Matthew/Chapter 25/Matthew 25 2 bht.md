## BHT:
In this section, the distinction between the wise and the foolish virgins is not about being good or bad, but rather about their level of goodwill towards the truth and their readiness for Christ's return.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are not distinguished into good and bad, as TRENCH observes, but into 'wise' and 'foolish'â€”just as in those who reared their house for eternity are distinguished into 'wise' and 'foolish builders'; because in both cases a certain degree of goodwill towards the truth is assumed."
2. "To make anything of the equal number of both classes would, we think, be precarious, save to warn us how large a portion of those who, up to the last, so nearly resemble those that love Christ's appearing will be disowned by Him when He comes."
3. "Warn us how large a portion of those who, up to the last, so nearly resemble those that love Christ's appearing will be disowned by Him when He comes."

### John Calvin:
1. "Towards the close of the former chapter, our Lord specially required steward to be wise... But now he demands wisdom from all the children of God in general..." 
2. "But now he demands wisdom from all the children of God in general, that they may not, through inconsiderate rashness, expose themselves to be the prey of Satan." 
3. "Now this kind of wisdom he describes by saying, that they are to provide themselves with the supplies necessary for completing the course of their life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 25:2. And five of them were foolish, etc. This equal division may have a meaning. The correct order is transposed in the common version.
	


### John Gill:
1. "The wise virgins are such, who are wise, not in their own conceits, which is the case of natural men, and empty professors; nor in the things of nature, or in the things of the world... but they are such who are wise unto salvation."
2. "The fools went in before him, as they were, filthy: the king rejoiced at meeting the wise, and was angry at meeting the foolish; and ordered, that those who had adorned themselves for the feast should sit and eat, and those that had not adorned themselves for the feast should stand."
3. "The number of wise and foolish virgins being equal, does not imply that there will be just the same number of nominal, as of real believers in the churches, in the latter day, a little before the coming of Christ; only that there will be a large number of such among them."
