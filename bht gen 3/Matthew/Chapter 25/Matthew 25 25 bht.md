# Matthew 25:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The servant in the parable was condemned because of his pretended fear and insolent speech, which betrayed his false answer. He claimed that he preserved the talent, but in truth, he failed to improve it. This excuse of fear was not valid, as it was merely an excuse for his own misimprovement of the gift. The servant's wickedness was in doing nothing for his master, not in doing anything against him. It is a reminder that it is not enough to retain what is given, it must be actively used and improved.
