# Matthew 25:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you truly believed that I was such a demanding master, then why didn't you at least invest my money to avoid ruin? Your laziness and refusal to act show your wickedness and slothfulness. You had the opportunity to make use of what I gave you with minimal effort, but you chose to neglect it. This questioning tone in the Lord's response highlights the sarcasm and emphasizes the servant's wickedness and slothfulness. It serves as a reminder that God judges not just for doing wrong, but also for failing to do what is right.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Did you truly believe that I was such a demanding master? If you truly thought that of me, then you should have at least invested my money to avoid complete ruin.
