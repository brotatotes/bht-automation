# Matthew 25:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This servant's negligence is evident as he did not make any effort to increase his master's wealth. He had the opportunity to invest with the exchangers but chose to bury the money instead. We must be cautious not to make excuses for our own inaction, as the servant's excuse was insufficient to justify his lack of effort. Let us learn from his mistake and be diligent in our service to God, avoiding laziness and indifference.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If thou hadst really been afraid, &c., slothful as thou art, thou mightest at least, without trouble to thyself, have provided that I should have not been defrauded of the interest of my money‚Äîbut now thou art both slothful and wicked, in having done me this injustice."
2. "Observe there would have been no praise due to the servant‚Äîbut 'that which is mine' would not have lost its increase."
3. "The machinery of religious and charitable societies in our day is very much in the place of the exchangers. Let the subscribers to them take heed that they be not in the degraded case of this servant, even if his excuse had been genuine."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 27. thou oughtest therefore to have
	put my money to the exchangers‚Äîthe bankers. 
	
and then at my coming I
	should have received mine own with usury‚Äîinterest.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The exchangers were persons who were in the habit of borrowing money...to be loaned to others at a higher interest." 
2. "This money was left with the servant...but since he was too indolent for that, he ought at least to have loaned it to the exchangers, that his master might have received some benefit from it." 
3. "The word 'usury,' in our language, has a bad signification...This was contrary to the law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Put [Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒµŒπŒΩ] . Lit., throw or fling down, as one would throw a bag of coin upon the exchanger's table."
2. "Exchangers [œÑœÅŒ±œÄŒµŒ∂ŒπœÑŒ±ŒπœÇ] . Taking their name from the table or counter at which they sat [œÑœÅŒ±œÄŒµŒ∂Œ±] . The Jewish bankers bore precisely the same name."
3. "Usury [œÑŒøŒ∫œâ] . A very graphic word, meaning first childbirth, and then offspring. Hence of interest, which is the product or offspring of capital."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "My money. The trust demanded this."
2. "To the bankers; the Greek word has the same etymology as the English one. These probably represent stronger spiritual characters who would have quickened his spirituality."
3. "The theory of Christianity is, that laboring for Christ is not a matter of bargain, but of loving, interested service. When the servant came with a false plea of returning to the master what was justly his, he was condemned on his own showing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His very words of excuse convict him. It was a necessity that he did not see."
2. "The bankers, money-changers, brokers, who exchanged money for a fee and who paid interest on money."
3. "Compound interest at six per cent doubles the principal every twenty years. It is amazing how rapidly that piles up if one carries it on for centuries and millenniums."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers... who were so called from the table that stood before them, on which they told, and paid their money, and the exchange and use." 
2. "Hence all the Oriental versions here read, 'thou shouldest have put my money to, or on the table'; put it into the hand of these bankers, where it would have been not only safe, as in the earth, where it was hid, but also would have made some increase, and would have been returned with profit."
3. "This is said not so much to encourage usury, though it may be lawful; and it seems to have been a practice in those times to put money out to use upon a reasonable interest; but to reprove the sloth and inactivity of this servant, upon his own reasonings, and the character he had given of his master."

### John Wesley:
1. Thou oughtest therefore ‚Äî On that very account, on thy own supposition, to have improved my talent, as far as was possible.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse highlights the negligence of a servant who failed to make any effort to increase his master's money. Despite having the opportunity to invest it with the exchangers, who were similar to bankers, the servant chose to bury it instead.

Just as this servant's excuse was insufficient to justify his inaction, we too must be cautious not to make excuses for our own laziness or indifference when it comes to serving God and others.
