# Matthew 25:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Trusting that the light, once burning, would ever burn, those who were foolish made no provision for the strengthening of the inner man by watchfulness and prayer. They took their lamps, but took no oil with them. The grace of the Spirit, compared to oil, is of an holy and sanctifying nature. However, the foolish took no oil with them, leaving no means to supply their future want or to recruit their lamp's decay. The lamp is faith, and a lamp with oil is faith working by love.
