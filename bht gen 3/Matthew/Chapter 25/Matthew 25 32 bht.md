## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression all the nations implies all the nations of the world, as distinguished from the elect already gathered to Him."
2. "Among these are 'the other sheep which He has, not of this fold.'"
3. "The sheep are those referred to in Rom. ii. 7, 10; the goats in ib. vv. 8, 9, where this same judgment according to works is spoken of."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That this should be understood to mean the heathen nations, or all except believers in Christ, will seem amazing to any simple reader." 
2. "But here we may just say, that if this scene does not describe a personal, public, final judgment on men, according to the treatment they have given to Christ‚Äîand consequently men within the Christian pale‚Äîwe shall have to consider again whether our Lord's teaching on the greatest themes of human interest does indeed possess that incomparable simplicity and transparency of meaning which, by universal consent, has been ascribed to it." 
3. "And he shall separate them‚Äînow for the first time; the two classes having been mingled all along up to this awful moment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "At his coming to judgment the world will be burned up, 2 Peter 3:10, 2 Peter 3:12; Revelation 20:11."
2. "The dead in Christ...will be raised up from their graves, 1 Thessalonians 4:16."
3. "Then shall the world be judged, the righteous saved, and the wicked punished."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Separate them [Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖœÇ]. Masculine, while the word nations is neuter. Nations are regarded as gathered collectively; but in contemplating the act of separation the Lord regards the individuals."
2. "The bald division of men into sheep and goats is, in one sense, so easy as not to be worth performing; and in another sense it is so hard as only to be possible for something with supernatural insight."
3. "Goats are an appropriate figure, because the goat was regarded as a comparatively worthless animal. Hence the point of the elder son's complaint in the parable of the Prodigal: Not so much as a kid (Luke 14:29). The diminutive [ŒµœÅŒπœÜŒπŒ±] expresses contempt."

### John Calvin:
1. "For they were satisfied with this single consideration, that their nation was delivered from the miseries with which it was then oppressed, so that it would be manifest that God had not in vain established his covenant with Abraham and his posterity."
2. "Again, in order to persuade believers to holiness of life, he assures them that the good and the bad will not share alike; because he will bring with him the reward which is laid up for both."
3. "The comparison appears to be borrowed from Ezekiel 34:18, where the Lord complains of the fierceness of the goats, which attack with their horns the poor sheep, and destroy the pastures, and pollute the water; and where the Lord expressly declares that he will take vengeance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whether voluntarily or involuntarily is not stated; but all submit."
2. "Christ is really the Shepherd of all mankind."
3. "Together in the pasture, they are now divided."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is a majestic picture with which to close the series of parables about readiness for the second coming. Here is the program when he does come." 
2. "But the doubt is most wanton. Where is the second brain that could have invented anything so original and so sublime as vv. Matthew 25:35-40; Matthew 25:42-45?" 
3. "The shepherd stands at the gate and taps the sheep to go to the right and the goats to the left."

### John Gill:
1. "This collection of them before Christ, the righteous judge, will be made by the holy angels, who will come with him for this purpose..."
2. "But then the judge, who is of quick understanding, will easily discern the one from the other... he will as easily separate the one from the other, and more so, than any shepherd, among men, can part a flock consisting of sheep and goats."
3. "Hypocrites in Zion shall now be no more, nor sinners stand any longer in the congregation of the righteous, nor both together as one body, and on one side in judgment."
