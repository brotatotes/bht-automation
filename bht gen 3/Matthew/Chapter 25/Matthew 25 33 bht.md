	his right hand‚Äîthe side of honor (1 Kings 2:19;
	Psalms 45:9; Psalms 110:1,
	&amp;c.). 
	
but the goats on the left‚Äîthe
	side consequently of dishonor.

3. "The left hand. This was the place of dishonor, denoting condemnation."

3. "But how unlikely that, in this great picture, believers should be excluded, when the term ‚Äòsheep‚Äô is appropriated to them so often."
