When the righteous respond to the Judge in hesitation, they are expressing doubt about His ability to accurately assess their good deeds, not out of ignorance but because this understanding has not been deeply impressed upon them.

This episode emphasizes that only those with the righteousness of Christ imputed to them will be at His right hand, highlighting the different estimation the righteous and the Judge have of their own works.
