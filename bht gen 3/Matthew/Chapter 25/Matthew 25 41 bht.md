# Matthew 25:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On judgment day, all salvation comes from God, while self-condemnation prevails. The meticulous judgment examines individual actions and intentions, revealing the neglect of showing kindness and compassion to the poor. Those on the left hand who turn away from Jesus are sternly reprimanded, banished from His presence, and sent to everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. The punishment is just, for even the absence of good works and love is enough to exclude from heaven. This warns all to earnestly strive for salvation and to avoid being cast away from God's loving presence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "all man's salvation is of Godâ€”all his condemnation from himself."
2. "there is election to lifeâ€”but there is no reprobation to death: a book of Lifeâ€”but no book of Death; no hell for manâ€”because the blood of Jesus hath purchased life for all"
3. "The repetition of all these particulars shews how exact even for every individual the judgment will be."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As for you on the left hand, ye did nothing for Me. I came to you also, but ye knew Me not: ye had neither warm affections nor kind deeds to bestow upon Me: I was as one despised in your eyes."
2. "But thus ye treated these little ones that believe in Me and now stand on My right hand. In the disguise of these poor members of Mine I came soliciting your pity, but ye shut up your bowels of compassion from Me: I asked relief, but ye had none to give Me."
3. "Take back therefore your own coldness, your own contemptuous distance: Ye bid Me away from your presence, and now I bid you from Mineâ€”Depart from Me, ye cursed!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To curse" is the opposite of "to bless." It implies a negation of all the blessings of heaven, and a positive infliction of eternal sufferings.
2. "The fact that the wicked will be eternally punished, cursed of God, should awe every spirit, and lead every man to strive most earnestly to secure his salvation."
3. "There is a remarkable difference between the manner in which the righteous will be addressed, and the wicked. Christ will say to the one that the kingdom was prepared for them; to the other, that the fire was not prepared for 'them,' but for another race of beings."

### John Calvin:
1. "He threatens, therefore, that he will come as their Judge, and that he will make them forget those luxurious enjoyments to which they are now so entirely devoted."
2. "We are therefore taught how desirable it is to be united to the Son of God; because everlasting destruction and the torment of the flesh await all those whom he will drive from his presence at the last day."
3. "But now Christ says, that hell is prepared for the devil, that wicked men may not entertain the belief that they will be able to escape it, when they hear that they are involved in the same punishment with the devil, who, it is certain, was long ago sentenced and condemned to hell, without any hope of deliverance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The punishment on those 'accursed' is a just one, that they go to torment prepared for the devil and his angels, because they have prepared themselves for it." 
2. "The word eternal means never-ending, scarcely admits of a doubt; it is used in Matthew 25:46 of the life of the righteous."
3. "Only sins of omission are mentioned; the absence of good works, the destitution of love, or the dominion of selfishness is sufficient, even without positive crimes, to exclude from heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "they are bid to be gone from him; they are banished his presence, which is what is commonly called the punishment of loss; the loss of the presence of God, Father, Son, and Spirit, angels, and saints".
2. "by which is meant, the wrath of God; and the phrase expresses the intolerable fierceness of it, and its perpetual continuance; the sense of which, without intermission, will ever be felt in the conscience; and is the punishment of sense, the wicked will for ever endure"
3. "showing, that the same punishment will be inflicted on hypocrites and carnal professors, as on the devils themselves"

### John Wesley:
1. Depart into the everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels â€” Not originally for you: you are intruders into everlasting fire.

- Attempt 1 BHT: On the day of judgment, all salvation will come from God, while condemnation will arise from within oneself. The judgment will be meticulous, examining each individual's actions and intentions. Those who neglected to show kindness and compassion to the poor and needy will be sternly reprimanded and ultimately cast away from the presence of God. The punishment pronounced upon them is eternal, a total negation of blessings and the imposition of endless suffering. This fate is not God's desired destiny for humanity, for His original plan was the preparation of a kingdom for the righteous. The eternal torment that awaits the wicked is a just consequence of their rejection of the needy and their lack of love and good works. They will be banished from the presence of God and thrown into everlasting fire, a place initially not intended for them but for the devil and his angels. This serves as a solemn warning for all to strive earnestly for salvation and to avoid the fate of being cast away from the loving presence of God.
