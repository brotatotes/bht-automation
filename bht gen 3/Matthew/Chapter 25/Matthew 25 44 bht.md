# Matthew 25:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The self-righteous plea of ignorance is a deceitful fancy that many entertain, thinking they would do good to Christ had they seen Him. However, they fail to recognize Him in the person of His followers and thus continue to despise the poor. Their vain excuses will be of no use on the day of retribution, as they will realize, too late, that those they now despise are esteemed by Christ. These nominal Christians make a profession of Christ but have never truly seen Him in such circumstances.

### John Wesley:
1. Then will they answer â€” So the endeavour to justify themselves, will remain with the wicked even to that day!
