## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The thought of the foolish virgins is very different from that of the wicked servant: hisâ€” â€˜there will be plenty of time, my Lord tarrieth;'â€”theirs, â€˜surely He will soon be here, there is no need of a store of oil.â€™"
2. "I believe no more is meant here than that all, being weak by nature, gave way to drowsiness: as indeed the wakefulness of the holiest Christian, compared with what it should be, is a sort of slumber."
3. "Some understand this verse of sleep in death. But, not to mention that this will not fit the machinery of the parable (see below on ver. 8), it would assume (they all) that none of the faithful would be living on earth when the Lord comes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ 'tarries,' among other reasons, to try the faith and patience of His people."
2. "The world 'slept' is the usual word for lying down to sleep, denoting two stages of spiritual declensionâ€”first, that half-involuntary lethargy or drowsiness which is apt to steal over one who falls into inactivity; and then a conscious, deliberate yielding to it, after a little vain resistance."
3. "Such was the state alike of the wise and the foolish virgins, even till the cry of the Bridegroom's approach awoke them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The bridegroom tarried - That is, while they waited for him. It was uncertain at what time he would come. He delayed longer than they expected."
2. "All slumbered and slept - Waiting until near midnight, they fell into repose. This circumstance is not to be pressed to prove that all Christians will be asleep, or cold and careless, when the Lord Jesus shall come."
3. "This circumstance is designed simply to show more clearly the 'duty of being ready,' Matthew 25:13. It does not mean to affirm it 'as a fact' that none will be ready."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Slumbered is, literally, nodded."
2. "Nodded is aorist, denoting a transient act, the initial stage of slumber."
3. "Slept is imperfect, of continuous slumber."

### John Calvin:
1. "There would be greater probability in explaining it to denote death, which overtakes believers before the coming of Christ; for it is not at that time only that we must look for salvation, but also when we have left the world and are sleeping in Christ."
2. "But I take it more simply as denoting earthly occupations, in which believers must be engaged, so long as they dwell in the body;"
3. "For they cannot be so constantly occupied with the thought of meeting Christ, as not to be distracted, or retarded, or entangled by a variety of cares, in consequence of which, while they watch, they are partly asleep."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All slumbered and slept. Sleep overcame them, even while trying to keep awake. This probably refers to a gradual forgetfulness of, or ceasing to expect at once, the coming of Christ."
2. "It indicates an unconscious giving way to the influence of the world."
3. "Christâ€™s coming will be unexpected by all, even by those who make calculations about it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They all slumbered and slept."
2. "They dropped off to sleep, nodded and then went on sleeping."
3. "A vivid picture drawn by the difference in the two tenses."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason why he tarries is, because his time is not come, and there are many things to be done first."
2. "They all slumbered and slept: which is not to be understood as if that one only slumbered, and the other slept, but both these are spoken of them all."
3. "The causes of it are a body of sin; an anxious care of the world; a being weary of spiritual exercises, and a leaving them off; abstaining from an awakening ministry, and spiritual conversation; and keeping company with sleepy and slothful professors, or the men of the world."

### John Wesley:
1. "While the bridegroom delayed â€” That is, before they were called to attend him, they all slumbered and slept - Were easy and quiet..." 
2. "the wise enjoying a true, the foolish a false peace."
