# Matthew 25:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The folly of the foolish virgins was in not making provision against the oil's exhaustion, by taking an oil-vessel to replenish their lamp. The real difference between the prepared and unprepared is the possession of an enduring principle of spiritual life. The former keeps their lamps trimmed by putting fresh oil and removing any hindrances, while the latter relies on their fellow virgins and only makes superficial preparations. Despite their awakenings of conscience, the foolish virgins were destitute of the oil of grace.

2. "The foolish virgins also arose; which may intend some awakenings of conscience, and reformation of life, and a more diligent attendance on duties and ordinances; all which they did to make them meet for Christ, and to obtain salvation; but after all it appears, they were destitute of the oil of grace."
3. "The former [wise virgins] by removing what hindered the clear burning of them; by casting off the works of darkness, and causing the light of good works to shine before men, in the discharge of them, from a principle of grace; and chiefly by applying to Christ for fresh supplies of the oil of grace, to fill their lamps, revive their light and heat, and keep them burning: and the latter [foolish virgins], only by a few outward decorations, and external performances; to make their outward profession of religion look as bright as possibly they could."

### John Wesley:
1. They trimmed their lamps â€” They examined themselves and prepared to meet their God.
