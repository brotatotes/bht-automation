# Matthew 25:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The foolish virgins found themselves lacking oil for their lamps, and although they pleaded for the wise virgins to share, it was simply not possible. Each individual can only have as much of God's provision as will meet their own needs. The time for obtaining the oil had passed, and there would not be enough for both parties. This serves as a reminder that we must not neglect the opportunity to seek the necessary provisions for our spiritual journey, as there may come a time when it is too late to obtain them.

"saints have a large abundance of grace communicated to them; some have more, others less; at least it so appears, as to exercise; but they that have the most, have none to spare, and see their need of more; and ask for more, being sensible that present grace in them, is not sufficient for time to come, but grace in Christ only"
3. "directing them to go to proper persons for grace; not to men, even ministers of the Gospel, nor to angels; but to God the Father, the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, who sits on a throne of grace, and gives it liberally to them that come to him for it through Christ, and ask it of him; and to Christ the mediator, who is full of grace and truth, and counsels persons to buy of him gold tried in the fire, grace more precious than the purest gold; and to the Spirit of grace, who gives it to all severally as he will"

3. "The time is past and returns no more!"

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The foolish virgins were clearly in a desperate situation, as they realized too late that they did not have enough oil to keep their lamps burning. They pleaded with the wise virgins to share their oil, but it was simply not possible. Each person can only have as much of God's provision as will supply their own needs; it is not something that can be shared or given away. The wise virgins understood this and refused to sell their oil, explaining that if they were to share it, both would be undone. While it may seem unkind or uncaring, this refusal was a necessary reminder of the proper way of obtaining the needed and precious oil. The foolish virgins had missed their opportunity to acquire it and now had to face the consequences of their neglect. The Greek language used in this passage reflects the certainty that there would not be enough for both parties, using double negatives to emphasize the impossibility of the situation. The time for obtaining the oil had passed, and now they had to face the reality that there was simply not enough. This serves as a reminder that we must not neglect the opportunity to seek and acquire the necessary provisions for our spiritual journey, as there may come a time when it is too late to obtain them.
