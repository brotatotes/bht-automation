# Matthew 26:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples inquire about the preparations for the Passover meal, given that the removal of leaven, slaughtering of the lamb, and the arrangement of the room were necessary. This shows their intention to follow the regular Passover meal at the customary time. Jesus, in his adherence to the Law, chose to observe the Passover on the day before the Sabbath, ensuring that he did not transgress any ordinances and subject himself to slanderous accusations. The disciples' question implies that the Passover meal was traditionally celebrated in Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The putting away leaven from the houses was of the work of the day, and the eating of the unleavened bread actually commenced in the evening."
2. "The â€˜making readyâ€™ would include the following particulars; the ration of the guest-chamber itself (which however in this case was already done, see Mark xiv. 15 and note);â€”the lamb already kept up from the 10th (Exod. xii. 3) had to be slain in the fore-court of the temple (2 Chron. xxxv. 5);â€”the unleavened bread, bitter herbs, &c., prepared;â€”and the room arranged."
3. "This report does not represent the whole that passed: it was the Lord who sent the two disciples; and in reply this enquiry was made (Luke)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now if it was the custom, at that time, to join two festivals in one, (as the Jews themselves admit, and as their ancient writings prove,) it is a highly probable conjecture that Christ, who celebrated the passover on the day before the Sabbath, observed the day prescribed by the Law."
2. "Having determined to be subject to the Law, that he might deliver us from its yoke, he did not forget this subjection at his latest hour; and therefore he would rather have chosen to omit an outward ceremony, than to transgress the ordinance which God had appointed, and thus lay himself open to the slanders of wicked men."
3. "Hence it follows that Christ, in departing from the ordinary custom, attempted nothing contrary to the Law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On the first day of unleavened bread. The 14th of Nisan, when the leaven was removed."
2. "The disciples. It is probable that they came with the intention of inquiring on this point."
3. "The householder kept the lamb from the 10th day of the month; he presented it in the temple, 'between the evenings,' i.e., between three and six o'clock in the afternoon of the fourteenth, himself slew it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either name was employed. Here the passover meal is meant, though in John 18:28 it is probable that the passover feast is referred to as the passover meal (the last supper) had already been observed."
2. "My view is that the five passages in John (John 13:1; John 13:27; John 18:28; John 19:14; John 19:31) rightly interpreted agree with the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 26:17; Matthew 26:20; Mark 14:12; Mark 14:17; Luke 22:7; Luke 22:14) that Jesus ate the passover meal at the regular time about 6 P.M. beginning of 15 Nisan."
3. "The question of the disciples here assumes that they are to observe the regular passover meal."

### John Gill:
1. "The time of killing the passover was after the middle of the day; and it is said that 'if they killed it before the middle of the day it was not right; and they did not kill it till after the evening sacrifice, and after they had offered the evening incense; and after they had trimmed the lamps, they began to slay the passovers, or paschal lambs, unto the end of the day; and if they slayed after the middle of the day, before the evening sacrifice, it was right.'" 
2. "The reason of this was, because the lamb was to be slain between the two evenings; the first of which began at noon, as soon as ever the day declined."
3. "The disciples having received such an order from their master, inquire not in what town or city they must prepare the passover, for that was always ate in Jerusalem."

### John Wesley:
1. On the first day of unleavened bread â€” Being Thursday, the fourteenth day of the first month, Exodus 12:6,15. Mark 14:12; Luke 22:7
