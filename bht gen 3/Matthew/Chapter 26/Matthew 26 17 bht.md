## BHT:
On the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples, Peter and John, came to Jesus to inquire about the Passover meal, as they were the only ones aware of Judas's betrayal.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If this night had been the ordinary time of sacrificing the Passover, the day preceding would not indeed have been strictly the first day of unleavened bread; but there is reason to suppose that it was accounted so."
2. "The â€˜making readyâ€™ would include the following particulars; the ration of the guest-chamber itself...the lamb already kept up from the 10th had to be slain in the fore-court of the temple...the unleavened bread, bitter herbs, &c., prepared;â€”and the room arranged."
3. "This report does not represent the whole that passed: it was the Lord who sent the two disciples; and in reply this enquiry was made."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is beyond a doubt that Christ was put to death on the day before the Sabbath; for he was hastily buried before sunset in a sepulcher which was at hand."
2. "Now if it was the custom, at that time, to join two festivals in one, it is a highly probable conjecture that Christ...observed the day prescribed by the Law."
3. "Having determined to be subject to the Law, that he might deliver us from its yoke, he did not forget this subjection at his latest hour."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On the first day of unleavened bread."
2. "The householder kept the lamb from the 10th day of the month; he presented it in the temple, 'between the evenings,' i.e., between three and six o'clock in the afternoon of the fourteenth, himself slew it."
3. "The householder then removed the skin and fat from the lamb; the latter was burned on the altar by the priest, the former was carried home bound about the lamb."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There were two feasts rolled into one, the passover feast and the feast of unleavened bread."
2. "My view is that the five passages in John rightly interpreted agree with the Synoptic Gospels that Jesus ate the passover meal at the regular time about 6 P.M. beginning of 15 Nisan."
3. "According to this view Jesus ate the passover meal at the regular time and died on the cross the afternoon of 15 Nisan."

### John Gill:
1. "The disciples came to Jesus; that is, Peter and John, as may be learnt from Luke 22:8, for these only seem to have had any notion of Judas's betraying Christ, from what had been said at the supper in Bethany, two days before; the rest thought he was gone to prepare for the feast, and therefore were under no concern about it; but these two judged otherwise, and therefore came to Christ to know his mind concerning it."
2. "The disciples having received such an order from their master, inquire not in what town or city they must prepare the passover, for that was always ate in Jerusalem; see Deuteronomy 16:5, where they were obliged, by the Jewish canon k, to lodge that night."
3. "They inquire in what house he would have it got ready; for they might make use of any house, and the furniture of it, where they could find room, and conveniency, without any charge."

### John Wesley:
1. On the first day of unleavened bread â€” Being Thursday, the fourteenth day of the first month, Exodus 12:6,15. Mark 14:12; Luke 22:7
