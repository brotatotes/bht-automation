# Matthew 26:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord, in virtue of His knowledge and command of circumstances, spoke of a man who would not necessarily be a disciple but would fulfill the Evangelist's description. By directing His disciples to go into the city, Jesus prevented Judas from knowing the location in time to betray Him. This evidence of prescience would support the disciples' faith when they saw Him weakened. The Lord's cheerful readiness to fulfill the Father's appointment was evident in His repetition of the nearness of His death.
