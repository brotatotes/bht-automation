## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I cannot understand these words (which are peculiar to our Gospel) otherwise than as an imperfect report of what really happened, viz. that the Lord dipped the sop, and gave it to Judas, thereby answering the general doubt, in which the traitor had impudently presumed to feign a share."
2. "A striking instance of this is also furnished in Mr. Birk‚Äôs Horse Evangelicae, p. 411: where in treating of this difficulty he says, 'If we suppose St. Matthew to express the substantial meaning of our Lord‚Äôs reply, rather than its precise words, the two accounts are easily reconciled.'"
3. "The literal harmonizers seem to be quite blind to the fact, that this principle of interpretation, which they use when it suits them, is the very one against which they so vehemently protest when others use it, and for the use of which they call them such hard names."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Thou hast said - That is, thou hast said the truth. It is so. Thou art the man. Compare Matthew 26:64 with Mark 14:62.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. Which betrayed [Œø œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ¥ŒøœÖœÇ] . The article with the participle has the force of an epithet : The betrayer.


### John Calvin:
1. "Though we often see persons trembling, who are conscious of doing wrong, yet along with dread and secret torments there is mingled such stupidity, that they boldly make a fiat denial."
2. "Thus Judas, while he is restrained by an evil conscience, cannot remain silent; so dreadfully is he tormented, and, at the same time, overwhelmed with fear and anxiety, by that internal executioner."
3. "Let us learn from this example, that the wicked, by bold apologies, do nothing more than draw down upon themselves a more sudden judgment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The hypocrisy of that question at such a time is an indication that, ‚Äòafter the sop Satan entered into him.‚Äô"
2. "Thou hast said it. An affirmative answer, uttered in close connection with the words: 'What thou doest, do quickly.'" 
3. "Judas not present... It is therefore most probable that Judas went out before the institution."

### John Gill:
1. "Who though he knew what he had been doing, and what he further resolved to do, and was conscious to himself he was the man; nay, though he had been pointed out as the person, and the most dreadful woe denounced on him, that should be the betrayer, in his hearing; yet all this did not at all affect his marble heart."
2. "In the most audacious manner, and without any concern of mind, or show of guilt, [Judas] asks if he was the person; suggesting, that surely he could not mean him."
3. "Thou hast said right, thou art the man; a way of speaking used, when what is asked is assented to as truth."

### John Wesley:
1. Thou hast said ‚Äî That is, it is as thou hast said.
