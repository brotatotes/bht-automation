# Matthew 26:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the paschal feast, Jesus took one of the passover wafers and broke it, giving thanks and blessing it as a symbol of his body offered for us. The purpose of the memorial is to remind us of his death for our sins, not to be worshipped. The bread serves as a beautifully simple, poetic symbol of his sacrifice. As we take and eat the bread, we symbolically take and receive him by the hand of faith, feeding on him spiritually.
