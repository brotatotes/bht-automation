# Matthew 26:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Sacrament, the blood of the Lamb of God, shed for the remission of sins, is spiritually partaken and assimilated by the faithful soul, signifying the blood of the new covenant. The disciples were already clean before the institution. The cup of thanksgiving given by Jesus during the Last Supper signifies and sets forth this covenant in His blood, and is likely the third cup of the Passover feast. All believers are invited to partake of the cup, as well as eat of the bread, receiving the refreshing and confirming assurance of forgiveness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The blood of the Lamb of God, slain for us, being not only as in the former case, sprinkled on, but actually partaken spiritually and assimilated by the faithful soul, is the blood of the new covenant; and the sacramental cup, is, signifies, sets forth this covenant in His blood."
2. "Without shedding of blood, was no remission of sins under the old covenant: and blood was, throughout, the covenant sign of forgiveness and acceptance. Now all this blood of sacrifice finds its true reality and fulfillment in the blood of Christ, shed for the remission of sins."
3. "In the Sacrament, not the forgiveness of sins itself, but the refreshing and confirming assurance of that state of forgiveness is conveyed. The disciples (with one exception) were clean before the institution."

### John Calvin:
1. "As it was the design of Christ to keep our faith wholly fixed on himself, that we may not seek any thing apart from him, he employed two symbols to show that our life is shut up in him."
2. "Christ, in order to show that he alone is able to discharge perfectly all that is necessary for salvation, says that he supplies the place of meat and drink; by which he gives an astonishing display of his condescension, in thus letting himself down to the feeble capacity of our flesh for the purpose of invigorating our faith."
3. "But those childish cavils yield no support to their impiety; for nothing can be more absurd than that believers should, of their own accord, part with the aids which the Lord has given, or allow themselves to be deprived of them; and, therefore, nothing can be more intolerable than this wicked mangling of the mystery."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Although the institution may have been independent of the regular mode of celebrating the Passover, the giving of thanks mentioned here, taken in connection with 1 Corinthians 10:16 (â€˜the cup of blessingâ€™), indicates that this was a cup of thanksgiving, hence probably the third cup of the Passover feast."
2. "â€˜Allâ€™ is significant in view of the Romanist usage, which denies the cup to the laity."

### John Gill:
1. "Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God, the king of the world, who hast created the 'fruit of the vine'." (Matthew 26:27)
2. "And which, as it most fitly represented the blood sprinkled on the door posts of the Israelites when the Lord passed over their houses; so the blood of Christ, shed for the remission of the sins of his people." (Matthew 26:27)
3. "For this is not to be restrained from one sort of communicants, and only partook of by another; but all are to drink of the cup, as well as eat of the bread." (Matthew 26:27)

### John Wesley:
1. And he took the cup â€” Called by the Jews the cup of thanksgiving; which the master of the family used likewise to give to each after supper.
