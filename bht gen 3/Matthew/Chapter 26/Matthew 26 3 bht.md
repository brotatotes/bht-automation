# Matthew 26:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the open court, an informal meeting was held by the Sanhedrin, consisting of the chief priests, scribes, and elders of the people. Some even called Annas, the father-in-law of the high priest Simon ben Kamith, the high priest himself. The uncertainty and hostility of Christ's enemies were in contrast to His clear knowledge of His impending death. Though the meeting was held in the palace, the term refers to the open court or hall, commonly used as a meeting place. This meeting, led by Caiaphas, ultimately resulted in their decision to put Jesus to death.
