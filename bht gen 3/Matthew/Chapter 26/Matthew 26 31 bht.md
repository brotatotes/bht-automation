# Matthew 26:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' statement about all being offended at him is meant to distinguish the present disciples from Judas and refers to the rejection and piercing of the Shepherd, identifying Jesus as the Messiah. This prediction of stumbling and falling away applies to both the disciples and the Jews after rejecting the smitten Shepherd. While these words were addressed to all, they likely carried particular significance for Peter, who needed extraordinary consolation after his denial of Christ. Their faith would have failed without Jesus' prayer, and the sufferings of Christ were part of God's plan executed with justice.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When Jesus said, All ye will be offended at me, he was speaking not just to the disciples present, but to distinguish them from Judas who had already betrayed him. This statement also alludes to the rejection and piercing of the Shepherd mentioned in other Scriptures, making it clear that Jesus is referring to himself as the Messiah. This prediction of the disciples' stumbling and falling away echoes the faith failure that would occur both among them and the Jews after rejecting the smitten Shepherd. While the statement was addressed to all, it is likely that Jesus directed it to Peter in particular, who needed extraordinary consolation to avoid being overwhelmed with despair after denying Christ. Without Jesus' prayer for them, their faith would have failed. Thus, the sufferings of Christ, symbolized by his smiting, were part of God's plan and executed with justice, and it is within that context that the disciples would falter and stumble.
