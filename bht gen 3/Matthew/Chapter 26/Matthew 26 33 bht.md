# Matthew 26:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his self-assuredness and arrogance, Peter proclaimed that even if all the other disciples were to stumble, he alone would remain faithful. However, he failed to consider the prophecy of Jesus' resurrection and their promised reunion in Galilee. Peter's disregard for these warnings reflected his belief that he was superior to the others. Unbeknownst to him, this boastful declaration would soon be contradicted, as he would go on to deny Jesus three times. This incident highlights the importance of self-reflection and trusting in God's strength rather than our own.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "Men do not bring themselves out so strongly, unless their fidelity has been previously attainted."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus the event showed, that Peter promised more for himself than he was able to accomplish, because he had not been sufficiently careful to examine himself."
2. "Believers ought, indeed, to be prepared for the contest in such a manner that, entertaining no doubt or uncertainty about the result and the victory, they may resist fear; for trembling and excessive anxiety are marks of distrust."
3. "This middle course between two faulty extremes is very beautifully expressed by Paul when he enjoins us to work out our salvation with fear and trembling, because it is God that worketh in us to will and perform."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Instead of laying hold of the comforting part of the promise, Peter reverts to the first part." 
2. "The utterance of affection, yet of self-confidence and arrogance, since â€˜allâ€™ refers to the other disciples."
3. "Hence he was allowed to fall lower than the rest. This reply differs from that given by Luke and John."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter ignored the prophecy of the resurrection of Jesus and the promised meeting in Galilee... He was intent on showing that he was superior to 'all' the rest." 
2. "Judas had turned traitor and all were weak, Peter in particular, little as he knew it. So Jesus has to make it plainer by pointing out 'this night' as the time."
3. "When one cock crows in the morning, others generally follow. The three denials lasted over an hour."

### John Gill:
1. "though all the men in the world, friends, and foes, though even all the rest of the disciples, who were his most intimate friends, most closely attached to him, and who dearly loved him, and sincerely believed in him, should be so stumbled at what should befall him, as to flee from him, and be tempted to relinquish his cause, and interest; yet nothing should ever cause him, in the least, to stumble and fall, to desert him, or hesitate about him..."
2. "...this he was positive of would be the case, not only that night, but ever after."
3. "No doubt he said this in the sincerity of his heart, and out of his great fervour of affection for Christ; but what he failed in, was trusting to his own strength, being self-confident..."
