# Matthew 26:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's bold declaration is contrasted here as the most powerful climax, implying that these words were not spoken for the first time. It appears that Peter misunderstood the phrase as a mere indication of time and dismissed it as a display of the Lord's doubt. Yet, Peter stands as a representative of all disciples who deny or forget Christ, and the cock crowing in the night serves as a warning voice summoning them to repentance. Before the first cock crows, early in the night, Peter will deny Jesus, demonstrating his lack of faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The contrast to Peterâ€™s boast, and the climax, is in these words the strongest; and the inference also comes out most clearly, that they likewise were not now said for the first time."
2. "It is most likely that Peter understood this expression as only a mark of time, and therefore received it, as when it was spoken before, as merely an expression of distrust on the Lordâ€™s part."
3. "Peter stands here as a representative of all disciples who deny or forget Christâ€”and the watchful bird that cries in the night is that warning voice which â€˜speaketh once, yea twice,â€™ to call them to repentance."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Before the cock crow. A little more graphic if the article is omitted, as in the Greek." 
2. "Before a single cock shall be heard, early in the night, thou shalt deny me."
3. "Dr. Thomson ('Land and Book') says that the barn - door fowls 'swarm round every door, share in the food of their possessors, are at home among the children in every room, roost overhead at night, and with their ceaseless crowing are the town - clock and the morning - bell to call up sleepers at early dawn.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Before a cock crow twice...Our Lord meant the actual cock-crowing to be a warning for Peter." 
2. "Deny knowing me...a denial of any relation to Christ, virtually a denial of faith in Him, as the Son of God."
3. "In contrast with the previous confession."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou wilt deny that thou knowest me, that thou belongest to me, or hast any concern with me; and this thou wilt do not only once, but again and again, even three times." 
2. "Before the cock crow a second time, which is most properly the cock crowing, Peter should three times deny his master."
3. "So cock crowing and midnight are distinguished by the Jews... who also speak of the cocks crowing a first and second, and even a third time."

### John Wesley:
1. "Before cock crowing thou wilt deny me thrice â€” That is, before three in the morning, the usual time of cock crowing." 
2. "Although one cock was heard to crow once, after Peter's first denial of his Lord."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Peter's boast is sharply contrasted as the strongest climax in these words, emphasizing that they were not said for the first time. Peter likely misunderstood the expression as simply a mark of time, disregarding it as a mere expression of the Lord's distrust. However, Peter serves as a representative of all disciples who deny or forget Christ, and the cock crowing in the night is a warning voice calling them to repentance. The article being omitted in the Greek makes the imagery more graphic, highlighting that before a single cock is heard, early in the night, Peter will deny Jesus. This denial of any relation to Christ is essentially a denial of faith in Him, contrasting with Peter's previous confession.
