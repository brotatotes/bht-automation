# Matthew 26:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee - this notwithstanding seems to have the certainty of an emphatic affirmation. The disciples were undoubtedly influenced by Peter's noble speech and his boast of loyalty, which made him even stronger in his commitment. However, their confidence was rooted in ignorance of their own weakness, a difference from the Lord's conflict, where the ruling will may be overwhelmed by depression and suffering. The other disciples were undoubtedly embarrassed by Peter's bold declaration.
