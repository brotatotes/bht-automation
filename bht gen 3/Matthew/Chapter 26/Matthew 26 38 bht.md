## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord‚Äôs whole inmost life must have been one of continued trouble of spirit‚ÄîHe was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief‚Äîbut there was an extremity of anguish now, reaching even to the utmost limit of endurance, so that it seemed that more would be death itself." 
2. "The expression my soul, in this sense, spoken by our Lord, is only found besides in John xii. 27. It is the human soul, the seat of the affections and passions, which is troubled with the anguish of the body; and it is distinguished from the spirit, the higher spiritual being."
3. "watch with me] not pray with me, for in that work the Mediator must be alone; but (see above) watch with Me‚Äîjust (if we may compare our weakness with His) as we derive comfort in the midst of a terrible storm, from knowing that some are awake and with us, even though their presence is no real safeguard."

### John Calvin:
1. "My soul is sorrowful. He communicates to them his sorrow, in order to arouse them to sympathy; not that he was unacquainted with their weakness, but in order that they might afterwards be more ashamed of their carelessness."
2. "This phrase expresses a deadly wound of grief; as if he had said, that he fainted, or was half-dead, with sorrow."
3. "And here again we ought to remember the cause of so great sorrow; for death in itself would not have so grievously tormented the mind of the Son of God, if he had not felt that he had to deal with the judgment of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A sufferer all His life, His sufferings now increased, even unto death."
2. "His human body would have given way under the sorrow of His human soul, had not strength been imparted by the ministrations of an angel."
3. "His command was not merely to keep awake out of sympathy with Him, but to be on their guard against coming dangers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Watch with me (Œ≥œÅŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒµŒπœÑŒµ ŒºŒµœÑ' ŒµŒºŒøœÖ). This late present from the perfect ŒµŒ≥œÅŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒ± means to keep awake and not go to sleep."
2. "Jesus pleaded for a bit of human sympathy as he wrestled with his Father."
3. "He had put his sorrow in strong language, 'even unto death' (ŒµœâœÇ Œ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÑŒøœÖ) that ought to have alarmed them."

### John Gill:
1. "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death... his soul was overwhelmed with sorrow; his heart was ready to break; he was brought even, as it were, to the dust of death..." 
2. "He knew it would be an hour of temptation both to him and them, and therefore advises them to watch against it; and to observe how it would go with him, and what should befall him..."
3. "They might be heavy and inclined to sleep... be witnesses of it, and be able to testify what agonies he endured, what grace he exercised, and how submissive he was to his Father's will."
