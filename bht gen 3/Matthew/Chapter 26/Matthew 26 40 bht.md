# Matthew 26:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are you so utterly unable to watch? Did you not have enough strength to stay awake for one hour? The disciples' slumber was a disappointment to Jesus, as they had promised to be there for him. While their drowsiness does not prove insensibility, it showcased their inability to remain alert. This scene of drowsiness serves as an emblem of believers' spiritual sleep and drowsiness, which can even render them unaffected by powerful preaching. Nonetheless, believers are not expected to be constantly in prayer, but rather to pray within the bounds of their infirmity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The question is literally could ye thus not watch...?â€”it implies their utter inability, as shewn by their present state of slumber, Are ye so entirely unable, &c."
2. "One hour need not imply that our Lord had been absent a whole hour:â€”if it is to be taken in any close meaning, it would be that the whole trial would last about that time."
3. "But most likely it is in allusion to the time of our Lordâ€™s trial, so often called by that name."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. What! It is hardly possible to convey the exact force of the Greek outwv, thus or so. The idea is, "are ye thus unable, or so utterly unable to watch?"


### John Calvin:
1. "For believers are not required to be so constant in prayer as never to cease from conversing with God; but on the contrary, following the example of Christ, they continue their prayers till they have proceeded as far as their infirmity allows, then cease for a short time, and immediately after drawing breath return to God."
2. "It would have been no slight alleviation of his grief, if his disciples had accompanied him, and taken part in it; and on the other hand, it was a bitter aggravation of his sufferings, that even they forsook him."
3. "For his expostulation is not feigned, but, out of the true feeling of his mind, he declares that he is grieved at having been forsaken."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their drowsiness does not prove insensibility; they had, however, been warned to watch."
2. "Unto Peter, who had promised most."
3. "What, or â€˜so then.â€™ This indicates disappointment, if not displeasure. His chosen friends had failed to comfort Him in this crisis."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did you not thus have strength enough to keep awake one hour?" 
2. "There is a tone of sad disappointment at the discovery that they were asleep after the earnest plea that they keep awake."
3. "Every word struck home."

### John Gill:
1. "We have other instances of persons in excessive grief and trouble falling asleep, as Elijah in 1 Kings 19:4, and Jonah in Jonah 1:5, so that this did not arise from a secure, lazy, indolent frame of spirit; or from any disregard to Christ, and neglect of him, and unconcernedness for him; but from their great sorrow of heart."
2. "Now, though this sleep was natural bodily sleep, which the disciples fell into, yet was an emblem of, and carried in it a resemblance to, the spiritual sleep and drowsiness of the people of God."
3. "Yet as the disciples were so much asleep, that the bare words of Christ did not arouse them from it for a while; so such is the sleep of the saints sometimes, that they are not to be aroused by the bare ministry of the word, though the most powerful arguments, and the most moving and melting language are made use of."
