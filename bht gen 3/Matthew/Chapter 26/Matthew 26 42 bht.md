### Henry Alford:
1. "St. Mark merely says of this second prayer, 'he... spake the same words.'"
2. "The words are not exactly the same: 'the Lord knew that the Father always heard Him (John xi. 42); and therefore He understands the continuance of His trial as the answer to His last words, as Thou wilt.'"
3. "Here therefore the prayer is If it be not possible.... Thy will be done. It is spoken in the fulness of self-resignation."

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ seems as if, having subdued fear, he came with greater freedom and courage to submit to the will of the Father."
2. "But we know that the Evangelists sometimes leave out circumstances, and only glance rapidly at the substance of what took place."
3. "Now though it is the Spirit of God alone that imparts fortitude, that does not hinder God from employing angels as his ministers."

2. "desiring in all things to submit unto, and to fulfil his Father's will,"
3. "though it was so irksome and disagreeable to nature."
