## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Judas is specified as 'one of the Twelve,' probably because the appellation, as connected with this part of his history, had become the usual one." 
2. "The intention of the chief priests evidently was to produce an impression to the effect that a seditious plot was to be crushed, and resistance might be expected."
3. "John mentions also lanterns and torchesâ€”to search perhaps in the dark parts of the garden, most of which would by this time be in the shade."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By the time Matthew's Gospel was written, the phrase had become a stereotyped designation of the traitor." 
2. "The Sanhedrin had neither soldiery nor a regularly-armed band at command." 
3. "Part of the band would consist of this regularly-armed cohort, and the rest of a crowd armed with cudgels, and embracing some of the servants of conspicuous men in the Sanhedrin."

### John Calvin:
1. "The event itself showed that nothing occurred by chance; and since Christâ€™s prediction directed them to contemplate the glory of his divinity."
2. "The circumstance of an armed multitude having been sent by the chief priests, and of a captain and band having been obtained by request from Pilate, makes it evident, that an evil conscience wounded and tormented them."
3. "It is a display of amazing rage, that, relying on the power of arms, they do not hesitate to rise up against God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This haste favors the view that avarice was his leading motive."
2. "Here the phrase emphasizes the treachery."
3. "The size of the crowd may have been a recognition of our Lordâ€™s power or designed to produce the impression on Pilate that some great plot was to be crushed, and on the people that Jesus was a great criminal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was an electric moment as Jesus faced Judas with his horde of helpers as if he turned to meet an army."
2. "The very horror of the thing is thus emphasized, that one of the chosen twelve apostles should do this dastardly deed."
3. "Judas was taking no chances of failure for he well knew the strange power of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "While he was thus speaking to his disciples, before the last words, he is at hand that doth betray me, were well out of his mouth; such an exact knowledge had Christ of every motion of Judas, of what he was about, and where he was."
2. "He is described by his name Judas; as in Matthew 26:14, for there was another Judas among the apostles; the Syriac and Persic read, Judas the betrayer, to distinguish him from the other: and also by his office, 'one of the twelve'; i.e. apostles, whom Christ called from the rest of his disciples and followers, and bestowed extraordinary gifts upon, and sent forth to preach the Gospel, cast out devils, and heal all manner of diseases; and 'lo!', one of these betrays him! an apostle, and yet a devil! one of the twelve, one of his select company, and bosom friends, and yet a traitor!"
3. "Thus we see how diligent wicked men are in the accomplishment of their evil designs, whilst good men are asleep and indifferent to godly and spiritual exercises. Judas is here described by his company; he who but a few hours ago was at table with his Lord, and the rest of the apostles, is now at the head of band of Roman soldiers, and other miscreants, and blood thirsty wretches, intent upon the death of his master."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 14:43; Luke 22:47; John 18:2.
