## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of the kiss, supposing it to have taken place after John vv. 4â€“8, [...] has been doubted. Yet I think on a review of what had happened, it is very intelligible."
2. "The kiss would be necessary in the course of their military duty, as their authorization,â€”notwithstanding the previous declaration by Jesus of Himself."
3. "The word in the original implies, 'kissed him eagerly,' with ostentation, as a studied and prearranged sign."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The compound verb has the force of an emphatic, ostentatious salute."
2. "The same word is used of the tender caressing of the Lord 's feet by the woman in the Pharisee 's house, of the father 's embrace of the returned prodigal, and of the farewell of the Ephesian elders to Paul."
3. "Meyer says embraced and kissed."

### John Calvin:
1. "I have no doubt that Judas, as if trembling for his Master's danger, pretended by these words to have some feeling of compassion."
2. "Though it was a very common practice among the Jews to welcome friends with a kiss, yet as Judas had left Christ but a little before, he seems now â€” as if he had become suddenly alarmed at his danger â€” to give the last kiss to his Master."
3. "Thus he excels the rest in the appearance of affection, when he appears to be deeply grieved at being separated from his Master; but how little he gained by his deception is evident from Christ's reply."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Hail, Rabbi. A deceitful address."
2. "Kissed him. A stronger word than that used in the last verse... a caressing, corresponding with the purpose of Judas to make sure, and with the excitement of his feelings."
3. "The sign was the simple kissing; but the performance was more emphatic."

### John Gill:
1. "The salutation he gave him was wishing him all health, prosperity, and happiness. The Syriac version renders it, 'peace, Rabbi'; and the Persic, 'peace be upon thee, Rabbi'; which was the very form of salutation the disciples of the wise men gave to their Rabbins."
2. "In Mark 14:45, the word 'Rabbi' is repeated, this being usual in the salutation of the Jewish doctors; and the rather used by Judas under a pretence of doing him the greater honour, and of showing the highest respect, and strongest affection for him."
3. "Yet, I can hardly think that this was done out of open contempt and derision; but under a pretence of respect and love; and even as being concerned for his present case, and as condoling him under the circumstances he was now likely to be in."
