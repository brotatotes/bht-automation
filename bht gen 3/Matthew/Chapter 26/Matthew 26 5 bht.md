## BHT:
The religious leaders were determined to capture and kill Jesus, but during the feast they couldn't lay hands on Him.

This delay was contrary to their common rules, driven by fear rather than reverence for God. Yet, God's providence allowed Judas to change their purpose, leading to the fulfillment of Jesus as the true paschal Lamb on the day of the solemn feast.
