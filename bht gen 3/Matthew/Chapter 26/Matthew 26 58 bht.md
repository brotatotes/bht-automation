### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Peter, though more courageous than the others, was still not courageous enough. He followed Jesus from a distance, hoping to remain unnoticed. However, this fear and distance betrayed his lack of true courage and devotion. Many of us are like this, afraid to draw near to Christ. Yet true religion requires us to be close to Him, to desire His presence, and to be willing to follow Him always. Following Him from afar may seem safer, but it leads us into danger rather than victory. Peter's unfortunate decision to sit among the officers in the high priest's palace only set him up for the temptation and denial that would follow. Love compelled him to follow, but fear kept him at a distance, leading him to unfit companions and the eventual denial of his Lord.
