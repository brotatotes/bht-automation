# Matthew 26:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this account, we see Simon, a possible former leper, inviting Jesus to his house for a feast. It is suggested that Simon may have been healed by Jesus himself, as he would not have been able to host guests if he were still a leper. While some speculate that it was Martha's house, there is no solid evidence to support this claim. This event demonstrates Simon's gratitude and hospitality towards Jesus, as he welcomes Him into his home.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not at this time a leper, or he could not be at his house receiving guests."
2. "It is at least possible, that he may have been healed by our Lord."
3. "He had been probably absent with Jesus at Ephraim, and on this account, and naturally for other reasons, would be an object of interest, and one of the sitters at table."

### John Calvin:
1. "They did not venture to attack Christ by open violence, and to oppress him by stratagem was no easy matter; but now that Judas suggests to them a plan of which they had not thought, the very facility of execution leads them to adopt a different opinion."
2. "As to its being said by John that his feet were anointed, while the other two Evangelists say that she anointed his head, this involves no contradiction... it agrees very well with this to say that it flowed down to his feet."
3. "Let us therefore hold it to be a settled point, that all the three Evangelists relate the same narrative."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Probably already healed by Jesus, since otherwise he would have been unclean."
2. "The two occurrences are clearly distinguished in many ways."
3. "Both families may have occupied the same house; or Simon may have been the owner, and Lazarus his tenant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Some hold that it was Martha's house because she served (John 12:2) and that Simon was either the father or husband of Martha, but Martha loved to serve and that proves nothing."
2. "Some identify Mary of Bethany with the sinful woman in Matthew 26:7 and even with Mary Magdalene, both gratuitous and groundless propositions."
3. "John (John 12:1) apparently locates the feast six days before the passover, while Mark (Mark 14:3) and Matthew (Matthew 26:6) seem to place it on the Tuesday evening (Jewish Wednesday) just two days before the passover meal."

### John Gill:
1. "The time of Christ's death being at hand, he keeps nigh to Jerusalem, where he was to suffer and die, in the room and stead of sinners."
2. "This Simon was one of those lepers that had a sense of his mercy, and was grateful for it, as appears by his entertaining Christ at his house; and may teach us thankfulness to Christ, who has healed all our diseases."
3. "Christ goes in and dwells with such whom he heals, and with such he is always welcome."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 14:3.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Matthew 26:6, we see Simon, possibly a formerly healed leper, hosting a feast for Jesus. Some believe that Simon may have been healed by Jesus himself. While some speculate that it was Martha's house, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim. Additionally, it is important to note that Mary of Bethany is not the same person as the sinful woman in Matthew 26:7 or Mary Magdalene. The feast mentioned in John 12:1 is said to have taken place six days before the Passover, while Mark and Matthew place it on Tuesday evening, just two days before the Passover meal. Overall, this verse highlights the gratitude and hospitality shown by Simon, a healed leper, towards Jesus.
