## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Simon the leper... Not at this time a leper, or he could not be at his house receiving guests."
2. "It is at least possible, that he may have been healed by our Lord."
3. "He had been probably... absent with Jesus at Ephraim, and on this account, and naturally for other reasons, would be an object of interest, and one of the sitters at table."

### John Calvin:
1. "They did not venture to attack Christ by open violence, and to oppress him by stratagem was no easy matter; but now that Judas suggests to them a plan of which they had not thought, the very facility of execution leads them to adopt a different opinion."
2. "As to its being said by John that his feet were anointed, while the other two Evangelists say that she anointed his head, this involves no contradiction."
3. "Let us therefore hold it to be a settled point, that all the three Evangelists relate the same narrative."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Probably already healed by Jesus, since otherwise he would have been unclean."
2. "The two occurrences are clearly distinguished in many ways."
3. "Both families may have occupied the same house; or Simon may have been the owner, and Lazarus his tenant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All sorts of fantastic theories have arisen about it."
2. "Some hold that it was Martha's house because she served and that Simon was either the father or husband of Martha, but Martha loved to serve and that proves nothing."
3. "Some identify Mary of Bethany with the sinful woman in Matthew 26:7 and even with Mary Magdalene, both gratuitous and groundless propositions."

### John Gill:
1. "The time of Christ's death being at hand, he keeps nigh to Jerusalem, where he was to suffer and die, in the room and stead of sinners."
2. "There were many lepers healed by Christ, which, among other things, was an evidence of his being the Messiah, and a proof of his deity."
3. "Christ goes in and dwells with such whom he heals, and with such he is always welcome."
