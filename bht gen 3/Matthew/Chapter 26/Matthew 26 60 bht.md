# Matthew 26:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders were unable to find witnesses whose testimonies were consistent or sufficient to convict Jesus. False witnesses were abundant, but they could not provide a testimony that would stand up to scrutiny. Even when two false witnesses appeared with similar testimonies, it was not enough to satisfy the requirement of the law. Driven by their fury, these leaders distorted Jesus' words and falsely accused him. Yet, their relentless efforts could not diminish the unwavering truth that Jesus embodied.
