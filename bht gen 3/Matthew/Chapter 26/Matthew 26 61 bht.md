# Matthew 26:61 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The false witnesses attempted to accuse Jesus by fabricating a false sense of His words, misrepresenting His statement about the temple. Their deliberate misinterpretation and lack of agreement among themselves exposed their deceitful tactics. Jesus had actually been prophesying His death and subsequent resurrection. However, the witnesses perverted His meaning, wrongly attributing His words to the physical temple in Jerusalem instead of His own body.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The false witness consisted in giving that sense to His words, which it appears they knew they did not bear."
2. "There is considerable difference between the words attributed to Him here, and there."
3. "The instance likewise of his zeal for the honour of the temple, which had so lately occurred might tend to perplex the evidence produced to the contrary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Probably both forms of giving in the testimony were used on the trial, and Matthew has recorded it as it was given at one time and Mark at another, so that there is no contradiction."
2. "That which they 'attempted' to accuse him of is what he had said respecting his body and their destroying it."
3. "They neither stated it as it was, nor did they state correctly its meaning, nor did they agree about the words used. It was therefore very little to their purpose."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜Fellowâ€™ conveys a sneer, not contained in the original."
2. "The witnesses were probably guilty of wilful misinterpretation."
3. "The words of our Lord are a prophecy of His death, and yet of His ultimate victory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What he had said (John 2:19) referred to the temple of his body which they were to destroy (and did) and which he would raise again in three days as he did."
2. "It was a pitiful perversion of what Jesus had said."
3. "Even so, the two witnesses disagreed in their misrepresentation (Mark 14:59)."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not say, 'I am able to destroy the temple', but only said, 'destroy this temple'; signifying neither his power, nor his will and inclination to it; but put it upon the Jews, and left it to them to do it."
2. "Nor did he say one word about the temple of God... but only 'this temple', referring to his body, or human nature; in which he, the Son of God, dwelt, as in a temple."
3. "They perverted his sense, as well as misquoted his words; applying that to the material temple at Jerusalem, what he spoke of the temple of his body, and of its resurrection from the dead, on the third day."
