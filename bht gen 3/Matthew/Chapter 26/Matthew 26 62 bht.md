### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When asked to respond to the accusations against him, Jesus chose to remain silent. The high priests and witnesses were demanding an explanation, but our Lord knew that revealing the true meaning of his words was not appropriate at that moment. It would have opened their eyes to his true nature and purpose, which was not yet the work to be accomplished. Caiaphas took advantage of Jesus' silence to assert his own dominance, not knowing that Jesus had willingly embraced the role of the sacrificial lamb. In the face of their frivolous objection, Jesus had no need to defend himself or engage in futile arguments. Instead, he rose above their anger and contempt, wholly unconcerned with his own acquittal.
