- Attempt 1 BHT: The high priest, in hearing Jesus claim to be the Messiah and the Son of God, reacted by rending his clothes, a sign of mourning or indignation. This act was not required for blasphemy, but rather for mourning or the dead. By doing so, the high priest aimed to show his grief and concern at the alleged profanation of God's holy name. However, the rending of the high priest's clothes also symbolized the eventual rending of the priesthood from him and his brethren, as well as the transformation that would come. In their eyes, Jesus's claim to be the Messiah was seen as an invasion of divine prerogative and proof that he deserved to die. While the high priest intended to display his zeal for the honor and glory of God, his actions inadvertently foreshadowed the redemption and restoration that would come through the suffering of Christ. As listeners, we are faced with a choice - to accept Jesus's testimony or to join in the harsh verdict of the high priest.
