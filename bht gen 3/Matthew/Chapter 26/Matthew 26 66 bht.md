# Matthew 26:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the chief priests and council convened, they had already reached a unanimous opinion about the accused - their vote was more of a formality than a legal condemnation. Despite lacking the authority to execute a death sentence, they declared him worthy of death. This hasty decision, conveniently made on the night before a major holiday, clearly illustrates their determination to quickly hand him over to the Romans for crucifixion, in order to maintain peace among the people.
