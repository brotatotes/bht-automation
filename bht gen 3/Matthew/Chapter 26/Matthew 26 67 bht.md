# Matthew 26:67 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this account, Jesus endures severe mistreatment, with individuals striking him with their fists and rods, and smiting him with the palms of their hands. The discrepancies in the various reports should be seen as a testimony to their independence, as each account would find its justification with complete details. The act of spitting in Jesus' face was an intense expression of contempt and proved to be an injurious treatment. These insults, inflicted by the soldiers and members of the Sanhedrin, were not only physically agonizing for Jesus, but they also deeply humiliated him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word rendered buffeted means to strike with the fist. The following verb (smote him) is, generally, to strike a flat blow with the back of the hand--but also, and probably here, since another set of persons are described as doing it, to strike with a staff."
2. "The four accounts of the FIRST denial are remarkably coincident. [...] I should be disposed to think this first recognition to have been but one, and the variations to be owing to the independence of the report."
3. "We value [the discrepancies] rather, as testimonies to independence: and are sure, that if for one moment we could be put in complete possession of all the details as they happened, each account would find its justification, and the reasons of all the variations would appear."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This, among the Jews, as among us, was significant of the highest contempt and insult." 
2. "That is, they struck him with their hands closed, or with the fist."
3. "The word used in the original here means literally to strike with rods. It also means to strike the mouth with the open hand, as if to prevent a personâ€™s speaking, or to evince abhorrence of what he had spoken."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Buffet [ÎµÎºÎ¿Î»Î±Ï†Î¹ÏƒÎ±Î½] . With the fist." 
2. "Smote with the palms of their hands. All expressed by one word, ejrapisan, from rJapiv, a rod, and meaning to smite with rods, not with the palms."
3. "The same word is employed Matthew 5:39. It came to mean generally to strike."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then did they spit in his face. The guard chiefly, but probably the members of the Sanhedrin also (Acts 7:54; Acts 7:57; Acts 22:2). At all events they permitted it. It was an expression of the greatest contempt." 
2. "And buffet him. Struck Him with their fists." 
3. "And some (â€˜the officers,â€™ Mark 14:65) smote him. Either with the hand, or â€˜with rods,â€™ probably both."

### John Gill:
1. "Than which nothing was more reproachful and disgraceful: the Jews say, that he that spits before, or in the presence of his master, is guilty of death, so nauseous and filthy was it accounted; and how much more must it be so, to spit in the face of anyone?" 
2. "Hereby a prophecy was fulfilled, Isaiah 50:6, 'I hid not my face from shame and spitting': and hereby, together with his sweat and blood, his visage was more marred than any man's, and his form than the sons of men."
3. "This was very injurious treatment, the Jews themselves being witnesses; who have in their canons enjoined that 'if a man strikes his neighbor with his double fist, he must give him a shekel;... if he gives him a slap on the face, he must pay him two hundred zuzims, or pence; and if with the back of his hand (which was accounted the more ignominious) four hundred zuzims: if he plucked him by his ear, or plucked off his hair, or spit, so as that the spittle came upon him, or took away his cloak--he must pay four hundred zuzims, and all according to his honor or dignity.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "After he had declared he was the Son of God, the sanhedrim doubtless ordered him to be carried out, while they were consulting what to do."
2. "And then it was that the soldiers who kept him began these insults upon him."
