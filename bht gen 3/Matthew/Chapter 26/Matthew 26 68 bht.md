# Matthew 26:68 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With uncontrolled glee, these doctors of divinity insulted Jesus by spitting in his face, buffeting his neck, and striking his face. Their spite and hatred were poured out upon him as they mockingly challenged him to prophesy who had struck him. Jesus remained silent, enduring their mockery and allowing them to strike his human body, while they aimed their scorn at his person and office. Although he did not respond in that moment, he would ultimately reveal the identities of those who had struck him. Their temporary amusement and mockery would come at a heavy price.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Having prevented his seeing, they ridiculed his pretensions of being the Messiah."
2. "If he Was the Christ, they supposed he could tell who smote him."
3. "The word 'prophesy' does not mean only to foretell future events, although that is the proper meaning of the word, but also to declare anything that is unknown, or anything which cannot be known by natural knowledge or without revelation."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:

2. "Christ did not think fit to give them an answer to this question, but he will let them know hereafter, who the particular person, or persons were, that smote him."
3. "In this ludicrous way did they use him, and made him their sport and diversion, as the Philistines did Samson; but it will cost them dear another day."
