# Matthew 26:69 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In an oriental house with a quadrangular interior court, Peter finds himself accused of association with Jesus the Galilean by a damsel. Caught off guard and warming himself by the fire, Peter denies knowing Jesus. This moment serves as a reminder that our own strength is insufficient to resist powerful attacks, as easily overcome as a slight gale or the rustling of a falling leaf. Without the hand of God, we crumble at the mere shadow of a battle.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "An oriental house is usually built round a quadrangular interior court... In the text, the interior court, often paved or flagged, and open to the sky, is the â€˜hall,â€™ where the attendants made a fire." 
2. "The place where Jesus stood before the High Priest may have been an open room or place of audience on the ground floor, in the rear or on one side of the court; such rooms open in front, being customary." 
3. "The passage beneath the front of the house from the street to this court, is the pro-aulion ( â€˜porch,â€™ Mark xiv. 68), or pylon ( â€˜porch,â€™ ver. 71)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Mark says the first denial took place while Peter was 'beneath in the palace.'"
2. "Peter was 'beneath or in the 'lower part' of the hall, with the servants at the fire."
3. "Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee - Probably she suspected him from his being in company with John."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. A damsel [Î¼Î¹Î± Ï€Î±Î¹Î´Î¹ÏƒÎºÎ³Î·] . Lit., one damsel, because the writer has in mind a second one (ver. 71).


### John Calvin:
1. "Here we see that there is no necessity for a severe contest, or for many forces or implements of war, to overpower a man; for any man, who is not supported by the hand of God, will instantly fall by a slight gale or the rustling of a falling leaf."
2. "Let us therefore remember that our strength is so far from being sufficient to resist powerful attacks, that it will give way, when there is the mere shadow of a battle."
3. "But in this way God gives us the just reward of our treachery, when he disarms and strips us of all power, so that, when we have thrown off the fear of him, we tremble for a mere nothing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But warming oneâ€™s self with Christâ€™s enemies has its dangers."
2. "A maid. Mark: â€˜one of the maids of the high-priest,â€™ probably the one who kept the door, mentioned by John, since he connects with this denial Peterâ€™s standing by the fire in the court."
3. "Jesus the Galilean. Probably contemptuous banter, or light ridicule, not with a view to serious accusation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean."
2. "Peter was warming himself by the fire and the light shone in his face."
3. "Or she may have seen Peter with Jesus on the streets of Jerusalem."

### John Gill:
1. "indeed, the ill usage he met with from his enemies, their spitting in his face, buffeting him with their fists, smiting him on the cheeks with their hands, and rods, did not give him so much pain and grief, as to be denied by his own disciple."
2. "saying, thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. The Arabic and Persic versions read, Jesus the Nazarene, or of Nazareth, as below. So she called him, not so much to distinguish him from any other of that name, as by way of reproach; suggesting, that he could not be the Messiah, or that prophet; since Christ comes not out of Galilee, nor does any prophet arise from thence."
3. "and when she charges him with being 'withâ€™ him, her meaning is not, that he was with him in the garden, when he was taken; where it cannot be thought she was to see him; nor with him in the temple, or in any part of Jerusalem, where she possibly might have seen him; but that he was a disciple of his, one that believed in him, embraced him as the Messiah, had imbibed his principles and doctrines, and was of his party; and was only come thither as a spy, to see what would be done to him."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In the passage, an oriental house with a quadrangular interior court serves as the setting for Peter's denial of knowing Jesus. Peter, standing in the hall, is accused by a damsel of being with Jesus the Galilean. This accusation is likely based on his previous association with John and Jesus on the streets of Jerusalem. Peter, warming himself by the fire, is caught off guard by the accusation, causing him to deny his association with Jesus. This denial takes place in the lower part of the hall, where servants and a maid are gathered. However, even in this seemingly insignificant moment, Peter's denial has significant consequences. It serves as a reminder that our own strength is insufficient to resist powerful attacks and that, without the hand of God, we are easily overcome.
