# Matthew 26:70 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter's response of I know not what thou sayest was a deceitful evasion, an easy subterfuge that failed to deceive anyone. Denying his discipleship and association with Jesus, he even feigned ignorance of the question. This denial, fueled by fear of man, only served to bring snare upon him. Let us remember that withholding our testimony for Christ exposes His name to ridicule. Therefore, we must hold firmly to a sincere and open profession of Christ, for denying it deprives Him of the testimony He rightly deserves.
