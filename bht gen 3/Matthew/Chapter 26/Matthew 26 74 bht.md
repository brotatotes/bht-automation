### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Hitherto he had merely sworn. Now he adds imprecation; invoking curses on himself if the case be not as he says."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not satisfied with swearing, he breaks out into cursing, by which he abandons his body and soul to destruction; for he prays that the curse of God may fall upon him, if he knows Christ."
2. "So much the more ought we to admire the goodness of Christ, who rescued his disciple from such fatal ruin, and healed him."
3. "Now this passage shows, that when a man falling through weakness of the flesh, denies the truth though he knows it, this does not amount to 'blasphemy against the Holy Spirit'."

### John Gill:
1. "He swore before, and now he began 'to curse'; not Christ, as Saul compelled some to blaspheme him, who professed him, and as the Jews formerly cursed Christ, and his followers, in their synagogues: for Peter's crime was bad enough, it need not be made worse than it was." 
2. "He could never call Jesus accursed; in so doing he would have sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost; but he cursed himself; 'he began to imprecate himself', as the Arabic version renders it; he made dreadful imprecations and wishes." 
3. "May I be the most miserable creature in the world, if I know anything of him."
