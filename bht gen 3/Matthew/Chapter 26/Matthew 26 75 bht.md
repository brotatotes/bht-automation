## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Outâ€”viz. from the porch where the second and third denial had taken place."
2. "The motive being, as Chrysostom gives it, 'that he might not be convicted by his tears.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A look from Jesus - a look of mingled affection, pity, and reproof - produces bitter sorrow for sin."
2. "Real Christians may be suffered to go far astray. To show them their weakness, to check self-confidence, and to produce dependence on Jesus Christ, they may be permitted to show how weak, and feeble, and rash they are."
3. "Though a Christian may be suffered to go astray - may fall into sin - yet he who should, from this example of Peter, think that he might, lawfully do it, or who should resolve to do it, thinking that he might, like Peter, weep and repent, would give evidence that he knew nothing of the grace of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "We all have experience of the same thing in ourselves; for which of us does not pass by with indifference and with deaf ears [...] even the voice of God, which is heard clearly and distinctly in the doctrine of the Law and of the Gospel?" 
2. "Let us therefore know, that whenever any one has fallen, his repentance will never begin, until the Lord has looked at him." 
3. "And by this example we are taught that we ought to entertain confident hope, though our repentance be lame; for God does not despise even weak repentance, provided that it be sincere."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His memory was helped by our Lordâ€™s look of reproachful love."
2. "His departure was not to save himself from his perilous position, but to be alone in his grief."
3. "Tears of true penitence. The repentance of Judas led him back to the priests, with money in his hand; the repentance of Peter led him to God with tears in his eyes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He had incurred the dread penalty involved in the words of Jesus in Matthew 10:33 of denial by Jesus before the Father in heaven."
2. "That look brought Peter back to his senses."
3. "One of the tragedies of the Cross is the bleeding heart of Peter."

### John Gill:
1. "Forgetfulness of God, of his works, of his words, and of his law, of his revealed mind and will, is often the cause of sin."
