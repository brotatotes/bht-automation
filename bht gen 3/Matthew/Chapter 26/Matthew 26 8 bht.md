### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "This indignation was either at the woman... or at Christ himself, for suffering such an action to be done unto him."
3. "They call that waste, or loss, which was spent on Christ himself; whereas, whatever is laid out for the honour of Christ, or the good of his interest, ought not to be reckoned loss, for it will be returned with great increase and advantage."

### John Wesley:
1. His disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying â€” It seems several of them were angry, and spoke, though none so warmly as Judas Iscariot.
