## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The chief priests and elders of the people took counsel - They agreed that he deserved to die, 'on a charge of blasphemy,' yet they did not dare to put him to death by stoning, as they did afterward Stephen Acts 7:0... They therefore 'consulted,' or took counsel together, to determine on what pretence they could deliver him to the Roman emperor."
2. "They fixed on... 'that of perverting the nation, and of forbidding to give tribute to Caesar'... On this accusation... they supposed Pilate could be induced to condemn Jesus."
3. "To put him to death - To devise some way by which he might be put to death under the authority of the Roman governor."

### John Calvin:
1. "But it is probable, that when Christ had been led away from their council, they immediately held a consultation, and, without long delay, resolved what they would do; for we have been already told at what time Christ went out from them and met Peter, which was after the cock-crowing, and just as day was breaking."
2. "The Evangelists, therefore, do not mean that they removed from the place, but only relate, that as soon as it was daylight, they condemned Christ to death, and did not lose a moment in earnestly putting into execution their wicked design."
3. "For the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:59) took place in a seditious manner, as happens in cases of tumult; but it was proper that the Son of God should be solemnly condemned by an earthly judge, that he might efface our condemnation in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Probably about sunrise, since the twilight is short in that latitude."
2. "It is characteristic of Pharisaism to be most formal when most unjust."
3. "Their plan appears to have been: 1. To ask Pilateâ€™s consent, without inquiry, to their sentence of death. 2. If necessary, to make the vague charge, that Jesus claimed to be King of the Jews. 3. Another charge mentioned by John, that He claimed to be the Son of God, may have been determined on, in case He denied the political character of His Messiahship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After dawn came the Sanhedrin held a formal meeting to condemn Jesus and so ratify the illegal trial during the night."
2. "Luke gives the details of this second ratification consultation."
3. "The phrase used, took counsel, is a Latin idiom for ÏƒÏ…Î½ÎµÎ²Î¿Ï…Î»ÎµÏ…ÏƒÎ±Î½Ï„Î¿."

### John Gill:
1. "Their feet ran to evil, and they made haste to shed blood." 
2. "What they consulted about was to put him to death; it was not what punishment to inflict upon him, whether scourging or death; that was before determined; they had already condemned him to death."
3. "They chose crucifixion as the most ignominious and painful; and therefore determined to deliver him up to the Roman governor, and use their interest with him to put him to death, according to the Roman law."
