# Matthew 27:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The primary accusation against Him was that He said He was Christ a King, which was presupposed in the inquiry. His silence during this questioning was an expression of His conscious innocence and the futility of attempting to convince them otherwise. He knew the charges were false, and by his silence, Jesus allowed himself to be condemned in order to fulfill God's plan of sacrifice for our sins. His silence at that moment serves as a reminder of His role as our advocate and the means of our righteousness through His grace.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The main accusation against Him was that He claimed to be the Christ, a King. This accusation was the focus of the question posed in this verse. Some commentators suggest that Jesus chose to remain silent because he was aware of his innocence and knew that the charges against him could not be proven. His silence would not have convinced his accusers or helped Pilate's desire to release him. But we must consider that God had determined that Jesus, who was sinless, would be condemned as guilty in our place, so his silence served a greater purpose. It allowed him to become our advocate and intercessor, enabling us to be delivered from condemnation. He was silent so that through his grace, we can boast that we are made righteous.
