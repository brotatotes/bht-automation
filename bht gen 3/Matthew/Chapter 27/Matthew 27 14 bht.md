2. "He was probably more surprised that he bore this so meekly, and did not return railing for railing, than that he did not set up a defense."
3. "Pleased with the respect which had been shown him, Herod laid aside his enmity against Pilate, and they became friends."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And he gave him no answer, not even to one word. This is the emphatic force of the original."
2. "The silence of our Lord continued until just before the final decision."
3. "Those accused are not often silent, and Pilate had probably found the Jews tried at his bar especially vehement."

2. "That a man, who at other times had such fluency of speech, and readiness of expression, who both for matter and words, and also weight and authority, spake as never man did: and who had so often silenced the Scribes and Pharisees, men of the greatest learning among the Jews, of which Pilate, doubtless, had knowledge, should say nothing in his own defence."
3. "He marvelled at the patience of Jesus, that he could hear such notorious falsities, and which so affected his character, and his life, and say nothing to them; and at the fortitude of his mind, at his being so regardless of his life, and fearless of death."
