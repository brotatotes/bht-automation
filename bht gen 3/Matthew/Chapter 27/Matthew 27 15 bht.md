### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Every year at the feast, it was the custom for Pilate to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. This year, the name Bar-abbas, meaning 'son of his father,' stood out, as it was a common name. However, it is not clear why this particular man was notable. Some suggest that Pilate purposely selected a very wicked man like Bar-abbas, in order to shame the people and compel them to release Jesus. Regardless, we should remember that Christ, though innocent, willingly humbled himself and allowed himself to be crucified, so that through his humiliation, we may receive heavenly glory. Additionally, this custom of releasing a prisoner was likely introduced by Pilate himself as a means to gain favor with the people during the passover feast.
