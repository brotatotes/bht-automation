## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "A notable prisoner. A leader in an insurrection in which he had committed murder (Mark and Luke). John calls him â€˜a robber.â€™ Probably one of the Zealots, of whom Josephus speaks. His crime was really political."
2. "Barabbas, â€˜Barabbas,â€™ i.e., â€˜the son of his father;â€™ although other meanings have been discovered in it. Some minor authorities call him, â€˜Jesus Barabbas,â€™ and many think he was a false Messiah; but this is a mere conjecture."

### John Gill:
1. "This prisoner is called a 'notable' one; that is, a famous, or rather an infamous one."
2. "He was a thief, and a robber, and had been guilty of sedition; had made, or joined with others in an insurrection, and had committed murder in it."
3. "A father's child that was spoiled and ruined, and a child of his father the devil."
