# Matthew 27:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the crowd gathered outside the PrÃ¦toriam, Pilate, caught in a dilemma, seized upon the Passover custom of releasing a prisoner. Unconsciously, Pilate pitted the forces of good and evil against each other by presenting the people with a choice: Barabbas, the criminal, or Jesus, the one called Christ. Pilate's attempt to avoid condemning Jesus was evident, yet by suggesting the release of Barabbas, Pilate unintentionally raised the stakes, unknowingly challenging the weight and importance of Jesus' identity and mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In St. Johnâ€™s narrative, the suggestion of liberating Barabbas seems to come from the Jews themselves; but not necessarily so: he may only be giving, as before, a general report of what passed." 
2. "The when they were gathered together seems to imply that a great crowd had collected outside the PrÃ¦toriam while the trial was going on." 
3. "It is possible that the addition, which is called Christ, which Pilate could hardly have heard from the Jews, may have been familiar to him by his wifeâ€™s mention of Jesus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To put Jesus, as yet uncondemned, on a level with Barabbas, was a crime; a cowardly shirking of responsibility, and a blunder."
2. "Pilate was not 'weak and irresolute;' but baffled in his purpose by superior cunning."
3. "His purpose, like his character, was lacking in moral earnestness; the grand defect of the heathen world at that time."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pilate was catching at straws or seeking any loophole to escape condemning a harmless lunatic or exponent of a superstitious cult." 
2. "So he bethought him of the time-honoured custom at the passover of releasing to the people 'a prisoner whom they wished.'"
3. "Pilate unwittingly pitted against each other two prisoners who represented the antagonistic forces of all time."

### John Gill:
1. "For it was to them the release of a prisoner was to be made, and so the proposal of one; and it was at their option, who should be the person." 
2. "He puts it to them, whom they would choose to have released, Barabbas, the thief and robber, the seditious person and murderer, or Jesus, whom some called the Christ, the Messiah, the king of the Jews."
3. "His view was not to reproach Christ, by joining him with so wicked a man, but in order to save him."
