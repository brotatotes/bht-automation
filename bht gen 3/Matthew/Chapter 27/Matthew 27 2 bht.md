# Matthew 27:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pontius Pilate, the governor, ordinarily resided in Caesarea but during the feast, in Jerusalem. The Jews took Jesus to Pilate, all a form and a farce. He had been bound in the garden and may have been unbound before Caiaphas. Pilate had an unyielding disposition, often leading to revolts among the Jews. The Jews did not enter themselves, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover, and they wanted Jesus to die the death of the cross.
