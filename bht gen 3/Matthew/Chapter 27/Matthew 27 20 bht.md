# Matthew 27:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd, incited by the chief priests, vehemently called for the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus, causing Pilate to hesitate. Their manipulative tactics convinced the people to abandon justice and blindly follow the desires of their rulers. The death of Jesus was not the result of universal animosity, but rather the majority's eagerness to appease their leaders and satisfy their own wicked intentions. Releasing Barabbas alone would not have sufficed, as their thirst for Jesus' blood drove their demand for his destruction.
