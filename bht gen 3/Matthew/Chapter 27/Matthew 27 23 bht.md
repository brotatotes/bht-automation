# Matthew 27:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate's feeble protest reveals a flickering conscience, as he argues with the mob in a gladiatorial manner, like a lynching fiasco. Despite his genuine desire to release Jesus, he is forced to negotiate with a godless alliance. Not a single proven criminal act is presented against Jesus, as Pilate acknowledges His innocence. Yet, the more Pilate pleads for Him and attests His faultlessness, the more outrageous and urgent the clamor becomes to have Him crucified.
