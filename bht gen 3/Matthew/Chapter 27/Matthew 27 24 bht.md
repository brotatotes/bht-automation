# Matthew 27:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Recognizing the significance of washing hands as a ritualistic symbol of innocence from bloodguiltiness, Pilate seized upon this act to declare himself blameless, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous manâ€¦ see ye to it. However, this act of washing hands did not absolve him of guilt. As a magistrate, Pilate was obligated to release the innocent, yet he chose to sanction the unjust crucifixion, thus condemning himself while attempting to avoid the consequences of his decision.
