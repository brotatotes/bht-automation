# Matthew 27:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jewish people, in declaring His blood be on us and on our children, show their consciousness of guilt and a recognition of the severity of their actions. They cannot wash away the blood of Jesus from their hands, as the consequences of their imprecation are evident in the destruction and persecution that has befallen them. However, there remains hope for redemption through the cleansing and healing power of Christ's blood when they turn to Him in repentance.
