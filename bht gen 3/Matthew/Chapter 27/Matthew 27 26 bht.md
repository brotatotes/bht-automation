## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Our Lord, being about to be put to death after the manner of a slave, was also treated as a slave as one of the lowest and most despised of mankind."
2. "...he gave him up as a judge, when he ought to have saved his life and might have done it."
3. "Pilate, therefore, as well as the Jews, was answerable to God for the death of the Savior of the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "But both of these things must be observed, that a compliance was forced from him contrary to his will, and yet that he exercised the office of a judge in condemning him whom he pronounces to be innocent."
2. "For if the Son of God had not been free from all sin, we would have had no right to look for satisfaction from his death; and, on the other hand, if he had not become our surety, to endure the punishment which we had deserved, we would now have been involved in the condemnation of our sins."
3. "But as this is a display of the dreadful vengeance of God, so, on the other hand, it holds out to us the most abundant grounds of confidence; for we have no reason to fear that our sins, from which the Son of God acquits us by so valuable a ransom, will ever again be brought into judgment before God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The guilty one was released, and the innocent one entered upon his punishment."
2. "The State became a tool in the hands of an apostate and bloodthirsty Church."
3. "Pilateâ€™s conduct is an awful warning to rulers, who to gain popularity pander to religious fanaticism."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pilate apparently lost interest in Jesus when he discovered that he had no friends in the crowd."
2. "The scourging before the crucifixion was a brutal Roman custom."
3. "The scourging was part of the capital punishment."

### John Gill:
1. "This man was an emblem of the persons for whom Christ suffered, both in his character and in his release."
2. "And when he had scourged Jesus... this kind of whipping, was very severe and cruel."
3. "This scourging of Christ, was an emblem of the scourges and strokes of divine justice, which he endured in his soul, as the surety of his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "The person crucified was nailed to the cross as it lay on the ground, through each hand extended to the utmost stretch, and through both the feet together."
2. "Then the cross was raised up, and the foot of it thrust with a violent shock into a hole in the ground prepared for it."
3. "This shock disjointed the body, whose whole weight hung upon the nails, till the persons expired through mere dint of pain."
