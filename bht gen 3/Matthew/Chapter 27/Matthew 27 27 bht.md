# Matthew 27:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers gathered in the praetorium, a palace in Rome, to mock and humiliate Jesus. They took pleasure in the sport of seeing him being scourged. These heathen soldiers delighted in showing their contempt not just for Jesus, but also for the Jews.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Our filthiness deserves that God should hold it in abhorrence, and that all the angels should spit upon us; but Christ, in order to present us pure and unspotted in the presence of the Father, resolved to be spat upon, and to be dishonored by every kind of reproaches."
2. "For this reason, that disgrace which he once endured on earth obtains for us favor in heaven, and at the same time restores in us the image of God, which had been not only stained, but almost obliterated, by the pollutions of sin."
3. "If, therefore, even in the present day, the world insolently mocks at Christ, let us learn to rise above these offenses by elevated faith; and let us not stop to inquire, what unworthy opposition is made to Christ by wicked men, but with what ornaments the Father hath clothed him, with what scepter and with what crown he hath adorned him, so as to raise him high, not only above men, but even above all the angels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Into the palace, or 'praetorium.' The scourging had taken place outside."
2. "Pilate, when in Jerusalem, probably lived in the former palace of Herod, 'on the northern brow of Zion, overlooking the enclosure of the temple, and connected with it by a bridge.'"
