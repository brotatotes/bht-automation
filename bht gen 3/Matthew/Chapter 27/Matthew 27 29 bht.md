# Matthew 27:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus stood before the soldiers, they crafted a crown of thorns, a cruel mockery that served as a symbol of the curse of sin. They added insult to injury by placing a reed in Jesus' hand, a simple stalk of cane grass serving as a counterfeit scepter. The soldiers kneeled before Him, not in genuine adoration, but in false homage, hailing Him as the King of the Jews. In this act of mockery, the crown of thorns and the reed conveyed deeper meaning, highlighting the stark contrast between the weakness of humanity and the unwavering strength of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The acanthus, with its large succulent leaves, is singularly unfit for such a purpose."
2. "Some flexile shrub or plant must be understoodâ€”possibly some variety of the cactus or prickly pear."
3. "Hasselquist, a Swedish naturalist, supposes a very common Plant, naba or nubka of the Arabs, with many small and sharp spines; soft, round, and pliant branches; leaves much resembling ivy, of a very deep green, as if in designed mockery of a victorâ€™s wreath."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A crown of thorns. This would wound as well as mock Him, though the latter was the chief design."
2. "And a reed in his right hand, as a mock sceptre. The original, according to the best authorities, represents the passive demeanor of Christ, as if His hand did not close on the reed."
3. "They bowed the knee. In feigned homage, greeting Him in the usual form: Hail, King of the Jews! A symbolical meaning may be found in all this mock-adoration."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A crown of thorns... It was more like a victor's garland than a royal diadem, but it served the purpose."
2. "So with the reed, a stalk of common cane grass which served as sceptre."
3. "The soldiers added the insults used by the Sanhedrin, spitting on him and smiting him with the reed."

### John Gill:
1. "The crown of thorns... had its significance, and was an emblem... either of wicked men, and of his being encompassed with them at this time; or of good men, chosen out from among them, redeemed by him, and accounted as a royal diadem with him."
2. "This may teach us many useful lessons: we may see what a curse sin brought upon man... we may observe the difference between us and Christ: we are a crown of glory... he was crowned with thorns."
3. "Christ does not disdain to hold a reed in his hand: nor will he break the bruised reed, or discourage, or crush the weakest believer."
