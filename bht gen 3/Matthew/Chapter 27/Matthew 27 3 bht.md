# Matthew 27:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Perhaps this unhappy man expected that, while he got the bribe, the Lord would miraculously escape, as He had once and again done before, out of His enemies' power. However, his possession of the bribe lashes him with such intensity that he cannot even use it, a remarkable illustration of the power of an awakened conscience. His remorse, though, does not lead to true repentance unless it includes a change of mind and life. True repentance is driven by a love and fear of God and produces a desire for righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Perhaps this unhappy man expected, that, while he got the bribe, the Lord would miraculously escape, as He had once and again done before, out of His enemies' power..."
2. "But perhaps this unhappy man expected, that, while he got the bribe, the Lord would miraculously escape, as He had once and again done before, out of His enemies' power: and if so, his remorse would come upon him with all the greater keenness."
3. "A remarkable illustration of the power of an awakened conscience. A short time before, the promise of this sordid pelf was temptation enough to his covetous heart to outweigh the most overwhelming obligations of duty and love; now, the possession of it so lashes him that he cannot use it, cannot even keep it!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'repented himself,' it has been observed, does not of necessity denote a change 'for the better,' but 'any' change of views and feelings."
2. "Here it evidently means no other change than that produced by the horrors of a guilty conscience, and by deep remorse for crime at its unexpected results."
3. "Assuredly such a man could not be a true penitent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What is that to us? They ignore the question of Christ 's innocence."
2. "As to Judas ' sin or conscience, that is his matter."
3. "Thou wilt see to that."

### John Calvin:
1. "True repentance is displeasure at sin, arising out of fear and reverence for God, and producing, at the same time, a love and desire of righteousness."
2. "Wicked men are far from such a feeling; for they would desire to sin without intermission, and even, as far as lies in their power, they endeavor to deceive both God and their own conscience."
3. "The former, therefore, while they have no hatred to sin, not only dread, but fly from the judgment of God, and thus, having received an incurable wound, they perish in the midst of their sorrows."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That Judas did not expect this issue, seems contrary to the words of his confession (Matthew 27:4). This circumstance shows that his object was not to induce Jesus to display His glory; in that case his repentance would have led him to Christ and not to suicide."
2. "Remorse is caused by the consequences of sin; repentance is only occasioned by them; in remorse the sorrow is for the consequences, in repentance for the cause, and the sin itself."
3. "The bringing back of the money really supports the view that his one great motive was avarice. Remorse, calling for rectification before men, would point to the moving cause of his crime."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This verb (first aorist passive participle of Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Î¼ÎµÎ»Î¿Î¼Î±) really means to be sorry afterwards like the English word repent from the Latin repoenitet, to have pain again or afterwards."
2. "The word does not have an evil sense in itself."
3. "But mere sorrow avails nothing unless it leads to change of mind and life (Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Î½Î¿Î¹Î±), the sorrow according to God."

### John Gill:
1. "When he saw that he was condemned... finding that his master was condemned to death... and seeing him leading to the place of execution, repented himself..."
2. "It did not spring from the love of God, as evangelical repentance does, nor proceed in the fear of God, and his goodness; but was no other than a foretaste of that worm that dieth not, and of that fire which cannot be quenched..."
3. "Judas's repentance was without hope of forgiveness, and was nothing else but horror and black despair, like that of Cain's, like the trembling of devils, and the anguish of damned souls."

### John Wesley:
1. Then Judas seeing that he was condemned â€” Which probably he thought Christ would have prevented by a miracle.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Perhaps this unfortunate man expected that, while he received the bribe, the Lord would miraculously escape, as He had done before, out of His enemies' power, which would only increase his remorse. This illustrates the power of an awakened conscience, as the possession of the bribe lashes him with such intensity that he cannot even use or keep it. The verb used to describe his remorse means to be sorry afterwards, but it doesn't have an evil sense in itself. However, mere sorrow is insufficient unless it leads to a change of mind and life, a true repentance. So, while Judas repented himself, it was remorse without hope of forgiveness, akin to horror and black despair, rather than true repentance driven by love and fear of God's judgment and goodness.
