# Matthew 27:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was led outside the city, just as executions often took place outside the camp or city. This was the custom both among the Jews and the Romans. Pilate, although not weak or indecisive, lacked moral principles in his actions, reflecting the corrupt culture of the time. Jesus, resembling a lamb going to slaughter, made no defense for himself despite false accusations. He was denied the opportunity to speak and was taken from the judgment hall by a man holding linen clothes and standing near a horse.
