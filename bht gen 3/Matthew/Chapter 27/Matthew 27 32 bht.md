# Matthew 27:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Weakened by the previous events, Jesus was unable to bear his own cross, prompting the soldiers to compel Simon of Cyrene to carry it. The Evangelists go to great lengths to mention Simon's name, his country, and even his children, highlighting how God ennobled a man from the lowest ranks of society for this infamous task. As Simon takes up the burden of Christ's cross, it serves as a reminder that following Jesus requires us to bear our own crosses, even when it goes against our human nature.

2. "Now the Evangelists relate that the soldiers constrained a man who was a peasant, and of mean rank, to carry the cross; because that punishment was reckoned so detestable, that every person thought himself polluted, if he only happened to put his hand to it."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Previously, Jesus had borne his own cross, but now, weakened by the events leading up to this moment, he could no longer bear the weight. In his place, the soldiers compelled, or rather impressed, Simon of Cyrene, a man coming from the country, to carry the cross. Simon, a peasant of humble rank, was chosen for this detestable task, highlighting the disgrace associated with crucifixion. Yet, in mentioning his name, country, and even his children, the Evangelists acknowledge God's elevation of Simon from the lowest dregs of society to an important role in Christ's journey to the cross. Just as Jesus went without the camp to suffer without the gate, Simon, an ordinary man, was called to participate in the extraordinary act of bearing Christ's cross. Thus, the act of taking up the cross and following Christ, though difficult and repugnant to our human nature, is a necessary part of our journey as believers.
