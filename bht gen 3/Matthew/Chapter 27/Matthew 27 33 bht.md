## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The name does not import a place of skulls, but a place of a skull or simply a skull."
2. "Many understand it as applying to the shape of the hill or rock."
3. "Neither does this seem satisfactory, as we have no analogy to guide us, and no such hill or rock is known to have existed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Golgotha - This is a Hebrew word, signifying the place of a skull."
2. "The most probable opinion, however, is that it was a place of execution; that malefactors were beheaded there or otherwise put to death, and that their bones remained unburied or unburned."
3. "Jesus was put to death out of the city, because capital punishments were not allowed within the walls."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word Calvary comes through the Latin calvaria, meaning skull..." 
2. "The New Testament narrative does not mention a mount or hill. The place was probably a rounded elevation."
3. "The meaning is not, as Tynd., a place of dead men's skulls, but simply skull."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this reason the apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, refers it to an ancient figure of the law."
2. "For the infamy of the place did not hinder him from erecting there a splendid trophy of his victory."
3. "Nor did the offensive smell of the carcasses which lay there hinder the sweet savor of his sacrifice from diffusing itself throughout the whole world, and penetrating even to heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The name is the form then used, for the Hebrew word 'skull'... It is very unlikely that it was the place of execution, and that the name arose from the skulls of the criminals lying there."
2. "The Apostles and Evangelists barely allude to the places of Christ's birth, death, and resurrection... They fixed their eyes upon the great facts themselves, and worshipped the exalted Saviour in heaven, where He lives forever."
3. "It is repugnant to sound Christian feeling to believe that a spot so often profaned and disgraced by the most unworthy superstitions, impostures, and quarrels of Christian sects, should be the sacred spot where the Saviour died for the sins of the race."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Golgotha (Î“Î¿Î»Î³Î¿Î¸Î±). Chaldaic or Aramaic Gulgatha, Hebrew Gulgoleth, place of a skull-shaped mount, not place of skulls." 
2. "Calvary or Golgotha is not the traditional place of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, but a place outside of the city, probably what is now called Gordon's Calvary, a hill north of the city wall which from the Mount of Olives looks like a skull."
3. "The rock-hewn tombs resembling eyes in one of which Jesus may have been buried."

### John Gill:
1. "The true pronunciation is 'Golgoltha', and so it is read in Munster's Hebrew Gospel."
2. "It seems to be so called, because it was the place where malefactors were executed, and afterwards buried; whose bones and skulls in process of time might be dug up, and some of them might lie scattered about in this place."
3. "This place was as infamous as our Tyburn, and to be crucified at 'Golgotha', was as ignominious as to be hanged at Tyburn; which shows what shame and disgrace our Lord was brought, and what he condescended to bear on our account."

### John Wesley:
1. "Golgotha in Syriac signifies a skull or head: it was probably called so from this time." 
2. "Being an eminence upon Mount Calvary, not far from the king's gardens."
3. "A place called Golgotha, that is, the place of a skull."
