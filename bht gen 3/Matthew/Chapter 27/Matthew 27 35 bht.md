## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The cross was an upright pale or beam, intersected by a transverse one at right angles, generally in the shape of a T." 
2. "To this cross, the criminal, being stripped of his clothes, was fixed by nails driven through the hands and (not always, nor perhaps generally, though certainly not seldomâ€”see note at Luke xxiv. 39) through the feet, separate or united."
3. "The body was not supported by the nails, but by a piece of wood which passed between the legs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "After they had driven the nails deeply in the wood, they elevated the cross with the agonizing sufferer on it, and, in order to fix it more firmly in the earth, they let it fall violently into the hole which they had dug to receive it."
2. "This sudden fall gave to the person that was nailed to it a violent and convulsive shock, and greatly increased his sufferings."
3. "Since it was the most ignominious punishment known, so it was the most painful."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the Evangelists exhibit to us the Son of God stripped of his garments, in order to inform us, that by this nakedness we have obtained those riches which make us honorable in the presence of God."
2. "Christ himself permitted his garments to be torn in pieces like a prey, that he might enrich us with the riches of his victory."
3. "It serves also to remove the offense with which the sense of the flesh might otherwise have regarded his nakedness, since he suffered nothing which the Holy Spirit does not declare to belong truly and properly to the person of the Redeemer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Men may honestly differ in their statements of the doctrine of the Atonement, but that our Lord then and there so suffered for men, that by virtue of His death we may be at peace with God, who hates our sins, is the only view that accounts for the facts."
2. "Hence the cross, the instrument of such torture, the sign of such shame, and on that account in itself a hindrance to the gospel among those who saw in it only this, has become the symbol of honor, blessing, and redemption."
3. "Even the superstition that bows to it, however to be deprecated, witnesses that the cross is the centre of the Christian scheme."

### John Gill:
1. "This death was not only painful and cruel, but exceedingly shameful and ignominious."
2. "Their canons run thus: when he is four cubits off of the place of stoning, they strip off his garments; a man they cover before, a woman both behind and before..."
3. "So our Lord was crucified; his clothes were a perquisite of the soldiers...and they parted them into four parts, and then cast lots whose each part should be."

### John Wesley:
1. "They parted his garments â€” This was the custom of the Romans. The soldiers performed the office of executioners, and divided among them the spoils of the criminals."
2. "My vesture â€” That is, my inner garment."
3. "Psalm 22:18."
