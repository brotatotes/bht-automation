# Matthew 27:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These two robbers, possibly from Barabbas' group, were condemned and crucified next to Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy that he would be numbered with transgressors. By being crucified between these men, Jesus was associated with them and elevated above them in mockery. This highlighted the ironic title King of the Jews, with the robbers symbolizing the subjects of such a king. This act reveals the weight of God's wrath against sin and the immeasurable love of Christ, who allowed himself to be identified with the wicked to bring us into the fellowship of the holy angels.

2. "If this was so ordered by Pilate, it might be done in order to cover the sin, and take off the reproach of putting an innocent person to death, suggesting hereby he was one of them; though this seems rather to be done by the Jews, the soldiers agreeing to it, for the greater reproach of Jesus."
3. "The grand reason why it was so ordered, was, that though Christ was no transgressor, he was accounted one, and stood in the room and stead of sinners, and was numbered with them, and as such was treated by divine justice, and accordingly died for them."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 15:27; Luke 23:32.
