# Matthew 27:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What a testimony this to Jesus! Guilty or innocent is nothing to us: We have Him nowâ€”begone! Was ever speech more hellish uttered? Judas made a confession of his sin in betraying innocent blood to the Sanhedrin, but not to God, nor to Jesus. The Sanhedrin ignore the innocent or righteous blood and tell Judas to look after his own guilt himself. The sentiment is that of Cain. Judas not only confesses that he has sinned, but asserts the innocence of Christ; from which it follows that they were guilty of a detestable murder.
