# Matthew 27:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Jesus hung on the cross, the crowd taunted him, saying, If thou art a son of God, echoing his claim before the Sanhedrin and misrepresenting his words about the temple of his body. It was a pitiful depiction of human depravity and failure in the presence of Christ giving his life for sinners. The crowd demanded proof of his power, suggesting that if he could destroy the temple, he could save himself. However, Jesus' true testament as the Son of God would be revealed through his resurrection, the ultimate sign of his divinity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou that destroyest the temple... Meaning, Thou that didst boast that thou couldst do it."
2. "This was one of the things that had been falsely charged on him."
3. "If he could destroy the 'temple,' they thought he might easily come down from the cross."

### John Calvin:
1. "But our duty is to wait for the proper season of the promised building, and not to take it ill if we are now crucified with Christ, that we may afterwards be partakers of his resurrection."
2. "Wicked men demand from Christ such a proof of His power that, by proving himself to be the Son of God, he may cease to be the Son of God."
3. "Let us allow God to conceal his power, whenever it pleases Him to do so, that he may afterwards display it at his pleasure at the proper time and place."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thou that destroyest the temple, etc. The testimony before the Sanhedrin (chap. Matthew 26:61) was taken up by the citizens of Jerusalem, who were proud of their temple. Such taunting of one executed has been repeated often enough, and does not, in itself, show that these spectators were worse than the mass of men."
2. "Save thyself. Power to destroy the temple implies power to do this."
3. "If thou art the Son of God. Another reference to the proceedings before the Sanhedrin (chap. Matthew 26:64). The taunt is in a poetic form (Hebrew parallelism); and the crowds at an execution in the east are said to give vent to their feelings in this way still."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If thou art a son of God... now hurled at Jesus under the devil's prompting as he hung upon the Cross." 
2. "There is allusion, of course, to the claim of Jesus under oath before the Sanhedrin 'the Son of God' and a repetition of the misrepresentation of his words about the temple of his body."
3. "It is a pitiful picture of human depravity and failure in the presence of Christ dying for sinners."

### John Gill:
1. "They reproach him with it, and suggest, that these were vain and empty boasts of his; for if he was able to do any thing of that kind, he need not hang upon the tree, but could easily save himself."
2. "Seeing his followers believed in him as the Son of God, and he had owned himself to be so before the sanhedrim, they require a sign of it by his power, and to do that which they believed no mere man in his situation could do; which shows, that they had no other notion of the Son of God, but that he was a divine person."
3. "But his sonship was not to be declared by his coming down from the cross, which he could have easily effected, but by a much greater instance of power, even by his resurrection from the dead; and no other but that sign was to be given to that wicked and perverse generation."
