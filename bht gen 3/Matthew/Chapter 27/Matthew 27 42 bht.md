# Matthew 27:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers' mocking taunts towards Jesus on the cross revealed a bitter irony. They acknowledged that Jesus had saved others through his miracles, yet questioned why he could not save himself. This ironic statement, although spoken in sarcasm, unwittingly highlighted the purpose of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  42.] St. Luke gives, more exactly, the second reproach in this verse as proceeding from the soldiers.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. He saved others, etc. The Greek order is, Others he saved; himself he cannot save.


### John Calvin:
1. "Let us, on the contrary, that our faith may firmly rely on Christ, seek a foundation in his cross."
2. "For the Jews, in consequence of having imagined to themselves a King who had been suggested to them by their own senses, rejected Christ crucified, because they reckoned it absurd to believe in him; while we regard it as the best and highest reason for believing, that he voluntarily subjected himself on our account to the ignominy of the cross."
3. "And it is too customary with all wicked men to estimate the power of God by present appearances, so that whatever he does not accomplish they think that he cannot accomplish, and so they accuse him of weakness, whenever he does not comply with their wicked desire."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He saved others. This may be ironical, or it is a recognition of His miracles of mercy, to taunt Him with a supposed loss of power just when He needed it most for Himself. His very mercy is used in mockery."
2. "He is the king of Israel, etc. Ironical, with a mocking suggestion of still being open to the proof of His Messiahship."
3. "And we will believe on him. Unless there was an atoning purpose in Christâ€™s death, it will always seem strange that He did not offer some such miraculous proof of His power. The soldiers repeated this reproach, but of course without this last clause (see Luke 23:36-37)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He saved others; himself he cannot save. The sarcasm is true, though they do not know its full significance."
2. "If he had saved himself now, he could not have saved any one."
3. "Christ will not give new proofs to the blind in heart."

### John Gill:
1. "He came not to save himself, but others, and to save them spiritually and eternally by dying himself."
2. "He could easily have caused the nails to have given way, and unloosed himself, and come down, who had done such mighty works among them."
3. "If he had, there is no reason to conclude they would have believed him to be the Son of God, and the true Messiah; for though after this, he did a much greater work, raised himself from the dead, of which they had the fullest evidence, yet they remained unbelieving."
