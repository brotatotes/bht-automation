# Matthew 27:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Others he saved; himself he cannot save. This paradoxical taunt reveals the irony of the situation. Jesus had saved others through his miracles, yet in this moment he did not save himself. His rejection of saving himself is in line with his philosophy of life, as he did not come to save himself but to save others. By not delivering himself from death, Jesus shows that he came to save others spiritually and eternally; had he saved himself, there would be no reason to believe in him as the true Messiah.
