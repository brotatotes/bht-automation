# Matthew 27:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people's mockery, challenging Jesus to prove his identity as God's Son by having God rescue him, echoes the language of Psalm 22:8, which describes the gestures of those who mocked the suffering servant. Although the priests argue that God doesn't love those he appears to forsake, Jesus' suffering and death actually secure our salvation. Their claim that Jesus isn't the Son of God because he fulfills his Father's will is baseless, as God's love cannot be limited to a single moment in time.
