# Matthew 27:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The darkness that shrouded the earth during Christ's crucifixion was not a mere coincidence or natural phenomenon; it was a sign of both nature and God showing sympathy for the suffering Son. This darkness, witnessed by all three Evangelists, highlights the significance of the event. While some may argue it was an ordinary eclipse, its timing and duration suggest supernatural intervention. This dense darkness for three hours symbolizes the amazement and shock of nature and the Creator at the depth of wickedness displayed in the crucifixion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Those whose belief leads them to reflect WHO was then suffering, will have no difficulty in accounting for these signs of sympathy in Nature, nor in seeing their applicability."
2. "The consent, in the same words, of all three Evangelists, must silence all question as to the universal belief of this darkness as a fact."
3. "Whether these words are to be taken in all their strictness is doubtful. Of course, over the whole globe the darkness would not be supernaturalâ€”as it would be night naturally over half of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The only cause of this was the interposing power of God - furnishing testimony to the dignity of the sufferer, and causing the elements to sympathize with the pains of his dying Son." 
2. "A thick darkness, shutting out the light of day, and clothing every object with the gloom of midnight, was the appropriate drapery with which the world should be clad when the Son of God expired."
3. "This darkness was noticed by one at least of the pagan writers. Phlegon, a Roman astronomer, speaking of the 14th year of the reign of Tiberius, which is supposed to be that in which our Saviour died, says 'that the greatest eclipse of the sun that was ever known happened then, for the day was so turned into night that the stars appeared.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus the majesty of Christ was attested by the obscuration of the sun, by the earthquake, by the splitting of the rocks, and the rending of the veil, as if heaven and earth were rendering the homage which they owed to their Creator."
2. "I rather think that, as stupidity had shut the eyes of that people against the light, the darkness was intended to arouse them to consider the astonishing design of God in the death of Christ."
3. "Meanwhile, let us learn that, when they were bewitched by the enchantments of Satan, the glory of God, however manifest, was afterwards hidden from them, or, at least, that their minds were darkened, so that, seeing they did not see."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It could not have been an ordinary eclipse, for the moon was full that day."
2. "It was a miraculous occurrence designed to exhibit the amazement of nature and or the God of nature at the wickedness of the crucifixion."
3. "Either God is suffering, and the world sympathizes with Him, or else the world is hurrying to destruction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The crucifixion began at the third hour Jewish time or nine A.M. The darkness began at noon, the sixth hour Jewish time and lasted till 3 P.M. Roman time, the ninth hour Jewish time."
2. "The dense darkness for three hours could not be an eclipse of the sun and Luke (Luke 23:45) does not so say, only 'the sun's light failing.'"
3. "One need not be disturbed if nature showed its sympathy with the tragedy of the dying of the Creator on the Cross (Romans 8:22), groaning and travailing until now."

### John Gill:
1. "This darkness that was over the earth at the time of Christ's sufferings, was, no doubt, an addition to them; the sun, as it were, hiding its face, and refusing to afford its comforting light and heat to him."
2. "It was an emblem of the judicial blindness and darkness of the Jewish nation; and signified, that now was the hour and power of darkness, or the time for the prince of darkness, with his principalities and powers, to exert himself."
3. "It was a representation of that darkness that was now on the soul of Christ, expressed in the following verse; as well as of the eclipse of him, the sun of righteousness, of the glory of his person, both by his incarnation, and by his sufferings."

### John Wesley:
1. "Either the God of nature suffers, or the frame of the world is dissolved."
2. "By this darkness God testified his abhorrence of the wickedness which was then committing."
3. "It likewise intimated Christ's sore conflicts with the Divine justice, and with all the powers of darkness."
