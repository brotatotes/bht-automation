## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His inner consciousness of union with God must have been complete and indestructibleâ€”but, like His higher and holy will, liable to be obscured by human weakness and pain." 
2. "We must however take care not to ascribe all his suffering to bodily pain, however cruel: his soul was in immediate contact with â€˜and prospect of deathâ€”the wages of sin, which He had taken on Him, but never committedâ€”and the conflict at Gethsemane was renewed."
3. "In the words however, â€˜My Godâ€™â€”there speaks the same union with the divine Will, and abiding in the everlasting covenant purpose, as in those, â€˜Not my will, but thine.â€™ These are the only words on the Cross related by St. Matt. and St. Markâ€”and they are related by none besides."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This expression is one denoting intense suffering."
2. "His sufferings were accumulated sufferings, and the design of the atonement seemed to require that he should suffer all that human nature 'could be made to endure' in so short a time."
3. "It was the manifestation of Godâ€™s hatred of sin, in some way which he has not explained, that he experienced in that dread hour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The approach of the Sabbath, and then its actual commencement, were announced by threefold blasts."
2. "The first three blasts were blown when one-third of the evening-sacrifice service was over."
3. "About 3 P. M. on Friday."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though in the cry which Christ uttered a power more than human was manifested, yet it was unquestionably drawn from him by intensity of sorrow."
2. "For not only did he offer his body as the price of our reconciliation with God, but in his soul also he endured the punishments due to us."
3. "No one who considers that Christ undertook the office of Mediator on the condition of suffering our condemnation, both in his body and in his soul, will think it strange that he maintained a struggle with the sorrows of death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The agony resembles that in Gethsemane, but seems even more intense."
2. "The casting lots for His garments is a fulfilment of Matthew 27:18."
3. "This was an experience of sin and death in their inner connection and universal significance for the race, by One who was perfectly pure and holy, a mysterious and indescribable anguish of the body and the soul in immediate prospect of, and in actual wrestling with, death as the wages of sin and the culmination of all misery of man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
2. "This cry of desolation...the depth of his suffering of soul."
3. "John 3:16 comes to our relief...the Son of God bearing the sin of the world."

### John Gill:
1. "He calls him his God, not as he was God, but as he was man."
2. "He made not this expostulation out of ignorance: he knew the reason of it, and that it was not out of personal disrespect to him, or for any sin of his own..."
3. "The condescending grace of Christ is here to be seen, that he, who was the word, that was with God from everlasting, and his only begotten Son that lay in his bosom, that he should descend from heaven by the assumption of human nature, and be for a while forsaken by God, to bring us near unto him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord's great agony probably continued these three whole hours, at the conclusion of which be thus cried out, while he suffered from God himself what was unutterable."
2. "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? â€” Our Lord hereby at once expresses his trust in God, and a most distressing sense of his letting loose the powers of darkness upon him..."
3. "...withdrawing the comfortable discoveries of his presence, and filling his soul with a terrible sense of the wrath due to the sins which he was bearing."
