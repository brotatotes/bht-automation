## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This was not said by the Roman soldiers, who could know nothing of Elias; nor was it a misunderstanding of the Jewish spectators, who must have well understood the import of Eli, nor again was it said in any apprehension, from the supernatural darkness, that Elias might really come." 
2. "But it was replied in intended mockery, as the contemptuous This man,â€” 'this one among the three,'â€”clearly indicates." 
3. "This is one of the cases where those who advocate an original Hebrew Gospel of Matthew are obliged to suppose that the Greek translator has retained the original words, in order to make the reason of the reply clear."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The taunt would be more cutting, because it was the universal belief of the Jews, as well as the doctrine of Christ, that 'Elias' would come before the Messiah."
2. "They derided him now, as calling upon 'Elias' when God would not help him."
3. "Or it is possible that this might have been said by some bystanders who did not understand the language in which he spoke, or who might not have been near enough to hear him distinctly."

### John Calvin:
1. "But if the hired brawlers of Antichrist, as well as wicked men existing in the Church, are now found to pervert basely by their calumnies what has been properly said by us, let us not wonder that the same thing should happen to our Head."
2. "This ironical language, therefore â€” or rather this barking of dogs â€” amounts to saying that Christ has no access to God if, by imploring Elijah, he seeks relief in another quarter."
3. "Thus we see that he was tortured on every hand, in order that, overwhelmed with despair, he might abstain from calling on God, which was, to abandon salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is here an allusion to the belief that Elijah would come before the Messiah, and hence a sarcastic denial of His Messiahship."
2. "A real misapprehension of His language, and a fear that Elijah might come, seem improbable."
3. "The resemblance between the word â€˜Eliâ€™ and the name Elijah is very close in the original."

### John Gill:
1. "These could not be the Roman soldiers that said so, who had no notion of Elias."
2. "It seems most likely to be the Jews... wilfully mistook him, with an intent to banter and ridicule him."
3. "They... fancied he was calling for [Elias]."
