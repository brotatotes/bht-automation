### Albert Barnes:

2. "Judas probably passed out of the temple in great haste and perturbation of mind. He sought a place where he might perpetrate this crime."

2. "He throws them into a state of fury, so that, voluntarily cutting themselves off from the hope of salvation, they find no consolation but in death."

1. "In Godâ€™s temple lay the money for which Godâ€™s Son had been sold to death, as a testimony against the Jews."

3. "The kind and manner of his death...falling headlong, he burst asunder the midst, and all his bowels gushed out...or it may be rendered, as it is in the Arabic and Ethiopic versions, 'he was strangled'; and that either by the devil...or by a disease called the squinancy, or quinsy, a suffocation brought upon him by excessive grief, deep melancholy, and utter despair..."

### John Wesley:
1. In that part of the temple where the sanhedrim met.
