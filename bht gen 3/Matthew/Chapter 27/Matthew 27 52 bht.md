## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole transaction was supernatural and symbolic: no other interpretation of it will satisfy even ordinary common sense."
2. "What but the opening of the tombsâ€”the symbolic declaration, that the Death which bad happened had broken the bands of death for ever?"
3. "The bodies of the saints in them did not arise till He rose, and having appeared to many after his resurrection,â€”possibly during the forty days,â€”went up with Him into His glory."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus, in the opening of the graves at the moment of the Redeemer's expiring, there was a glorious symbolical proclamation that the death which had just taken place had 'swallowed up death in victory'".
2. "It must be observed, however, that the resurrection of these sleeping saints was not like those of the widow of Nain's son, of Jairus' daughter, of Lazarus, and of the man who 'revived and stood upon his feet... which were mere temporary recallings of the departed spirit to the mortal body, to be followed by a final departure of it 'till the trumpet shall sound'. But this was a resurrection once for all, to life everlasting; and so there is no room to doubt that they went to glory with their Lord, as bright trophies of His victory over death".
3. "Thus, while it was not deemed fitting that He Himself should appear again in Jerusalem, save to the disciples, provision was made that the fact of His resurrection should be left in no doubt".

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The graves were opened by this earthquake, but the dead in them did not rise until after his resurrection."

3. "The death of saints is often called 'sleep.'"

### John Calvin:

3. "As the time was not fully come when the whole body of the Church should be gathered to its Head, he exhibited in a few persons an instance of the new life which all ought to expect."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The splitting of the rocks by the earthquake and the opening of tombs can be due to the earthquake."
2. "The raising of the bodies of the dead after the resurrection of Jesus which appeared to many in the holy city puzzles many today."
3. "We come back to miracles connected with the birth of Jesus, God's Son coming into the world."

### John Gill:
1. "This was a proof of Christ's power over death and the grave, by dying; when he through death, destroyed him that had the power of it, and abolished death itself; and became the plague of death and the destruction of the grave, taking into his hands the keys of hell and death."
2. "These were saints, and such as slept in Jesus; and of whom he is the first fruits that now rose; and not all, but many of them, as pledges of the future resurrection."
3. "And they rose in the same bodies in which they before lived, otherwise they could not be called their bodies, or known by those to whom they appeared."
