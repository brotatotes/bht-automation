## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. It is to prevent this being supposed, that the qualification after his resurrection is added.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The narrative of Matthew does not determine whether they came to life before Jesus rose, and remained in the tombs, or came to life after he died. The latter is probably the correct opinion."
2. "There is nothing said of the reason why they were raised. It is not improbable to suppose that it was, amid the other wonders attending the death of Jesus, to convince the Jews that he was the Messiah."
3. "Perhaps some who had been his open friends were raised up now as an attestation that he in whom they had believed was the Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "When Matthew bestows on Jerusalem the honorable designation of the holy city, he does not intend to applaud the character of its inhabitants."
2. "Its holiness, which was founded on Godâ€™s adoption, could not be effaced by any corruptions of men."
3. "On the part of man it was profane, and on the part of God it was holy."

### John Gill:
1. "For he was the first that was raised to an immortal life."
2. "These saints, I apprehend, continued on earth until our Lord's ascension, and then joining the retinue of angels, went triumphantly with him to heaven."
3. "as trophies of his victory over sin, Satan, death, and the grave."
