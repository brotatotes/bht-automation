2. "Beholding from afar. At one time a few ventured near the cross (John 19:25-27), but not ‚Äòmany.‚Äô"
3. "Ministering unto him, i.e., while they followed Him. Comp, on this ministry, Luke 8:2. Others, who had followed Him to Jerusalem, are distinguished from these (Mark 15:41), but it is not necessary to suppose there were two separate groups of women."

3. "Matthew does not try to picture the anguish of heart of these noble women nor does he say as Luke (Luke 23:48) does that 'they returned smiting their breasts.' He drops the curtain on that saddest of all tragedies."

### John Gill:
- "None were present excepting John, as can be learnt from the evangelists; but many women, those of the weaker sex, were there, which was a rebuke of the former vanity and confidence of the disciples, and of their present pusillanimity and cowardice."
- "they beheld with an eye of faith, their bleeding, dying Lord, as crucified for them, and as bearing and taking away their sins: a sight which at once stirred up their affection and love to Christ, their concern for him, and sorrow for sin; and yet joy and peace, in believing in him."
- "they attended him in his triumphant entry into Jerusalem, and now at his cross; nor did they leave him when dead, and in his grave."
