## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mother of the sons of Zebedee (i.e. of James and John: not 'of Zebedee's children,' as A.V. curiously renders it) Salome, Mark."
2. "And if this view [that Mary was led away by the beloved Apostle] be objected to, yet she could not be named here, nor in Mark, except separately from these threeâ€”for she could not have been well included among those who ministered to Him."
3. "There must have been also another group, of His disciples, within sight;â€”e.g. Thomas, who said, 'Except I see in his hands the print of the nails,'&c., and generally those to whom He afterwards shewed his hands and feet as a proof of His identity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Among which was Mary Magdalene... and Mary the mother of James and Joses... and the mother of Zebedee's children." 
2. "All this about the women is mentioned for the sake of what is afterwards to be related of their purchasing spices to anoint their Lord's body."
3. "The Women Mark the Sacred Spot that They Might Recognize It on Coming Thither to Anoint the Body."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Mary Magdalene - Mary of Magdala. She had a special cause of attachment to the Saviour, having been relieved by him of a most dreadful calamity and restored to her right mind, after being possessed by seven devils." 
2. "And the mother of Zebedeeâ€™s children - That is, of James and John, Matthew 10:2."
3. "Her name was Salome, Mark 15:40."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Magdalene [Î· Î¼Î±Î³Î´Î±Î»Î·Î½Î·] . Neither Mary of Bethany (Matthew 26:6-13) nor the woman who had been a sinner (Luke 7:37-48). The word denotes merely her town : She of Magdala.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is no evidence that she was the sinful woman who anointed our Lordâ€™s feet in the house of Simon the Pharisee."
2. "The mother of the sons of Zebedee, i.e., â€˜Salomeâ€™... We identify the person spoken of by him as â€˜His ( i.e., Jesus) motherâ€™s sister,â€™ with Salome."
3. "These pious women, who, with the courage of heroes, witnessed the dying moments of their Lord and Master... are the shining examples of female constancy and devotion to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Out of whom Christ had cast out seven devils; and who having received much from him, loved much, which she showed by her zealous and constant attachment to him."
2. "Magdala was famous, or rather infamous, for whoredom; for which reason the Jews say it was destroyed."
3. "Jerom says, her name signifies 'towered', or 'fortified', because of her care and diligence, and the ardour of her faith."

### John Wesley:
1. James â€” The less: he was so called, to distinguish him from the other James, the brother of John; probably because he was less in stature.
