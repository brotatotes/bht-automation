By prioritizing outward appearances and hair-splitting over righteousness, they ignored the severity of their own actions. In their hypocrisy, they were too conscientious about trifling matters, neglecting the immoral bargain that provoked God's vengeance against them. This episode sheds light on how hypocrites prioritize superficial observations over justice and righteousness.
