## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The meaning of the saying may have been, and was, hid from the disciples; but the fact of its having been said could be no secret."
2. "Hatred is keener sighted than love;â€”that the raising of Lazarus would show, what sort of a thing rising the dead was to be."
3. "Till we know much more about the circumstances under which, and the scope with which, each Gospel was compiled, all Ã  priori arguments of this kind are good for nothing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The crucifixion took place on the Friday and all was not over till shortly before sunset, when the Jewish sabbath commenced." 
2. "That day being over at six on Saturday evening, they hastened to take their measures."
3. "That sabbath day was an high day, being the first day of the feast of unleavened bread."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The first day of the feast of the Passover was called the day of 'preparation,' because all things were on that day got in readiness for the observances of the paschal week."
2. "The 'next day' mentioned here does not mean the following day in our acceptation of the word, or the following 'morning,' but the next day in the Jewish way of speaking - that is, after the next day had commenced, or after sundown."
3. "To suppose them to have waited until the next morning would be absurd, as the disciples would be as likely to steal him away the first night as the second."

### John Calvin:
1. "The enemies of Christ were indeed unworthy of having his resurrection made known to them; but it was proper that their insolence should be exposed, and every occasion of slander taken away from them, and that even their consciences should be convinced, so that they might not be held excusable for ignorance."
2. "Yet let us observe that God, as if he had hired them for the purpose, employed their services for rendering the glory of Christ more illustrious..."
3. "...with all persons of correct and sober judgment it was a sufficient testimony that Christ was risen, since his body, which had been placed in a grave, and protected by guards who surrounded it on all sides, was not to be found."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The day of the preparation was Friday, as is plain from Mark 15:45."
2. "The first day of the Passover (Friday) was in one sense a Sabbath, hence this designation is more definite."
3. "While our Lord rested in the tomb, they desecrated the Sabbath, despite their great scrupulousness."

### John Gill:
1. "It shows what consciences these men had, who accused the disciples of Christ of a violation of the Sabbath, for plucking a few ears of corn on that day; and yet they themselves could leave their devotions, and first meet together and agree upon an address to Pilate, and then go in a body to his palace." 
2. "They feared his resurrection; and though they could not prevent the thing, they consult to hinder the credit of it."
3. "These were the inveterate and implacable enemies of Christ; they took counsel how to put him to death; they employed Judas to betray him, and sent a band of soldiers with him to take him."

### John Wesley:
1. "The day of preparation was the day before the Sabbath, whereon they were to prepare for the celebration of it."
2. "The next day then was the Sabbath according to the Jews."
3. "The evangelist seems to express it by this circumlocution, to show the Jewish Sabbath was then abolished."
