## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The meaning of the saying may have been, and was, hid from the disciples; but the fact of its having been said could be no secret."
2. "Hatred is keener sighted than love;â€”that the raising of Lazarus would show, what sort of a thing rising the dead was to be."
3. "Till we know much more about the circumstances under which, and the scope with which, each Gospel was compiled, all Ã  priori arguments of this kind are good for nothing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The crucifixion took place on the Friday and all was not over till shortly before sunset, when the Jewish sabbath commenced." 
2. "That sabbath day was an high day, being the first day of the feast of unleavened bread." 
3. "They hastened to take their measures."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The first day of the feast of the Passover was called the day of 'preparation,' because all things were on that day got in readiness for the observances of the paschal week."
2. "The 'next day' mentioned here does not mean the following day in our acceptation of the word, or the following 'morning,' but the next day in the Jewish way of speaking - that is, after the next day had commenced, or after sundown."
3. "To suppose them to have waited until the next morning would be absurd, as the disciples would be as likely to steal him away the first night as the second."

### John Calvin:
1. "The resurrection of Christ would undoubtedly have been less manifest, or, at least, they would have had more plausible grounds for denying it, if they had not taken pains to station witnesses at the sepulcher."
2. "We see then how the Lord not only disappointeth the crafty, but employs even their own schemes as snares for holding them fast, that he may draw and compel them to render obedience to him."
3. "Yet let us observe that God, as if he had hired them for the purpose, employed their services for rendering the glory of Christ more illustrious."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The morrow, which is the day after the preparation...The first day of the Passover (Friday) was in one sense a Sabbath, hence this designation is more definite." 
2. "While our Lord rested in the tomb, they desecrated the Sabbath, despite their great scrupulousness."
3. "It is urged that this must have taken place on Friday evening after six o'clock...But their anxiety was about the night preceding the third day...This is accounted for, if we suppose that this incident occurred on Saturday, and not on Friday evening after six o'clock."

### John Gill:
1. "And yet they themselves could leave their devotions... and make the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch, which were servile works, and, according to their laws and traditions, not to be done on the sabbath day; and yet they scrupled them not, notwithstanding their characters and profession." 
2. "These were the inveterate and implacable enemies of Christ; they took counsel how to put him to death; they employed Judas to betray him... they got him condemned to death, and followed him to the cross, where they mocked him." 
3. "Though he was dead, they feared his resurrection; and though they could not prevent the thing, they consult to hinder the credit of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The day of preparation was the day before the Sabbath, whereon they were to prepare for the celebration of it."
2. "The next day then was the Sabbath according to the Jews."
3. "The evangelist seems to express it by this circumlocution, to show the Jewish Sabbath was then abolished."
