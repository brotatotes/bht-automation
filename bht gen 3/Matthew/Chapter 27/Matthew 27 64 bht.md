# Matthew 27:64 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders, in their fear of Jesus's claims about rising from the dead, proposed to Pilate that a Roman guard be placed at the sepulchre until the third day, when, if Jesus was still there, it would be obvious to all that his supposed resurrection was a fraud and a deception. They referred to the belief in Jesus as the Messiah as the first error, and stated that the belief in his resurrection would be even worse, in terms of its influence and impact on the people.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The religious leaders, in their fear of Jesus's claims about rising from the dead, proposed to Pilate that a Roman guard be placed at the sepulchre until the third day, when, if Jesus was still there, it would be obvious to all that his supposed resurrection was a fraud and a deception. They referred to the belief in Jesus as the Messiah as the first error, and stated that the belief in his resurrection would be even worse, in terms of its influence and impact on the people. They were concerned that this last error would perpetuate the impression that Jesus was the Messiah and garner even more followers. Thus, their request for the Roman guard served as an attempt to counteract this potential delusion among the people.
