## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sealing was by means of a cord or string passing across the stone at the mouth of the sepulchre, and fastened at either end to the rock by sealing-clay."
2. "Ye haveâ€”the verb rendered may be either 1), indicative, Ye have:â€”but then the question arises, What guard had they?"
3. "Take a body of men for a guard. And to this latter I rather incline: see the note in my Greek Test."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye have a watchâ€”The guards had already acted under orders of the Sanhedrim, with Pilate's consent; but probably they were not clear about employing them as a night watch without Pilate's express authority."
2. "Go your way, make it as sure as ye canâ€”as ye know how, or in the way ye deem securest."
3. "Though there may be no irony in this speech, it evidently insinuated that if the event should be contrary to their wish, it would not be for want of sufficient human appliances to prevent it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews had a guard of Roman soldiers, who kept watch in the tower of Antonia, on the northwest of the temple."
2. "Pilate either referred to these, or to the 'watch' that attended the crucifixion - the whole 'band' that had been appointed for that."
3. "As the torments of crucifixion sometimes lasted many days, the band had been probably granted to them during that time, and they were therefore still at the direction of the chief priests."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Make it sure as ye know how. Not 'as sure as ye can,' nor is it at all ironical."
3. "Pilate shirks the responsibility, but again gives way. Yet this was overruled for good."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
