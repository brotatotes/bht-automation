# Matthew 27:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The enemies of Jesus left no stone unturned in their attempts to prevent His resurrection, sealing the sepulcher and stationing a guard. Little did they know that God would make use of their precautions for His own ends. Their seal-secured tomb would preserve the body of the Son of God in undisturbed repose, while the watch of the guard would unknowingly become a guard of honor. In sealing the stone in the presence of the guard, they unintentionally provided more witnesses to the fact of the empty tomb and the resurrection of Jesus.
