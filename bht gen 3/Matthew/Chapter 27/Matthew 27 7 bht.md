### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Matthew 27:7, we learn that the field purchased with Judas' blood money was the potter's field, a small piece of land rendered useless for farming due to the excavation for clay. This field was known and likely of little value, purchased at a cheap price. It was intended to serve as a burial ground for strangers, including foreign Jews who had come to Jerusalem for the feasts, as the high priests did not want to provide a burial place for Gentiles. However, this field, instead of being a consecrated graveyard, became a desecrated one when Judas used his blood money to acquire it. The purchase of this field for a small sum remains as a lasting reminder of the wickedness and infamy of Judas' actions.
