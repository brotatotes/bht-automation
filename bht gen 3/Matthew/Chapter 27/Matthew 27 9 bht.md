## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The citation is not from Jeremiah (see ref.), and is probably quoted from memory and precisely."
2. "Jer. xviii. 1, 2, or perhaps Jer. xxxii. 6â€“12, may have given rise to it."
3. "The quotation here is very different from the Septuagint,â€”and not much more like the Hebrew."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Never was a complicated prophecy, otherwise hopelessly dark, more marvellously fulfilled."
2. "Perhaps the true explanation is the following, from LIGHTFOOT: 'Jeremiah of old had the first place among the prophets...therefore he is first named.'"
3. "The Veil Rent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Spoken by Jeremy the prophet - The words quoted here are not to be found in the prophecy of Jeremiah."
2. "The passage is not quoted literally; and by its being 'fulfilled' is meant, probably, that the language used by Zechariah on a similar occasion would express also this event."
3. "The price of him that was valued - That is, the price of him on whom a value was set. The word rendered 'valued,' here, does not, as often in our language, mean to 'esteem,' but to 'estimate;' not to love, approve, or regard, but to fix a price on, to estimate the value of."

### John Calvin:
1. "The import of these words is, that he was treated quite contemptuously as if he had been some mean and ordinary laborer."
2. "The meaning is the same, that while the Jews ought to have entirely devoted themselves, and all that they possessed, to the Lord, they contemptuously dismissed him with a mean hire."
3. "The price was such as was fit to be given to a potter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No such words can be found in the book of Jeremiah, but something very similar occurs in Zechariah 11:12. Explanations: (1) Zechariah was changed into Jeremiah. Of this there is no positive proof of any weight, and there is no motive for the change."
2. "The book of Jeremiah, being actually arranged by the Jews as the first of all the prophets, gave its name to the whole body of their writings. This is the simplest view."
3. "We regard the whole as a free adaptation from Zechariah 11:13. Here the prophetâ€™s labors are valued at thirty pieces of silver which he is bidden to cast to the potter in the house of the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This quotation comes mainly from Zechariah 11:13 though not in exact language."
2. "Many theories are offered for the combination of Zechariah and Jeremiah and attributing it all to Jeremiah as in Mark 1:2."
3. "That makes it more parallel with the language of Matthew 27:7."

### John Gill:
1. "The removing of this difficulty, it might be observed, that the Syriac and Persic versions make no mention of any prophet's name, only read, 'which was spoken by the prophet'; and so may as well be ascribed to Zechariah, as to Jeremy, and better."
2. "That the prophecy in Zechariah belongs to the Messiah, and was fulfilled in Jesus, manifestly appears from the context, for as well as the text itself."
3. "Wicked men have no value for Christ; they sell him and themselves for nought; but gracious souls cannot value him enough, nor sufficiently express their esteem of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "What was figuratively represented of old, was now really accomplished."
2. "The word Jeremy... is evidently a mistake."
3. "He who spoke what St. Matthew here cites was not Jeremy, but Zechariah."
