# Matthew 28:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the sabbath was ending, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, accompanied by Salome, went to the sepulchre early in the morning with ointments and spices for Jesus' body. Their promptness reveals their deep love and devotion to him. The grandeur of the impending event was signaled by a great earthquake and the angel of the Lord descending from heaven. It is clear from the chronological statement that their visit took place before the sabbath concluded, as dawn in the Jewish sense refers to the beginning of the twenty-four-hour day at sunset.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This careful chronological statement according to Jewish days clearly means that before the sabbath was over, that is before six P.M., this visit by the women was made 'to see the sepulchre'."

### John Gill:
- "In the end of the sabbath... intends not what the Jews call the sabbath eve, for that began the sabbath; but what they call ◊û◊ï◊¶◊ê◊ô ◊©◊ë◊™, 'the goings out of the sabbath'; and as Mark says, 'when the sabbath was past': that is, when the sun was set, and any stars appeared."
- "Came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, the wife of Cleophas, and mother of James and Joses, with whom also was Salome, the mother of Zebedee's children."
- "From all the accounts it is clear, that he rose, as is expressly said, Mark 16:9, on the first day of the week... he lay in the grave all sabbath day, or Saturday; and rose early on the first day of the week... to see whether they could enter into it, and anoint the body with the spices and ointments, which they had prepared and brought with them for that purpose."
