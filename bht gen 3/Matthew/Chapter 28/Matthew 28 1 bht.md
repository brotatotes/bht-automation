# Matthew 28:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the end of the Sabbath, the women who had prepared spices and ointments for the body of Jesus approached the sepulchre. According to the view that most aligns with other testimonies, their visit took place just before the Sabbath ended, before 6 P.M. Driven by their love for Jesus, they came with the intention to anoint His body. While their visit was prompted by an unconscious hope of the resurrection, it is worth noting that they did not carry the spices with them.

3. "It was to anoint the Body, for which purposes they had bought, since the end of the Sabbath, ointments and spices."

### Albert Barnes:
