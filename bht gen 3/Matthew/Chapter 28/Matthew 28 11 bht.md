# Matthew 28:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simple, unsophisticated soldiers were astounded that their tale of the empty tomb did not immediately convince their terrified employers. Naively, they had approached the Sanhedrin, who had control over them, with the only other explanation they could fathom. The soldiers had been placed at the disposal of the chief priests, and although they told a truthful account to the best of their understanding, the Sanhedrin remained unconvinced of Jesus' resurrection. However, it was possible that the soldiers hoped for a bribe when they truthfully recounted their experiences to the chief priests.
