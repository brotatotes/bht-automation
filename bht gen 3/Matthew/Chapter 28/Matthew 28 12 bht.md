# Matthew 28:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers must have been regarded with contempt by the Jewish ecclesiastics, who gave them sufficient money to bribe them into inventing a lie. The Jewish authorities were desperate to protect themselves, as the guilt of putting Jesus to death was now at stake. They convened a meeting, possibly the grand sanhedrim, and concluded that the best course of action was to bribe the soldiers, even though they knew the power of bribery. This act of malice and desperation reflects their refusal to be convinced by the undeniable truth of Jesus' resurrection.
