# Matthew 28:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chief priests claimed that Jesus' disciples stole His body while the guards were asleep, an offense punishable by death. However, if the soldiers were truly asleep, they wouldn't have discovered the theft or admitted their neglect. The drastic action of the disciples to steal the body covertly, only to spread a false resurrection story, seems illogical. Furthermore, the lack of punishment towards the supposed negligent soldiers calls into question the priests' genuine belief in their own claims.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: According to the first-tier commentary, the chief priests claimed that Jesus' disciples stole His body while the soldiers were asleep, despite such an act being a capital offense. However, the second-tier commentary points out that if the soldiers were truly asleep, they wouldn't have been able to catch the thieves or even acknowledge their own negligence. The skeptical tone of the third-tier commentary highlights the implausibility of this claim, as it questions the intelligence of a group of men risking their lives to steal Jesus' body, only to then spread a lie about His resurrection. The commentators also challenge the chief priests' logic, asking why they didn't punish the soldiers for their supposed failure to stay awake.
