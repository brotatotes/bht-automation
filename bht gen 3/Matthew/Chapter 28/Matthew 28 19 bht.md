2. "This gracious commission was the foundation of their authority to go to the Gentiles. Jesus broke down the partition wall, and commissioned his disciples to go everywhere, and bring the 'world' to the knowledge of himself."
3. "The union of these three names in the form of baptism proves that the Son and Holy Spirit are equal with the Father. Nothing would be more absurd or blasphemous than to unite the name of a creature - a man or an angel - with the name of the ever-living God in this solemn rite."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The priesthood of the New Testament consists in slaying men, as a sacrifice to God, by the spiritual sword of the word. Hence it follows, that all are but pretended and spurious priests who are not devoted to the office of teaching."
3. "There are good reasons why the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are expressly mentioned; for there is no other way in which the efficacy of baptism can be experienced than when we begin with the unmerited mercy of the Father, who reconciles us to himself by the only begotten Son; next, Christ comes forward with the sacrifice of his death; and at length, the Holy Spirit is likewise added, by whom he washes and regenerates us, and, in short, makes us partakers of his benefits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because Christ rules, go, not to conquer men by force, but to work on their hearts make them disciples, docile pupils in the school of Christ."
2. "The 'discipling' consists of two parts: baptism, the rite of admission, and the subsequent instruction. This is the ordinary process in the Christian Church."
3. "It is impossible that this means, the one name of God, of a mere man, and of an attribute of God. It is the one name of One God, existing (as well as manifested), as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is the world program of the Risen Christ and it should not be forgotten by those who seek to foreshorten it all by saying that Jesus expected his second coming to be very soon."
2. "Meanwhile we are to be ready for his coming at any time and to look for it joyfully."
3. "This program includes making disciples or learners (Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Ï„ÎµÏ…ÏƒÎ±Ï„Îµ) such as they were themselves. That means evangelism in the fullest sense and not merely revival meetings."

### John Gill:
1. "Go ye therefore,.... Into all the world; some into one place, and some into another; since his power and authority, and so now the commission he gave them, reached every where: before it was confined to Judea, but now it is extended to all the nations of the world."
2. "make them disciples by teaching them; or, as the Persic version, by way of explanation, adds, 'bring them to my religion and faith': not that they were able to do this of themselves, but they were to teach men externally, or outwardly minister the word, whilst the Spirit of God internally applied it, and taught, and made men true disciples of Christ."
3. "This is the first, and indeed the only, place in which the Trinity of persons is expressed in this order, and in the selfsame words."

### John Wesley:
1. "Disciple all nations â€” Make them my disciples. This includes the whole design of Christ's commission." 
2. "Baptizing and teaching are the two great branches of that general design." 
3. "And these were to be determined by the circumstances of things; which made it necessary in baptizing adult Jews or heathens, to teach them before they were baptized; in discipling their children, to baptize them before they were taught."
