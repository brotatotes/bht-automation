2. "Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This way of speaking is not unfrequent. Thus, Mark and Luke mention only one demoniac who was cured at Gadara. Matthew mentions two. In like manner Mark and Luke speak of only one blind man who was cured at Jericho, while from Matthew it is certain that two were. The fact that but one is mentioned, where it is not denied that there were others, does not prove that there could not be others."
2. "Angels, in the Scriptures, from 'appearing' in the form of human beings, are often called as they 'appear,' and are mentioned as men."
3. "Fear not ye. That is, 'Be not agitated, or troubled, that you do not find the body of the Saviour. I know that ye seek him, and are troubled that he is removed; but you need not fear that he has been stolen. You will see him again in Galilee.'"

3. "Œ∫Œ± œÑŒøœÖœÑŒøŒΩ ŒµœÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœâŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason alleged, by the angel, why they had no reason to fear, is, for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified: the knowledge which angels have of saints is very considerable."
2. "Such as seek a crucified Christ, and life and salvation by him, have no reason to be afraid of anything."
