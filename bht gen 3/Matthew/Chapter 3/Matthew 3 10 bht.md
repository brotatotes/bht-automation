# Matthew 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This speaks of a personal judgment, not the destruction of Jerusalem. The fire mentioned is the future torment of the impenitent, and the word casting represents just indignation. The present tense emphasizes the immediacy and certainty of the impending judgment. The axe laid at the root signifies imminent destruction, and though there may be blossoms without fruit, the preaching of the gospel will continue to advance God's wrath against the wicked. Immediate repentance is necessary to avoid divine vengeance and escape everlasting burnings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Language so personal and individual as this can scarcely be understood of any national judgment like the approaching destruction of Jerusalem, with the breaking up of the Jewish polity and the extrusion of the chosen people from their peculiar privileges which followed it; though this would serve as the dark shadow, cast before, of a more terrible retribution to come." 
2. "The 'fire,' which in another verse is called 'unquenchable,' can be no other than that future 'torment' of the impenitent whose 'smoke ascendeth up for ever and ever,' and which by the Judge Himself is styled 'everlasting punishment'." 
3. "What a strength, too, of just indignation is in that word 'cast' or 'flung into the fire!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Laying the axe at the root of a tree is intended to denote that the tree is to be cut down...a searching, trying kind of preaching has been commenced."
2. "No art, no dissimulation, will be successful: People are to be tried by their lives, not by birth or profession."
