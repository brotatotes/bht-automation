## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The winnowing is at hand: they throw the straw into the fire, the chaff to the wind, but preserve the wheat in the floor; so the nations of the world shall be the conflagration of a furnace: but Israel alone shall be preserved."
2. "The contents of the barn-floor."
3. "Not only the chaff, but also the straw: see reff.: 'all that is not wheat.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is no other than the preaching of the Gospel, even now beginning, the effect of which would be to separate the solid from the spiritually worthless, as wheat, by the winnowing fan, from the chaff." 
2. "His true-hearted saints; so called for their solid worth."
3. "Singular is the strength of this apparent contradiction of figures:â€”to be burnt up, but with a fire that is unquenchable; the one expressing the utter destruction of all that constitutes one's true life, the other the continued consciousness of existence in that awful condition."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His fan - The word used here and rendered 'fan' means a winnowing shovel instead."
2. "By the floor, here, is represented the Jewish people. By the wheat, the righteous, or the people of God. By the chaff, the wicked."
3. "By the unquenchable fire is meant the eternal suffering of the wicked in hell, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9; Mark 9:48; Matthew 25:41."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The whole metaphor represents the Messiah as separating the evil from the good, according to the tests of his kingdom and Gospel, receiving the worthy into his kingdom and consigning the unworthy to destruction."
2. "Throughly (retained by Rev.) obsolete form of thoroughly, is the force of the preposition dia (through). In that preposition lies the picture of the farmer beginning at one side of the floor, and working through to the other, cleansing as he goes."
3. "The picture is of a farmer at his threshing - floor, the area of hard - beaten earth on which the sheaves are spread and the grain trodden out by animals."

2. "The thrashing floor... denotes... the Church... covered with husks, and straws, and other rubbish, but would soon be cleansed by the strong breeze of the Gospel."
3. "Let us lay aside the speculations, by which foolish men weary themselves to no purpose, and satisfy ourselves with believing, that these forms of speech denote... a dreadful torment, which no man can now comprehend, and no language can express."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The thorough cleansing of the floor itself will be completed when the end of the world comes, but the process of winnowing is included, i.e., the disciplinary and punitive leadings of God with men."
2. "His wheat, the fruits of the husbandry, the persons saved, hence 'His.'"
3. "Fire unquenchable. The violent, uncontrollable blaze of a straw fire is the figurative representation of an awful reality. Once begun, the fiery judgment continues, until the unquenchable fire of Gehenna is kindled."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Will burn up with unquenchable fire."
2. "The 'fire' here is probably judgment by and at the coming of the Messiah."
3. "The Messiah 'will thoroughly cleanse', He will sweep from side to side to make it clean."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'fan', here is meant, either the Gospel which Christ was just ready to publish; by which he would effectually call his chosen people among the Jews, and so distinguish and separate them from others, as well as purify and cleanse them."
2. "By 'his floor', is meant the land of Israel, where he was born, brought up, and lived; of which the Lord says, 'O my threshing, and the corn of my floor!'"
3. "By 'the chaff', are meant wicked and ungodly persons, such as are destitute of the grace of God, whether professors, or profane; being empty, barren, and unfruitful; and so good for nothing but the fire, which therefore 'he will burn with unquenchable fire', of divine wrath and vengeance."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whose fan â€” That is, the word of the Gospel."
2. "His floor â€” That is, his Church, which is now covered with a mixture of wheat and chaff."
3. "He will gather the wheat into the garner â€” Will lay up those who are truly good in heaven."
