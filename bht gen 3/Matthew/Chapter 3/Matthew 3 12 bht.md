## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The winnowing is at hand: they throw the straw into the fire, the chaff to the wind, but preserve the wheat in the floor; so the nations of the world shall be the conflagration of a furnace: but Israel alone shall be preserved."
2. "his floor...the contents of the barn-floor."
3. "Not only the chaff, but also the straw: see reff.: ‚Äòall that is not wheat.‚Äô"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is no other than the preaching of the Gospel, even now beginning, the effect of which would be to separate the solid from the spiritually worthless, as wheat, by the winnowing fan, from the chaff."
2. "He will burn up the chaff‚Äîempty, worthless professors of religion, void of all solid religious principle and character."
3. "Singular is the strength of this apparent contradiction of figures:‚Äîto be burnt up, but with a fire that is unquenchable; the one expressing the utter destruction of all that constitutes one's true life, the other the continued consciousness of existence in that awful condition."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His fan - The word used here and rendered 'fan' means a winnowing shovel instead. It was used for throwing the grain, after it was threshed, into the air, so that the chaff might be driven away by the wind."
2. "The grain was usually trodden out by oxen. Sometimes it was beaten with flails, as with us; and sometimes with a sharp threshing instrument, made to roll over the grain and to cut the straw at the same time."
3. "By the unquenchable fire is meant the eternal suffering of the wicked in hell, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9; Mark 9:48; Matthew 25:41."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Throughly cleanse [Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅŒπŒµŒπ]. Throughly (retained by Rev.) obsolete form of thoroughly, is the force of the preposition dia (through)."
2. "In that preposition lies the picture of the farmer beginning at one side of the floor, and working through to the other, cleansing as he goes."
3. "The whole metaphor represents the Messiah as separating the evil from the good, according to the tests of his kingdom and Gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "The preaching of the Gospel, then, is the winnowing-fan...when he reproves the consciences and summons them to the tribunal of God, the chaff is sifted out, which formerly occupied a great part of the thrashing-floor."
2. "The thrashing floor accordingly denotes - not the world, but the Church...John tells them that it is foolish in them to be proud of it because they hold but a temporary place in the Church of God, from which they are soon to be thrown out, like chaff from the thrashing-floor."
3. "But let us remember, that believers even now enter, by hope, into the granary of God, in which they will actually have their everlasting abode; while the reprobate experience, in their convictions of guilt, the heat of that fire, the actual burning of which they will feel at the last day."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The thorough cleansing of the floor itself will be completed when the end of the world comes, but the process of winnowing is included, i.e., the disciplinary and punitive leadings of God with men."
2. "His wheat, the fruits of the husbandry, the persons saved."
3. "Fire unquenchable. The violent, uncontrollable blaze of a straw fire is the figurative representation of an awful reality."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Will burn up with unquenchable fire." 
2. "The 'fire' here is probably judgment by and at the coming of the Messiah." 
3. "The Messiah 'will thoroughly cleanse.' He will sweep from side to side to make it clean."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'fan', here is meant, either the Gospel which Christ was just ready to publish; by which he would effectually call his chosen people among the Jews, and so distinguish and separate them from others, as well as purify and cleanse them, or rather the awful judgment of God, which Christ was ready to execute, and in a short time would execute on the unbelieving and impenitent Jews."
2. "By 'his floor', is meant the land of Israel, where he was born, brought up, and lived... This, he says, 'he will thoroughly purge' of all his refuse and chaff, that is, by fanning: so fanning and cleansing, or purging, are joined together."
3. "By 'the chaff', are meant wicked and ungodly persons, such as are destitute of the grace of God, whether professors, or profane; being empty, barren, and unfruitful; and so good for nothing but the fire, which therefore 'he will burn with unquenchable fire', of divine wrath and vengeance."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whose fan ‚Äî That is, the word of the Gospel."
2. "His floor ‚Äî That is, his Church, which is now covered with a mixture of wheat and chaff."
3. "He will gather the wheat into the garner ‚Äî Will lay up those who are truly good in heaven."
