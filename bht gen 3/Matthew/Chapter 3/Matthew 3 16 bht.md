## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Holy Spirit descended not only in the manner of a dove, but in bodily shape (||Luke): which I cannot understand in any but the literal sense, as THE BODILY SHAPE OF A DOVE, seen by the Baptist."
2. "The Spirit as manifested in our Lord was gentle and benign. This was not a sudden and temporary descent of the Spirit, but a permanent though special anointing of the Saviour for his holy office."
3. "The anointing and crowning are but signs of the official assumption of the power which the king has by a right independent of, and higher than these."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lo, I come; I delight to do Thy will, O God. Father, glorify Thy name. Show Me a token for good. Let the Spirit of the Lord God come upon Me, and I will preach the Gospel to the poor, and heal the broken-hearted, and send forth judgment unto victory."
2. "But the fourth Gospel gives us one more piece of information here, on the authority of one who saw and testified of it: 'John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and IT ABODE UPON HIM.'"
3. "And when with this we compare the predicted descent of the Spirit upon Messiah (Isaiah 11:2), 'And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him,' we cannot doubt that it was this permanent and perfect resting of the Holy Ghost upon the Son of Godâ€”now and henceforward in His official capacityâ€”that was here visibly manifested."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ordinances of religion will be commonly ineffectual without prayer. If in those ordinances we look to God, we may expect that he will bless us; the heavens will be opened, light will shine upon our path, and we shall meet with the approbation of God."
2. "The expression, 'the heavens were opened,' is one that commonly denotes the appearance of the clouds when it lightens. The heavens appear to open or give way. Something of this kind probably appeared to John at this time."
3. "The form chosen here was doubtless an emblem of the innocence, meekness, and tenderness of the Saviour. The gift of the Holy Spirit, in this manner, was the public approbation of Jesus and a sign of his being set apart to the office of the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The dove was an ancient symbol of purity and innocence, adopted by our Lord in Matthew 10:16."
2. "In Christian art it is the symbol of the Holy Spirit, and that in his Old Testament manifestations as well as in those of the New Testament."
3. "The symbol is explained by Elisha's prayer that a double portion of Elijah's spirit might rest upon him."

### John Calvin:
1. "The opening of the heavens sometimes means a manifestation of heavenly glory; but here it means also a cleft, or opening, of the visible heaven, so that John could see something beyond the planets and stars."
2. "It is sufficient for us to believe, that it was a symbol of the Divine presence."
3. "It was done on purpose, that believers might learn to receive, and to contemplate with reverence, his divine power, and that the weakness of the flesh might not make him despised."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Heaven, which was closed by the first Adam, is opened again over the second."
2. "The dove symbolizes perfect gentleness, purity, fulness of life and the power of communicating it."
3. "The Godhead eternally existing as Trinity was manifested, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to us and for us in this occurrence, as throughout the economy of redemption."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Spirit of God descending as a dove."
2. "It is not certain whether Matthew means that the Spirit of God took the form of a dove or came upon Jesus as a dove comes down."
3. "The dove in Christian art has been considered the symbol of the Holy Spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "A circumstance strongly in favour of baptism by immersion: for that Christ should go down into the river, more or less deep, to the ankles, or up to the knees, in order that John should sprinkle water on his face, or pour it on his head, as is ridiculously represented in the prints, can hardly obtain any credit with persons of thought and sense."
2. "The descent of him was in a 'bodily shape', as Luke says in Luke 3:22 either in the shape of a dove, which is a very fit emblem of the Spirit of God who descended, and the fruits thereof, such as simplicity, meekness, love, c. and also of the dove-like innocence, humility, and affection of Christ, on whom he lighted or it was in some other visible form, not expressed, which pretty much resembled the hovering and lighting of a dove upon anything."
3. "Give me leave to transcribe a passage I have met with in the book of Zohar s; 'a door shall be opened, and out of it shall come forth the dove which Noah sent out in the days of the flood, as it is written, 'and he sent forth the dove', that famous dove; but the ancients speak not of it, for they knew not what it was, only from whence it came, and did its message; as it is written, 'it returned not again unto him any more': no man knows whither it went, but it returned to its place, and was hid within this door; and it shall take a crown in its mouth, and put it upon the head of the king Messiah.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Let our Lord's submitting to baptism teach us a holy exactness in the observance of those institutions which owe their obligation merely to a Divine command."
2. "Surely thus it becometh all his followers to fulfill all righteousness."
3. "And God owned his ordinance, so as to make it the season of pouring forth the Holy Spirit upon him."
