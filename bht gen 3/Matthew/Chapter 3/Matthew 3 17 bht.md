## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The English here, at least to modern ears, is scarcely strong enough. 'I delight' comes the nearest, perhaps, to that ineffable complacency which is manifestly intended..." 
2. "This is the rather to be preferred, as it would immediately carry the thoughts back to that august Messianic prophecy to which the voice from heaven plainly alluded..." 
3. "Nor are the words which follow to be overlooked, 'I have put My Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The baptism of Jesus has usually been regarded as a striking manifestation of the doctrine of the Trinity, or the doctrine that there are three Persons in the divine nature."

3. "The ancients looked upon this as so clear and full a proof of this truth [the doctrine of the Trinity], that they were wont to say; Go to Jordan, and there learn the doctrine of the Trinity."
