2. "The primary and literal application of this prophecy...directed onward to its greater fulfillmentâ€”the announcement of the kingdom of Christ."
3. "The ways and paths of the Lord are men's souls, which must be cleared of the thorns of passion and the stones of sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straightâ€”This prediction is quoted in all the four Gospels, showing that it was regarded as a great outstanding one, and the predicted forerunner as the connecting link between the old and the new economies."
2. "Like the great ones of the earth, the Prince of peace was to have His immediate approach proclaimed and His way prepared; and the call hereâ€”taking it generallyâ€”is a call to put out of the way whatever would obstruct His progress and hinder His complete triumph, whether those hindrances were public or personal, outward or inward."
3. "Levelling and smoothing are here the obvious figures whose sense is conveyed in the first words of the proclamationâ€”'Prepare ye the way of the Lord.'

### Albert Barnes:
1. "[Isaiah] uses language taken from that custom. A crier, or herald, is introduced. In the vast deserts that lay between Babylon and Judea he is represented as lifting up his voice, and, with authority, commanding a public road to be made for the return of the captive Jews, with the Lord as their deliverer."
2. "The meaning in Isaiah is, 'Let the valleys be exalted, or filled up, and the hills be levelled, and a straight, level highway be prepared, that they may march with ease and safety.'"
3. "As applied to John, the passage means that he was sent to remove obstructions, and to prepare the people for the coming of the Messiah, like a herald going before an army on the march, to make preparations for its coming."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as the restoration promised is perpetual, and not for a time only, and as Isaiah refers chiefly to the redemption, which was to be expressed at the coming of Christ, John the Baptist is justly considered the chief minister of consolation." (Commentary)
2. "The voice of one crying That voice is contrasted with the temporary silence, which I have just mentioned: for the Jews were to be deprived, for a time, of the instruction, which they had wickedly despised." (Commentary)
3. "The crooked shall be made straight... there are intricate and crooked windings in the world, but through such appalling difficulties the Lord makes a way for himself, and breaks through, by incredible means, to accomplish our salvation." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Is he. All the Evangelists and John himself thus apply the prophecy, which is more than a typical one."
2. "The voice. From the Septuagint. Literally â€˜a voice.â€™ Some suppose John is represented as a â€˜voice,â€™ in contrast with Christ as â€˜the Word,â€™ others because his life was vocal,â€™ the whole man being as it were a sermon,â€™ perhaps with reference to the long silence since the prophet Malachi."
3. "The way of the Lord, i.e., Jehovah. By implication the coming One was Jehovah. An allusion to the Eastern custom of removing obstacles before the approach of a royal personage."

### John Gill:
1. "The consolations spoken of in Isaiah 40:3, were to be in the days of the king Messiah"
2. "The Messiah is more expressly prophesied of in Isaiah 40:9 as one that should appear to the joy of his people, and 'come with a strong hand'"
3. "The Lord whom ye have sought, the Messiah whom you have expected, is just coming, he will quickly appear; prepare to meet him by repentance, and receive him by faith"

### John Wesley:
1. The way of the Lord â€” Of Christ.
Make his paths straight â€” By removing every thing which might prove a hinderance to his gracious appearance. Isaiah 40:3.
