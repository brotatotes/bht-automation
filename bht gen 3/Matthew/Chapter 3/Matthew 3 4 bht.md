# Matthew 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist came preaching a message of repentance in the wilderness, dressed in a garment made of camel's hair, woven of it. His sustenance consisted of locusts, the well-known Eastern locust, a food of the poor, and honey made by wild bees. This austere dress and meager diet, resembling that of Elijah, reflected John's humble life and self-denial. Although such an uncouth figure may not be welcomed in modern pulpits, it was in the wilderness where John's appearance effectively conveyed the majesty of God and commanded admiration.
