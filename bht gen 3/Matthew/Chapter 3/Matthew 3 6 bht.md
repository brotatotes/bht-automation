# Matthew 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John's baptism was not just a mere display of contrition, but a public confession and acknowledgment of sin, signifying the people's need for deliverance and their readiness to welcome the coming Deliverer. Though familiar with the baptism of proselytes, this baptism of Jews was new and strange to them. While the exact method of baptism might have been immersion, the emphasis was on the symbolic washing and spiritual purification it represented rather than the specific mode.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole families of proselytes, including infants, were baptized."
2. "It is most probable that John’s baptism in outward form resembled that of proselytes."
3. "From the form and expression, this does not seem to have been merely ‘shewing a contrite spirit,’ ‘confessing themselves sinners,’ but a particular and individual confession."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This baptism was at once a public seal of their felt need of deliverance from sin, of their expectation of the coming Deliverer, and of their readiness to welcome Him when He appeared."
2. "The baptism itself startled, and was intended to startle, them."
3. "They were familiar enough with the baptism of proselytes from heathenism; but this baptism of Jews themselves was quite new and strange to them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He applied an old ordinance to a new purpose. As it was used by him it was a significant rite, or ceremony, intended to denote the putting away of impurity, and a purpose to be pure in heart and life."
2. "The Hebrew word טבל Tabal which is rendered by the word 'baptize,' occurs in the Old Testament in the following places, namely: [list of verses]. It occurs in no other places; and from a careful examination of these passages its meaning among the Jews is to be derived."
3. "In none of these cases can it be shown that the meaning of the word is to immerse entirely. But in nearly all the cases the notion of applying the water to a part only of the person or object, though it was by dipping, is necessarily to be supposed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They were baptized while in the act of confessing."
2. "An open confession, not a private one to John."
3. "An individual confession; possibly a specific one."

### John Calvin:
1. "In Baptism, he declares that our sins are forgiven, and calls us to repentance."
2. "That men may come forward, in a right manner, to be baptized, confession of sins is demanded from them: otherwise the whole performance would be nothing but an idle mockery."
3. "Even granting to Papists all that they ask, confession will belong to Catechumens alone, and will have no place after Baptism."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Baptism was essentially a symbolical or ceremonial washing, prescribed at first by the Mosaic law, as a sign of moral renovation, joined with sacrifice."
2. "If the rite is not identical with Christian baptism, the mode practised by John cannot conclusively determine the proper mode of Christian baptism."
3. "The Greek verb baptize is a technical term for a symbolical washing, with a view to spiritual purification."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The movement of course was gradual. It began on a small scale and steadily grew till it reached colossal proportions" (Bruce).
2. "Let Plummer, the great Church of England commentator on Matthew, speak here of John's baptizing these people who came in throngs: 'It is his office to bind them to a new life, symbolized by immersion in water.'"
3. "They came 'confessing their sins' (εξομολογουμενο), probably each one confessing just before he was baptized, 'making open confession' (Weymouth)."

### John Gill:
1. "The manner in which they were baptized by him was by immersion or plunging them in the water: this may be concluded from the signification of the word βαπτιζω where used, which in the primary sense of it signifies to dip or plunge; from the place in which they were baptized, 'the river Jordan'; and from John's constant manner of baptizing elsewhere, who chose places for this purpose, where and because there was there much water." 
2. "Even in baptism itself there is a tacit confession and acknowledgment of sin, for it represents the sufferings and death of Christ which were for sin, into which persons are baptized, and profess to be dead to sin thereby; and also the resurrection of Christ for justification from sin, which obliges the baptized person to walk in newness of life."
3. "Now this is the character given of the very first persons that were baptized by John, and ought surely to be attended to, by us; and as much care as possible should be taken, that none but such as have a true sense of sin, and are brought to an humble and hearty acknowledgment of it, be admitted to this ordinance."

### John Wesley:
1. "Such prodigious numbers could hardly be baptized by immerging their whole bodies under water: nor can we think they were provided with change of raiment for it, which was scarcely practicable for such vast multitudes."
2. "It seems, therefore, that they stood in ranks on the edge of the river, and that John, passing along before them, cast water on their heads or faces, by which means he might baptize many thousands in a day."
3. "And this way most naturally signified Christ's baptizing them with the Holy Ghost and with fire, which John spoke of, as prefigured by his baptizing with water, and which was eminently fulfilled, when the Holy Ghost sat upon the disciples in the appearance of tongues, or flames of fire."
