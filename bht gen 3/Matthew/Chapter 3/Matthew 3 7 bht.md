## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The character of the sect as a whole was hypocrisy; the outside acknowledgment and honouring of God and his law, but inward and practical denial of Him; which rendered them the enemies of the simplicity and genuineness which characterized our Lordâ€™s teaching." 
2. "The denial of a future state does not appear to have been an original tenet of Sadduceism, but to have sprung from its abuse. The particular side of religionism represented by the Sadducees was bare literal moral conformity, without any higher views or hopes."
3. "The two sects, mutually hostile, are found frequently in the Gospels united in opposition to our Lord; the Pharisees representing hypocritical superstition; the Sadducees, carnal unbelief."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Viper brood, expressing the deadly influence of both sects alike upon the community."
2. "What can have brought you hither? John more than suspected it was not so much their own spiritual anxieties as the popularity of his movement that had drawn them thither."
3. "In this view of it, how striking is the word he employs to express that stepâ€”fleeing from itâ€”as of one who, beholding a tide of fiery wrath rolling rapidly towards him, sees in instant flight his only escape!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were a corrupt, hypocritical, office-seeking, haughty class of men."
2. "The Essenes...were generally more pure...an unambitious, a modest, and retiring sort of people."
3. "In the phrase 'generation of vipers'...the viper is the symbol of wickedness, of envenomed malice."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing can be more unequal, in this respect, than a constant equality."
2. "Those whose habits of uttering falsehood to God, and of deceiving themselves, lead them to hold out hypocrisy and pretension, instead of the reality, ought to be urged, with greater sharpness than other men, to true repentance."
3. "There is an astonishing pertinacity, as I have said, in hypocrites; and, until they have been flayed by violence, they obstinately keep their skin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees and Sadducees. Two opposing parties, here classed together in the same unworthy category...The Pharisees were the upholders of strict orthodox Judaism...The Sadducees represent the opposite tendency of skepticism, rationalism, and unbelief."
2. "A third school existed, the Essenes...They may be called the Jewish mystics, and represent a tendency less universal than the other two schools."
3. "The fear of these times rather than of the future judgment moved the Pharisees and Sadducees, while John himself foretold the fate of the Jewish nation as part of the 'impending wrath.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One cannot properly understand the theological atmosphere of Palestine at this time without an adequate knowledge of both Pharisees and Sadducees."
2. "John clearly grasped the significance of this movement on the part of the Pharisees and Sadducees who had followed the crowds to the Jordan."
3. "'The coming wrath' was not just for Gentiles as the Jews supposed, but for all who were not prepared for the kingdom of heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "O generation of vipers!... full of the deadly poison of hypocrisy, malice, and error."
2. "Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
3. "Wrath to come... not meant hell fire, everlasting destruction... but temporal calamity and destruction, the wrath which in a little time came upon that nation to the uttermost."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye brood of vipers." 
2. "The crafty Herod is styled a fox."
3. "Terms which are not the random language of passion, but a judicious designation of the persons meant by them."
