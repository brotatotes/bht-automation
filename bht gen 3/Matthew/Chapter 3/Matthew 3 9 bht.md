## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Think not that your perishing will leave Abraham without children: for God is able to raise him up children even from stones, as He created man out of dust at the beginning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham"
2. "Flatter not yourselves with the fond delusion that God stands in need of you"
3. "Though the stern speaker may have pointed as he spoke to the pebbles of the bare clay hills that lay around, it was clearly the calling of the Gentiles...into the room of unbelieving and disinherited Israel that he meant thus to indicate"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God, from these stones, could more easily raise up those who should be worthy children of Abraham, or be like him, than simply, because you are descendants of Abraham, make you, who are proud and hypocritical, subjects of the Messiahâ€™s kingdom."
2. "Mere nativity, or the privileges of birth, avail nothing where there is not righteousness of life."
3. "God could 'of them' raise up children to Abraham."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. These stones. Pointing, as he spoke, to the pebbles on the beach of the Jordan.


### John Calvin:
1. "Johnâ€™s address to the Pharisees and Sadducees amounts to this: 'Now that I have sharply upbraided you, do not, as persons of your stamp are wont to do, endeavor to find a remedy in an empty and deceitful title.'" 
2. "The covenant, which God had made with Abraham, was employed by them as a shield to defend a bad conscience: not that they rested their salvation on the person of one man, but that God had adopted all the posterity of Abraham." 
3. "The Jews flattered themselves with nearly the same pretenses, as are now brought forward insolently by the Papists...This error, of relying too much on the promise of God, John exposes and refutes, by saying that, though God passes by them, he will not want a Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do not say, nay, do not think that this is a plausible defense, even within yourselves, in your own hearts: We have Abraham to our father, or 'for a father,' i.e., we shall escape, or be saved, because we are natural heirs to the promise made to him. This was the Jewish boast, the Jewish error; Johnâ€™s preaching went to the heart of the matter."
2. "God is able of (or, 'out of') these stones, i.e., lying loose on the banks of Jordan, where the words were uttered sarcastic. No figurative reference to heathen, or to monuments."
3. "God could create others to take their place as heirs of the promise. Probably a reference to the spiritual offspring of the patriarch (Romans 4:16; Galatians 3:7). John, either consciously or unconsciously, predicts the calling of the Gentiles. Spiritual succession not dependent on natural or ecclesiastical (even 'apostolic') succession."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John touched the tender spot, their ecclesiastical pride."
2. "They felt that the 'merits of the fathers,' especially of Abraham, were enough for all Israelites."
3. "Pointing, as he spoke to the pebbles on the beach of the Jordan."

### John Gill:
1. "It is not a person's being born of believing parents that can entitle him to water baptism; or be a reason why it ought to be administered to him."
2. "If nothing more than this can be said in his favour, it is a plain case from hence, he ought to be debarred from it."
3. "God stood in no need of these persons, nor had they any reason to boast of their natural descent from Abraham; since this in spiritual matters, and in things relating to the Gospel dispensation, would stand them in no stead, or be of any advantage to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Think not, seems here, and in many places, not to diminish, but rather add to the force of the word with which it is joined."
2. "It is almost incredible, how great the presumption of the Jews was on this their relation to Abraham."
3. "I say unto you - This preface always denotes the importance of what follows."
