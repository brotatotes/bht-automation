## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The desert here spoken of may either be the traditional place of the Temptation near Jericho [...] or [...] the Arabian desert of Sinai." 
2. "Hence it is evident that our Lord this time wes not â€˜led upâ€™ of his own will and design: but, as a part of the conflict with the Power of Darkness, He was brought to the Temptation." 
3. "In reverently considering the nature and end of this temptation, we may observe [...] an actual conflict between our Redeemer and the Power of Evil."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Spirit conducted Him into the wilderness simply to have His faith tried; but as the agent in this trial was to be the wicked one, whose whole object would be to seduce Him from His allegiance to God, it was a temptation in the bad sense of the term." 
2. "The temptation evidently embraced two stages: the one continuing throughout the forty days' fast; the other, at the conclusion of that period."
3. "The tempter's whole object during the forty days evidently was to get Him to distrust the heavenly testimony borne to Him at His baptism as THE SON OF GODâ€”to persuade Him to regard it as but a splendid illusionâ€”and, generally, to dislodge from His breast the consciousness of His Sonship."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was evidently that it might be seen that his holiness was such that he could not be seduced from allegiance to God."
2. "There was a kind and a degree of holiness which no art or power could estrange from allegiance."
3. "In the clearest manifestations of the divine favor to us we may not be far from most powerful temptations, and then may be the time when it is necessary to be most carefully on our guard."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Devil, Satan, the God of this world is always with the article and never plural."
2. "The Son of God. By its position in the sentence Son is emphatic."
3. "These stones were perhaps those 'silicious accretions,' which assume the exact shape of little loaves of bread..."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us therefore learn that, by the guidance of the Spirit, Christ withdrew from the crowd of men, in order that he might come forth as the highest teacher of the church, as the ambassador of God, â€” rather as sent from heaven, than as taken from some town, and from among the common people."
2. "Christâ€™s fasting was a distinctive badge of the divine glory: and is it not to defraud him of his glory, and to reduce him to the ordinary rank of men, when mortals freely mix themselves with him as his companions?"
3. "Whenever we are called to encounter Satan, let us remember, that his attacks can, in no other way, be sustained and repelled, than by holding out this shield: for the Son of God undoubtedly allowed himself to be tempted, that he may be constantly before our minds, when Satan excites within us any contest of temptations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Led up by the Spirit. Not by His own spirit, but by the Holy Spirit."
2. "To be tempted. For this purpose. To this contest, the God-Man is impelled, not directly by his own will, but by the Spirit to fulfill the design of the Father."
3. "The Greek word means slanderer, accuser. In the Old Testament he is called Satan, or adversary. A person, not a principle or influence, as is evident, from the whole tenor of Scripture."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is not surprising that Jesus was tempted by the devil immediately after his baptism which signified the formal entrance upon the Messianic work. That is a common experience with ministers who step out into the open for Christ."
2. "The difficulty here is that Matthew says that 'Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.' It was a strong impulsion by the Holy Spirit that led Jesus into the wilderness to think through the full significance of the great step that he had now taken."
3. "Certainly Jesus did not discount or deny the reality of the devil's presence."

### John Gill:
1. "The action of the Spirit in and upon Christ; he was led of the Spirit."
2. "Being 'led' by him, denotes an internal impulse of the Spirit in him, stirring him up."
3. "The end of his being led there, was to be tempted of the devil."
