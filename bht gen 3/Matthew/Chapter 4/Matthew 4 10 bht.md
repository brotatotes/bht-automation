## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord at once repels him openly; not that He did not know him before,â€”but because he had thus openly tempted Him." 
2. "But not even this of His own power or will; He adds, for it is written,â€”again, as Man, appealing to the word of God."
3. "From this time, our Lord is known by the devils, and casts them out by a word."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the final and conclusive evidence, as we think, that Matthew's must be the right order of the temptations."
2. "Thus does our Lord part with Satan on the rock of Scripture."
3. "Once more the word 'only,' in the second clauseâ€”not expressed in the Hebrew and the Septuagintâ€”is here added to bring out emphatically the negative and prohibitory feature of the command."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Here was a higher attempt, a more decided and deadly thrust at the piety of the Savior."
2. "It was a proposition that the Son of God should worship the devil, instead of honoring and adoring Him who made heaven and earth."
3. "Satan asked him to worship him. This was expressly forbidden, and Jesus therefore drove him from his presence."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ simply bids him go away; and now proceeds with the same kind of defense as before, employing Scripture as a shield."
2. "Christ rejects this frivolous distinction, and claims for God alone worship; by which he warns us to attend more to the matter than to expressions, when we have to do with the worship of God."
3. "Now, as religion is strictly spiritual, and the outward acknowledgment of it relates to the body, so not only the inward worship, but also the outward manifestation of it, is due to God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Get thee hence. A single word, â€˜begone,â€™ â€˜avaunt,â€™ expressing abhorrence of both person and proposal."
2. "Satan. Addressed by name, having spoken in his true character as â€˜adversary.â€™ For, giving a reason for rejecting the proposal, and also for his going hence, from the presence of One who instead of rendering worship, could claim it."
3. "Thou shalt worship, etc. The two clauses taken together forbid every kind of religious homage to any other than Jehovah God. When Jesus of Nazareth permitted religious adoration of himself, he virtually declared that He was Jehovah our God. Tempted yet sinless, hungry yet Divine, He is ready to sympathize with us and able to succor us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Begone" Christ says to Satan. This temptation is the limit of diabolical suggestion and argues for the logical order in Matthew.
2. "Satan" means the adversary and Christ so terms the devil here.
3. The words "him alone thou shalt serve" need be recalled today. Jesus will warn men against trying to serve God and mammon (Matthew 6:24).

### John Gill:
1. "he had borne his insults and temptations with great patience; he had answered him with mildness and gentleness; but now his behaviour to him was intolerable" 
2. "Worship includes both an internal and external reverence of God"
3. "since the Lord God is the alone object of worship, it was horrid blasphemy in Satan to desire it might be given to him, and which could not be done without the greatest impiety."

### John Wesley:
1. "Get thee hence, Satan â€” Not, get thee behind me, that is, into thy proper place."
2. "...speaking what was not expedient."
3. "Deuteronomy 6:13."
