## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord at once repels him openly; not that He did not know him before,‚Äîbut because he had thus openly tempted Him." 
2. "...not even this of His own power or will; He adds, for it is written,‚Äîagain, as Man, appealing to the word of God." 
3. "From this time, our Lord is known by the devils, and casts them out by a word."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the final and conclusive evidence, as we think, that Matthew's must be the right order of the temptations."
2. "Thus does our Lord part with Satan on the rock of Scripture."
3. "Once more the word 'only,' in the second clause‚Äînot expressed in the Hebrew and the Septuagint‚Äîis here added to bring out emphatically the negative and prohibitory feature of the command."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Here was a higher attempt, a more decided and deadly thrust at the piety of the Saviour."
2. "It was a proposition that the Son of God should worship the devil, instead of honoring and adoring Him who made heaven and earth."
3. "Satan asked him to worship him. This was expressly forbidden, and Jesus therefore drove him from his presence."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ simply bids him go away; and now proceeds with the same kind of defense as before, employing Scripture as a shield, not of reeds, but of brass."
2. "Christ rejects this frivolous distinction, and claims for God alone œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫·ΩªŒΩŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ, worship; by which he warns us to attend more to the matter than to expressions, when we have to do with the worship of God."
3. "Now, as religion is strictly spiritual, and the outward acknowledgment of it relates to the body, so not only the inward worship, but also the outward manifestation of it, is due to God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Get thee hence. A single word, ‚Äòbegone,‚Äô ‚Äòavaunt,‚Äô expressing abhorrence of both person and proposal."
2. "Satan. Addressed by name, having spoken in his true character as ‚Äòadversary.‚Äô"
3. "Thou shalt worship, etc. The two clauses taken together forbid every kind of religious homage to any other than Jehovah God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Begone" Christ says to Satan.
2. The devil as the lord of the evil world constantly tries to win men to the service of the world and God.
3. "Him alone thou shalt serve" need be recalled today.

### John Gill:
1. "He had borne his insults and temptations with great patience; he had answered him with mildness and gentleness; but now his behaviour to him was intolerable, which obliged him to show his resentment, exert his power and authority, and rid himself at once of so vile a creature; giving this reason for it." 
2. "Worship includes both an internal and external reverence of God: the word 'only' is not in the original text, but is added by our Lord; and that very justly; partly to express the emphasis which is on the word 'him'; and in perfect agreement with the context, which requires it."
3. "The meaning of our Lord in citing it is; that since the Lord God is the alone object of worship, it was horrid blasphemy in Satan to desire it might be given to him, and which could not be done without the greatest impiety."

### John Wesley:
1. "Get thee hence, Satan ‚Äî Not, get thee behind me, that is, into thy proper place."
2. "As he said on a quite different occasion to Peter, speaking what was not expedient."
3. "Deuteronomy 6:13."
