## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not in the wider ecclesiastical sense of the word, but its strict meaning, of abstaining from all food whatever." 
2. "The period of the fast, as in the case of Moses, was spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the natural body were suspended." 
3. "Then probably not during the time itself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Had fasted - Abstained from food."
2. "It has been questioned by some whether Christ abstained wholly from food, or only from the food to which he was accustomed."
3. "There are other instances of persons fasting 40 days recorded in the Scriptures. Thus, Moses fasted 40 days, Exodus 34:28. Elijah also fasted the same length of time, 1 Kings 19:8. In these cases they were no doubt miraculously supported."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The length of the fast is not incredible. Comp. the fasts of Moses (Exodus 34:28) and Elijah (1 Kings 19:8), Absorption in intellectual pursuits, but especially in spiritual contemplation, will render any one for a time independent of ordinary food or nourishment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The period of the fast, as in the case of Moses was spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the natural body were suspended."

2. "to express the reality of his human nature, which though miraculously supported for so long a time without food, and insensible of hunger, yet at length had appetite for food"
3. "very advantageous opportunity Satan had to attack him in the manner he did, with his first temptation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having fasted â€” Whereby doubtless he received more abundant spiritual strength from God."
2. "Forty days and forty nights â€” As did Moses, the giver of the law, and Elijah, the great restorer of it."
3. "He was afterward hungry â€” And so prepared for the first temptation."
