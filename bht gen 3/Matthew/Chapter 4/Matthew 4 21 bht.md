## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In a ship‚Äîrather, 'in the ship,' their fishing boat."
2. "Mending their nets: and he called them."
3. "He called them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In a ship - A small vessel. In fact, it was little more, probably, than a sail-boat."
2. "Mending their nets - A very common employment when they were not actually engaged in fishing."
3. "They were men engaged in the same employment, as it is probable that there were many such in the neighborhood of the lake."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Mending [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÅœÑŒπŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ] . Not necessarily repairing; the word means to adjust, to "put to rights." It may mean here preparing the nets for the next fishing. 


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Going on from thence. (Mark: ‚Äòa little further.‚Äô) All four had assisted in the great draught of fishes." 
2. "In the boat, a fishing boat (not a ‚Äòship‚Äô), probably drawn up on the shore." 
3. "Mending, or ‚Äòputting their nets in order,‚Äô preparing them for use. The wider sense is perhaps to be preferred."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mending their nets... to adjust, to articulate, to mend if needed." 
2. "So they promptly left their boat and father and followed Jesus." 
3. "They had also already become disciples of Jesus. Now there are four who follow him steadily."

### John Gill:
1. "These were in a ship with Zebedee their father. Men of this name, and sons of men of this name, were very common among the Jewish Rabbins; but neither this man, nor his sons, were masters or doctors in Israel; for such Christ chose not for his apostles."
2. "This shows their industry and diligence, and may be a pattern and example to persons, closely to attend the business of their calling, whilst the providence of God continues them in it."
3. "And he called them: from their employment, to follow him, and become his disciples; and no doubt gave them the same promise and encouragement he had given the two former."
