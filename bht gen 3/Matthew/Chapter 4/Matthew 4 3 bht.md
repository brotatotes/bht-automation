2. "Adam stood not,‚ÄîIsrael according to the flesh stood not,‚Äîwhen the Lord their God tempted them: but rather, after Satan‚Äôs likeness, tempted their God: but now the second Adam is come, the true Israel, by whose obedience the way of life is again made known and opened."
3. "Observe also how our Lord resists Satan in His humanity; at once here numbering Himself with men, by adducing 'man' as including His own case; and not only so, but thus speaking out the mystery of his humiliation, in which He had foregone his divine Power, of his own will."
