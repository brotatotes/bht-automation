## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It may be observed, that St. Luke makes no assertion as to succession, only introducing each temptation with and: whereas 'then' and 'again' here seem to mark succession."
2. "The general opinion, that our Lord was placed on Herod‚Äôs royal portico, is probably right. That portico overhung the ravine of Kedron from a dizzy height, so as to make one giddy with looking down."
3. "The inference from Eusebius, who, quoting Hegesippus, (Hist. ii. 23) describes James the Just as set on and thrown from the pinnacle of the temple, among the people, is not decisive: for this term might embrace either side, as 'the cornice,' or 'the parapet' would."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Then the devil taketh him up‚Äîrather, 'conducteth Him.'" 
2. "into the holy city‚Äîso called (as in Isaiah 48:2; Nehemiah 11:1) from its being 'the city of the Great King,' the seat of the temple, the metropolis of all Jewish worship."
3. "and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple‚Äîrather, 'the pinnacle'‚Äîa certain well-known projection."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This does not mean that he bore him through the air; or that he compelled him to go against his will, or that he performed a miracle in any way to place him there."
2. "From these passages, and many more, it appears that all that is meant here is, that Satan conducted Jesus, or accompanied him; but not that this was done against the will of Jesus."
3. "The word 'pinnacle' does not quite express the force of the original... It was on this place, doubtless, that Christ was placed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word temple (iJeron, lit., sacred place) signifies the whole compass of the sacred inclosure, with its porticos, courts, and other subordinate buildings; and should be carefully distinguished from the other word, naov, also rendered temple, which means the temple itself - the 'Holy Place' and the 'Holy of Holies.'" 
2. "When we read, for instance, of Christ teaching in the temple [ŒπŒµœÅŒøŒΩ] we must refer it to one of the temple - porches."
3. "So it is from the iJeron, the court of the Gentiles, that Christ expels the money - changers and cattle - merchants."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no absurdity in supposing, that this took place by the permission of God and the voluntary subjection of Christ; provided we hold that within, ‚Äî that is, in his mind and souls, ‚Äî he suffered no delusion."
2. "In a matter that is doubtful, and where ignorance brings no risk, I choose rather to suspend my judgment, than to furnish contentious people with an occasion of debate."
3. "The design of Satan, we have now ascertained, was to induce Christ to make trial of his divinity, and to rise up, in foolish and wicked rashness, against God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Force is not necessarily implied, though Satan may have had for the time being some power over his weakened body." 
2. "The conducting and setting were of a similar character." 
3. "The temptation presented being the suggestion that He should, by a miraculous display, elevate Himself to become the priest-king of that temple."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Matthew is very fond of this temporal adverb (œÑŒøœÑŒµ)."
2. "Note historic present with vivid picturesqueness."
3. "Hegesippus says that James the Lord's brother was later placed on the wing of the temple and thrown down therefrom."

### John Gill:
1. "This was done, not in a visionary way, but really and truly: Satan, by divine permission, and with the consent of Christ."
2. "Satan frequents all sorts of places; men are no where free from his temptations."
3. "The view Satan had in setting him here appears in the next verse."

### John Wesley:
1. "The holy city [...] being the place God had peculiarly chosen for himself."
2. "On the battlement of the temple ‚Äî Probably over the king's gallery."
3. "[The king's gallery] was of such a prodigious height, that no one could look down from the top of it without making himself giddy."
