## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The additional words in Luke, 'in a moment of time,' are valuable as pointing out to us clearly the supernatural character of the vision."
2. "If it be objected, that in that case there was no need for the ascent of the mountain,â€”I answer, that such natural accessories are made use of frequently in supernatural revelations."
3. "In this last temptation the enemy reveals himself openly, as the Prince of this world, and as the father of lies: for though power is given him over this world and its sons, his assertion here is most untrue."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A scene was presented to our Lord's natural eye seems plainly expressed."
2. "To limit this to the most extensive scene which the natural eye could take in, is to give a sense to the expression, 'all the kingdoms of the world,' quite violent."
3. "It was permitted to the tempter to extend preternaturally for a moment our Lord's range of vision, and throw a 'glory' or glitter over the scene of vision."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not known what mountain this was. It was probably some elevated place in the vicinity of Jerusalem, from the top of which could be seen no small part of the land of Palestine."
2. "This shows that there were mountains from which no small part of the land of Canaan could be seen; and we need not suppose that there was any miracle when they were shown to the Saviour."
3. "The term 'world' is often used in this limited sense to denote a part or a large part of the world, particularly the land of Canaan."

### John Calvin:
1. "The kind of temptation here described was, that Christ should seek, in another manner than from God, the inheritance which he has promised to his children."
2. "The daring insolence of the devil is manifested, in robbing God of the government of the world, and claiming it for himself."
3. "A considerable portion of mankind disbelieve the power and authority of God over the world, and imagine that everything good is bestowed by Satan."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An exceeding high mountain. Its situation can only be conjectured; the Mount of Olives, which was relatively high; others, the mountain in the wilderness (Quarantania), Nebo, Tabor."
2. "Sheweth him. Luke adds, â€˜in a moment of time,â€™ this may imply some supernatural extension of vision."
3. "All the kingdoms of the world; not to be restricted to Palestine, a narrower meaning which â€˜worldâ€™ occasionally has, but never in such a phrase. It becomes intelligible on the theory suggested: actual vision with added rhetorical description."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This wonderful panorama had to be partially mental and imaginative, since the devil caused to pass in review 'all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.'"
2. "But this fact does not prove that all phases of the temptations were subjective without any objective presence of the devil. Both could be true."
3. "Here again we have the vivid historical present (Î´ÎµÎ¹ÎºÎ½Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î½). The devil now has Christ upon a very high mountain whether the traditional Quarantania or not."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'all the kingdoms of the world' are meant, not only the Roman empire, as Dr. Lightfoot thinks, though that was, to be sure, the greatest in the world at that time; but all the kingdoms in the whole world, which subsisted in any form, whether within, or independent of the Roman empire; or whether greater or lesser: and by 'the glory of them', is meant, the riches, pomp, power, and grandeur of them."
2. "Now the view which Satan gave Christ of all this, was not by a representation of them in a picture, or in a map, or in any geographical tables, as some have thought...but this was a fictitious, delusive representation, which Satan was permitted to make; to cover which, and that it might be thought to be real, he took Christ into an high mountain; where he proposed an object externally to his sight, and internally to his imagination, which represented, in appearance, the whole world, and all its glory."
3. "The word ÏƒÏ„Î¹Î³Î¼Î·, used by Luke 4:5 sometimes signifies a mathematical point, which Zeno says is the end of the line, and the least mark; to which the allusion may be here, and designs the smallest part of time that can be conceived of...If this could be thought to be a true and exact account of a moment, or point of time, it was a very short space of time indeed, in which the devil showed to Christ the kingdoms of this world, and their glory."

### John Wesley:
1. Showeth him all the kingdoms of the world â€” In a kind of visionary representation.
