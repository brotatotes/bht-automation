# Matthew 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples of Jesus are called the light of the world, shining with His light upon the world. Just as salt operates internally, the Christians are the salt of the earth, while light operates externally, illuminating all it reaches. The Church of God, like a city set on a hill, cannot be hidden but must be seen by many eyes. Christians carry and spread the light of the Gospel to dispel darkness and bring truth and holiness to society, like the sun in the firmament.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His ministers are 'candles,' John v. 35, and 'lights,' Phil. ii. 15, receiving their light, and only burning for a time: lights lighted, whereas He is Light lighting."
2. "And here too, light in this verse = candle in ver. 15, where the comparison is resumed. so also Eph. v. 8:â€”light, as partaking of His Light: for everything lighted (see note, ib. ver. 13) is light."
3. "But the CHURCH OF GOD, the city on a hill (Isa. ii. 2: Gal. iv. 26: see also Heb. xii. 22), in allusion to their present situation, on a mountain, is most probably leading thought."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye are the light of the worldâ€”a title expressly said to be unsuitable even to the highest of all the prophetsâ€”it must be applied here by our Lord to His disciples only as they shine with His light upon the world, in virtue of His Spirit dwelling in them, and the same mind being in them which was also in Christ Jesus." 
2. "Salt operates internally, in the mass with which it comes in contact; the sunlight operates externally, irradiating all that it reaches. Hence Christians are warily styled 'the salt of the earth,' but 'the light of the world'â€”with reference to the vast and variegated surface which feels its fructifying and gladdening radiance." 
3. "A city that is set on an hill cannot be hidâ€”nor can it be supposed to have been so built except to be seen by many eyes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The light of the world often denotes the sun... The term light is often applied to religious teachers." 
2. "They must be seen; and as this was the case, they ought to be holy, harmless, and undefiled."
3. "Certainly they are quite sufficient to suggest the name. There lies Gennesaret, like a mirror set in framework of dark mountains and many-faced hills."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are all the children of light, after having been enlightened by faith, and are commanded to carry in our hands 'burning lamps,' (that we may not wander in darkness,) and even to point out to others the way of life."
2. "They are placed in this rank on the condition, that they shall shine, as from an elevated situation, on all others."
3. "Christ informs the apostles, that they must be more careful to live a devout and holy life, than unknown persons of the common rank, because the eyes of all are directed to them, as to lighted candles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The influence of salt is internal, of light, external; hence 'earth' (Matthew 5:13), and here 'world,' both referring to society or mankind, the latter more to its organized external form."
2. "Light is opposed to darkness, and dispels it; is the symbol of truth and holiness."
3. "The Church of God is such a city, and must be seen, like the light."

### John Gill:
1. "What the luminaries, the sun and moon, are in the heavens, with respect to corporal light, that the apostles were in the world with regard to spiritual light."
2. "Carrying and spreading the light of the Gospel not only in Judea, but all over the world, which was in great darkness of ignorance and error."
3. "The doctrines which the apostles were commissioned to preach...were not to be hid, or concealed from men: they were not to shun to declare the whole counsel of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye are the light of the world â€” If ye are thus holy, you can no more be hid than the sun in the firmament."
2. "No more than a city on a mountain."
3. "Probably pointing to that on the brow of the opposite hill."
