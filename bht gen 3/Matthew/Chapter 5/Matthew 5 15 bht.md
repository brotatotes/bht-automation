# Matthew 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The lights of the world are 'lighted' by Him for whose use they are and should not be concealed or neglected. In lowly cottage life, the lamp was placed on a stand or lampstand to giveth light unto all that are in the house. Similarly, the candle of the everlasting Gospel, lighted by Christ, should not be hidden but held forth by ministers to illuminate the whole house of God and benefit all. The very purpose of this light is to shine and benefit all.
