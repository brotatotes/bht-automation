# Matthew 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this teaching, Jesus emphasizes the enduring authority and divine significance of the Old Testament. The entirety of Scripture, both Old and New Testaments, stands as a unified whole and cannot be disregarded or altered. Even the smallest elements of the law, such as letters or punctuation marks, possess great importance and reflect supreme legislative authority. Failing to recognize the value and fulfilment of the law ultimately leads to rejecting Jesus and the truth of the New Testament. The law encompasses historical truths, theocratic dispensations, and moral principles that Jesus came to fulfill, not abolish.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is important to observe in these days how the Lord here includes the O.T. and all its unfolding of the divine purposes regarding Himself, in His teaching of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven."
2. "First, its historical truth‚Äîthen its theocratic dispensation and the types and prophecies connected with it, are swept away; so that Christ came to fulfil nothing, and becomes only a teacher or a martyr: and thus the way is paved for a similar rejection of the N.T."
3. "It should be a maxim for every expositor and every student, that Scripture is a whole, and stands or falls together."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the expression manifestly, of supreme legislative authority; and as the subject in connection with which it is uttered is the Moral Law, no higher claim to an authority strictly divine could be advanced."
2. "When the Baptist's words‚Äî'I say unto you'‚Äîare compared with those of his Master here, the difference of the two cases will be at once apparent."
3. "The meaning is that 'not so much as the smallest loss of authority or vitality shall ever come over the law.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Till heaven and earth pass - This expression denotes that the law never would be destroyed until it should be all fulfilled. It is the same as saying everything else may change; the very earth and heaven may pass away, but the law of God shall not be destroyed until its whole design has been accomplished."
2. "To change a small point of one letter, therefore, might vary the meaning of a word, and destroy the sense... The expression, 'one jot or tittle,' became proverbial, and means that the smallest part of the law should not be destroyed."
3. "The moral laws are such as grow out of the nature of things, and which cannot, therefore, be changed - such as the duty of loving God and his creatures... These our Saviour has neither abolished nor superseded."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jot is for jod, the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet."
2. "Tittle is the little bend or point which serves to distinguish certain Hebrew letters of similar appearance."
3. "The guilt of changing those little hooks which distinguish between certain Hebrew letters is declared to be so great that, if such a thing were done, the world would be destroyed."

### John Calvin:
1. "The truth of the law and of every part of it, is secure, and that nothing so durable is to be found in the whole frame of the world."
2. "Sooner shall heaven fall to pieces, and the whole frame of the world become a mass of confusion, than the stability of the law shall give way."
3. "There is nothing in the law that is unimportant, nothing that was put there at random; and so it is impossible that a single letter shall perish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Evangelist John generally repeats the first word. The whole phrase is used by Christ alone, the absolute, personal Truth."
2. "While heaven and earth last, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law without all these, declared, promised, or typified, being done."
3. "A warning against contempt for the Old Testament, which leads at last to a denial of Christ. He has Himself fulfilled the ceremonial law; He teaches the true, higher, spiritual significance of the whole law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not an iota, not a comma" (Moffatt), "not the smallest letter, not a particle" (Weymouth).
2. "The iota is the smallest Greek vowel, which Matthew here uses to represent the Hebrew yod (jot), the smallest Hebrew letter."
3. "It is not certain here whether Œ∫ŒµœÅŒµŒ± means a little horn, the mere point which distinguishes some Hebrew letters from others or the 'hook' letter Vav. Sometimes yod and vav were hardly distinguishable."

### John Gill:
1. "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."
2. "If, all the nations of the world were gathered together, 'to root one word out of the law', they could not do it."
3. "The whole world is not equal even to one word out of the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "For the law has its effect, when the rewards are given, and the punishments annexed to it inflicted, as well as when its precepts are obeyed."
