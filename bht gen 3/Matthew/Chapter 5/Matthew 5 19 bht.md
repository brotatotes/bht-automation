# Matthew 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be great in the kingdom of heaven, we must appreciate the significance of even the smallest parts of God's revelation and strive for a righteousness that surpasses that of the Scribes and Pharisees. However, breaking even the least commandments and teaching others to do the same will result in being considered the least in the kingdom. Jesus emphasizes the importance of practicing what we preach and applying God's teachings to ourselves before teaching others. Therefore, we must not dismiss or weaken the authority of God's law but maintain its doctrine entirely to be faithful expounders.
