## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The superiority to the Pharisaic righteousness here required is plainly in kind, not degree; for all Scripture teaches that entrance into God's kingdom, whether in its present or future stage, depends, not on the degree of our excellence in anything, but solely on our having the character itself which God demands."
2. "Our righteousness, thenâ€”if it is to contrast with the outward and formal righteousness of the scribes and Phariseesâ€”must be inward, vital, spiritual."
3. "Without a righteousness exceeding that of the Pharisees, we cannot be members of it at all, save in name."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Unless you are more holy than they are, you cannot be saved."
2. "The righteousness of true Christians is seated in the heart, and is therefore genuine."

3. "The principal charge brought by Christ against their doctrine may be easily learned from what follows in the discourse, where he removes from the law their false and wicked interpretations, and restores it to its purity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Except your righteousness, your obedience, rectitude, shall exceed, abound more than, that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
