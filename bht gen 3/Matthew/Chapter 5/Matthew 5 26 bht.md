# Matthew 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we wrong someone, the debt we owe them can never truly be discharged, displaying the unending duration of future punishment. It is crucial to reconcile with our offended brother before facing the judgment of the Great Judge, for the consequences of our actions extend beyond earthly matters. Just as the image of the debtor in prison unable to pay the last farthing portrays the inevitability of punishment, we should not delay in making peace with both our earthly brethren and the One whose cause of complaint holds eternal consequences.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words...amount to a negation of [future liberation], because the debt can never be discharged." 
2. "The minister is the officer of the court who saw the sentences executed." 
3. "It must represent the chief of those who...are hinted at by 'the tormentors,' viz, the great enemy, the minister of the divine wrath."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In expounding the sixth commandment, I have spoken of offenses between man and man reminding you that the offender has another party to deal with besides him whom he has wronged on earth, and assuring you that all worship offered to the Searcher of hearts by one who knows that a brother has just cause of complaint against him, and yet takes no steps to remove it, is vain." 
2. "But I cannot pass from this subject without reminding you of One whose cause of complaint against you is far more deadly than any that man can have against man: and since with that Adversary you are already on the way to judgment, it will be your wisdom to make up the quarrel without delay."
3. "It may safely be said that the unending duration of future punishmentâ€”elsewhere so clearly and awfully expressed by our Lord Himselfâ€”is the only doctrine with which His language here quite naturally and fully accords."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Reconciliation with an offended brother in this life is absolutely necessary before his wrong cry against us to the Great Judge, and we be cast into eternal condemnation." 
2. "The meaning is: until everything is paid. If our sins be regarded as â€˜debtsâ€™ this is impossible, but no conclusive argument for or against the eternity of punishment can be based on the figure." 
3. "The main idea is the inexorable rigor of divine justice against the impenitent sinner."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The last farthing...a vivid picture of inevitable punishment for debt." 
2. "This is emphasized by the strong double negative Î¿Ï… Î¼Î· with the aorist subjunctive."

### John Gill:
1. "Verily, I say unto thee,.... This may be depended upon, you may assure yourself of it, that thou shalt by no means come out thence, from prison..." 
2. "till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing, or 'last farthing'... which seems to express the inexorableness of the creditor..."
3. "...and the impossibility of the debtor's release."

### John Wesley:
1. "Till thou hast paid the last farthing â€” That is, for ever, since thou canst never do this."
2. "What has been hitherto said refers to meekness: what follows, to purity of heart."
