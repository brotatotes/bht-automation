# Matthew 5:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To truly follow Jesus and live a righteous life, we must resist the first springs of evil desire and be willing to sacrifice what is dear to us. By doing so, we protect ourselves from falling into temptation and safeguard our self-interest. We must strike at the root of unholy dispositions and cut off the occasions that stimulate them. Failure to do so would result in being cast into hell. It is better to deny ourselves sinful pleasures and remove any obstacles that hinder our moral walk, even if it means losing something as precious as our eyes.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: To truly follow Jesus and live a righteous life, we must be willing to resist and cut off the first sparks of evil desire, even if it means sacrificing something that is dear to us. By doing so, we are safeguarding our own self-interest and protecting ourselves from falling into temptation. This means not only removing the occasions that lead us astray, but also addressing the root of our unholy dispositions. If we fail to do so, we risk suffering the consequences of our actions, just like one would be caught in a trap. Thus, it is crucial that we take decisive action to remove any obstacles that hinder our moral walk. It may be painful to deny ourselves the immediate gratification of our sinful desires, but the cost of eternal life is far greater. Therefore, it is imperative that we amputate whatever hinders our obedience to God, even if it is as precious as our eyes. It is better to lose the carnal pleasures of this world than to risk everlasting destruction in hell.
