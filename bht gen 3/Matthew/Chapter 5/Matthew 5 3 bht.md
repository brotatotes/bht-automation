## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He said not, the poor in possessions, but 'in spirit:â€™ i.e. the lowly in purpose and in soul."
2. "What is â€˜the poor in spirit?â€™ the humble and contrite in heart."
3. "The kingdom must here be understood in its widest sense: as the combination of all rights of Christian citizenship in this world, and eternal blessedness in the next."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Accordingly, our translators sometimes render such words 'the humble' [...] 'the meek' [...] 'the lowly', as having no reference to outward circumstances."
2. "But here the explanatory words, 'in spirit', fix the sense to 'those who in their deepest consciousness realize their entire need.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Blessed are the poor in spirit - The word 'blessed' means 'happy,' referring to that which produces felicity, from whatever quarter it may come."
2. "To be poor in spirit is to have a humble opinion of ourselves; to be sensible that we are sinners, and have no righteousness of our own; to be willing to be saved only by the rich grace and mercy of God; to be willing to be where God places us, to bear what he lays on us, to go where he bids us, and to die when he commands."
3. "It is remarkable that Jesus began his ministry in this manner, so unlike all others. Other teachers had taught that happiness was to be found in honor, or riches, or splendor, or sensual pleasure. Jesus overlooked all those things, and fixed his eye on the poor and the humble, and said that happiness was to be found in the lowly vale of poverty more than in the pomp and splendors of life."

1. "Behind it lies the clear cognition of sin as the fountain-head of all misery, and of holiness as the final and effectual cure for every woe."
2. "The Christian word blessed is full of the light of heaven."
3. "It sternly throws away from itself every hint of the Stoic's asserted right of suicide as a refuge from human ills, and emphasizes something which thrives on trial and persecution, which glories in tribulation, which not only endures but conquers the world, and expects its crown in heaven."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ pronounces those to be happy who, chastened and subdued by afflictions, submit themselves wholly to God, and, with inward humility, betake themselves to him for protection."
2. "Others explain the poor in spirit to be those who claim nothing for themselves, and are even so completely emptied of confidence in the flesh, that they acknowledge their poverty."
3. "It deserves our attention, that he only who is reduced to nothing in himself, and relies on the mercy of God, is poor in spirit: for they who are broken or overwhelmed by despair murmur against God, and this proves them to be of a proud and haughty spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The humble, those conscious of their spiritual needs, and thus prepared to be filled with the riches of the gospel. The discourse begins at the beginning; sense of want comes before spiritual blessings; the fruit of the law and the germ of the gospel." 
2. "Pride is always the first and great hindrance to obtaining a part in the kingdom."
3. "For theirs is. It belongs to them. The kingdom of heaven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Blessedness is, of course, an infinitely higher and better thing than mere happiness."

3. "Now these are pronounced 'blessed', for this reason, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven... eternal glory, this is prepared for them, and given to them; they are born heirs of it, have a right unto it, are making meet for it, and shall enjoy it."
