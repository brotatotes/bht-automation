## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "fornication must be taken to mean sin, not only before marriage, but after it also, in a wider sense, as including adultery likewise."
2. "if by such divorce the marriage be altogether dissolved, how can the woman be said to commit adultery by a second marriage?"
3. "the tenor of our Lordâ€™s teaching in other places seems to set before us the state of marriage as absolutely indissoluble as such, however he may sanction the expulsion a mensÃ¢ et thoro of an unfaithful wife."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adulteryâ€”that is, drives her into it in case she marries again." 
2. "And whosoever shall marry her that is divorcedâ€”for anything short of conjugal infidelityâ€”committeth adultery."
3. "Whether the innocent party, after a just divorce, may lawfully marry again, is not treated of here. The Church of Rome says, No; but the Greek and Protestant Churches allow it."

### John Calvin:
1. "The man who, unjustly and unlawfully, abandons the wife whom God had given him, is justly condemned for having prostituted his wife to others."
2. "As the bill of divorcement bore, that the woman had been loosed from her former husband, and might enter into a new marriage."
3. "The man who, unjustly and unlawfully, abandons the wife whom God had given him, is justly condemned for having prostituted his wife to others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Maketh her to commit adultery, not by the fact of her being divorced, but in view of the extremely probable case of another marriage."
2. "This high ideal of the marriage union is the basis of social morality. To oppose it is not only unchristian, but to demoralize the family, and to make war against the welfare of humanity."
3. "The application to the case of a man is not only required by the spirit of Christâ€™s teaching in general, but by the fact that He is here speaking of and condemning the sin of the man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An unusual phrase that perhaps means 'except for a matter of unchastity.'" 
2. "The early Christians made the exception to meet a pressing need."
3. "It looks like criticism to meet modern needs."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ does not infringe, or revoke the original grant, or permission of divorce; only frees it from the false interpretations, and ill use, the Pharisees made of it."
2. "For a divorce was allowable in no case, saving for the cause of fornication; which must not be taken strictly for what is called fornication, but as including adultery, incest, or any unlawful copulation."
3. "Should she marry another man, whilst he is alive, which her divorce allows her to do, she must be guilty of adultery; since she is his proper wife, the bond of marriage not being dissolved by such a divorce."

### John Wesley:
1. Causeth her to commit adultery â€” If she marry again.
