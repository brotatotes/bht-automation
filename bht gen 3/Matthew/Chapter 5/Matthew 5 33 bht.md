# Matthew 5:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus exceeds the Jewish belief that oaths without God's name are not binding by instructing his followers not to swear at all. Swearing solely serves as a means to strengthen simple affirmation due to sinful-induced distrust. Jesus disapproves frivolous and casual swearing, as it carries an appeal to God regardless of His name being mentioned. His teaching opposes the erroneous Jewish notion that only false swearing and oaths by God's name were forbidden. The emphasis here is to treat God's name with reverence, even in ordinary conversations.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Matthew 5:33, Jesus goes beyond the Jewish understanding of oaths and lays down a new rule for the Christian community: not to swear at all. This is because every oath, regardless of whether the name of God is invoked, carries an appeal to God. The use of oaths to strengthen affirmation arises from human sin and distrust, which is why the just and true and pure of heart do not need such means. Our Lord addresses the issue of swearing in common and frivolous circumstances, not condemning all oaths, such as those taken in a court of justice. The Jews erred in thinking that only false swearing and swearing by the name of God were forbidden, but Jesus corrects this misunderstanding. The prohibition on swearing extends to treating the name of God irreverently on trivial occasions or in ordinary conversation.
