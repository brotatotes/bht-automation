# Matthew 5:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
People often think it is acceptable to use oaths invoking heaven, earth, Jerusalem, or their own heads as substitutes for God's name. This reflects a lingering half-respect for the sacredness of God's name. However, the earth is God's footstool, as stated in Isaiah 66:1, and Jerusalem is the city of the great King. The earth showcases God's glory as part of His work, and Jerusalem represents His special religious authority. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use these references lightly in oaths; instead, we should honor the holiness of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Men had learned to think that, if only Godâ€™s name were avoided, there was no irreverence in the frequent oaths by heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem, by their own heads..." 
2. "Just-as now-a-days the same lingering half-respect for the Holy Name will often cause men, who would not be wholly profane, to substitute for that name sounds that nearly resemble, but are not exactly it, or the name, it may be, of some heathen deity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 35. Nor by the earth; for it is his
	footstoolâ€”(quoting Isaiah 66:1);
	
neither by Jerusalem for it
	is the city of the great Kingâ€”(quoting Isaiah 66:1- :).


### Philip Schaff:

2. "Any solemnity attending this oath came from the fact that it was the city of the great."
3. "Where the temple stood, the seat of the special religious government Jehovah had established over Israel."

### John Gill:
1. "The earth is God's 'footstool', referring, as before, to Isaiah 66:1 on which he treads; and where he also manifests forth his glory, and is a considerable part of the work of his hands."
2. "In the Gemara it is, 'he that says as Jerusalem, does not say anything, till he has made his vow concerning a thing, which is offered up in Jerusalem.''"
3. "The reason given for prohibiting this kind of oath, is; for it is the city of the great king: not of David, but of the King of kings, the Lord of hosts."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: People often believe that as long as they avoid using God's name, it is not irreverent to make oaths by invoking heaven, earth, Jerusalem, or their own heads. This is similar to how some people today may substitute similar-sounding words for God's name. However, this practice is not honoring to the sacredness of God's name. The verse reminds us that the earth is God's footstool, as stated in Isaiah 66:1, and Jerusalem is the city of the great King, highlighting the significance of these places in relation to God. The earth, a creation of God's hands, displays His glory. Additionally, Jerusalem, where the temple once stood, represents the special religious authority established by Jehovah over Israel. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use these references in oaths. Instead, we should respect the holiness of God and refrain from such practices.

- Attempt 2 BHT: People often think that it is acceptable to use oaths invoking heaven, earth, Jerusalem, or their own heads as substitutes for God's name. This practice reflects a lingering half-respect for the sacredness of God's name. However, the significance of the earth as God's footstool, mentioned in Isaiah 66:1, and Jerusalem as the city of the great King, should not be diminished. The earth, a remarkable creation of God, reveals His glory, and Jerusalem represents His special religious authority. It is therefore inappropriate to use these references lightly in oaths, as we should honor the holiness of God instead.

However, the earth is the very footstool of God, reflecting the words of Isaiah 66:1, and Jerusalem holds the designation as the city of the great King. We must not take lightly these references, for they represent the glory of God and His special religious authority.
