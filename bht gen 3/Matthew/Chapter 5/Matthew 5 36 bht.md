# Matthew 5:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
You have no control over the appearance of grey hairs on your head, as every oath is an appeal to God. Swearing by your own head is profane and assumes a stability it does not have. You cannot even make one hair white or black, so it is improper to pledge what is God's gift and property. Instead, let your yes be yes and your no be no, without relying on oaths that are beyond your control.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Our lives, including the appearance of our hair, are not within our control or ownership. Every oath we make is ultimately an appeal to God. Instead of making extravagant oaths, Jesus teaches us to let our yes be yes and our no be no, without the need for excessive swearing. When we swear by our own head, we are assuming a stability and control that we do not have. It is improper and even profane to swear by something that is beyond our control, as it is essentially an implicit oath by God Himself.
