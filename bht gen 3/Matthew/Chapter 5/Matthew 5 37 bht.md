## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let your communication... be, Yea, yea; Nay, nayâ€”Let a simple Yes and No suffice in affirming the truth or the untruth of anything." (Matthew 5:37)
2. "The untruthfulness of our corrupt nature shows itself not only in the tendency to deviate from the strict truth but in the disposition to suspect others of doing the same." (Matthew 5:37)
3. "Just as swearing to the truth of what we say begets the disposition it is designed to remove, so the love and reign of truth in the breasts of Christ's disciples reveals itself so plainly even to those who themselves cannot be trusted." (Matthew 5:37)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When we hear a man swear to a thing, it is pretty good evidence that he knows what he is saying to be false, and we should be on our guard." 
2. "He that will break the third commandment will not hesitate to break the ninth also. And this explains the fact that profane swearers are seldom believed." 
3. "A man that is truly a Christian, and leads a Christian life, does not need oaths and profaneness to make him believed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Fairness and honesty in our words are, therefore, demanded by Christ, that there may be no longer any occasion for an oath."
2. "This repetition means, that we ought to abide by our words, so that all may be convinced of our honesty."
3. "Christ teaches us, in my opinion, that it originates in the wickedness of men, that they are compelled to swear: for, if honesty prevailed among men, if they were not inconsistent and hypocritical, they would maintain that simplicity which nature dictates."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The true oath consists in the simple asseveration uttered under a sense of the presence of God, before Him, and in Him."
2. "All strengthening of simple yea and nay is occasioned by the presence of sin, and the power of Satan, in the world."
3. "There is no more striking proof of the existence of evil, than the prevalence of the foolish, low, useless habit of profanity."

### John Gill:
1. "A righteous man's yea, is yea, and his no, is no; his word is sufficient."
2. "This way of speaking, they looked upon equivalent to an oath; yea, they affirm it was one."
3. "Whatever exceeds this way of speaking and conversation, in the common affairs of life, is either from the devil, who is the evil one, by way of eminency; or from the evil heart of man, from the pride, malice, envy, &c. that are in it."

### John Wesley:
1. Let your conversation be yea, yea; nay, nay â€” That is, in your common discourse, barely affirm or deny.
