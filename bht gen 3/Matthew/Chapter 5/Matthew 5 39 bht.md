2. "He gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, and hid not his face from shame and spitting."
3. "Only, the other possible meaning there, 'the evil One,' is precluded here."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:

2. "The best interpreter of this passage that we can have is Paul, who enjoins us rather to 'overcome evil by good' than contend with evil-doers."
3. "Unquestionably, Christ did not intend to exhort his people to whet the malice of those, whose propensity to injure others is sufficiently strong: and if they were to turn to them the other cheek, what would it be but holding out such an encouragement?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "Turn to him the other also: which is to be understood comparatively, rather than seek revenge."

### John Wesley:
1. "If a man smite thee on the right cheek - Return not evil for evil: yea, turn to him the other." 
2. "Rather than revenge thyself, where the damage is not great, choose rather to suffer it, though possibly it may on that account be repeated, than to demand an eye for an eye, to enter into a rigorous prosecution of the offender." 
3. "Rather than return evil for evil, when the wrong is purely personal, submit to one bodily wrong after another, give up one part of your goods after another, submit to one instance of compulsion after another."
