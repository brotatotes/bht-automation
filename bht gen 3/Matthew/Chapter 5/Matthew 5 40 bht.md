# Matthew 5:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone sues you and takes away your undergarment, let them have your outer garment as well. This command from Christ teaches us to be patient and submissive, even in legal disputes. The inner garment, or coat, could be demanded at law, while the outer garment, or cloak, was more valuable and used as a covering for the night. Christians should refrain from seeking vengeance and instead demonstrate patience and a forgiving attitude. Giving up both garments without resistance shows a higher level of concession.
