# Matthew 5:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we pray to God, He answers us in a way that is ultimately better than what we ask for. While it may not always be exactly what we desire, it is always what is good for us. We are called to practice a higher form of charity, one that flows from inner springs of love, guiding us to make timely concessions and refusals. In the case of lending to others, it is important to understand that the original sense of borrowing here refers to simple lending, not lending with interest. We should not be indiscriminate in our giving, but carefully consider the welfare of the one asking. In our modern world, it can be easy for the milk of human kindness to dry up in the midst of organized charities. Therefore, let us embrace the spirit, rather than the letter, of these teachings, seeking to be generous and kind to all who are genuinely in need.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our gracious Saviour, knowing what is good for us, so answers our prayers, that we never are sent empty away; not always, indeed, receiving what we ask,â€”but that which, in the very disappointment, we are constrained thankfully to confess is better than our wish."
2. "To give every thing to every oneâ€”the sword to the madman, the alms to the impostor, the criminal request to the temptressâ€”would be to act as the enemy of others and ourselves."
3. "Ours should be a higher and deeper charity, flowing from those inner springs of love, which are the sources of outward actions sometimes widely divergent; whence may arise both the timely concession, and the timely refusal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though the word signifies classically 'to have money lent to one on security,' or 'with interest,' yet as this was not the original sense of the word, and as usury was forbidden among the Jews, it is doubtless simple borrowing which our Lord here means, as indeed the whole strain of the exhortation implies."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is better to give sometimes to an undeserving person than to turn away one who is really in need."
2. "To give to such is to encourage laziness, and to support the idle at the expense of the industrious."
3. "If a widow, an orphan, a man of misfortune, or an infirmed man, lame, or sick, is at your door, never send any of them away empty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Borrow [Î´Î±Î½Î¹ÏƒÎ±ÏƒÎ¸Î±Î¹] . Properly, to borrow at interest.


### John Calvin:
1. "Christ exhorts his disciples to be liberal and generous."
2. "The way of doing it is, not to think that they have discharged their duty when they have aided a few persons, but to study to be kind to all, and not to be weary of giving, so long as they have the means."
3. "To have an open hand to petitioners is to be generously disposed to all who need our assistance, and who cannot return the favor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Refusal may often be the best gift."
2. "Our gifts and loans are to be measured by the welfare, not by the desert of the asker."
3. "To be made in the spirit of our Heavenly Father."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is one of the clearest instances of the necessity of accepting the spirit and not the letter of the Lord's commands."
2. "Not only does indiscriminate almsgiving do little but injury to society, but the words must embrace far more than almsgiving."
3. "In the organized charities of modern life, we are in danger of letting the milk of human kindness dry up."

### John Gill:
1. "Give it freely, readily, cheerfully, according to your abilities, and as the necessity of the object requires."
2. "Refuse him not, turn not away from him with a frown, or without speaking to him, or with a denial; look upon him with a pleasant countenance, cheerfully lend him what he wants."
3. "Lend him freely, 'hoping for nothing again', which must not be understood of not hoping for the money lent, for then it would be giving, and not lending; but of not hoping for any reward for lending it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Give to him that asketh thee - Give and lend to any so far, (but no further, for God never contradicts himself) as is consistent with thy engagements to thy creditors, thy family, and the household of faith." 
2. "Give and lend to any so far, (but no further, for God never contradicts himself) as is consistent with thy engagements." 
3. "Give and lend to any so far, (but no further, for God never contradicts himself)."
