# Matthew 5:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus fulfills the command to love our neighbor, extending it to include all mankind, even those who curse, revile, and persecute us. The Pharisees had added the belief to hate one's enemies, but Jesus corrects this and teaches us to pray for our enemies and treat them kindly. The true meaning of neighbor that Jesus restores is a love that looks beyond deserving and extends to the unworthy, the wicked, and the ungrateful. Jesus exemplified this love through his own actions and teachings, such as the parable of the Good Samaritan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lordâ€™s 'fulfilment' of neighbourly love extends it to all mankindâ€”not only foreign nations, but even those who are actively employed in cursing, reviling, and persecuting us." 
2. "The hating of enemies is, in His fulfilment of it, no longer an individual or national aversion, but a coming out and being separate from all that rebel."
3. "But our Lordâ€™s 'fulfilment' of neighbourly love extends it to all mankindâ€”not only foreign nations, but even those who are actively employed in cursing, reviling, and persecuting us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou shalt love thy neighbourâ€”To this the corrupt teachers added, and hate thine enemy." 
2. "No wonder that the Romans charged the Jews with hatred of the human race."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The command to love our neighbor was a law of God."
2. "They were total strangers to that great, special law of religion which requires us to love both."
3. "A neighbor is literally one that lives near to us; then, one who is near to us by acts of kindness and friendship."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Neighbor [Ï„Î¿Î½ Ï€Î»Î·ÏƒÎ¹Î¿Î½] . Another word to which the Gospel has imparted a broader and deeper sense."
2. "The Old Testament expands the meaning to cover national or tribal fellowship, and that is the sense in our Lord 's quotation here."
3. "The Christian sense is expounded by Jesus in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:29 sqq.), as including the whole brotherhood of man, and as founded in love for man, as man, everywhere."

### John Calvin:
1. "To keep up the exercise of brotherly love, God assures us, that all men are our brethren, because they are related to us by a common nature."
2. "But the charity, which God requires in his law, looks not at what a man has deserved, but extends itself to the unworthy, the wicked, and the ungrateful."
3. "Now, this is the true meaning which Christ restores, and vindicates from calumny; and hence it is obvious, as I have already said, that Christ does not introduce new laws, but corrects the wicked glosses of the Scribes, by whom the purity of the divine law had been corrupted."

1. "The original precept referred to Israelites, and obedience to it helped to keep them distinct from other nations."
2. "But the Pharisees, to increase the distance between the Jews and Gentiles, added the converse precept: and hate thine enemy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul in Romans 12:20 quotes Proverbs 25:22 to prove that we ought to treat our enemies kindly."

1. "The Jew has no reason to charge Christ, or the Evangelist, with a false testimony."

3. "This arises from a mistaken sense of the word 'neighbor', which they understood only of a friend."
