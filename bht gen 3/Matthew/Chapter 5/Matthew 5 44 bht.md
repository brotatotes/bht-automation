## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Love your enemiesâ€”The word here used denotes moral love, as distinguished from the other word, which expresses personal affection."

3. "The best commentary on these matchless counsels is the bright example of Him who gave them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There are two kinds of love, involving the same general feeling, or springing from the same fountain of good-will to all mankind, but differing so far as to admit of separation in idea."
2. "This is the love of benevolence, and this love we are to bear toward our enemies."
3. "This seems to be what is meant by loving our enemies; and this is a special law of Christianity, and the highest possible test of piety, and probably the most difficult of all duties to be performed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ presents to us, in a summary view, the way and manner of fulfilling this precept, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
2. "We learn from these words, how far believers ought to be removed from every kind of revenge: for they are not only forbidden to ask it from God, but are commanded to banish and efface it from their minds so completely, as to bless their enemies."
3. "We ought simply to inquire, what is demanded by the law of charity: for, if we rely on the heavenly power of the Spirit, we shall encounter successfully all that is opposed to it in our feelings."
