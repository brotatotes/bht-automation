# Matthew 5:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By imitating God's mind and embracing His view on revenge and exclusive dealing, we solidify our position as His children in the kingdom of heaven. Following Seneca's sentiment of conferring benefits even on the ungrateful, we exemplify God's character by doing good to those who may not appreciate it. This demonstrates our resemblance to God, showcasing His love and benevolence. In essence, imitating God's actions proves our sonship and reinforces the notion that reflecting His nature is not just a new concept but a timeless principle.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The more we lift ourselves above the worldâ€™s view of the duty and expediency of revenge and exclusive dealing, into the mind with which the â€˜righteous Judge, strong and patient, who is provoked every day,â€™ yet does good to the unthankful and evilâ€”the more firmly shall we assure, and the more nobly illustrate, our place as sons in His family, as having entered into the kingdom of heaven."
