# Matthew 5:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even the worst of men, like the publicans who were seen as the scum of the earth, can love those who love them. So when Jesus says that if you only love those who love you, you are not displaying any superior principle or evidence of genuine love, he's challenging his followers to rise above this natural inclination. It is easy for anyone, even the publicans, to show love to those who love them; it's a poor religion that doesn't inspire a higher love than what is natural to worldly men.
