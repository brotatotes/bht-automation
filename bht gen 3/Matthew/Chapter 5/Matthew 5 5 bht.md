# Matthew 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise of inheriting the earth speaks directly to the meek, striking at the root of worldly expectations of power and wealth in the kingdom of the Messiah. Meekness, as depicted in Ephesians 4:2, goes beyond mere outward lowliness and encompasses love and long-suffering. This Christian virtue, emphasizing a spiritual relationship with God, reveals the best aspects of heathen virtue - mildness, gentleness, equanimity. It is the gentle strength that Jesus himself exemplified, different than the pagan understanding of meekness. Ultimately, the meek receive all things and find favor with God, surpassing the possession of worldly riches.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The meek should inherit the earth, struck at the root of the temporal expectations of power and wealth in the Messiahâ€™s kingdom."
2. "This meekness is not mere outward lowliness of demeanour, but that true meekness of Eph. iv. 2, whose active side is love, and its passive side long-suffering."
3. "That kingdom of God which begins in the hearts of the disciples of Christ, and is not 'of (sprung from) this world,' shall work onwards till it shall become actually a kingdom over this earth, and its subjects shall inherit the earth: first in its millennial, and finally in its renewed and blessed state for ever."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The promise to the meek is but a repetition of Psalms 37:11; only the word which our Evangelist renders 'the meek,' after the Septuagint, is the same which we have found so often translated 'the poor,' showing how closely allied these two features of character are."
2. "Towards men this disposition is the opposite of high-mindedness, and a quarrelsome and revengeful spirit; it 'rather takes wrong, and suffers itself to be defrauded'." 
3. "All things, in short, are theirsâ€”in the possession of that favor which is life, and of those rights which belong to them as the children of Godâ€”whether the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are theirs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Meekness is patience in the reception of injuries. It is neither meanness nor a surrender of our rights, nor cowardice; but it is the opposite of sudden anger, of malice, of long-harbored vengeance."
2. "Meekness is the reception of injuries with a belief that God will vindicate us."
3. "The value of meekness, even in regard to worldly property and success in life, is often exhibited in the Scriptures."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Christian word, on the contrary, describes an inward quality, and that as related primarily to God."
2. "The Christian quality, in its manifestation, reveals all that was best in the heathen virtue - mildness, gentleness, equanimity - but these manifestations toward men are emphasized as outgrowths of a spiritual relation to God."
3. "While, therefore, the pagan quality is redolent of self-assertion, the Christian quality carries the flavor of self-abasement."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ places his own protection, and that of the Father, in contrast with the fury and violence of wicked men, and declares, on good grounds, that the meek will be the lords and heirs of the earth."
2. "For the children of God, on the other hand, I answer, that though they may not plant their foot on what is their own, they enjoy a quiet residence on the earth."
3. "Though exposed to every species of attack, subject to the malice of wicked men, surrounded by all kinds of danger, they are safe under the divine protection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meek; the mild, the gentle, opposed to the ambitious, who succeed in such a kingdom as the Jews were looking for." 
2. "A higher quality than the preceding." 
3. "Inherit the earth, or â€˜the land,â€™ i.e., of Canaan, the type of all blessings, not merely of spiritual ones."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But Jesus lifted the word to a nobility never attained before."
2. "The English word 'meek' has largely lost the fine blend of spiritual poise and strength meant by the Master."
3. "It is the gentleness of strength, not mere effeminacy."

### John Gill:
1. "Meekness, or humility, is very valuable and commendable."
2. "Here meekness is to be considered, not as a moral virtue, but as a Christian grace, a fruit of the Spirit of God."
3. "Such who are possessed of it, and exercise it, are well pleasing to God; when disconsolate, he comforts them; when hungry, he satisfies them; when they want direction, he gives it to them; when wronged, he will do them right; he gives them more grace here, and glory hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "Happy are the meek â€” They that hold all their passions and affections evenly balanced."
2. "They shall inherit the earth â€” They shall have all things really necessary for life and godliness."
3. "They shall enjoy whatever portion God hath given them here, and shall hereafter possess the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
