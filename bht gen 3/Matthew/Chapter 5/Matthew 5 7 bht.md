# Matthew 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Happy are those who show mercy not only through acts of charity, but also through kind words and tears. By showing mercy, we imitate God and demonstrate our likeness to Him. As we bear the injustices of the world and address the needs of others, we exude a merciful character that is both evidence and measure of God's mercy. Although the world may be ungrateful, we can find comfort in the grace that is stored up with God for the merciful. Let us remember that whatever mercy we desire from God, let us show the same to others.
