# Matthew 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who, by faith and love, attain inner purity and see God with a clear and sympathetic vision. This purity of heart is more than just moral cleanliness; it is a cleanness from sin that allows one to truly see the Lord. Without holiness, no one can have the blessed privilege of the Beatific Vision, but those with pure hearts can experience this closeness to God both on earth and in eternity.
