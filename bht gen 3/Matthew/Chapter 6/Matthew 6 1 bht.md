Jesus now transitions from actions to motives, focusing on the righteousness of the kingdom of heaven. He distinguishes between the open benevolence of a Christian seeking to glorify God and the self-seeking ostentation of one motivated by praise from others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The discourse of our Lord now passes from actions to motives; not that He has not spoken to the heart before, but then it was only by inference, now directly." 
2. "It is best then to understand righteousness as in ch. v. 20, as a general term, including the three duties afterwards treated of."
3. "Not the open benevolence of the Christian who lets his light shine that men may glorify God, but the ostentation of him whose object is the praise and glory coming from man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By 'righteousness,' in this case, we are to understand that same righteousness of the kingdom of heaven, whose leading featuresâ€”in opposition to traditional perversions of itâ€”it is the great object of this discourse to open up." 
2. "To 'do' this righteousness, was an old and well-understood expression. Thus, 'Blessed is he that doeth righteousness at all times.'"
3. "True, He had required them to let their light so shine before men that they might see their good works, and glorify their Father which is in heaven... But this is quite consistent with not making a display of our righteousness for self-glorification. In fact, the doing of the former necessarily implies our not doing the latter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Our Saviour here does not positively command his disciples to aid the poor, but supposes that they would do it of course, and gives them directions how to do it."

1. "A very necessary admonition; for in all virtues the entrance of ambition is to be dreaded, and there is no work so laudable, as not to be in many instances corrupted and polluted by it."
2. "Under one class he lays down, by a synecdoche, a general doctrine: for he speaks of alms only, as he speaks shortly afterwards about prayers."
3. "But the difference is of little moment: for in either way there is no room to doubt, that the design is, to correct the disease of ambition, when, in doing what is right, we seek glory from men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The method to be cared for to guard against the wrong end."
2. "Hiding from men only necessary to prevent the praise of men from becoming the motive."
3. "The reward may (usually does) come from men, but not from God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Our word theatrical is this very word, spectacular performance."
3. "Literally 'beside your Father,' standing by his side, as he looks at it."
