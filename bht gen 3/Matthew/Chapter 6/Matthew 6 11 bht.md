## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For a discussion of the probable derivations and meanings, I must refer to my Gr. Test. I have there seen reason to prefer the sense required for our subsistence—proper for our sustenance." 
2. "To understand the expression of the Eucharist primarily, or even of spiritual feeding on Christ, is to miss the plain reference of the petition to our daily physical wants."
3. "'Augustine uses the testimony of this prayer against all proud Pelagian notions of an absolutely sinless state in this life' (Trench); and answers the various excuses and evasions by which that sect escaped from the conclusion."

### John Calvin:
1. "When we pray, therefore, we must never turn away our eyes from that object."
2. "Since God condescends to nourish our bodies, there can be no doubt whatever, that he is far more careful of our spiritual life."
3. "No man will sincerely offer such a prayer as this, unless he has learned, by the example of the Apostle Paul, 'to be full and to be hungry, to abound and to suffer need,' (Philippians 4:12), to endure patiently his poverty or his humble condition, and not to be intoxicated by a false confidence in his abundance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Bread,’ food in general; the form in the Greek hints that it is ‘ours,’ i.e., created for our use; ‘this day,’ shows that we are to pray daily and to ask neither for riches nor poverty, but, with contentment and thankfulness for the day’s portion only."
2. "The word translated ‘daily’ has occasioned a great deal of discussion... Explanations (1) ‘required for our (physical) wants,’ ‘needful;’ (2) ‘coming,’ i.e., tomorrow’s bread...and (3) Romanists refer ‘bread’ to spiritual nourishment...the primary sense must be that of actual bodily food."
3. "The propriety of daily family prayer is suggested by this petition for our ‘daily bread.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The opinion here expressed has been confirmed by A. Debrunner's discovery (Theol. Lit. Ztg. 1925, Col. 119) of επιουσιος in an ancient housekeeping book."
2. "The word occurs also in three late MSS. after 2Macc. 1:8, τους επιουσιους after τους αρτους."
3. "The meaning, in view of the kindred participle (επιουση) in Acts 16:12, seems to be 'for the coming day,' a daily prayer for the needs of the next day as every housekeeper understands like the housekeeping book discovered by Debrunner."

### John Gill:
1. "this signifies the whole subsequent time of life, and so furnishes us with a very commodious sense of this petition; which is, that God would give us, 'day by day'".
2. "the meaning of it is, that God would give us, for the present time, such food as we stand in need of; is suitable to us, to our nature and constitution, state and condition, and is sufficient and convenient for us".
3. "By 'bread' is meant all the necessaries of life, and for the support of it: it is called 'our's'; not that we have a right unto it, much less deserve it, but to distinguish it from that of beasts; and because it is what we need, and cannot do without".
