## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sentiment is not in any way inconsistent with the Christian's joy when he 'falls into divers temptations,' James i. 2, but is a humble self-distrust and shrinking from such trial in the prospect."
2. "There is no discrepancy with James i. 13, which speaks not of the providential bringing about of, but the actual solicitation of, the temptation."
3. "They are the expression of the yearning for redemption of the sons of God (Rom. viii. 28), and so are fitly placed at the end of the prayer, and as the sum and substance of the personal petitions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is a mistake to define this word as only solicitation to evil. It means trial of any kind, without reference to its moral quality."
2. "Here, generally of all situations and circumstances which furnish an occasion for sin."
3. "We cannot pray God not to tempt us to sin, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are conscious Of our own weakness, and desire to enjoy the protection of God, that we may remain impregnable against all the assaults of Satan."
2. "We ask that the Lord would not cause us to be thrown down, or suffer us to be overwhelmed, by temptations."
3. "It is surprising that this clause, which agrees so well with the rest of the prayer, has been left out by the Latins: for it was not added merely for the purpose of kindling our hearts to seek the glory of God, and of reminding us what ought to be the object of our prayers; but likewise to teach us, that our prayers, which are here dictated to us, are founded on God alone, that we may not rely on our own merits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We should never seek temptation, but flee from it; or if we cannot avoid it, meet it with the weapon of prayer wielded in that faith which overcomes the world."
2. "Entire deliverance by Godâ€™s grace from evil (or from the evil one) is entire freedom from temptation, and looks toward that final redemption in heaven."
3. "For, 'we ask all this of Thee because,' thine, by right and possession, is the kingdom, the blessed dominion for which we pray, and the power, omnipotence, ability to answer, and the glory, the glory prayed for in the first petition which is the end of all our petitions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word here translated 'temptation' means originally 'trial' or 'test'... God does test or sift us, though he does not tempt us to evil." 
2. "Do not allow us to be led into temptation... There is a way out, but it is a terrible risk." 
3. "The use of a doxology arose when this prayer began to be used as a liturgy... It was not an original part of the Model Prayer as given by Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "We are not here taught to pray against temptations at all, or in any sense, for they are sometimes needful and useful; but that they may not have the power over us, and destroy us."
2. "To be delivered from [Satan], is to be rescued out of his hands, preserved from his snares, and delivered from his temptations."
3. "The whole [prayer], and every part of it, being exceedingly instructive, and worthy of imitation; but to rectify a vulgar mistake, and to abate the formal and superstitious observance of it."
