# Matthew 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus speaks of fasting, He warns against imitating the hypocrites who disfigure their faces and make their faces unappearable to appear as if they are deeply engaged in fasting. However, Jesus sharply ridicules this pretense of piety and encourages sincere fasting without seeking the approval of men. Instead, we should practice moderation, focusing on our genuine devotion to God rather than impressing others with a gloomy appearance or drastic changes in our appearance during fasting.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The allusion is therefore not to covering the face, which could only be regarded as a sign of mourning, but to the squalor of the uncleansed face, and hair of the head and beard." 
2. "The word [disfigure] literally means make to disappear... But in later Greek, the meaning was to disfigure."
3. "One writer uses it of women who paint their faces."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Moreover, when ye fastâ€”referring, probably, to private and voluntary fasting, which was to be regulated by each individual for himself; though in spirit it would apply to any fast."
2. "be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their facesâ€”literally, 'make unseen'; very well rendered 'disfigure.' They went about with a slovenly appearance, and ashes sprinkled on their head."
3. "Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Fasting, then, is the natural expression of grief... It is because the soul, when oppressed and burdened by a sense of sin, is so filled with grief that the body refuses food."
2. "It is also useful to humble us, to bring us to reflection, to direct the thoughts away from the allurements of this world to the bliss of a better."
3. "Never should people exhibit outwardly more than they feel; and never should they attempt to exhibit anything for the mere sake of ostentation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Observe the force of the present tense as indicating action in progress: Whenever ye may be fasting." 
2. "The idea is rather conceal than disfigure."
3. "Avoid the squalor of the unwashed face and of the unkempt hair and beard, and the rather anoint thy head and wash thy face, so as to appear not unto men, but unto God as fasting."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not enjoin us to counterfeit splendor, or exhort us to temperance in food in such a manner, as to encourage the luxuries of ointments and of dress: but merely exhorts us to preserve moderation, without any thing new or affected;â€”in short, that the fastings, in which we engage, should make no change in our accustomed way of living."
2. "Prayer holds the first rank among the antics of piety: but fasting is a doubtful operation, and does not, like alms, belong to the class of those actions which God requires and approves."
3. "The meaning of Christâ€™s words is: 'God will one day show that he was pleased with those good works, which appeared to be lost, because they were concealed from the eyes of men.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fasting as an aid to prayer and meditation, and a wholesome discipline, is a religious duty, and has a place in Christian practice."
2. "More is meant than temperance in meat and drink. Stated fasts are likely to become formal; public fasts are almost sure to become Pharisaical."
3. "They make their faces unappearable (â€˜disfigureâ€™), that they may appear unto men fasting. They obtain their wish, have received their reward, the hire for which they do such things."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These actors or hypocrites 'put on a gloomy look' and, if necessary, even 'disfigure their faces', that they may look like they are fasting."
2. "It is this pretence of piety that Jesus so sharply ridicules."
3. "They conceal their real looks that they may seem to be fasting, conscious and pretentious hypocrisy."

### John Gill:
1. "They disfigure their faces; not by covering them out of sight, by putting a veil over them, as some have thought; but they neglected to wash their faces, and make them clean, as at other times; and not only so, but put ashes upon their heads, and other methods they used: they discoloured their faces, or 'made' them 'black', as the Arabic version reads it; that they might look as if they became so through fasting."
2. "Now these practices they used, that they might appear unto men to fast: so that either they did not really fast, when they pretended to it; only put on these outward appearances, that men might think they did."
3. "For their view in fasting was not to satisfy their own consciences, or please God, but that they might have glory of men. Hence, says Christ, verily I say unto you, they have their reward; they obtain what they seek for, honour from men, and that is all they will have."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord does not enjoin either fasting, alms-deeds, or prayer: all these being duties which were before fully established in the Church of God."
2. "Disfigure â€” By the dust and ashes which they put upon their heads, as was usual at the times of solemn humiliation."
