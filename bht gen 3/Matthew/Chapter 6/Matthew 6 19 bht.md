# Matthew 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The treasures of this earth, whether costly clothing or material wealth, are fleeting and vulnerable to destruction. Earthly possessions should not be cherished or stored up, for they can rot away or be stolen. Instead, our focus should be on the treasures of heaven, the rich palaces prepared for those who possess faith and charity. The desire for worldly riches is futile, as they are transient and unreliable. Rather than placing our trust in perishable treasures, we should value heavenly treasures that will endure for eternity.
