# Matthew 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When giving, we must avoid seeking recognition like the hypocrites who sounded a trumpet to draw attention to themselves. Their actions were driven by a desire for fame and reputation, rather than a genuine desire to do what is right and glorify God. However, the applause of men is a poor reward, falling short of God's approval and honor. True fulfillment comes from serving with humility and sincerity, without seeking the praise or approval of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not implying any such custom of the hypocrites of that day, but the habit of self-laudation, and display of good works in general."
2. "Many Commentators...think that the words are to be taken literally."
3. "The synagogues, as afterwards the Christian churches, were the regular places for the collection of alms."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Therefore, when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before theeâ€”The expression is to be taken figuratively for blazoning it. Hence our expression to 'trumpet.'" 
2. "as the hypocrites doâ€”This wordâ€”of such frequent occurrence in Scripture, signifying primarily 'one who acts a part'â€”denotes one who either pretends to be what he is not (as here), or dissembles what he really is (as in Luke 12:1; Luke 12:2)."
3. "that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto youâ€”In such august expressions, it is the Lawgiver and Judge Himself that we hear speaking to us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hypocrite'...means here, and in the New Testament generally, those who 'dissemble' or hide their real sentiments, and assume or express other feelings than their own."
2. "It is probable that such persons...caused a trumpet to be sounded, professedly to call the poor together to receive it, but really to call the people to see the proofs of their liberality and piety; or perhaps it may mean that they should not make a great noise about it, like sounding a trumpet."
3. "They obtain the applause they seek...and as this applause was all they wished, there is, of course, no further reward to be looked for or obtained."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sound a trumpet. There seems to be no trace of any such custom on the part of almsgivers, so that the expression must be taken as a figurative one for making a display."
2. "It is just possible that the figure may have been suggested by the 'trumpets' of the temple treasury - thirteen trumpet-shaped chests to receive the contributions of worshippers."
3. "Have their reward. The preposition ajpo indicates receipt in full. Rev. renders they have received, so that there is nothing more to receive."

### John Calvin:
1. "When our service is rendered to the eyes of men, we do not submit our life to the judgment and approbation of God."
2. "Those persons, who exhibit themselves in this manner, have their reward: for they whose eyes are held by such vanity cannot look upon God."
3. "Others do good, not from a desire to do what is right, nor on account of the glory of God, but only to obtain for themselves fame and a reputation for holiness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do not sound a trumpet before thee, etc. It would be impossible to blow a trumpet in the synagogues, where the alms were regularly collected, or even in the streets, where the giver would be accosted by the beggar, and hardly carry a trumpet with him for such casual occurrences. The language is figurative: a trumpet was sounded before official personages to call attention to them; hence self-laudation and display are meant." 
2. "Hypocrites. The Pharisees are not named, but, as a class, deserved this epithet." 
3. "They have received their reward; already in full, and will get no more. They have the applause of men; the favor of God is denied by Matthew 6:1. Their â€˜dueâ€™ reward is not spoken of."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Certainly it was in keeping with their love of praise. And Jesus expressly says that 'the hypocrites' do this very thing. This is an old word for actor, interpreter, one who personates another... Then to pretend, to feign, to dissemble, to act the hypocrite, to wear a mask." 
2. "They have received their reward... 'they have their receipt in full,' all the reward that they will get, this public notoriety."
3. "They can sign the receipt of their reward."

### John Gill:
1. "The sense is, that when they did their alms, they chose public places for it, such as the 'synagogues', where was a large concourse of people met together for religious worship; or the open 'streets' of the city, where people were continually walking to and fro, so that nothing could be done in this way, but what must be seen and observed."
2. "Verily I say unto you, they have their reward; and a poor one it is, the applause of men: however, it is what they seek after, and is all their empty performances deserve, and all they will have."
3. "By seeking the glory of men, they lay impediments in the way of receiving honour from God."

### John Wesley:
1. "As the hypocrites do...under a pretence of calling the poor together."
2. "They have their reward...for they shall have none from God."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When we give to others, we should not do it in a way that draws attention and praise to ourselves, like the hypocrites who would sound a trumpet to announce their good deeds. Jesus warns against this self-centered display, emphasizing that the applause of men is all that these hypocrites will receive. By seeking the approval and admiration of others, they close themselves off from receiving true honor from God. Their actions are driven by a desire for fame and reputation, rather than a genuine desire to do what is right and glorify God. It is important for us to remember that our service should be done for the eyes of God, not for human recognition, as our reward lies in His approval alone.
