# Matthew 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When you give to the needy, do not seek public recognition and applause like the hypocrites who make a show of their good deeds. Their actions are driven by a need for self-laudation and the display of their own righteousness. Instead, perform your acts of charity quietly and sincerely, without drawing attention to yourself. Seek the approval and reward of God, rather than the fleeting applause of men. True charity is done with a pure heart and a genuine desire to help others, not for personal gain or recognition.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "sound a trumpet] A proverbial expression, not implying any such custom of the hypocrites of that day,-but the habit of self-laudation, and display of good works in general."
2. "Many Commentators, among whom are Calvin and Bengel, think that the words are to be taken literally: and Euthymins mentions this view."
3. "The synagogues, as afterwards the Christian churches, were the regular places for the collection of alms."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Therefore, when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee...Hence our expression to 'trumpet'." 
2. "This wordâ€”of such frequent occurrence in Scripture, signifying primarily 'one who acts a part'â€”denotes one who either pretends to be what he is not...or dissembles what he really is."
3. "In such august expressions, it is the Lawgiver and Judge Himself that we hear speaking to us...All they wanted was human applause, and they have itâ€”and with it, all they will ever get."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hypocrite' is taken from 'stage-players,' who act the part of others, or speak not their own sentiments, but the sentiments of others. It means here, and in the New Testament generally, those who 'dissemble' or hide their real sentiments, and assume or express other feelings than their own."
2. "In the synagogues - The word 'synagogue' commonly means the place of assembling for religious worship known by that name. See the notes at Matthew 4:23. It might mean, however, any 'collection of people' assembled for any purpose, and it is not improbable that it has that meaning here."
3. "They have their reward - That is, they obtain the applause they seek the reputation of being charitable; and as this applause was all they wished, there is, of course, no further reward to be looked for or obtained."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sound a trumpet. [...] It is just possible that the figure may have been suggested by the 'trumpets' of the temple treasury - thirteen trumpet-shaped chests to receive the contributions of worshipers."
2. "Have their reward. The preposition ajpo indicates receipt in full. Rev. renders they have received, so that there is nothing more to receive."
3. "They have received their need."

### John Calvin:
1. "When our service is rendered to the eyes of men, we do not submit our life to the judgment and approbation of God."
2. "Having no proper object in view in the performance of good works, they assume a different character, that they may appear to be holy and sincere worshippers of God."
3. "It is a curious instance of the facility with which a word passes, by a few changes, into a meaning altogether different from what it originally bore."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do not sound a trumpet before thee, etc... self-laudation and display are meant."
2. "Hypocrites... deserved this epithet."
3. "They have received their reward; already in full, and will get no more."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No actual instance of such conduct has been found in the Jewish writings."
2. "Certainly it was in keeping with their love of praise."
3. "This is the hardest word that Jesus has for any class of people and he employs it for these pious pretenders who pose as perfect."

### John Gill:
1. "When thou dost thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory of men."
2. "But what did they get by it? Verily I say unto you, they have their reward; and a poor one it is, the applause of men."
3. "By seeking the glory of men, they lay impediments in the way of receiving honour from God."

### John Wesley:
1. "As the hypocrites do...under a pretence of calling the poor together."
2. "They have their reward."
3. "All they will have; for they shall have none from God."
