Our conversation will be in heaven, reflecting the eternal happiness we will find there.

3. "But because 'laying up' is not in itself sinful, nay, in some cases enjoined (:-), and honest industry and sagacious enterprise are usually rewarded with prosperity, many flatter themselves that all is right between them and God, while their closest attention, anxiety, zeal, and time are exhausted upon these earthly pursuits."

2. "But if your treasure is put into the hands of God, your hearts will be with him, and be settled on him; your desires will be after heavenly things; your affections will be set on things above."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Where our hearts are, our true treasure lies - a divided affection between earthly riches and heavenly rewards. Some may rationalize their focus on worldly pursuits, but the truth remains that our happiness and security in this world is uncertain and short-lived. If we truly believe that our ultimate happiness is found in heaven, we would easily sacrifice earthly desires and rise towards heavenly aspirations. If our hearts are fixated on earthly treasures, our souls are at risk of being lost. However, if our treasure is entrusted to God, our hearts will be anchored in Him, our desires directed towards heavenly things, and our eternal happiness assured. Let us remember that our conversation must reflect the treasures we hold: in heaven, while on earth.
