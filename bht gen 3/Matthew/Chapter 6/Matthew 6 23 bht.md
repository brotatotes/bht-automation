# Matthew 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the light within us, the conscience and guide of our souls, is tainted and obscured, how much deeper and darker will our passions and faculties become? It is like a mind and heart divided between heavenly and earthly desires, resulting in a state of darkness. This false perception, worse than blindness, distorts our judgment and prevents us from discerning what is right. Let us strive to keep our inner light pure, so that our whole being may be filled with radiant light, like a shining candle.
