# Matthew 6:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man's being cannot be divided between serving God and Mammon; he must be one, either light or dark. One cannot serve two masters of opposing character and interests. It is impossible to serve both God and Mammon, with the service of this god and the true God together being pronounced impossible. Trying to serve both only leads to failure and falling into the ditch. Man must choose to be wholly devoted to one master, as serving Mammon means abandoning the service of God and becoming a slave to the devil.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Man cannot simultaneously serve God and Mammon (Matthew 6:24). This division in man's being is impossible to reconcile, as one's affections and obedience will be divided. Trying to serve both masters is futile, as it results in failure to fulfill one's duty to God. The servant must choose whether to love and obey God or to cleave to and despise Mammon. One cannot serve two masters of distinct and opposing character and interests. The service of God and Mammon together is declared impossible and indignant. Those who attempt to serve Mammon while pretending to obey God are essentially blind guides leading others astray. In reality, those who give themselves up as slaves to riches abandon the service of God and become slaves of the devil. The possession of wealth itself is not condemned, but rather the mastery of money over one's mind.
