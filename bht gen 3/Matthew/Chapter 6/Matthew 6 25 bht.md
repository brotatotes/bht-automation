# Matthew 6:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be anxious about your life. This command urges us not to be burdened with worry and care about our needs, but rather trust in God's providence. By committing everything to Him in prayer and supplication, we can find peace in knowing that He will sustain and protect us. We should not be excessive and anxious about the future, for our lives are far more valuable than mere sustenance, and God, who gives the greater gift of life, will surely provide the lesser gifts of food and clothing.
