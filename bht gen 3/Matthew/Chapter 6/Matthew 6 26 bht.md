Behold the fowls of the air, for our heavenly Father, who feeds the birds, will much more feed us, his children, who are much better and nobler in the eyes of God.

If God takes care of them, how much more will he take care of us, his children, who are of greater consequence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first is an argument from the less to the greater; that our heavenly Father, who feeds the birds, will much more feed us."
2. "The second, besides this application, which (ver. 30) it also contains, is a reproof of the vanity of anxiety about clothing, which, in all its pomp of gorgeous colours, is vouchsafed to the inferior creatures, but not attainable by, as being unworthy of, us."
3. "Notice, it is not said 'Sow not, reap not, gather not into barns;'â€”the birds are not our example to follow in their habits, for God hath made us to differ from themâ€”the doing all these things is part of our 'how much better are ye,' and increases the force of the Ã  fortiori."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold the fowls of the air...so as to learn wisdom from them." 
2. "Are ye not much better than they?â€”nobler in yourselves and dearer to God." 
3. "The brute creationâ€”void of reasonâ€”are incapable of sowing, reaping, and storing: yet your heavenly Father suffers them not helplessly to perish, but sustains them without any of those processes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "See the fowls of the air: they have no anxiety about the supply of their wants...yet how few die with hunger!" 
2. "How he ministers to their unnumbered wants! How cheerfully and regularly are their necessities supplied!" 
3. "You are of more consequence than they are; and shall God feed them in such numbers, and suffer you to want?"

### John Calvin:
1. "The only cure for covetousness is to embrace the promises of God, by which he assures us that he will take care of us." 
2. "If it is thoroughly fixed in our minds, that the fowls are supplied with food by the hand of God, there will be no difficulty in expecting it for ourselves, who are formed after his image, and reckoned among his children."
3. "All that he means is, that, though other means fail, the providence of God is alone sufficient for us, for it supplies the animals abundantly with everything that they need."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The birds of the heaven, the sky, the atmospheric heaven. This expresses the wild freedom above the earth which contains their food, and also their lower rank in the scale of creation."
2. "That. Not 'for.' We are to behold with respect to the birds this fact, that they sow not, etc. Do not use the means which we all ought to use."
3. "Are not ye much better than they? This conclusive argument shows that Matthew 6:25 must be designed to forbid our numerous earthly cares."

### John Gill:
1. "Yet your heavenly Father feedeth them; see Psalms 145:15. The Jews acknowledge this, that the least and meanest of creatures are fed by God."
2. "Are ye not much better than they? Do not you differ from them? are ye not much more excellent than they? And if God feeds and provides for inferior creatures, such as are very mean and contemptible, how much more will he not provide for you?"
3. "For if these, which are created to serve me after this manner, are supported without trouble; I, who am created to serve my Maker, is it not fit that I should be supplied without trouble?"
