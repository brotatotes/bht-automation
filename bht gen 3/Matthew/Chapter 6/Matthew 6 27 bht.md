# Matthew 6:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Anxiety over the length of one's life is futile; only God can determine the measure of our days. No amount of worry or effort can add even a step to our life's journey. It is a reminder that our ultimate dependence should be on God, who sustains us and provides for our needs. We are called to trust in Him rather than anxiously striving for things that are beyond our control. Our labor is important, but we must not confuse our efforts with the true source of growth and provision.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Which of you, by taking thoughtâ€”anxious solicitude... can add one cubit unto his stature?" 
2. "But if we take the word in its primary sense of 'age' (for 'stature' is but a secondary sense), the idea will be this, 'Which of you, however anxiously you vex yourselves about it, can add so much as a step to the length of your life's journey?'" 
3. "To compare the length of life to measures of this nature is not foreign to the language of Scripture... So understood, the meaning is clear and the connection natural."
