3. "Probably, however, the word here may be taken in a wider import, as signifying all wild flowers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Gill:
1. "Consider the lilies of the field...Look upon, with their eyes, consider and contemplate in their minds, how they grow; in what variety of garbs they appear, of what different beautiful colours, and fragrant odours, they were."
2. "...they toil not, or do not labour as husbandmen do, in tilling their land, ploughing their fields, and sowing them with flax, out of which linen garments are made."
3. "Neither do they spin; the flax, when plucked and dressed, as women do, in order for clothing; nor do they weave it into cloth, or make it up into garments, as other artificers do."
