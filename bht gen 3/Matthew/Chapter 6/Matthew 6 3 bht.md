# Matthew 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When giving alms, it is important not to seek recognition or to boast about our actions. The emphasis is on secrecy, with even the left hand being unaware of the right hand's deeds. This encourages humility and discourages spiritual pride. By being satisfied with God as our sole witness and serving Him with a pure conscience, we can avoid being distracted by vain thoughts and seeking the approval of others. Keeping our acts of generosity private allows us to genuinely please God without any ulterior motives.
