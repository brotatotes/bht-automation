# Matthew 6:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as the wild flowers are counted as belonging to the grass and are cut down with it, they too soon wither in the heat. But God adorns these flowers in a more magnificent way than human grandeur. If He so beautifully clothes the transient flowers, surely He will provide clothing for His children. Jesus gently chides the disciples for their little faith, as they doubt God's provision. This reminds us of God's faithful care and provision for His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The wild flowers which form part of the meadow-growth are counted as belonging to the grass, and are cut down with it." 
2. "Cat grass, which soon withers from the heat, is still used in the East for firing."
3. "A covered earthen vessel, a pan, wider at the bottom than at the top, wherein bread was baked by putting hot embers round it, which produced a more equable heat than in the regular oven."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Gorgeous as is the array of the flowers that deck the fields, surpassing all artificial human grandeur, it is for but a brief moment; you are ravished with it to-day, and to-morrow it is gone; your own hands have seized and cast it into the oven..." 
2. "Shall, then, God's children, so dear to Him, and instinct with a life that cannot die, be left naked? He does not say, Shall they not be more beauteously arrayed? but, Shall He not much more clothe them? that being all He will have them regard as secured to them..." 
3. "The expression, 'Little-faithed ones,' which our Lord applies once and again to His disciples... can hardly be regarded as rebuking any actual manifestations of unbelief at that early period, and before such an audience. It is His way of gently chiding the spirit of unbelief, so natural even to the best..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field... which today is." 
2. "It is short-lived, and seems to be a thing of no value, and is so treated." 
3. "The Jews had different modes of baking... the bread was quickly baked."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If‚Äô does not imply doubt. The direct creative purpose and act of God is here assumed."
2. "He who adorns the transient wild flower, so that human pomp is mean in comparison, will most assuredly provide for His children, whose being is not for a day, but forever."
3. "O ye of little faith, little faith about what is least, when He has given us the greatest gift, in giving Him who thus teaches us."

### John Gill:
1. "If God so clothes the lilies, the flowers of the field, and whatever grows up out of the earth, in such a beautiful and splendid manner, as even to outdo Solomon, in his richest apparel; there's no doubt to be made of it, or at least ought not, but that he will much more provide clothing for men." 
2. "Now if God clothes these plants, which are so short lived, and at last used for such mean purposes; shall he not much more clothe you men, his people, who are of a much longer life, and designed for greater ends and purposes?"
3. "O ye of little faith? As such persons are, who distrust the providence of God, with respect to food and raiment."

### John Wesley:
