# Matthew 6:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. Unlike the heathen who only seek present objects as their sole good, we, as God's children, can find comfort in the knowledge that our Father knows our every need. We are called to have unwavering devotion to our Father and place our trust in Him above all else. Let us not allow the pursuit of material wealth to overshadow our spiritual affections and desires, for it is unbecoming and against the teachings of God's providence and the promise of a future after this life.
