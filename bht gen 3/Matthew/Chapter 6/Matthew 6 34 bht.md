# Matthew 6:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be consumed with anxious care for the future, as each day already has its own troubles to face. It is futile to borrow troubles from the morrow, for the ghost of tomorrow brings doubt and distrust. Instead, seek first the kingdom of God and approach each day with a desire and aim for heaven. By doing so, we can find assurance that all our needs will be met, as God, our Father, will befriend us in all circumstances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Take therefore no thoughtâ€”anxious care."
2. "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereofâ€”An admirable practical maxim."
3. "Every day brings its own cares; and to anticipate is only to double them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "How strange that any man can live, and not pour out his desires to God! How strange that anyone is willing to go to eternity with this sad reflection: 'I have gone through this world, spent my probation, wasted my strength, and am dying, and have never prayed!'"
2. "Forgiveness is essential in prayer. If we come to God harboring malice and unwilling to forgive, we have his solemn assurance that we shall not be ourselves forgiven."
3. "From all this, how manifest is the propriety of seeking first the kingdom of God! First in our affections, first in the objects of pursuit, first in the feelings and associations of each morning, be the desire and the aim for heaven. Having this, we have assurance of all that we need. God, 'our' Father, will then befriend us, and in life and death all will be well."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The morrow is here personified."
2. "For the morrow will be anxious for itself. Not 'take care of itself,' but 'bring its own cares and anxieties,' do not foolishly increase those of today by borrowing from the morrow."
3. "Sufficient unto the day, or for the day, is the evil thereof. 'Evil' may mean natural or moral evil, suffering, or sin. The latter sense is the more usual one, the former suits the context better."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The last resort of the anxious soul when all other fears are allayed."
2. "The ghost of tomorrow stalks out with all its hobgoblins of doubt and distrust."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not distress thyself with tomorrow's affliction, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth."
2. "The morrow shall take thought for the things of itself."
3. "Sufficient for distress, or vexation, is the present time."

### John Wesley:
1. "The morrow shall take thought for itself." 
2. "But all trouble is, upon the whole, a real good."
