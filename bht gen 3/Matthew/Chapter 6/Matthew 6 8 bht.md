# Matthew 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's view, in sharp contrast with the false gods of the heathen, is one that encourages His children to pray to Him and connects His promised supplies to their petitions. This view of God should inspire us to draw near and keep near to Him, opening up every aspect of our lives to Him. We can be assured that by asking, seeking, and knocking, we will receive from Him. Our prayers are not meant to inform God of our needs, but rather to confess our consciousness of them and our trust that He can and will supply them. Prayer is a means by which we seek God, exercise our faith, and cultivate a disposition that is ready to receive His grace and blessing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What a view of God is here given, in sharp contrast with the gods of the heathen!"
2. "He will have His children pray to Him, and links all His promised supplies to their petitions for them."
3. "encouraging us to draw near and keep near to Him, to talk and walk with Him, to open our every case to Him, and assure ourselves that thus asking we shall receiveâ€”thus seeking we shall findâ€”thus knocking it shall be opened to us."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever is convinced, that God not only cares for us, but knows all our wants [...] will reckon it enough to prolong his prayers, as far as shall be necessary for exercising his faith; but will reckon it absurd and ridiculous to approach God with rhetorical embellishments."
2. "Believers do not pray, with the view of informing God about things unknown to him, or of exciting him to do his duty, or of urging him as though he were reluctant. On the contrary, they pray, in order that they may arouse themselves to seek him, that they may exercise their faith in meditating on his promises."
3. "We must, therefore, maintain both of these truths, that He freely anticipates our wishes, and yet that we obtain by prayer what we ask."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore, because these things are heathen; the temptation to adopt or retain heathen worship will arise."
2. "Our prayers do not tell 'our Father' of our needs, but simply confess our consciousness of them, and our trust that He can and will supply them."
3. "Both of these feelings must precede answer to prayer. Hence the reason holds good against vain repetitions, not against childlike petitions."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not be imitators of them, and follow their ways, who have only the dim light of nature to guide them."
2. "The omniscience of God is a considerable argument, and a great encouragement to prayer; he knows our persons and our wants beforehand."
3. "As he is able to help us, we have reason to believe he will; especially since he stands in the relation of a Father to us."

### John Wesley:
1. "Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of â€” We do not pray to inform God of our wants."
2. "The chief thing wanting is, a fit disposition on our part to receive his grace and blessing."
3. "Consequently, one great office of prayer is, to produce such a disposition in us."
