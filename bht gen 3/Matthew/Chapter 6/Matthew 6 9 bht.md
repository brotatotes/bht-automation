## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole passage, vv. 7â€“15, is digressive from the subject of the first part of this chapter, which isthe discouragement of the performance of religious duties to be seen of men, and is resumed at ver. 16."
2. "'The prayer is a fraternal one; He saith not, My Father, as if prayed for himself only: but Our Father, as embracing in one prayer all who are known as brethren in Christ.'"
3. "These opening words of the Lordâ€™s Prayer set clearly before us the state of the Christian, as believing in, depending upon, praying to, a real objective personal GOD, lifted above himself; to approach whom he must lift up his heart, as the eye is lifted up from earth to heaven."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us therefore know, that we shall be in a state of mind for praying in a right manner, if we not only are in earnest about ourselves and our own advantage, but assign the first place to the glory of God."
2. "Now, as it would be the folly and madness of presumption, to call God our Father, except on the ground that, through our union to the body of Christ, we are acknowledged as his children, we conclude, that there is no other way of praying aright, but by approaching God with reliance on the Mediator."
3. "The substance of this petition is, that the glory of God may shine in the world, and may be duly acknowledged by men. But religion is in its highest purity and rigour, when men believe, that whatever proceeds from God is right and proper, full of righteousness and wisdom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The beauty of the Lordâ€™s Prayer is in its unity, symmetry, completeness, and pervading spirit."
2. "It embodies all essential desires of a praying heart, resembling in this respect a pearl on which the light of heaven plays."
3. "The very preface to the Lordâ€™s Prayer is a denial of Atheism, Pantheism, and Deism, since it recognizes a God, a Personal God, who is our Father through Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It should be called 'The Model Prayer' rather than 'The Lord's Prayer.'" 
2. "But there is no evidence whatever that Jesus designed it as a set formula."
3. "God is the Father of all men in one sense; the recognition of Him as the Father in the full sense is the first step in coming back to him in regeneration and conversion."

### John Gill:
1. "Our Father which art in heaven...expresses fiducial confidence in him, faith of interest in him, and relation to him; which arises from some experience of his paternal love, and requires the witnessings of the Spirit of adoption."
2. "The heaven of heavens is the place where he most eminently displays his glory: and this may teach us to look upwards in prayer, and seek those things which are above; and also, that this earth, on which we dwell, is not our native country, but heaven is, where our Father dwells."
3. "By sanctifying his name, is not meant a making him holy, but acknowledging, and declaring him to be holy, and a glorifying him, and all his perfections. He is sanctified by himself, by declaring himself to be holy; by glorifying his perfections in his works; by implanting grace and holiness in the hearts of his people; by restoring the purity of his worship; by diffusing the knowledge of himself in the world; and by taking vengeance on the wicked."

### John Wesley:
1. "Mayest thou be duly honoured, loved, feared, by all in heaven and in earth, by all angels and all men."
2. "May thy kingdom of grace come quickly, and swallow up all the kingdoms of the earth: may all mankind, receiving thee, O Christ, for their king, truly believing in thy name, be filled with righteousness, and peace, and joy; with holiness and happiness, till they are removed hence into thy kingdom of glory, to reign with thee for ever and ever."
3. "Whenever we are tempted, O thou that helpest our infirmities, suffer us not to enter into temptation; to be overcome or suffer loss thereby; but make a way for us to escape, so that we may be more than conquerors, through thy love, over sin and all the consequences of it."
