# Matthew 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus's command to refrain from judging others is directed at the disposition to look unfavorably on their character and actions, leading to rash, unjust, and unlovely judgments. However, when exercising necessary discrimination and devoid of a censorious spirit, it is permissible and sometimes necessary to judge for our own guidance. This command condemns the violation of the law of love and warns against engaging in harsh and unfair judgment. Ultimately, God's judgment is more strict, and often, the judgment of men aligns with His.
