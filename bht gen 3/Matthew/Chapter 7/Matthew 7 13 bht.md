# Matthew 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The difficulty of the first step in true religion is expressed by the strait gate that requires triumph over natural inclinations. The narrow gate, symbolizing Christ Himself, leads to true culture and life, but is accompanied by afflictions and persecutions. In contrast, the wide gate and broad way, filled with worldly temptations, attract many but ultimately lead to destruction. Though the path may seem constricting and lonely, striving for life through the narrow gate is worthwhile, as it separates us from the crowd and leads to eternal reward.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Enter ye in at the strait gate‚Äîas if hardly wide enough to admit one at all. This expresses the difficulty of the first right step in religion, involving, as it does, a triumph over all our natural inclinations." 
2. "Hence the still stronger expression in Luke ( :-), 'Strive to enter in at the strait gate.'" 
3. "for wide is the gate‚Äîeasily entered. and broad is the way‚Äîeasily trodden. that leadeth to destruction, and‚Äîthus lured 'many there be which go in thereat.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Seest thou not, then, a little door, and a way before the door, which is not much crowded, but very few travel it? This is the way which leadeth into true culture."
2. "The gate is not at the end, but at the beginning of the road."
3. "The gate is not at the end, but at the beginning of the road."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as it is difficult to restrain our desires from wicked licentiousness and disorder, he soothes this bitterness by a joyful remuneration, when he tells us, that the narrow gate, and the narrow road, lead to life."
2. "He expressly says, that many run along the broad road: because men ruin each other by wicked examples."
3. "We think it strange that we should be forcibly separated from the vast majority, as if we were not a part of the human race. But though the doctrine of Christ confines and hems us in, reduces our life to a narrow road, separates us from the crowd, and unites us to a few companions, yet this harshness ought not to prevent us from striving to obtain life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Enter ye in by, or through, the narrow gate...the entrance gate at the beginning of the journey of life..." 
2. "For wide is the gate and broad the way, etc. More attractive, more easy to find, and to follow...To follow our natural tendencies is to pursue the broad way." 
3. "Destruction. The way leads to this; in one sense it is this already...Carnal Christianity passes on to similar judgment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The narrow gate" is repeated in verse Matthew 7:14 and straitened the way (œÑŒµŒ∏ŒªŒπŒºŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ Œ∑ ŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ) added. The way is "compressed," narrowed as in a defile between high rocks, a tight place like œÉœÑŒµŒΩŒøœáœâœÅŒπŒ± in Romans 8:35."
2. "The way that leads to life involves straits and afflictions" (McNeile).
3. "The broad way" (ŒµœÖœÅœÖœáœâœÅŒøœÇ) is in every city, town, village, with the glaring white lights that lure to destruction.

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'strait gate' is meant Christ himself; who elsewhere calls himself 'the door'... This is called 'strait'; because faith in Christ, a profession of it, and a life and conversation agreeable to it, are attended with many afflictions, temptations, reproaches, and persecutions."
2. "For wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction; so that the one may be easily known from the other. There is no difficulty in finding out, or entering in at, or walking in the way of sin, which leads to eternal ruin."
3. "The gate of carnal lusts, and worldly pleasures, stands wide open, and many there be which go in thereat; even all men in a state of nature; the way of the ungodly is 'broad', smooth, easy, and every way agreeable to the flesh; it takes in a large compass of vices, and has in it abundance of company; but its end is destruction."

### John Wesley:
1. "The holiness described in the foregoing chapters. And this is the narrow way."
2. "They need not seek for this; they come to it of course."
3. "Many go in through it because strait is the other gate; therefore they do not care for it; they like a wider gate."
