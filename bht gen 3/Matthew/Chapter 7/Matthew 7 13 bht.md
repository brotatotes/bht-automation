2. "But though the doctrine of Christ confines and hems us in, reduces our life to a narrow road, separates us from the crowd, and unites us to a few companions, yet this harshness ought not to prevent us from striving to obtain life."
3. "I have therefore thought it best to introduce here the whole passage from Luke, which corresponds to this sentence.

2. "Wide is the gate, and many there are that go in through it ‚Äî They need not seek for this; they come to it of course."
3. "Many go in through it, because strait is the other gate ‚Äî Therefore they do not care for it; they like a wider gate. Luke 13:24."
