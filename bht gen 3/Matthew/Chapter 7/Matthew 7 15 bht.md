### John Calvin:
1. "It is of the greatest consequence, undoubtedly, that we should suffer ourselves to be directed by good and faithful ministers of Christ: but as false teachers, on the other hand, make their appearance, if we do not carefully watch, and if we are not fortified by perseverance, we shall be easily carried off from the flock."
2. "They ought rather to be aroused to keep watch: for it is not without reason that Christ enjoins them to be on their guard."
3. "Now that we know that the Lord will not fail to perform his promises, whatever may be the attacks of Satan, let us go boldly to the Lord, asking from him the Spirit of wisdom, by whose influences he not only seals on our hearts the belief of his truth, but exposes the tricks and impositions of Satan, that we may not be deceived by them."

3. "When they were inwardly full of hypocrisy and iniquity, of rapine, oppression, and covetousness; and, under a pretence of religion, 'devoured widows' houses'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Beware of false prophets â€” Who in their preaching describe a broad way to heaven: it is their prophesying, their teaching the broad way, rather than their walking in it themselves, that is here chiefly spoken of." 
2. "All those are false prophets, who teach any other way than that our Lord hath here marked out."
3. "Wolves - Not feeding, but destroying souls."
