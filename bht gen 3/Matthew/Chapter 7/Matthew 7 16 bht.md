# Matthew 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False prophets may deceive with their sheep's clothing, but their corrupt doctrines and evil practices reveal their true nature. By examining the practical effect of their teachings, one can discern the fruit they bear. Just as a good tree cannot produce bad fruit, false prophets cannot produce the fruits of faith, holiness, joy, peace, and comfort. Their teachings are like thorns and thistles, causing pain and offering no nourishment. Therefore, one must judge them based on their fruits to distinguish true from false prophets.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Beware of those who possess cunning disguises and present themselves as righteous, for their true nature is revealed through their corrupt teachings and wicked actions. Just as a tree can be recognized by its fruit, so too can false prophets be discerned by the practical effect of their teaching. It is not enough for them to put on a show of righteousness through acts of charity, prayer, and fasting; their true character is determined by the fruit they bear. Genuine faith and the proper understanding of God's Word should produce the fruits of faith, holiness, joy, peace, and comfort, turning sinners to God and glorifying His grace. In contrast, the doctrines of false prophets are like thorns and thistles, causing pain and harm, offering no nourishment for the soul. Therefore, rely on the evidence of their fruits to recognize true from false prophets, for a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
