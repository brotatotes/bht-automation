# Matthew 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A corrupt tree is incapable of bearing good fruit, but it can transform and produce good fruit. This verse counters the belief in man's ability to perform good deeds solely through his willpower. It emphasizes that our deeds are a reflection of our moral nature. Just as a good tree naturally yields good fruit, a person with a righteous character will naturally produce beneficial actions. The goodness of the tree determines the quality of its fruit, and similarly, a preacher's doctrines align with their moral character.
