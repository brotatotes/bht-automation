# Matthew 7:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our actions are determined by our hearts, showing that a good tree cannot bear evil fruit, and neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit. This truth is apparent when considering how certain churches and individuals prioritize actions, apart from the motives behind them, as a means of merit. However, a corrupt preacher who denies the doctrines of grace cannot consistently deliver good doctrine. It is only a well-instructed minister, filled with the Spirit of God, who can preach the truth and be instrumental in converting sinners.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruitâ€”Obvious as is the truth here expressed in different formsâ€”that the heart determines and is the only proper interpreter of the actions of our life."
2. "No one who knows how the Church of Rome makes a merit of actions, quite apart from the motives that prompt them, and how the same tendency manifests itself from time to time even among Protestant Christians, can think it too obvious to be insisted on by the teachers of divine truth."
3. "Here follows a wholesome digression."

### John Gill:
1. "A man that is unprincipled with the grace of God... cannot knowingly deliver, maintain, and abide by any doctrine that is contrary to the glory of God's grace, and the person of Christ, the work of the Spirit, the fundamental doctrines of the Bible." 
2. "A corrupt preacher... who never had any experience of the doctrines of grace, and denies them in the theory of them, cannot, consistent with himself, and his own principles, deliver, or preach good doctrine." 
3. "As our Lord means by 'a good tree', not a good man, barely, or one that is made so by the grace of God; but a good minister, one that is furnished by the Spirit of God, and is well instructed in the kingdom of heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "A bad man preaching the good doctrine here delivered, is sometimes an instrument of converting sinners to God."
2. "Yet I do not aver, that all are true prophets who speak the truth, and thereby convert sinners."
3. "I only affirm, that none are such who do not."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The heart determines and is the only proper interpreter of the actions of our life. This truth is evident when we consider how the Church of Rome and even Protestant Christians at times prioritize actions over motives, seeking to make a merit of them. However, a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit, just as a corrupt preacher, lacking in the grace and experience of the doctrines of grace, cannot consistently deliver good doctrine. It is only a good minister, furnished by the Spirit of God and well instructed in the kingdom of heaven, who can truly preach the good doctrine and be an instrument of converting sinners to God.
