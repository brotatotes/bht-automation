# Matthew 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord's role as Judge highlights the importance of doing the will of His Father, rather than relying on mere professions of faith. True discipleship involves aligning one's actions with God's will, going beyond empty words. Genuine obedience and a transformed life grounded in faith are necessary for entering the eternal glory of God's Kingdom. Mere acknowledgment of Christ as Lord is insufficient; it must be accompanied by wholehearted devotion. The contrast between talkers and doers serves as a reminder to live out one's faith in every aspect of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The doom of the hypocritical false prophets introduces the doom of all hypocrites, and brings on the solemn close of the whole."
2. "Here the Lord sets Himself forth as the Judge in the great day, and at the same time speaks not of 'my will,' but 'the will of my Father:' an important and invaluable doctrinal landmark."
3. "To seek for discrepancies in passages of this kind implies a predisposition to find them: and is to treat Holy Scripture with less than that measure of candour which we give to the writings of one another."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lordâ€”the reduplication of the title 'Lord' denoting zeal in according it to Christ."
2. "Yet our Lord claims and expects this of all His disciples, as when He washed their feet: 'Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.'"
3. "And He so speaks here to give authority to His asseverations. But now He rises higher stillâ€”not formally announcing Himself as the Judge, but intimating what men will say to Him, and He to them, when He sits as their final judge."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The power of working miracles had no necessary connection with piety."
2. "Saving power on the mind is the work of God, and he may convey it by any agency which he chooses."
3. "Many may be found in the day of judgment who may have been endowed with powers of prophecy or miracle, yet destitute of piety."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever then desires to be reckoned among the disciples, must labor to devote himself, sincerely and honestly, to the exercises of a new life."
2. "To do the will of the Father not only means, to regulate their life and manners, but also to believe in Christ."
3. "These words, therefore, do not exclude faith, but presuppose it as the principle from which other good works flow."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not every one. The really pious profess Christ, but not all who profess are really pious." 
2. "Such acknowledgment in word (or subscription to an orthodox creed) is not enough for entrance into the kingdom of heaven."
3. "Of all who thus confess, only those doing the will of God shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Not--but (Î¿Ï…--Î±Î»Î»'). Sharp contrast between the mere talker and the doer of God's will. 


### John Gill:
1. "Not everyone that saith unto me Lord, Lord,.... Not every one that calls Christ his Lord and Master, professes subjection to him, or that calls upon his name, or is called by his name; or makes use of it in his public ministrations."
2. "There are many who desire to be called, and accounted Christians, and who make mention of the name of Christ in their sermons, only to take away their reproach, to cover themselves, and gain credit with, and get into the affections and goodwill of the people; but have no hearty love to Christ, nor true faith in him."
3. "This is to be understood not of the outward dispensation of the Gospel, or the Gospel church state, or the visible church of Christ on earth, in which sense this phrase is sometimes used; because such persons may, and often do, enter here; but of eternal glory, into which none shall enter, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "No one that makes a mere profession of me and my religion shall enter." 
2. "He that doth the will of my Father - as I have now declared it."
3. "Every thing short of this is only saying, Lord, Lord."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Matthew 7:21, the Lord speaks as the Judge in the great day, emphasizing the importance of doing the will of His Father. Mere profession and outward acknowledgments are not enough, as the title Lord should be accorded to Christ with genuine zeal.
