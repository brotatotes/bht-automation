# Matthew 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one who hears and puts into action the words of Christ is like a wise builder who lays the foundations of their house on a rock. This rock is Christ, and being united with Him through faith forms an unshakable foundation. Trials and challenges may come in the form of rain, floods, and winds, but those who are built upon Christ are able to withstand them. They may be shaken, but they cannot be removed from the solid ground on which they stand.
