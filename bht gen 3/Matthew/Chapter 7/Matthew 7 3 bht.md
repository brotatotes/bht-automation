# Matthew 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why do we fixate on the small faults of others while neglecting to address the much greater sins within ourselves? Jesus uses the imagery of a splinter and a beam in our eye to highlight this hypocrisy. We often rush to judge and condemn the minor offenses of our brothers and sisters, but fail to acknowledge or confront our own serious transgressions. We must humbly examine our own faults before seeking to correct others. Let us show grace and understanding, recognizing our own shortcomings and extending compassion to those around us.
