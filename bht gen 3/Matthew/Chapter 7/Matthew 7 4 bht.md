## BHT:
How can you, with such audacity, say to your brother, Let me remove the speck from your eye, when you have a beam in your own eye? Are you so blind that you fail to see your own greater sinfulness? How can you have the gall to condemn and criticize others when you are guilty of far worse offenses yourself? May you consider your own faults before attempting to correct others.
