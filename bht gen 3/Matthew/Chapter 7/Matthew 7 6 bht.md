2. "It is a common maxim with the Jews... 'that they do not redeem holy things, to give to the dogs to eat.'"
3. "The design of these expressions... that men should be cautious, and prudent, in rebuking and admonishing such persons for their sins, in whom there is no appearance or hope of success; yea, where there is danger of sustaining loss."

1. "Give not - That is, talk not of the deep things of God to those whom you know to be wallowing in sin."
2. "Neither declare the great things God hath done for your soul to the profane, furious, persecuting wretches."
3. "Talk not of perfection, for instance, to the former; not of your experience to the latter."
