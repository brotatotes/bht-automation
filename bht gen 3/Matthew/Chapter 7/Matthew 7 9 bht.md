# Matthew 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a child asks for bread, what parent would give them a stone? It would be like offering a loaf-shaped stone, only to mock them. The resemblance between certain stones and loaves of bread is what prompted the devil to tempt Jesus in a similar manner. However, comparing God's willingness with that of a human father, we can be assured that no earthly father would ever act so mercilessly toward their child. If even the smallest acts of kindness yield great beneficence, imagine the boundless generosity we can expect from God, the inexhaustible ocean of love and compassion.

### John Calvin:
1. "Self-love (œÜŒπŒªŒ±œÖœÑ·Ω∑Œ±) renders us malicious: for every man is too much devoted to himself, and neglects and disregards others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Loaf--stone (Œ±œÅœÑŒøŒΩ--ŒªŒπŒ∏ŒøŒΩ). Some stones look like loaves of bread. So the devil suggested that Jesus make loaves out of stones (Matthew 4:3). 


### John Gill:
1. "No, by no means; no man can act such a merciless, cruel part as this to a child."
2. "though he might impose upon him by the likeness of some sort of stones with bread; yet could not hope to satisfy his hunger, or stop his mouth this way."
