## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Marveled, to be accepted simply as a fact, as when Jesus rejoiced, wept, was sorrowful."
2. "Not to be rationalized away into a mere lesson to teach us what to admire."
3. "The mysteries of our Lord's humanity are not to be sacrificed to the timidity of theology."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When Jesus heard it, he marveled - He wondered at it, or he deemed it remarkable."
2. "I have not found so great faith - The word 'faith,' here, means 'confidence' or belief that Christ had power to heal his servant."
3. "Not in Israel - Israel was a name given to 'Jacob' Genesis 32:28-29, because, as a prince, he had power with God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not even in Israel have I found so great faith." 
2. "It was no small matter to declare, in such lofty terms, the power of God, of which a few rays only were yet visible in Christ."
3. "If we consider all the properties of faith, we must conclude that the faith of Mary was greater... But there were chiefly two reasons why Christ preferred the faith of a Gentile to the faith of all the Jews."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He marveled. Not to be explained away. Our Lord could marvel; a mystery of His humanity."
2. "With no man in Israel have I found so great faith. This is the sense of the correct reading, which however places last, for emphasis, the phrase, 'in Israel.'"
3. "There greater faith might have been looked for, but a Gentile was the first to acknowledge Christâ€™s power to heal at a distance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  So great faith (Ï„Î¿ÏƒÎ±Ï…Ï„Î·Î½ Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½). In a Roman centurion and greater than in any of the Jews. In like manner Jesus marvelled at the great faith of the Canaanitish woman (Matthew 15:28). 


### John Gill:
1. "Verily, I say unto you; a strong asseveration, and which Christ used, when he was about to deliver anything of considerable importance, and required attention."
2. "I have not found so great faith, no not in Israel: that is, among the people of Israel: so the Arabic version reads it, 'in any of Israel'; and the Persic, 'among the children of Israel'."
3. "But as great as it was, he did not exceed it; he did not ascribe more to Christ than was proper, and which, by the way, is a clear proof of our Lord's divinity."

### John Wesley:
1. I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel â€” For the centurion was not an Israelite.
