## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many shall come from the east ... - Jesus takes occasion from the faith of a Roman centurion to state that this conversion would not be solitary; that many pagans - many from the east and west would be converted to the gospel, and be saved, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were."
2. "The phrase 'from the east and from the west,' in the Scripture, is used to denote the 'whole world.'"
3. "To sit with those distinguished men was an honor, and would be expressive of great felicity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Shall sit down [Î±Î½Î±ÎºÎ»Î¹Î¸Î·ÏƒÎ¿Î½Ï„Î±Î¹] . Lit., recline. The picture is that of a banquet. Jews as well as Romans reclined at table on couches.


### John Calvin:
1. "In the person of the servant, Christ gave to the Gentiles a taste and a kind of first-fruits of his grace."
2. "He declares, that the Gentiles, who shall come to the faith, will be partakers of the same salvation with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
3. "The word á¼€Î½Î±ÎºÎ»Î¹Î¸á½µÏƒÎ¿Î½Ï„Î±Î¹, shall recline, contains an allusion to a banquet: but as we know, that the heavenly life does not require meat and drink, this phrase has the same meaning as if he had said, they shall enjoy the same life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That many shall come from the east and west. A prophecy that the Gentiles, even the most remote, shall enter the kingdom of heaven."
2. "And shall sit down (i.e., â€˜recline at tableâ€™) with Abraham, etc. The Jews represented the delights of the Messiahâ€™s kingdom as a feast with the patriarchs; but the reference here is rather to intimate domestic intercourse."
3. "The patriarchs are properly mentioned, since with these the separating of the people of God began."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "And sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven."
3. "The allusion is to sitting, or rather lying along, which was the posture of the ancients at meals... represented the blessings of the Gospel, and the joys of heaven; which are not restrained to any particular nation, or set of people; not to the Jews, to the exclusion of the Gentiles."

### John Wesley:
1. "Many from the farthest parts of the earth shall embrace the terms and enjoy the rewards of the Gospel covenant established with Abraham."
2. "But the Jews, who have the first title to them, shall be shut out from the feast; from grace here, and hereafter from glory."
3. "Luke 13:29."
