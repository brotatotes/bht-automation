# Matthew 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Lying sick of a fever, burning with fever, this woman's condition was severe. The type of fever is not specified, but fever itself was considered a disease. Possessing a dual identity as the city of Andrew and Peter, Bethsaida was the place where Peter's wife's mother lay ill. Even though Peter was married, his wife was not mentioned, leaving room for speculation about her fate. It's interesting to note that ministers of the Gospel, like Peter, have the right to marry. This healing miracle took place in Peter's house, indicating his role as a disciple.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sick of a fever [œÄœÖœÅŒµœÉœÉŒøœÖœÉŒ±ŒΩ] . Derived from pur, fire. Our word fever comes through the German feuer.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Bethsaida, however, is called 'the city of Andrew and Peter.' When or why they removed is unknown."
2. "Peter was therefore married. Jerome and modem Romanist expositors infer that the wife was dead from the fact that the mother when healed 'ministered unto them;' but were that the case Peter must have married again."
3. "Lying, prostrate, confined to bed with fever."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lying sick of a fever (Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ Œ∫Œ± œÄœÖœÅŒµœÉœÉŒøœÖœÉŒ±ŒΩ). Two participles, bedridden (perfect passive of Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒªœâ) and burning with fever (present active)." 
2. "How long the fever had had her we have no means of knowing, possibly a sudden and severe attack (Mark 1:30), as they tell Jesus about her on reaching the house of Peter."
3. "We are not told what kind of fever it was. Fever itself was considered a disease. 'Fever' is from German feuer (fire) like the Greek œÄœÖœÅ."

### John Gill:
1. "Though Andrew and Peter were originally of Bethsaida, a place not far from this, but had removed hither since their call by Christ, this being his city."
2. "The distemper was very raging and furious, it had got to a very great height."
3. "Hence it may be observed against the Papists, that ministers of the Gospel may lawfully marry; Peter, an apostle, and from whom they pretend to derive their succession of bishops, was a married man."

### John Wesley:
1. Peter's wife's mother ‚Äî St. Peter was then a young man, as were all the apostles. Mark 1:29; Luke 4:38.
