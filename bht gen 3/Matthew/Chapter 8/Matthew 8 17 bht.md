## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The true relevancy of the prophecy is to be sought by regarding the miracles generally to have been...typical outshewings of the great work of bearing the sin of the world."
2. "Moreover in these His deeds of mercy, He was â€˜touched with the feeling of our infirmities:â€™ witness His tears at the grave...and His sighing over the deaf and dumb man."
3. "The very act of compassion is (as the name imports) a suffering with its object; and if this be true between man and man, how much more strictly so in His case who had taken upon Him the whole burden of the sin of the world, with all its sad train of sorrow and suffering."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To bear those griefs is clearly to bear them away, or to remove them. This was done by his miraculous power in healing the sick." 
2. "To 'carry' these is to sympathize with the sufferers; to make provision for alleviating those sorrows, and to take them away."
3. "The passage in Isaiah and Matthew, therefore, mean precisely the same thing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word does not mean 'he took away,' but 'he bore,' as a burden laid upon him." 
2. "This passage is the corner - stone of the faith - cure theory, which claims that the atonement of Christ includes provision for bodily no less than for spiritual healing."
3. "Matthew may be presumed to have understood the sense of the passage he was citing from Isaiah, and he could have used no word more inadequate to express his meaning, if that meaning had been that Christ took away infirmities."

### John Calvin:
1. "Isaiah does not there speak of miracles, but of the death of Christ, â€” and not of temporal benefits, but of spiritual and eternal grace."
2. "They experienced in their bodies the grace of Christ, but we must look at the design: for it would be idle to confine our view to a transitory advantage, as if the Son of God were a physician of bodies."
3. "Following out this analogy, let us connect those benefits, which Christ bestowed on men in the flesh, with the design which is stated to us by Matthew, that he was sent by the Father, to relieve us from all evils and miseries."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prophecy refers to bearing and expiating our sins, but is here applied to the healing of bodily diseases."
2. "His contact with all this suffering was an important part of the work of One who for us became 'a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.'"
3. "The work of healing is an integral part of our Lordâ€™s redeeming work. The medical profession can find its highest incentive and truest glory in this fact."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He took away our sicknesses, and bore the burden of our diseases."
2. "He took upon himself our pains, and bore our diseases."
3. "In our burdens Jesus steps under the load with us and helps us to carry on."

### John Gill:
1. "He himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses: very agreeable to the Hebrew text, 'he himself,' not another; 'took up,' upon himself voluntarily, freely, as a man lifts up a burden, and takes it on his shoulders."
2. "And that these words are spoken of the Messiah, the Jews themselves own; for among the names they give to the Messiah, 'a leper' is one."
3. "Though the prophet chiefly designs to point out Christ taking upon him, and bearing the sins of his people, in order to make satisfaction for them, and to save them from them; yet so likewise, as to include his bearing, by way of sympathy, and taking away by his power, the bodily diseases of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "He fulfilled these words in the highest sense, by bearing our sins in his own body on the tree."
2. "In a lower sense, by sympathizing with us in our sorrows, and healing us of the diseases which were the fruit of sin."
3. "Such instances are frequent in the sacred writings, and are elegancies rather than imperfections."
