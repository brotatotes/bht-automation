# Matthew 8:18 Commentary Help Text

St. Matthew's clear intention is to bind the following incidents to the previous one. Jesus, after a day of labor and conflict, sought rest and decided to cross the lake to another part, below Capernaum. This journey was not strictly to the opposite shore, but to a curved area of the lake. While other Gospel writers provide more extensive details, Matthew emphasizes Jesus' need for solitude, the testing of his disciples' faith, and his desire to separate himself from the crowd's worldly concerns.

2. "His reasons here seem to be with respect to himself, that being wearied as man, with the work of the day, he might have an opportunity of refreshing himself with sleep; with respect to his disciples, that he might have a trial of their faith, when in danger at sea; and with respect to the multitude, because of their carnality, and sole concern for their temporal, and worldly good."
3. "The persons he gave commandment to, must be either the multitude, or the disciples; not the former, because he studiously avoided their company, and his concern was to be rid of them; but the latter."

### John Wesley:
1. He commanded to go to the other side â€” That both himself and the people might have a little rest.
