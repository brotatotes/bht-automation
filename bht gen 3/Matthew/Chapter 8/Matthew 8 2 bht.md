# Matthew 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A leper, symbolizing one dead in sin, approached Jesus, acknowledging his divine power and uncertain of His willingness to heal. The leper's faith exceeded the understanding of even those closest to Jesus, as he believed that healing an incurable disease required only the fiat of His Person. Jesus, moved by the leper's worship and his conviction of His power, declared His willingness, thus exhibiting His miraculous love alongside His miraculous power. The leper's doubt was a hopeful one, and Jesus commanded him to keep the healing a secret to suppress excitement and hostility.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The disease was not contagious: so that the view which makes them mere sanitary regulations is out of the question... This disease was specially selected, as being the most loathsome and incurable of all, to represent the effect of the defilement of sin upon the once pure and holy body of man."
2. "The leper was the type of one dead in sin..."
3. "Thus in the above-cited instances we find leprosy inflicted as the punishment a rebellion, lying, and presumption."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "while the ceremonial ordinances for detection and cleansing prescribed in this case by the law of Moses held forth a coming remedy 'for sin and for uncleanness,' the numerous cases of leprosy with which our Lord came in contact, and the glorious cures of them which He wrought, were a fitting manifestation of the work which He came to accomplish."
2. "But of Christ's willingness to heal him he was not so sure. It needed more knowledge of Jesus than he could be supposed to have to assure him of that. But one thing he was sure of, that He had but to 'will' it."
3. "This shows with what 'worship' of Christ this leper fell on his face before Him. Clear theological knowledge of the Person of Christ was not then possessed even by those who were most with Him and nearest to Him. But he who at that moment felt and owned that to heal an incurable disease needed but the fiat of the Person who stood before him, had assuredly that very faith in the germ which now casts its crown before Him that loved us, and would at any time die for His blessed name."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The bones and marrow are pervaded with the disease. The malady advances from one stage to another with slow and certain ruin. 'Life still lingers amid the desolation;' the joints, and hands, and feet lose their power; and the body 'collapses,' or falls together in a form hideous and awful."
2. "The wretched victim is thus doomed to see himself dying 'piecemeal,' assured that no human power can arrest for a moment the silent and steady march of this foe to the seat of life."
3. "He must feel that Jesus 'can' save him. He must also feel that he has no claim on him; that it depends on his sovereign will; and must cast himself at his feet with the feelings of the leper."

### John Calvin:
1. "The outward gesture of kneeling was exhibited by the leper as a token of reverence."
2. "By these words he declared, that he acknowledged a divine power in Christ: and when Christ replies, I am willing, he shows that he claimed more for himself than belongs to man."
3. "He only declares, that he is so fully convinced of the power of Christ, as to entertain no doubt that it is in his power to cure leprosy; and then presents himself to be healed, but uncertain as to the result, because he did not yet know the will of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Men more easily believe in miraculous power than in miraculous love" (Bruce).
2. "This is a condition of the third class (undetermined, but with prospect of being determined), a hopeful doubt at any rate."
3. "The command to 'tell no one' was to suppress excitement and prevent hostility."

### John Gill:
1. "He was a very lively emblem of a poor vile sinner, full of sin and iniquity, who is brought to see himself all over covered with sin, when he comes to Christ for pardon and cleansing; and is so considered by Christ the high priest, when he applies his justifying righteousness and sin purging blood to his conscience."
2. "A leper, by the Jews, is called 'a wicked' man; for they suppose leprosy comes upon him for evil speaking."
3. "And thus it is with poor sensible sinners under first awakenings; they can believe in the ability of Christ to justify them by his righteousness, cleanse them by his blood; and save them by his grace to the uttermost: but they stick at, and hesitate about his willingness, by reason of their own vileness and unworthiness."
