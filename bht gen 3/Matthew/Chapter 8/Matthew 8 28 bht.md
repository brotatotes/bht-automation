## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were of little faith, in that they were afraid of perishing while they had on board the slumbering Saviour."
2. "The symbolic application of this occurrence is too striking to have escaped general notice."
3. "And the personal application is one of comfort, and strengthening of faith, in danger and doubt."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The propensity to take up the abode in the tombs is mentioned by ancient physicians as a characteristic of mad-men."
2. "The Levitical uncleanness of the tombs would insure the wretches the solitude which they sought."
3. "Originally, difficult, hard. Hence hard to manage; intractable."

### John Calvin:
1. "The error of those who think that Mark and Luke relate a different miracle from this, has been already refuted."
2. "Commentators have been led into the error of separating Matthew‚Äôs narrative from that of the others by this single difference, that he mentions two, while the others mention but one."
3. "The circumstance of their holding up to commendation one singular instance of Christ‚Äôs divine power is not inconsistent with the narrative of Matthew, in which another, though less known man, is also mentioned."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Two possessed with demons. Mark and Luke speak of but one, although the former gives the most detailed account."
2. "Coming from out of the tombs. According to the other accounts, their abode, chosen 'from a morbid craving for the terrible.'"
3. "Exceeding fierce (comp. Mark 5:3-5). Mark tells of the unsuccessful efforts made to subdue them; Matthew, that unsubdued they were the terror of the country."

### John Gill:
1. "Gergesa is interpreted, œÄŒ±œÅŒøŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ± ŒµŒ∫Œ≤ŒµŒ≤ŒªŒ∑Œ∫ŒøœÑœâŒΩ, 'the habitation of those that cast out'; being called so perhaps prophetically, for what the inhabitants of those places did to the Saviour, beseeching him to depart out of their coasts."
2. "These possessed men met him, not purposely, or with design, but accidentally to them, and unawares to Satan too; for though he knows much, he is not omniscient: had he been aware of Christ's coming that way, and what he was about to do, he would have took care to have had the possessed out of the way."
3. "Which places were chosen by the devils, either because of the solitude, gloominess, and filthiness of them; or as some think, to confirm that persuasion some men had, that the souls of men after death, are changed into devils; or rather, to establish a notion which prevailed among the Jews, that the souls of the deceased continue for a while to be about their bodies; which drew persons to necromancy, or consulting with the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "The country between them took its name, sometimes from the one, sometimes from the other."
2. "Doubtless those malevolent spirits love such tokens of death and destruction."
3. "No one could pass ‚Äî Safely."
