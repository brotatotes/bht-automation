## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He who just now expansively fulfilled the law by word and commands, now does the same by act and deed."
2. "The same almighty power which suspends natural laws, supersedes ceremonial laws."
3. "Here is a noble example illustrating His own precept so lately delivered, â€˜Give to him that asketh thee.â€™"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But as the man's faith told him there would be no case for such regulations if the cure he hoped to experience should be accomplished, so He who had healing in His wings transcended all such statutes."
2. "How majestic those two words! By not assuring the man of His power to heal him, He delightfully sets His seal to the man's previous confession of that power."
3. "And immediately his leprosy was cleansedâ€”as perfectly as instantaneously. What a contrast this to modern pretended cures!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was an offence to the Jews to 'touch' a leprous person, and was regarded as making him who did it ceremonially impure."
2. "The act of putting forth his hand and 'touching' him, therefore, expressed the intention of Jesus to cure him."
3. "It was a pledge that he 'was,' in fact, already cured."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ possesses such purity as to repel all filth and defilement."

3. "The stretching out of his hand was therefore an expression and token of infinite grace and goodness."

### John Gill:
1. "A great encouragement this, for poor sensible sinners to betake themselves to Christ, under a sense of their guilt and filth; who readily receives such, in no wise casts them out, but gives immediate discoveries of his power and grace unto them."
2. "He did not stand parleying with the man, or making any further trial of his faith, or objecting to him his uncleanness; but at once stretches out his hand, touches his filthy flesh, and commands off the disorder."
3. "He was not only pronounced clean, but was made so; he was thoroughly healed of the disease of leprosy."
