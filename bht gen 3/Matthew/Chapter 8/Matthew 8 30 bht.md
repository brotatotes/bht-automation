# Matthew 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scene of the miracle with the swine is believed to be at some distance on the plain, not far off as the Vulgate suggests. The swine were likely owned by Gentiles or Jews involved in an unclean trade. Mark mentions that there were two thousand swine in the herd, which was significant. While it was forbidden for Jews to eat swine's flesh, they were allowed to bring them up for sale to Gentiles. However, it was illegal for Jews to keep swine, which is why Jesus permitted their destruction.

3. "After all, it was only an Israelite that was forbid this; a stranger might bring them up, for this is one of their canons z: 'A man may sell fetches to give to a stranger that breeds hogs, but to an Israelite it is forbidden to breed them.'"

### John Wesley:
