## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The dÃ¦moniac was one whose being was strangely interpenetrated (â€˜possessedâ€™ is the most exact word that could be found) by one or more of those fallen spirits..."
2. "There appears to have been in him a double will and double consciousnessâ€”sometimes the cruel spirit thinking and speaking in him, sometimes his poor crushed self crying out to the Saviour of men for mercy..."
3. "If what has been cited above be true, and the unchecked indulgence of sensual appetite afforded an inlet for the powers of evil to possess the human demoniac, then we have their influence joined to that part of manâ€™s nature which he has in common with the brutes that perish, the animal and sensual soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not an overhanding precipice, but a steep, almost perpendicular declivity, between the base of which and the water was a narrow margin of ground, in which there was not room for the swine to recover from their headlong rush."
2. "Farther south the plain becomes so broad that the herd might have recovered and recoiled from the lake."
 
3. "The article localizes the steep as in the vicinity of the pasture."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact of the possession of the swine is stated. It is not more improbable than that the human body could be under demoniacal control."
2. "The whole herd, etc. The simultaneous rush of the whole herd was not a natural movement, but due to the possessed, since few gregarious animals are so marked by individual stubbornness as swine."
3. "Mere sensuous life and demoniacal influence stand in some relation; hence this is a warning against sensualism."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The influence of mind on matter is now understood better than formerly, but we have the mastery of the mind of the Master on the minds of the maniacs, the power of Christ over the demons, over the herd of hogs."
2. "Difficulties in plenty exist for those who see only folk-lore and legend, but plain enough if we take Jesus to be really Lord and Saviour."
3. "The incidental destruction of the hogs need not trouble us when we are so familiar with nature's tragedies which we cannot comprehend."

### John Gill:
1. "Without divine permission, these evil spirits cannot do anything to the bodies, souls, or estates of men."
2. "It may be asked, why did Christ suffer the devils to enter the herd of swine, and destroy them, which was a considerable loss to the proprietors? To which may be answered, that if the owners were Jews, and these creatures were brought up by them for food, it was a just punishment of their breach of the law of God."
3. "This was suffered to show the malice of the evil spirits, under whose influence they were, and who would, if they had but leave, serve them as they did the swine; and to display the power of Christ over the devils, and his sovereign right to, and disposal of the goods and properties of men."
