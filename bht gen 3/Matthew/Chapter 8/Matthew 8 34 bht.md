# Matthew 8:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The city's request for Jesus to leave after the miracle of healing the demoniacs reveals their preference for material possessions over the well-being of their souls. They were more concerned about the loss of their hogs than the remarkable power displayed by Jesus in casting out the demons. Unfortunately, their fear of worldly loss overshadowed any sense of humility or recognition of Jesus' divine authority. It serves as a reminder that sometimes people prioritize material wealth over the presence and salvation offered by Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This request, which is related by all three Evangelists, was probably not from humility, but for fear the miraculous powers of our Lord should work them still more worldly loss."
2. "For the additional particulars of this miracle, see Mark v. 15, 16, 18â€“20: Luke vii. 35, and notes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ healed madmen where calculating selfishness drove Him away."
2. "This miracle alone tells of a transfer of demoniacal possession and of its effect upon other creatures than man."
3. "That in the time of Christ persons were, actually and bodily, possessed by personal evil spirits."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The whole city was excited over the destruction of the hogs and begged Jesus to leave, forgetful of the healing of the demoniacs in their concern over the loss of property."
2. "They cared more for hogs than for human souls, as often happens today."

### John Gill:
1. "And behold, the whole city...great numbers flocked from all parts." 
2. "Not out of any love and respect to him, but either out of curiosity to see such an extraordinary person, or being terrified at the report concerning him."
3. "They besought him that he would depart out of their coasts...preferring the presence of swine to the presence of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. They besought him to depart out of their coasts â€” They loved their swine so much better than their souls! How many are of the same mind!
