## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in this case they were of lasting obligation, that the cleansed leper was not to make his healing a matter of boast hereafter."
2. "our Lord almost uniformly repressed the fame of His miracles, for the reason given in ch. xii. 15â€“21, that, in accordance with prophetic truth, He might be known as the Messiah not by 'wonder-working power, but by the great result of His work upon earth."
3. "all those priests being types, not of future human priests, but of Him, who abideth a Priest for ever in an unchangeable priesthood and in Whom not a class of Christians, but all Christians, are in the true sense priests unto God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A hard condition this would seem to a grateful heart, whose natural language, in such a case, is 'Come, hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul.'" 
2. "What the sequel was, our Evangelist Matthew does not say; but Mark thus gives it... 'But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to Him from every quarter.'"
3. "And this is the secret both of strength and of sweetness in the servants and followers of Christ in every age."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was his duty to make haste to the residence of the priest, and obtain his sanction to the reality of the cure."
2. "Perhaps, also, Christ was apprehensive that the report would go 'before' the man if he delayed, and the priest, through opposition to Jesus, might pronounce it an imposition."
3. "Show thyself to the priest, and get his testimony to the reality of the cure, as a proof to the people that the healing is genuine."

### John Calvin:
1. "This example shows us, that those who allow themselves to be guided by inconsiderate zeal act improperly, because the more eager they are to please God, the greater progress do they make in rebellion to his commands."
2. "Christ, therefore, by sending the leper to the priest, proves that he had no other object in view than to display the glory of God."
3. "He alone is appointed to be the judge of spiritual leprosy, and entitled to receive, from those who have been cured, the offering for their cleansing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "See thou tell no man i.e., do not stop to blaze it abroad, but go thy way, go directly and show thyself to the priest."
2. "The command also implies a caution against making too much of the external miraculous acts of our Lord; a kind of materialism, no less than the denial of the possibility of such miracles."
3. "Our Lord had in view the welfare of the person healed; He did not wish to hinder the duty Moses had commanded, nor to prejudice the priests who would inspect the man; He thus sought to prevent a concourse of the people, and the enmity of the rulers."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that this fact could be concealed, if it was done publicly, before the multitude nor was it Christ's design that it should be; only it was his counsel to this man, that whilst he was on the road to Jerusalem, and when he was come there, that he would speak of it to no man, before he came to the priest, or priests."
2. "There was a two fold offering, according to the law of Moses, on account of the cleansing of the leper."
3. "meaning either to the priests; for the Syriac and Persic versions read the former clause, 'show thyself to the priests', that they being satisfied of the healing and cleansing of this man, and accordingly pronouncing him clean, and accepting his offerings, this might be either a convincing testimony to them, that Jesus was the Son of God, and true Messiah, and that he did not deny or oppose the law given by Moses; or might be a standing testimony against them, should they continue in unbelief; or else to the Jews, who saw the miracle, and heard the orders Christ gave to the man after he had healed him; or to the lepers that they were cleansed; or this law of Moses was for a testimony or statute to be always observed by them in such cases."

### John Wesley:
1. "And this he seems to have done, chiefly for one or more of these reasons: 1. To prevent the multitude from thronging him, in the manner related Mark 1:45."
2. "To fulfil the prophecy, Isaiah 42:1, that he would not be vain or ostentatious. This reason St. Matthew assigns, Matthew 12:17, etc."
3. "To avoid being taken by force and made a king, John 6:15."
