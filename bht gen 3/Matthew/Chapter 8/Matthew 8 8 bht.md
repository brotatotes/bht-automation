## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The centurion heard that the Lord was coming, Luke vii. 6."
2. "He knew and felt himself, as a heathen, to be one out of the fold of God."
3. "Therefore unworthy to receive under his roof the Redeemer of Israel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am not worthy ... - This was an expression of great humility."
2. "It refers, doubtless, to his view of his 'personal' unworthiness, and not merely to the fact that he was a 'Gentile.'"
3. "So every truly penitent sinner feels - a feeling which is appropriate when he comes to Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "There was astonishing humility in exalting so highly above himself a man who belonged to a conquered and enslaved nation."
2. "Something, too, he had undoubtedly heard about the promised Redeemer. Though he does not distinctly understand that Christ is God manifested in the flesh, yet he is convinced that the power of God is manifested in him."
3. "He ascribed this power to the word, not of a mortal man, but of God, whose minister he fully believed Christ to be: on that point he entertained no doubt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lord, I am not worthy, etc. This humility sprang out of his consciousness that he was a heathen, as well as his esteem of our Lord."
2. "But only say in a word. This means one word of command, as Matthew 8:9 shows."
3. "Humility and faith always go hand in hand."

### John Gill:
1. "Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof. This is not said as rejecting and despising the presence and company of Christ; but is expressive of his great modesty and humility, and of his consciousness of his own vileness, and unworthiness of having so great a person in his house."
2. "And if such a man was unworthy, having been an idolater, and lived a profane course of life, that Christ should come into his house, and be, though but for a short time, under his roof; how much more unworthy are poor sinful creatures (and sensible sinners see themselves to be so unworthy), that Christ should come into their hearts, and dwell there by faith, as he does, in all true believers, however vile and sinful they have been?"
3. "But speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed... he signifies that if he would but speak a word, the least word whatever; or, as Luke has it, 'say in a word'; let but a word come out of thy mouth, and it will be done."

### John Wesley:
1. The centurion answered â€” By his second messengers.
