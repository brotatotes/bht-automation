# Matthew 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees raised objections to Jesus eating with sinners and tax collectors, implying that such association tarnished His own righteousness. Instead of confronting Jesus directly, they directed the question to His disciples. This is because the Pharisees held these individuals in low regard and considered any form of interaction with them to be forbidden. However, the disciples acted rightly by bringing their concerns to Jesus, who validated and encouraged them in the face of the Pharisees' accusations.
