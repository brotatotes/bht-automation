## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both words, in the application of the saying, must be understood subjectively"
2. "not as though the Pharisees were objectively either 'whole' or 'righteous'"
3. "however much objective truth 'sick' and 'sinners' may have had as applied to the publicans and sinners."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye deem yourselves whole; My mission, therefore, is not to you: The physician's business is with the sick; therefore eat I with publicans and sinners."
2. "Oh, what myriads of broken hearts, of sin-sick souls, have been bound up by this matchless saying!"
3. "They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If you Pharisees are such as you think yourselves - already pure and holy - you do not need my aid. It would be of no use to you, and you would not thank me for it."
2. "With those persons who feel that they are sinners I may be useful, and there is my proper place."

### John Calvin:

2. "If we consider that this was his office and the end of his coming, â€” if we remember that this was the reason why he took upon him our flesh, why he shed his blood, why he offered the sacrifice of his death, why he descended even to hell, we will never think it strange that he should gather to salvation those who have been the worst of men, and who have been covered with a mass of crimes."
3. "Now, if we feel disgust at being associated by Baptism and the Lordâ€™s Supper with vile men, and regard our connection with them as a sort of stain upon us, we ought immediately to descend into ourselves, and to search without flattery our own evils."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They that are whole have no need of physician, but they that are sick."

### John Gill:
1. "He is an universal one, with regard both to diseases and to persons, that apply to him; he heals all sorts of persons, and all sorts of diseases."
