# Matthew 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples of John the Baptist, imitating the strict asceticism of their teacher and the Pharisees, criticized Jesus for not fasting. It is likely that they were prompted by the Pharisees to question Jesus. These private fasts, separate from the public fasts commanded by the law, were based on the traditions and self-appointed practices of the Pharisees and John's disciples. This incident serves as a cautionary reminder not to let outward ceremonies or differences in practice divide us, but to prioritize unity of faith and the bond of charity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is one of those instances where the three accounts imply and confirm one another, and the hints incidentally dropped by one Evangelist form the prominent assertions of the other."
2. "The fasting often of the disciples of John must not be understood as done in mourning for their masterâ€™s imprisonment, but as belonging to the asceticism which John, as a preacher of repentance, inculcated."
3. "On the fasts of the Pharisees, see Lightfoot in loc."

### John Calvin:
1. "This example reminds us, that prudence and caution are necessary to prevent wicked and cunning men from sowing divisions among us on any slight grounds."
2. "We ought especially to beware lest the unity of faith be destroyed, or the bond of charity broken, on account of outward ceremonies."
3. "Let us first learn not to place holiness in outward and indifferent matters, and at the same time to restrain ourselves by moderation and equity, that we may not desire to restrict others to what we approve, but may allow everyone to retain his freedom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees, it is supposed, fasted twice in the week (Luke 18:12); the remnant of Johnâ€™s disciples would be led to a similar practice, by his austere life."
2. "If you are a teacher from God, why does your teaching result in leading your followers away from old-established forms and customs, confirmed by the example of our own teacher, John."
3. "External legalism here assumed to teach Christ; and Johnâ€™s disciples borrowed aid from the Pharisees whom John denounced."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One is surprised to find disciples of the Baptist in the role of critics of Christ along with the Pharisees."
2. "John was languishing in prison and they perhaps were blaming Jesus for doing nothing about it."
3. "The strict asceticism of the Baptist and of the Pharisaic rabbis was imitated by their disciples."

### John Gill:
1. "The fastings here referred to are not the public fasts enjoined by the law of Moses, or in any writings of the Old Testament; but private fasts, which were enjoined by John to his disciples, and by the Pharisees to theirs; or which were, according to the traditions of the elders, or of their own appointing, and which were very 'often' indeed."
2. "Fasts were kept also on account of many other evils, as pestilence, famine, war, sieges, inundations, or any other calamity; sometimes for trifling things, as for dreams, that they might have good ones, or know how to interpret them, or avoid any ill omen by them."
3. "This may serve to illustrate and prove the frequency of the Jewish fastings. Luke represents this question as put by the Pharisees, which is here put by the disciples of John: it was doubtless put by both agreeing in this matter; and which shows that John's disciples were instigated to it by the Pharisees, who sought to sow discord between them, and to bring Christ and his disciples into contempt with them."

### John Wesley:
1. Then â€” While he was at table. Mark 2:18; Luke 5:33.
