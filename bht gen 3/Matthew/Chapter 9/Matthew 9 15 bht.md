# Matthew 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, referring to Himself as the Bridegroom, fulfills Old Testament prophecies. The sons of the bridechamber, the friends of the bridegroom, are synonymous with the wedding guests. Genuine fasting should be an expression of inward sorrow for the absence of the Bridegroom in the soul. Just as the nuptials will come to an end, there may be a time when the Bridegroom is taken away, leading to fasting and mourning. Fasting should be a true response to real occasions of sorrow.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord, in calling Himself the Bridegroom, announces the fulfillment in Him of a whole cycle of O.T. prophecies and figures."
2. "The sons of the bridechamber are more than the mere guests at the wedding: they are the bridegroomâ€™s friends who go and fetch the bride."
3. "This furnishes us with an analogous rule for the fasting of the Christian life: that it should be the genuine offspring of inward and spiritual sorrow, of the sense of the absence of the Bridegroom in the soul."

### John Calvin:
1. "He gives warning that they will very soon be treated with greater harshness and severity."
2. "When the Lord sometimes endures the weakness of our brethren, and acts towards them with gentleness, while he treats us with greater severity, we have no right to murmur."
3. "When we sometimes obtain relief from sorrow and from vexations, let us beware of giving ourselves up to enjoyments; but let us, on the contrary, remember that the nuptials will not always last."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜Mournâ€™ and â€˜fastâ€™ are used interchangeably; genuine fasting springs from real sorrow."
2. "â€˜How sublime and peaceful is this early announcement by our Lord of the bitter passage before Himâ€™ (Alford)."
3. "Real fasting takes place where there is real occasion for it. History shows that prescribed fasts become formal; that formal fasting is closely linked with Pharisaical ritualism."

3. "But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; in a forcible manner, and put to death, as he was; and then shall they fast and mourn, and be in great distress."

1. "While I am with them, it is a festival time, a season of rejoicing, not mourning."
2. "After I am gone, all my disciples likewise shall be in fastings often."
3. "Mourning and fasting usually go together."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Our Lord, in calling Himself the Bridegroom, fulfills Old Testament prophecies. The sons of the bridechamber, the friends of the bridegroom, go and fetch the bride. Similarly, the fasting of the Christian life should stem from the sorrow and sense of the absence of the Bridegroom within the soul. It is a genuine response to the awareness of His absence. When the Lord treats us with gentleness, we should not murmur, but remember that the nuptials will not always last. The allusion is to a joyous nuptial solemnity, a time of feasting and rejoicing. However, a time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away, and his disciples will fast and mourn in great distress. This teaches us that genuine fasting is born out of real occasion for it, where there is true sorrow.
