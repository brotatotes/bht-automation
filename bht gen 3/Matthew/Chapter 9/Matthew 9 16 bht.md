# Matthew 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The old system of prescribed fasts must not be patched with the new and sound piece. The complete and beautiful whole of Gospel light and liberty cannot be engrafted as a mere addition on the worn-out system of ceremonies. All things are not suitable for all people, especially the weak and tender disciples who should not be burdened. Combining the righteousness of Christ with one's own in order to make up a justifying righteousness before God is a foolish act. Embrace the new and complete gospel without clinging to the old forms of piety.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The old system of fasting for fasting's sake cannot be patched together with the new and complete gospel, just as undressed cloth would shrink, tear, and make a worse hole on an old garment. It is important to recognize that all things are not suitable for all people and that the weak and tender disciples should not be burdened with unnecessary strictness. Trying to combine the righteousness of Christ with one's own righteousness in order to justify oneself before God is equally foolish. Thus, it is essential to embrace the new and complete gospel without clinging to the worn-out system of ceremonies and burdens.
