# Matthew 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When new wine is poured into old wineskins, the result is disastrous. The new wine, too living and strong, shatters the outward appearance of the old ceremonial system and the spirit is lost. The vessel is utterly destroyed, emphasizing the incompatibility between the new and the old. In order to receive and retain the love of God, the Gospel, and its blessings, one must have a new heart and principles implanted within them. Only then can the doctrine of the Gospel and their salvation be preserved.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The wine is poured in, is something inward, the spirit of the system."
2. "The new wine is something too living and strong for so weak a moral frame; it shatters the fair outside of ceremonial seeming; and the wine runneth out, the spirit is lost; the man is neither a blameless Jew nor a faithful Christian; both are spoiled."
3. "And then the result: not merely the damaging, but the utter destruction of the vessel,â€”the skins perish."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bottles [Î±ÏƒÎºÎ¿Ï…Ï‚] . Rev., rightly, wine - skins, though our word bottle originally carried the true meaning, being a bottle of leather."
2. "In Spain wine is still brought to market in pig - skins."
3. "When old, they break under the fermentation of the wine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The living principle of the new covenant, if we attempt to enclose it in the old ceremonial man, is lost, the wine runneth out, and the skin perish; even the form is destroyed."
2. "New emergencies require new means. In this case, God had appointed the new means."
3. "The new life assumes an outward form, differing from the antiquated form, and we must seek to preserve both life and form: both are preserved together."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The new wine will ferment and crack the dried-up old skins."
2. "The wine is spilled, poured out."

### John Gill:
1. "Now as the new wine is not put into old bottles, else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: so the love of God, the Gospel of the grace of God, and the blessings of it, are not received and retained, nor can they be, by natural men, by self-righteous persons: they do not suit and agree with their old carnal hearts and principles; they slight and reject them, and let them run out, which proves their greater condemnation."
2. "By 'new bottles' are meant sinners, whom Christ calls by his grace, and the Spirit regenerates and renews, who are made new creatures in Christ; who have new hearts, and new spirits, and new principles of light, life, love, faith, and holiness, implanted in them; who have new eyes to see with, new ears to hear with, new feet to walk with, to and in Christ, new hands to work and handle with, and who live a new life and conversation."
3. "Now to such as these, the love of God is manifested and shed abroad in their hearts; by these, the Gospel of Christ is truly received and valued, and these enjoy the spiritual blessings of it; and so both the doctrine of the Gospel, and the grace of God, are preserved entire, and these persons saved in the day of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Fermenting wine will soon burst those bottles, the leather of which is almost worn out."
2. "The word properly means vessels made of goats' skins, wherein they formerly put wine, (and do in some countries to this day) to convey it from place to place."
3. "Give harsh doctrines to such as have strength to receive them."
