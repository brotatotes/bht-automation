## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "She was not dead, but dying; at the last extremity."
2. "St. Matthew, omitting the message from the ruler‚Äôs house... gives the matter summarily in these words."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelists agree in relating, that while Christ, at the request of a ruler of the synagogue, was coming to his house, a woman on the road was secretly cured of a bloody flux by touching his cloak; and that afterwards Christ came into the ruler‚Äôs house, and raised a dead young woman to life."
2. "We have here a bright mirror in which the divine condescension towards us is beheld...he encourages him to expect a favorable result, and thus proves to us that his faith, however small it might be, was not wholly rejected."
3. "Though we have not such abundance of faith as might be desired, there is no reason why our weakness should drive away or discourage us from prayer."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "This Jairus was a man of great power and significance; who in such a very humble manner prostrated himself at the feet of Jesus, and expressed such strong faith in him."
2. "The ruler's address to Christ on this occasion, is a very considerable, though not so great an instance of faith as some others; that he, who was a ruler of a synagogue, should apply to Christ, which sort of men were generally most averse to him; that he should fall down and worship him, if not as God, since as yet he might be ignorant of his deity, yet behaved with the profoundest respect to him, as a great man, and a prophet."
3. "That even then, he should believe in hope against hope; he affirms, that he really believed, that if Christ would but come to his house, and lay his hand upon her, an action often used in grave and serious matters, as in blessing persons, in prayer, and in healing diseases, she would certainly be restored to life again."

### John Wesley:
1. Just dead ‚Äî He had left her at the point of death, Mark 5:23. Probably a messenger had now informed him she was dead. Mark 5:22; Luke 8:41.
