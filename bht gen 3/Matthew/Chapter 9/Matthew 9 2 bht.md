## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By its means the feeling of sinfulness and guilt was more strongly aroused in him, and he recognized the misery of his disease as the punishment of his sins."
2. "At all events spiritual and bodily pain seem to have been connected and interchanged within him."
3. "We do not know enough of the paralytic's own state to be able to say whether there may not have been some cause for it in the man himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This destitution of doors and lights from the streets, though it gives their dwellings a sombre appearance, is yet adapted to the habits of retirement and secrecy among the people of the East, where they are desirous of keeping their 'females' from observation."
2. "The perseverance they had manifested was the evidence of their faith or confidence in his power to heal the sick man."
3. "Jesus might be willing to direct the minds of the spectators 'to this fact;' and, by pointing them to a manifest instance of the effect of sin, to lead them to hate and forsake it."

### John Calvin:
1. "They had given evidence of faith by the laboriousness of that attempt: for they would never have submitted to so much trouble, nor contended with such formidable hindrances, if they had not derived courage from entire confidence of success."
2. "By their faith, the grace of God is extended to their children and their children‚Äôs children even before they are born."
3. "The only way of obtaining deliverance from all evils is to have God reconciled to us. It does sometimes happen, that wicked men are freed from their distresses, while God is still their enemy: but when they think that they have completely escaped, the same evils immediately return, or more numerous and heavier calamities overwhelm them, which make it manifest that they will not be mitigated or terminated until the wrath of God shall be appeased."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Son, be of good cheer. Words of affectionate address, fully given by Matthew alone. 'Son' implies that a new relation was now to exist between them, since Christ thus addressed His chosen disciples (Mark 10:24). The 'good cheer' came before the bodily healing, as a result of a purely spiritual blessing."
2. "Thy sins are forgiven. A positive declaration, 'they have been, and are now forgiven.' Certainly not a concession to the popular notion that such sickness was a direct judgment for sin. There is no proof that the disease was in this case the fruit of indulgence. The man‚Äôs conscience was aroused through his sickness; our Lord first of all gives him spiritual health; afterwards bodily health; proving His authority to pardon by His power to cure, He thus places 'forgiveness' not only before but above miraculous healing."
3. "The general connection between sin and suffering is assumed throughout."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They brought (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒµœÜŒµœÅŒøŒΩ). Imperfect, 'were bringing,' graphic picture made very vivid by the details in Mark 2:1-4 and Luke 5:17."
2. "'Lying on a bed' (stretched on a couch), perfect passive participle, a little bed or couch (Œ∫ŒªŒπŒΩŒπŒ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ) in Luke 5:19, 'a pallet' (Œ∫œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøœÇ) in Mark 2:4; Mark 2:9; Mark 2:11."
3. "Thy sins are forgiven (Œ±œÜŒπŒµŒΩœÑŒ±). Present passive indicative (aoristic present). Luke (Luke 5:21) has Œ±œÜŒµœâŒΩœÑŒ±, Doric and Ionic perfect passive indicative for the Attic Œ±œÜŒµŒπŒΩœÑŒ±, one of the dialectical forms appearing in the Koine."

### John Gill:
1. "And Jesus seeing their faith...believed he was able to cure him."
2. "He bids him 'be of good cheer',...nothing could be more cheering and reviving to him."
3. "This was a wonderful instance of the grace of Christ, to bestow a blessing unasked, and that of the greatest moment and importance."

### John Wesley:
1. Seeing their faith ‚Äî Both that of the paralytic, and of them that brought him.
Son ‚Äî A title of tenderness and condescension. Mark 2:3; Luke 5:18.
