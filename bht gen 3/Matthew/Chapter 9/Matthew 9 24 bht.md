# Matthew 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words of Jesus, The maiden is not dead, but sleeping, may not imply that she was never truly dead. Rather, Christ used the phrase sleeping to indicate that she would soon return to life. This language of sleep is significant, as it parallels the idea of death being a temporary state before resurrection. People laughed at Jesus' statement, perhaps thinking him to be foolish or unaware of the reality of her death. However, they did not have faith in his power to bring her back to life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No inference can be drawn from these words as to the fact of the maidenâ€™s actual death."
2. "Think not the damsel dead, but sleeping; for she shall soon return to life."
3. "From Luke we learn that our Lord said 'Maid, arise;' from Mark we have the words He actually uttered, Talitha Cum."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. A direct reference to the miracle, which He was about to perform. She did not die, as others die; but she is as one who sleepeth, for I am about to raise her, as one is wakened from a sleep."
2. "The same words were used of Lazarus, in whose case the actual raising from actual death is distinctly affirmed... There is also a deeper and more general meaning; for Christ has, by His own resurrection and His promise to raise believers, declared death to be but a sleep."
3. "And they laughed him to scorn. They laughed Him down, not sharing the fatherâ€™s faith."

### John Gill:
1. "For the maid is not dead, but sleepeth: not but that she was really dead; and Christ signifies as much, when he says, she 'sleepeth'; a phrase that is often used in the Talmudic writings, for one that is dead."
2. "Christ's meaning is, that she was not so dead as the company thought; as always to remain in the state of the dead, and not to be restored to life again: whereas our Lord signifies, it would be seen in a very little time, that she should be raised again, just as a person is awaked out of sleep."
3. "And they laughed him to scorn...taking him either to be a madman, or a fool; knowing that she was really dead, of which they had all the evidence they could have; and having no faith at all in him, and in his power to raise her from the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "Withdraw - There is no need of you now; for the maid is not dead."
2. "Her life is not at an end; but sleepeth - This is only a temporary suspension of sense and motion."
3. "which should rather be termed sleep than death."
