# Matthew 9:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples came to Jesus, expressing their faith in His ability to heal their blindness. Jesus, in order to deepen and raise their expectation, asked them if they believed He was able to do this. Their immediate acknowledgment of His power exemplified the success of His test in preparing them to receive the cure. Jesus allowed them to persist in their request until He reached the house, drawing out their faith and avoiding a public response to the title Son of David. Such faith is necessary, for without it, knowledge of His power would be cold and unprofitable.
