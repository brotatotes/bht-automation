### Henry Alford:
1. "Touching, or anointing the eyes, was the ordinary method which our Lord took of impressing on the blind the action of the divine power which healed them." 
2. "No direct word of power passes from our Lord, but a relative concession, making that which was done a measure of the faith of the blind men."
3. "We may already notice, in the history of this first period of our Lordâ€™s ministry, that, from having at first yielded immediately to the request for healing, He begins, by degrees, to prove and exercise the faith of the applicants."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:

1.  Touched their eyes (Î·ÏˆÎ±Ï„Î¿ Ï„Ï‰Î½ Î¿Ï†Î¸Î±Î»Î¼Ï‰Î½). The men had faith (Matthew 9:28) and Jesus rewards their faith and yet he touched their eyes as he sometimes did with kindly sympathy.
