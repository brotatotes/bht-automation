# Matthew 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders, driven by their malice and envy, accused Jesus of blasphemy when he claimed to forgive sins. Their conclusion was based on their correct premise that only God can forgive sins. In their hearts, they condemned Jesus as just another ordinary man, failing to recognize his divine authority. However, Jesus quickly provided convincing evidence of his divinity through his miracles. By attributing to himself the power of forgiving sins, Jesus was affirming his equality with God. His claim, though scandalous and blasphemous to their conventional thinking, revealed his true identity as God incarnate.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "When applied to God, it means to speak of him unjustly; to ascribe to him acts and attributes which he does not possess; or to speak impiously or profanely." 
2. "It also means to say or do anything by which his name or honor is insulted, or which conveys an 'impression' unfavourable to God."
3. "None of the prophets had this power; and by saying that 'he forgave sins,' Jesus was understood to affirm that he was divine; and as he proved this by working a miracle expressly to confirm the claim, it follows that he is divine, or equal with the Father."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is beyond all question, that their eagerness to slander drove them to this wicked conclusion."
2. "They must have been already poisoned by malice and envy, otherwise they would not so eagerly have seized an occasion of blaming Christ."
3. "They had a right to inquire on what grounds Christ laid claim to such authority: but, without any inquiry, they suppose him to be one of the common rank of men, and proceed rashly to condemn him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Said within themselves, i.e., in their hearts, as is plain from Mark 2:6."
2. "This man, not necessarily a term of contempt."
3. "The parallel passages base the charge on the correct premise, that God only can forgive sins. The language of our Lord must therefore have been authoritative."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  This man blasphemeth (ουτος βλασφημε). See the sneer in "this fellow." "The prophet always is a scandalous, irreverent blasphemer from the conventional point of view" (Bruce). 


### John Gill:
1. "This man blasphemeth: the reason was, because they thought he ascribed that to himself, which was peculiar to God."
2. "He himself was God, of which he quickly gave convincing proofs."
3. "He ascribed that to himself, which was peculiar to God."
