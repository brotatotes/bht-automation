## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of our Lordâ€™s earnestness appears to have been twofold: ... (1) that He might not be so occupied and overpressed with applications as to have neither time nor strength for the preaching of the Gospel: (2) to prevent the already-excited people from taking some public measure of recognition, and thus arousing the malice of the Pharisees before His hour was come."
2. "No doubt the two men were guilty of an act of disobedience in thus breaking the Lordâ€™s solemn injunction: for obedience is better than sacrifice; the humble observance of the word of the Lord, than the most laborious and wide-spread will-worship after manâ€™s own mind and invention."
3. "This was a dumbness caused by dÃ¦moniacal possession: for the difference between this and the natural infirmity of a deaf and dumb man, see Mark vii. 31â€“37."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 30. And their eyes were opened: and
	Jesus straitly charged themâ€”The expression is very strong,

### Philip Schaff:

- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus, in his earnestness, both prioritized preaching the Gospel and prevented an untimely recognition that would provoke the Pharisees. However, the two men who regained their sight were disobedient to Jesus' command to keep it a secret, despite the difference between their miraculous recovery and natural infirmities. Jesus sternly charged them to stay silent, emphasizing the need for obedience over self-promotion. Their eyes were opened immediately, but Jesus urged them not to make the miracle known, aligning with his usual practice and teachings. Though the reason for keeping it secret is unknown, it likely involved either ensuring witnesses or postponing its proclamation. The charge was given with severity, and Jesus avoided public acknowledgement, possibly to avoid seeking applause.
