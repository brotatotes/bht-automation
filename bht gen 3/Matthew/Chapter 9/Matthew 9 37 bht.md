# Matthew 9:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord's compassion was stirred by the plenteous harvest of souls, primarily among the Jewish people. He wisely sent out His disciples, granting them preliminary practice for their future work. Jesus, the Lord of the harvest, Himself did not join the disciples in prayer but sent them out as laborers. The vast field of souls needing to be gathered to Him extended beyond the Jewish scope. However, the number of laborers divinely qualified and called to harvest was few. The need for more laborers was evident to gather souls for Christ and eternal salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The harvest was primarily that of the Jewish people, the multitudes of whom before Him excited the Lordâ€™s compassion."
2. "We see not only our Lordâ€™s freedom from vainglory, in sending out his disciples rather than drawing all notice to Himself, but His wisdom, in giving them this preliminary practice for their future work."
3. "The Lord, says Chrysostom, having given this command, does not join them in such a prayer, but Himself sends them out as labourersâ€”shewing plainly that He Himself is the Lord of the harvest."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The harvest truly is plenteousâ€”His eye doubtless rested immediately on the Jewish field, but this he saw widening into the vast field of 'the world,' teeming with souls having to be gathered to Him."
2. "The laborersâ€”men divinely qualified and called to gather them inâ€”'are few.'"
3. "The harvest is plenteous and the laborers are few."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No obstacle should prevent him. He should lay himself at his feet, and feel that Jesus holds over him the power of life and death, and that no other being can save."
2. "To him, then, the lost sinner may come with the assurance that as he freely 'then' exerted that power, so he is ever the same, and will do it now."
3. "Jesus Christ is divine. Nothing could prove it more clearly than the power to pardon sinners. Only God can pronounce what shall be done with transgressors of His law... Jesus was therefore divine. He can save to the uttermost all who come to God through him."

### John Calvin:
1. "The harvest is indeed abundant... God values a small band of his own people more highly than the rest of the world."
2. "He does not rank them among laborers: for he employs the word laborers in a good sense."
3. "He refers to their boasting: for he would not have bestowed the designation of laborers on those who devoted all their exertions to ruin and waste the flock."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The people were ready to hear; but could not, if more did not enter into the work."
2. "As yet, He was the only laborer."
3. "Our weak faith denies the harvest as much as it diminishes the number of laborers."

### John Gill:
1. "The harvest truly is plenteous... these were maturely prepared by anything in themselves, or done by them, for the grace of God."
2. "There is a certain fixed time, settled... Christ calls them an 'harvest'; and because of their number, a large, or 'plenteous' one."
3. "Such painful and laborious ministers, who are willing to spend, and be spent for Christ and immortal souls, have been but few in all ages; generally speaking, there are more loiterers than labourers."

### John Wesley:
1. "The harvest truly is great â€” When Christ came into the world, it was properly the time of harvest; till then it was the seed time only."
2. "But the labourers are few â€” Those whom God sends; who are holy, and convert sinners."
3. "Of others there are many. Luke 10:2."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The harvest of souls, primarily among the Jewish people, elicited the Lord's compassion, prompting Him to send out His disciples as laborers in the vast field of the world. Recognizing the plenitude of the harvest and the scarcity of laborers, Jesus emphasized the need for more divinely-qualified laborers to gather souls to Him. Jesus, as the Lord of the harvest, appointed His disciples and later, other holy laborers, to engage in the work of spreading the Gospel and saving lost sinners. It is vital for us to trust in Jesus' power to pardon and save, for He alone holds the authority to forgive transgressors. We must wholeheartedly embrace our role as laborers and recognize that our weak faith not only hinders our ability to see the abundant harvest but also limits the number of laborers available.
