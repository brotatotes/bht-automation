## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Which is easiest, to claim this power or that, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk? That (i. e. the former) is easiest, and I will now prove my right to say it, by saying with effect and with an outward consequence setting its seal to my truth, the harder word, Arise and walk."
2. "By doing that, which is capable of being put to the proof, I will vindicate my right and power to do that which in its very nature is incapable of being proved."
3. "From this, which I will now do openly and before you all, you may conclude that it is 'no robbery' upon my part to claim also the power of forgiving men their sins."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "One is as easy as the other; and to be able to do the one, involves the right and the power to do the other."
3. "Whether is easier to say - Thy 'sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?'"
