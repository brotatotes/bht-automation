# Matthew 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son of Man, as God manifest in manâ€™s flesh, has on manâ€™s earth that power, which in its essence belongs to God in heaven. Jesus performs the miracle of healing the paralytic to prove his Messianic power on earth to forgive sins even as God does. He had both power and authority, and he demonstrated it by commanding the paralytic to rise from his bed and carry it himself, providing visible proof of his ability and authority as both God and man.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Alexandrian Fathers, in their conflict with the Nestorians, made use of this passage in proof of the entire transference which there was of all the properties of Christâ€™s divine nature to His human; so that whatever one had, was so far common, that it might also be predicated of the other."
2. "It is quite true that had not the two natures Been indissolubly knit together in a single Person, no such language could have been used; yet I should rather suppose that â€˜Son of Manâ€™ being the standing title whereby the Lord was well pleased to designate Himself, bringing out by it that He was at once one with humanity, and the crown of humanity, He does not so use it that the title is every where to be pressed, but at times simply as equivalent to Messiah."
3. "The Son of Man, as God manifest in manâ€™s flesh, has on manâ€™s earth that power, which in its fountain and essence belongs to God in heaven. And this not by delegation, but 'because He (being God) is the Son of Man.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I will perform an act which all must perceive and admit to require the power of God."
2. "The fact that a man, just before perfectly helpless, could now take up and carry his own bed or couch, proved that a divine 'power' had been exerted."
3. "That fact proved that he who had performed the miracle must also have the 'power' and the 'authority' to forgive sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "They cannot so properly be said to pardon sins, as to declare that they are pardoned, when they deliver the commission which is entrusted to them."
2. "Christ declares that he is not only the minister and witness, but likewise the author, of this grace."
3. "Christ exhibits forgiveness of sins to men in his own person, and as it were in his hands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Son of man, here equivalent to the Messiah."
2. "'Power' is not so exact."
3. "Christ claimed and exercised this 'authority' as the incarnate Son of God, or as 'the Son of man on earth,' having brought it with Him from heaven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus accepts the challenge in the thoughts of the scribes and performs the miracle of healing the paralytic, who so far only had his sins forgiven, to prove his Messianic power on earth to forgive sins even as God does." 
2. "The word ÎµÎ¾Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î± may mean either power or authority. He had both as a matter of fact."
3. "Pack up at once (aorist active imperative) the rolled-up pallet."

### John Gill:
1. "That they might have a visible proof, an ocular demonstration, that though he was the son of man, truly and really man, yet not a mere man; but also as truly and properly God, God and man in one person." 
2. "Not only ability as God, but even authority to do it as mediator, even whilst he was on earth, in a state of humiliation, in fashion as a man, in the form of a servant, conversing with sinful mortals."
3. "He ordered him to 'arise' from his bed, on which he was carried by four men, and 'take up his bed', and carry it himself; which would be not only an evidence that the disease had left him, but that he was in full strength, and perfect health."

### John Wesley:
1. On earth â€” Even in my state of humiliation.
