# Matthew 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
While he himself sinks his family name, he is careful not to sink his occupation, the obnoxious associations with which he would place over against the grace that called him from it, and made him an apostle. Being in this case by the seaside, it might be the ferry tax for the transit of persons and goods across the lake, which he collected. Witching words these, from the lips of Him who never employed them without giving them resistless efficacy in the hearts of those they were spoken to.
