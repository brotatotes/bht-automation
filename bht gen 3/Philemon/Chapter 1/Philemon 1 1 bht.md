## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "prisoner of Christ Jesus, i.e. one whom He (or His cause) has placed in bonds"
2. "He does not designate himself as an apostle, or the like, as writing familiarly, and not authoritatively."
3. "fellow-labourer...at Colosse, in building up the church there"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "prisoner of Jesus Christ â€” one whom Christ's cause has made a prisoner."
2. "He does not call himself, as in other Epistles, 'Paul an apostle', as he is writing familiarly, not authoritatively."
3. "our... fellow labourer â€” in building up the Church at Colosse, while we were at Ephesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ - A prisoner at Rome in the cause of Jesus Christ"
2. "As Timothy was of that region of country, and as he had accompanied Paul in his travels, he was doubtless acquainted with Philemon."
3. "The word rendered 'fellow-laborer' does not determine what office he held, if he held any, or in what respects he was a fellow-laborer with Paul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A prisoner for Christ's sake."
2. "Timothy could not be called an apostle."
3. "Philemon, an inhabitant, and possibly a native of Colossae in Phrygia."

### John Calvin:
1. "Sending back a runaway slave and thief, he supplicates pardon for him. But in pleading this cause, he discourses about Christian forbearance with such ability, that he appears to speak about the interests of the whole Church rather than the private affairs of a single individual."
2. "In behalf of a man of the lowest condition, he demeans himself so modestly and humbly, that nowhere else is the meekness of his temper painted in a more lively manner."
3. "A prisoner of Jesus Christ. In the same sense in which he elsewhere calls himself an Apostle of Christ, or a minister of Christ, he now calls himself 'a prisoner of Christ;' because the chains by which he was bound on account of the gospel, were the ornaments or badges of that embassy which he exercised for Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As the matter on which the apostle is about to write is rather personal and social in its character, he does not style himself an apostle in his address, but employs a word which should challenge sympathy more than make a claim to obedience."
2. "St. Paul was not ashamed of his chains, but saw advantage coming from his bondage, and so he called it his grace."
3. "The sacrifices which Philemon was making for the church at ColossÃ¦, by receiving the congregation into his house, entitles him to this name. And the man who did so much for Christâ€™s cause, we may be sure was ready to do more."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A prisoner of Christ Jesus... more touching occasion of pride as Paul writes with his manacled right hand."
2. "Timothy... associated with Paul also in I and II Thess., II Cor., Philipp., Col."
3. "To Philemon... active in the church in Colossae and was beloved by Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "He was a prisoner at Rome for the sake of Christ, on account of professing him, and preaching in his name; his bonds were for the sake of the Gospel of Christ; and therefore they are in this epistle called the bonds of the Gospel."
2. "And Timothy our brother, not according to the flesh, or as being of the same country, for he was the countryman of neither of them; nor only on account of his being a regenerate than, born of God, a child of God, and of the same family; but chiefly because he was of the same function, was a minister of the Gospel."
3. "unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow labourer: the name of Philemon is Greek; there was a Greek poet of this name, and a Greek historian that Pliny made use of in compiling his history... and likewise as he was a minister of the Gospel; for so the next phrase, 'and fellow labourer,' seems to import."

### John Wesley:
1. "This single epistle infinitely transcends all the wisdom of the world."
2. "It gives us a specimen how Christians ought to treat of secular affairs from higher principles."
3. "Paul a prisoner of Christ â€” To whom, as such, Philemon could deny nothing."
