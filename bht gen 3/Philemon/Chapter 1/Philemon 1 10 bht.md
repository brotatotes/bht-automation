# Philemon 10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I beseech thee for my son, Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds. Scripture does not begin a political crusade against slavery, but it sets forth principles of love that would eventually undermine and overthrow it without violent upheaval. By appealing to you on behalf of my spiritual child, I hope to show the power of conversion transcending physical circumstances. Just as a slave was considered property under Roman law, this person whom I regard as my own child deserves your recognition.
