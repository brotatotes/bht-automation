### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No doubt the discipline of Onesimus‚Äô return was food both for master and slave, [...] to Philemon also it was a benefit that he should be called on to exercise forgiveness for a serious wrong, while the more tender conduct which would be shown towards Onesimus in the future, would do something, if not much, toward loosening the bonds of any other slaves among the congregation at Coloss√¶."
2. "But St. Paul everywhere else uses the word rendered ‚Äòbowels‚Äô for the seat of the feelings and emotions, so that it is better to interpret the words here as an expression of deep affection."
3. "Some, taking the literal rendering of the Authorised Version, have considered this expression as equivalent to ‚Äòmy own child.‚Äô"
