## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Onesimus had confessed to Paul what he had done." - Bengel.
3. "That reckon, or impute to me: hardly perhaps, notwithstanding the engagement of the next verse, with a view to actual repayment, but rather to inducing Philemon to forego exacting it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If he hath wronged [ÎµÎ¹ Î·Î´Î¹ÎºÎ´ÏƒÎµÎ½] . The indicative mood with the conditional particle may imply that what is put hypothetically is really a fact : if he wronged thee as he did."
2. "Oweth. Perhaps indicating that Onesimus had been guilty of theft. Notice the general word wronged instead of the more exact specification of the crime."
3. "Put that on my account [Ï„Î¿Ï…Ï„Î¿ ÎµÎ¼Î¿Î¹ ÎµÎ»Î»Î¿Î³Î±] . For the verb, compare Romans 5:13 (note)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence we may infer that Onesimus had likewise stolen something from his master, as was customary with fugitives; and yet he softens the criminality of the act, by adding, or if he oweth thee anything."
2. "Not only was there a bond between them recognised by civil law, but the slave had become indebted to his master by the wrong which he had inflicted on him."
3. "So much the greater, therefore, was the kindness of Paul, who was even ready to give satisfaction for a crime."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The offence of the unjust steward, who had appropriated his masterâ€™s income is described by the same word. It seems used euphemistically when the mention of actual â€˜theftâ€™ is not convenient."
2. "If we suppose some such false entries in the slaveâ€™s accounts as are spoken of in St. Lukeâ€™s narrative, we can understand that St. Paul, out of tenderness to Onesimus, might speak of the defalcation, which perhaps had been discovered after his flight, as a debt due from the slave to the master."
3. "St. Paul would scarcely have said this if there bad been no business concerns between him and Philemon. It is not as if he had said â€˜hold me responsible.â€™ The word in the original refers to an actual reckoning, and the next verse bears out that sense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Onesimus did wrong...He had probably robbed Philemon before he ran away."
2. "Delicate way of putting the stealing."
3. "It means to set to one's account."

2. "or oweth thee ought; by embezzling his master's goods, robbing him of his money, and running away from his service."
3. "put that on mine account; Signifying that he would be answerable for all, and make good all debts and damages."
