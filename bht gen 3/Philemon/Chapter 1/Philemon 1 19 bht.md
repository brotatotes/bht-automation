## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The inference from this is, that the whole Epistle was autographic."
2. "This is a kind of reticence, when we say that we wish to omit that very thing which we wish most to say."
3. "Thine own self. Not thy goods merely. This shows that Philemon had been converted by St. Paul in person."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "with mine own hand ‚Äî not employing an amanuensis, as in other Epistles: a special compliment to Philemon"
2. "that I may not say ... not to say"
3. "thou owest ... even thine own self ‚Äî not merely thy possessions. For to my instrumentality thou owest thy salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I Paul have written it with mine own hand" - It has been inferred from this, that Paul wrote this entire Epistle with his own hand, though this was contrary to his usual practice... he would certainly be bound for what he had promised.
2. "I will repay it" - I will be security for it... if he did, he would feel himself bound to pay it.
3. "Albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides" - Paul had doubtless been the means of the conversion of Philemon... His very life - his eternal welfare - was to be traced to his labors... for this consideration, Philemon would not think of exacting of him what he had voluntarily obligated himself to obey.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of his autograph here, rather than at the end of the letter, may indicate that he wrote the whole epistle with his own hand, contrary to his usual custom of employing an amanuensis."
2. "I thus give my note of hand that I may avoid saying that thou owest, etc."
3. "I have laid you under obligation, not only for an amount equal to that due from Onesimus, but for yourself as made a Christian through my ministry."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is nothing that thou couldest refuse to give me, even though I should demand thyself."
2. "I wish that thou shouldest not contend with thy slave, unless thou choosest to have me for thy debtor in his stead."
3. "He who claims the whole man as his property, need not give himself uneasiness about paying money."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I Paul write it with mine own hand. Up to this point, the apostle had probably used his amanuensis; but that the transaction may be formal and secure, he attaches his own signature to what has been written, and so transforms the Epistle into a bond."
2. "He might have urged the larger debt which Philemon owed to him for his conversion to the faith of Christ, should be held to far outbalance the loss inflicted by Onesimus. But this he will not press, though by a delicate reference to it, he gives force to the appeal which he is making."
3. "On St. Paul‚Äôs connection with the Colossian church see the Introduction. It appears probable that Philemon‚Äôs conversion was wrought by the apostle‚Äôs preaching at Ephesus, for St. Paul seems up to this time not to have been in Coloss√¶. And he speaks to Philemon of his ‚Äòown self,‚Äô that he may remind him how paltry the consideration of money gain or loss must be in comparison of the salvation of that which alone of man is to know immortality."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With mine hand (œÑŒ∑ ŒµŒºŒ∑ œáŒµŒπœÅ). Instrumental case and a note of hand that can be collected."
2. "This is Paul's promissory note."
3. "He used every available argument to bring Philemon to see the higher ground of brotherhood in Christ about Onesimus."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows his great humility to be a bondsman for a servant, and to make good damages and debts brought on in a scandalous manner; as also that suretyship in some cases is lawful, though it ought to be cautiously, and for very good reasons, entered into."
2. "And this engagement of the apostle for Onesimus bears some resemblance with, and may serve to illustrate the suretyship of Christ, for his people."
3. "From hence may be observed, how greatly obliged regenerated persons are to those, who have been the means and instruments of their conversion."

### John Wesley:
1. "I will repay it ‚Äî If thou requirest it."
2. "Not to say, that then owest me thyself ‚Äî It cannot be expressed, how great our obligation is to those who have gained our souls to Christ."
3. "Beside ‚Äî Receiving Onesimus."
