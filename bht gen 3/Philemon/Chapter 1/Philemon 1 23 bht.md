# Philemon 23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Epaphras, referred to as a fellow prisoner, could be interpreted as a metaphorical or literal term. Some suggest that he was a faithful companion to Paul in his imprisonment, voluntarily putting himself in the position of a prisoner. Others argue that Epaphras may have been actually imprisoned together with Paul. Epaphras had a significant role in the establishment of the Colossian church and the spread of the Gospel in Colossae, Hierapolis, and Laodicea. The reason for him being called a fellow prisoner remains uncertain, but it implies shared suffering or perhaps actual imprisonment due to his dedication to the cause of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner â€” He had been sent by the Colossian Church to inquire after, and minister to, Paul, and possibly was cast into prison by the Roman authorities on suspicion."
2. "However, he is not mentioned as a prisoner in :-, so that 'fellow prisoner' here may mean merely one who was a faithful companion to Paul in his imprisonment, and by his society put himself in the position of a prisoner."
3. "So also 'Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner,' :-, may mean. Benson conjectures the meaning to be that on some former occasion these two were Paul's 'fellow prisoners,' not at the time."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The same persons who are here mentioned as greeting Philemon, are mentioned in the close of the Epistle to the Colossians - furnishing a high degree of evidence that Philemon resided at Colosse."
2. "Epaphras was a member of the church there."
3. "My fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus - In the cause of Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is disputed whether fellow - prisoner is to be taken in a literal or in a spiritual sense."
2. "In Romans 16:7, the word used here is applied to Andronicus and Junia."
3. "The probabilities seem to favor the spiritual sense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee."
2. "Why the apostle calls him â€˜fellow-prisonerâ€™ is not clear... Therefore it seems probable that the word is used of these friends because they voluntarily shared the imprisonment of the apostle, and so in fact were captives as much as he."
3. "Or it may even be that, for zeal in his cause, they had been subjected to some sort of restraint."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Epaphras. The Colossian preacher who apparently started the work in Colossae, Hierapolis, and Laodicea." 
2. "My fellow-prisoner. Used metaphorically like the verb Î±Î¹Ï‡Î¼Î±Î»Ï‰Ï„Î¹Î¶Ï‰ in 2 Corinthians 10:5."
3. "Some hold that Epaphras became a prisoner with Paul in Rome."

### John Gill:
1. "There salute thee Epaphras.... my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus." 
2. "this good man, and minister of Christ, might have been sent by the Colossians, as Epaphroditus was by the Philippians, to the apostle at Rome, to pay him a visit, and comfort and assist him under his afflictions."
3. "Epaphras being at Rome, when this persecution broke out, was taken up and put in prison, as were also Aristarchus and Timothy."
