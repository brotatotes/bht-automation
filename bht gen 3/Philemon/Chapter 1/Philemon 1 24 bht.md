## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Lucas - see the notes at the Epistle to the Colossians, Colossians 4:10, Colossians 4:14.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mark. Probably John Mark the evangelist." 
2. "He appears as the companion of Paul." 
3. "Luke. The physician and evangelist."

### John Calvin:
1. "And if one of Paul‚Äôs assistants, having become weary and discouraged, was afterwards drawn aside by the vanity of the world, let no man reckon too confidently on the zeal of a single year..."
2. "...let him pray to God for steadfastness."
3. "...but, considering how large a portion of the journey still remains to be accomplished..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And to do Mark. Doubtless the John Mark who on the first missionary journey had turned back and left Paul and Silas. He had not ceased, however, to work in Christ‚Äôs cause, and the apostle‚Äôs displeasure had passed away, for Mark had become profitable to him for the ministry (2 Timothy 4:11)."
2. "Demas, mentioned like the rest in the Colossian Epistle, but at a later time (2 Timothy 4:10) described as deserting St. Paul for the love of the world."
3. "By his own efforts and by those of his companions, St. Paul made it apparent that, even though he were a prisoner, the Word of God was not bound. We often regard the two years at Rome as a time when the apostolic work was stayed. It may well have been the most fruitful period of the apostle‚Äôs life, for from his own lips the Roman soldiery learnt the story of the Cross, while the self-sacrificing zeal of his Christian companions was ready to undertake any duty that would prove them deserving of the name of fellow-labourers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. The other "co-workers" (œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥Œø) here (Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke) are all named in detail in Colossians 4:10-14 with kindly words. 


### John Gill:
1. "Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas...Aristarchus was a Macedonian of Thessalonica... Demas is the same with him who is mentioned in 2 Timothy 4:10...Luke the Evangelist, the beloved physician...these the apostle styles, 'my fellow labourers.'"
2. "This shows the apostle's great humility, so to call them, when they were far from being on an equal foot with him in office, gifts, or usefulness."
3. "The Christian salutations of these persons are sent to Philemon, with this view, to engage him the more to attend to the apostle's request, in which they all joined."
