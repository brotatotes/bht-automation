## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

	‚Äî ( :-;

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is a model of courtesy. It shows that the apostle was a man of refined sensibility, and had a delicate perception of what was due in friendship, and what was required by true politeness."
2. "The Epistle shows that [Paul] had great tact in argument, and great skill in selecting just such things as would be adapted to secure the end in view."
3. "The principles laid down in this Epistle would lead to the universal abolition of slavery. If all those who are now slaves were to become Christians, and their masters were to treat them 'not as slaves, but as brethren beloved,' the period would not be far distant when slavery would cease."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To have attacked the institution as such would have been worse than useless. To one who reads between the lines, Paul's silence means more than any amount of denunciation; for with his silence goes his faith in the power of Christian sentiment to settle finally the whole question."
2. "He accepts the social condition as a fact, and even as a law. He sends Onesimus back to his legal owner. He does not bid Philemon emancipate him, but he puts the Christian slave on his true footing of a Christian brother beside his master."
3. "He knows that the recognition of the slave as free in Christ will carry with it, ultimately, the recognition of his civil freedom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
2. "the apostle‚Äôs own blessing is invoked over him and his, and the whole church as well"
3. "to whom the letter at the outset refers"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Grace (Œ∑ œáŒ±œÅŒπœÇ). This great word occurred in the greeting (verse Philemon 1:3) as it does in the farewell. 


### John Gill:
1. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit." 
2. "Not with his spirit only, but with the spirit of Apphia and Archippus, to whom also the epistle was sent."
3. "The salutation is the same as in all the epistles; the form of it agrees with Galatians 6:18."
