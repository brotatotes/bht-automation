## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The fact of his calling himself Paul the aged is interesting, as connected with the date of this Epistle and those to Eph. and Col.: see Introd. to Eph.¬ßiv."
3. "I prefer this way, as the more efficacious, being such an one..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Love's sake‚Äîmine to thee, and (what ought to be) thine to Onesimus."
2. "Being such an one as thou knowest me to be, namely, Paul‚Äîthe founder of so many churches, and an apostle of Christ, and thy father in the faith."
3. "Now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ‚Äîthe strongest claim I have on thy regard: if for no other reason, at least in consideration of this, through commiseration gratify me."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Not, being such an one (armed with such authority), as Paul the aged I beseech (the second beseech in ver. 10); but, as Rev., for love 's sake I rather beseech, being such an one as Paul the aged."
3. "The beseech in ver. 10 is resumptive."

### John Calvin:
1. "By his example he shows that pastors should endeavor to draw disciples gently rather than to drag them by force; and indeed, when, by condescending to entreaty, he foregoes his right, this has far greater power to obtain his wish than if he issued a command."
2. "He means that teachers have not power to enact whatever they please, but that their authority is confined within these limits, that they must not command anything but 'what is proper,' and, in other respects, consistent with every man‚Äôs duty."
3. "The designation 'elder,' here, denotes not age, but office. He calls himself an apostle for this reason, that the person with whom he has to deal, and with whom he talks familiarly, is a fellow-laborer in the ministry of the word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For the love I bear you I lay aside all authority, and beg you to be moved by that love alone."

2. "But in Ephesians 6:20 Paul says œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤ŒµœÖœâ ŒµŒΩ Œ±ŒªœÖœÉŒµ (I am an ambassador in a chain). Hence Lightfoot holds that here œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤œÖœÑŒ∑œÇ = œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤ŒµœÖœÑŒ∑œÇ because of common confusion by the scribes between œÖ and ŒµœÖ."
3. "Undoubtedly ambassador (œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤ŒµœÖœÑŒ∑œÇ) is possible here as in Ephesians 6:20 (œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤ŒµœÖœâ) though there is no real reason why Paul should not term himself properly 'Paul the aged'."

### John Gill:
1. "Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee..."
2. "Being such an one as Paul the aged..."
3. "and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ"

### John Wesley:
1. "In how handsome a manner does the apostle just hint, and immediately drop, the consideration of his power to command, and tenderly entreat Philemon..."
2. "With what endearment, in the next verse, does he call Onesimus his son, before he names his name!"
3. "And as soon as he had mentioned it, with what fine address does he just touch on his former faults, and instantly pass on to the happy change that was now made upon him!"
