# Philemon 9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I rather beseech you, for love's sake, as Paul the aged, to show the same Christian love that you have exemplified. Though I could command you with authority, I choose to entreat you because of the love we share. As an apostle, founder of many churches, and your spiritual father, I ask you to consider my plea. Let us appeal to love rather than use power. As a prisoner of Christ, my age and position should garner respect. By setting aside my authority and appealing to love, I hope you will be moved to forgive and accept Onesimus.

### John Calvin:
1. "By his example he shows that pastors should endeavor to draw disciples gently rather than to drag them by force; and indeed, when, by condescending to entreaty, he foregoes his right, this has far greater power to obtain his wish than if he issued a command."
2. "Hence... pastors are reminded that the hearts of their people must be soothed with all possible gentleness, wherever this method is likely to be more advantageous, but yet so as to know that they who are treated so gently have nothing less exacted from them than what they ought to do."
3. "The designation 'elder,' here, denotes not age, but office. He calls himself an apostle for this reason, that the person with whom he has to deal, and with whom he talks familiarly, is a fellow-laborer in the ministry of the word."

2. "Hippocrates calls a man œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤œÖœÑŒ∑œÇ from 49 to 56 and Œ≥ŒµœÅœâŒΩ after that." 
3. "Hence Lightfoot holds that here œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤œÖœÑŒ∑œÇ = œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤ŒµœÖœÑŒ∑œÇ because of common confusion by the scribes between œÖ and ŒµœÖ."
