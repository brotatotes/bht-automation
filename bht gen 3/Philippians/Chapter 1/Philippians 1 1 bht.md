## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly no official character is intended to be given by it, as some have thought: for of all the Epistles, this is the least official."
2. "[The mention of Timothy] is merely formal...the most so."
3. "The simple juxtaposition of the officers with the members of the Church, and indeed their being placed after those members, shews...the absence of hierarchical views."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of his name implies merely that Timothy joined in affectionate remembrances to them."
2. "Paul does not call himself 'an apostle,' as in the inscriptions of other Epistles; for the Philippians needed not to be reminded of his apostolic authority. He writes rather in a tone of affectionate familiarity."
3. "The Spirit thus intimated that the churches were to look up to their own pastors, now that the miraculous gifts were passing into God's ordinary providence, and the presence of the inspired apostles, the dispensers of those gifts, was to be withdrawn."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The common appellation given to the church, denoting that it was holy."
2. "The word properly means an inspector, overseer, or guardian, and was given to the ministers of the gospel because they exercised this care over the churches."
3. "The word properly means servants, and is then applied to the ministers of the gospel as being the servants of Christ, and of the churches."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The christian Church has inherited the title and the privileges of the Jewish nation. Hence it is eqnov agion a holy nation." 
2. "In the apostolic writings it is synonymous with presbyter or elder; and no official distinction of the episcopate as a distinct order of the ministry is recognized."
3. "Such may also be the meaning of ministering, Romans 12:7. Hence men of faith, piety, and sound judgment were recommended for the office by the apostles, Acts 6:3; 1 Timothy 3:8-13."

### John Calvin:
1. "We may, however, infer from this, that the name of bishop is common to all the ministers of the Word, inasmuch as he assigns several bishops to one Church. The titles, therefore, of bishop and pastor, are synonymous."
2. "Now, although we must not contend for words, it were at the same time better for us in speaking to follow the Holy Spirit, the author of tongues, than to change for the worse forms of speech which are dictated to us by Him."
3. "This term may be taken in two ways â€” either as meaning administrators, and curators of the poor, or for elders, who were appointed for the regulation of morals."

3. "It is clear from the New Testament usage that the word for â€˜bishopâ€™ was in these days synonymous with that for â€˜elder.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word saint (Î±Î³Î¹Î¿Ï‚) here is used for the professing Christians as in 1 Corinthians 1:2" 
2. "The centre for all Christian relations and activities for Paul and for us."
3. "In the second century ÎµÏ€Î¹ÏƒÏ‡Î¿Ï€Î¿Ï‚ (Ignatius) came to mean one superior to elders, but not so in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "The reasons of his joining Timothy with him are, because he was with him when he first preached at Philippi, and so was known unto the Philippians, and respected by them; and because he was about to send him to them again, whose commendations he enlarges on in the epistle itself."
2. "The members are meant by 'all the saints in Christ Jesus'; they were saints or holy persons, not by Moses and his law; not by ceremonial ablutions and sacrifices, which only sanctified to the purifying of the flesh, but could not take away sin, or cleanse from it; nor by themselves and their moral righteousness; for though thereby men, nay outwardly appear holy and righteous, yet they remain inwardly unholy and impure; nor by baptism, which has no regenerating nor sanctifying virtue in it; if persons are not saints before that, they are never by it."
3. "The officers of this church were 'the bishops and deacons'. The 'bishops' were the pastors, elders, and overseers of the church, for a bishop and an elder is one and the same... The 'deacons' were such as served tables, the Lord's table, the minister's table, and the poor's table; took care of the secular affairs of the church, received and disbursed moneys, kept the church's accounts, and provided everything necessary for its temporal good."

### John Wesley:
1. "Servants â€” St. Paul, writing familiarly to the Philippians, does not style himself an apostle."
2. "To all the saints â€” The apostolic epistles were sent more directly to the churches, than to the pastors of them."
3. "The word bishops here includes all the presbyters at Philippi, as well as the ruling presbyters: the names bishop and presbyter, or elder, being promiscuously used in the first ages."
