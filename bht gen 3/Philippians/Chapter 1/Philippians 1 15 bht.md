# Philippians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this context, there are two categories of individuals: those who preach Christ out of envy and those who do so out of good will towards Paul. The first group, consisting of anti-Pauline Christians, preached with the intention of diminishing Paul's influence due to their envy. On the other hand, there were those who preached Christ with sincerity, desiring the salvation of others. It is disheartening to see envy and rivalry intertwined with the preaching of Christ, but such conflicts between preachers have arisen throughout history.
