## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But the others out of contention (or rather, 'a factious spirit'; 'cabal'; a spirit of intrigue, using unscrupulous means to compass their end; 'self-seeking') proclaim Christ, not sincerely." 
2. "Literally, 'not purely'; not with a pure intention; the Jewish leaven they tried to introduce was in order to glorify themselves, thinking (but in vain) to raise up tribulation to my bonds."
3. "Their thought was that taking the opportunity of my being laid aside, they would exalt themselves by their Judaizing preaching, and depreciate me and my preaching, and so cause me trouble of spirit in my bonds."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not sincerely - Not 'purely' - Î±Ì”Î³Î½Ï‰Í‚Ï‚ hagnoÌ„s - not with pure motives or intentions."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the term [contention] does not apply to doctrine, because it is possible that the man who teaches most purely, may, nevertheless, not be of a sincere mind."
2. "Hence it is not to be wondered if false brethren snatch a weapon from the gospel for harassing good and pious pastors."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Of love (ÎµÎ¾ Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î·Ï‚). Out of love to Paul as well as to Christ. Put Philippians 1:1 here as a flash-light. 


### John Gill:
1. "They did not preach Christ from a principle of love to his person, and from an inward experience of the power of his Gospel, and a zealous affection for it, and firm attachment to it, and with a view to the glory of God, the honour of Christ, and the good of immortal souls; but were influenced by avarice, ambition, and envy."
2. "They had very evil designs upon the apostle, supposing to add affliction to my bonds; imagining that by their free and bold way of preaching Christ openly in the city without control, and with impunity, it might be thought that the apostle did not lie in bonds for preaching Christ, but for some other crime."
3. "He was so far from being made uneasy hereby, that he rejoiced at the preaching of Christ, let their intentions be what they would."
