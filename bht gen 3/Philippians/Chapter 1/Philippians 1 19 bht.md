## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Salvation is variously interpreted: of deliverance from present custody: of sustenance in life: of victory over foes: of the salvation of others. But from the context it must refer to his own spiritual good‚Äîhis own fruitfulness for Christ and glorification of Him, whether by his life or death;‚Äîand so eventually his own salvation, in degree of blessedness, not in relation to the absolute fact itself."
2. "Surely, that intercessory prayer should attain its object, and the supply take place in consequence of the prayer, is only in accord with the simplest idea of any reality in such prayer at all."

3. "The supply of the Spirit is a supply of gifts from Christ, fitting and qualifying men for his service, and which are ministered by the Spirit to them severally as he will; and a supply of grace out of the fulness of Christ, which the Spirit of grace is the applier of; and a supply of strength from the same by him, to enable the saints both to do and suffer whatever he is pleased to call them to."

### John Wesley:
1. This shall turn to my salvation ‚Äî Shall procure me an higher degree of glory.
