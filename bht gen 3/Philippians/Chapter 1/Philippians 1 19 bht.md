## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "salvation is variously interpreted: of deliverance from present custody: of sustenance in life: of victory over foes: of the salvation of others. But from the context it must refer to his own spiritual goodâ€”his own fruitfulness for Christ and glorification of Him, whether by his life or death;â€”and so eventually his own salvation, in degree of blessedness, not in relation to the absolute fact itself)"
2. "the construction obliges us to take supply as parallel with prayer, and as also included under the description your. Were the sense as A.V., and ordinarily, â€˜through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,â€™ the form of the original would have been different."
3. "Surely, that intercessory prayer should attain its object, and the supply take place in consequence of the prayer, is only in accord with the simplest idea of any reality in such prayer at all."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This proclamation of Christ every way will turn out to my spiritual good."
2. "So far is their preaching from causing me, as they thought, tribulation in my bonds."
3. "Through your prayer and (the consequent) supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (obtained for me through your prayer)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whether the effect shall be to turn public favor toward the Christian religion, and secure my release; or whether it shall be to instigate my enemies more, so as to lead to my death; I am satisfied that the result, so far as I am concerned, will be well."
2. "Trying and painful as all this was, yet trial and pain Paul reckoned among the means of grace; and he had no doubt that this would prove so."
3. "He needed the same spirit which Jesus Christ had, to enable him to bear his trials with patience, and to impart to him the consolations which he required."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This preaching of Christ in every way." 
2. "Salvation simply is used, without any more precise definition." 
3. "The Spirit is the living principle and the organ of the proper presence of Christ and of His life in them."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though they plot my destruction, yet I trust that all their attempts will have no other effect but that Christ will be glorified in me â€” which is a thing most salutary to me."
2. "He who depends for help on the prayers of the saints relies on the promise of God."
3. "The supply of the Spirit is the efficient cause, while prayer is a subordinate help."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For I know that this shall turn to my salvation."
2. "He will make the opposition an occasion for more fervency of spirit and purity of motive on his own part."
3. "This was the only true relief in his trouble, more of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. So will his own work in preaching Christâ€™s Gospel be purified and made effective."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Will turn... To my salvation." 
2. "Can it be that Paul carried both conceptions in the word here?" 
3. "Supply... To furnish supply for the chorus."

### John Gill:
1. "He knew that by the power and grace of God it should be made useful to the conversion, and for the salvation of many souls; and this was a matter of rejoicing to him."
2. "He knew that every reproach, indignity, and suffering he endured, did but increase his fame and his honor, and make his name the more illustrious among the saints."
3. "The supply of the Spirit is a supply of gifts from Christ, fitting and qualifying men for his service, and which are ministered by the Spirit to them severally as he will; and a supply of grace out of the fullness of Christ."

### John Wesley:

Through your prayer â€” Obtaining for me a larger supply of the Spirit.
