# Philippians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For me, to live is Christ, and all my life, energy, and time are His. Whatever life may be to others, for me, it is solely about Christ. Not only do I live for Christ, but I also see the state after death as gain, not the act of dying itself. Even if my enemies were to cause my death, it would be no shame to me but a gain because it would be a further glorification of Christ. So, I face death with independence and calm courage, knowing that it is a positive gain for me.
