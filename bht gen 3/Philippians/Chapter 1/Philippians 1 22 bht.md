# Philippians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If living after the flesh, if this is the fruit of my labor, then what I shall choose I do not declare. It is not for me to express a choice. If this is the fruit of my work, then I cannot determine with myself, if the choice were given me, both alternatives being great goods alike. If I live in the flesh, this is worth my while, for thus Christ's interest will be advanced. I am at a loss as to what I should choose if it were left to my choice.

- Attempt 1 BHT: If the continuation of my life in the physical body is the result of my apostolic work, then I cannot determine whether I would choose to continue living or to die. On one hand, living in the flesh would allow me to further advance the interests of Christ and continue to bear fruit in my ministry. On the other hand, dying would mean departing from this world of toil and entering into a realm of rest and gain. I am at a loss as to which choice I should make, as both options hold their own significance and value.
