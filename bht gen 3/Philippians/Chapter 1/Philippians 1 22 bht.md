# Philippians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If continuing to live in the flesh is the fruit of my work, then I am uncertain about what I would choose for myself. If living in the flesh means that Christ's interest will be advanced through my life, then it is worth my while. On the other hand, if I am to live any longer in the body and be continued for some time in this world, it would allow me to labor more. Long life in this context is indeed a blessing, for the ministry is a work, a laborious one.

- Attempt 1 BHT: If continuing to live in the flesh is the fruit of my work, then I am uncertain about what I would choose for myself. If living in the flesh means that Christ's interest will be advanced through my life, then it is worth my while. On the other hand, the alternative of dying is also taken into consideration, as Paul acknowledges the possibility of being offered up. Ultimately, he wavers in making a decision, stating that he does not know what he would choose if given the opportunity. It is evident that the connection between the fruit of his labor and the outcome is of utmost importance to Paul.
