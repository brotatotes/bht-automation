## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (the contrast is to the decision involved in the word 'know') I am perplexed (literally, held in, kept back from decision, which would be a setting at liberty) by (from the direction of,‚Äîkept in on both sides) the two." 
2. "(the A.V., 'having a desire to,' entirely misses the delicate sense) departing (from this world‚Äîused on account of the 'being with Christ' which follows), and being with Christ."
3. "This place,' says Calvin, 'suffices to refute their folly, who dream that our souls sleep when separated from our bodies: for Paul openly declares that we enjoy Christ's presence when we are dissolved in death.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "having the desire for departing (literally, 'to loose anchor,' 2 Timothy 4:6) and being with Christ; FOR (so the oldest manuscripts) it is by far better"
2. "This refutes the notion of the soul being dormant during its separation from the body."
3. "To depart is better than to remain in the flesh; to be with Christ is far, far better; a New Testament hope."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle represents himself as in a similar condition. His strong affection for them bound his heart to them - as an anchor holds a ship to its moorings and yet there was a heavenly influence bearing upon him - like the gale upon the vessel - which would bear him away to heaven."
2. "To be with Christ is synonymous with being in heaven - for Christ is in heaven, and is its glory."
3. "A mere willingness to die, or even a desire to die, is no certain evidence of preparation for death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The picture is that of a man pressed on both sides. Lit. I am held together, so that I cannot incline either way." 
2. "The pressure comes from both sides." 
3. "Paul's metaphor here is the military one, to break camp."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul does not reckon that he has any other advantage from living than the welfare of the brethren."
2. "Paul now says is this; 'I desire to die, because I will, by this means, come into immediate connection with Christ.'"
3. "Paul openly declares that we enjoy Christ‚Äôs presence on being set free from the body."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I am in a strait betwixt the two. The verb is one which the LXX. use (Job 36:8) of ‚Äòthose who are holden in cords of affliction,‚Äô and the apostle describes himself as thus holden and constrained."
2. "He views the world as a place of temporary sojourn, not as a home, and so he uses to describe his departure a significant term which implies that he will be like one who has only been detained here."
3. "He cannot forget the greatness of the gain, though his love for the salvation of men may reconcile him to forego it. So, in this further allusion to life with Christ, he intensifies his language by a doubly expressed comparative."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am in a strait (œÉœÖŒΩŒµœáŒøŒºŒ±). 'I am held together.'"
2. "Betwixt the two (ŒµŒ∫ œÑœâŒΩ Œ¥œÖŒø). 'From the two (sides).' Pressure to live on, pressure to die and be with Christ."
3. "Very far better (œÄŒøŒªŒªœâ ŒºŒ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒµŒπœÉœÉŒøŒΩ). Double comparative (triple Lightfoot calls it because of œÄŒøŒªŒªœâ) like Isocrates and the Koine often."

### John Gill:
1. "Death is desired for some other end; wicked men desire it, and desire others to put an end to their lives, or do it themselves to free them from some trouble they are in; or because they are not able to support under a disappointment of what their ambition or lust have prompted them to."
2. "Good men desire death... that they may be rid of sin, which so much dishonours God as well as distresses themselves; and that they may be clothed upon with the shining robes of immortality and glory."
3. "To depart and be with Christ is better than to live in the flesh in this sinful world, in the midst of a variety of sorrows and troubles, and in which communion with Christ is but now and then enjoyed."

### John Wesley:
1. To depart ‚Äî Out of bonds, flesh, the world.
And to be with Christ ‚Äî In a nearer and fuller union. It is better to depart; it is far better to be with Christ.
