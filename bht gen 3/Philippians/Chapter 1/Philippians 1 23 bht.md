## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (the contrast is to the decision involved in the word 'know') I am perplexed...having my desire towards...departing...and being with Christ." 
2. "(Paul openly declares that we enjoy Christ‚Äôs presence when we are dissolved in death.)"
3. "For it is by far better."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I know not (:-), BUT am in a strait (am perplexed) betwixt the two (namely, 'to live' and 'to die'), having the desire for departing and being with Christ; FOR it is by far better."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I earnestly long to be with Christ; and I desire to remain to be useful to the world."
2. "It was not because he had been disappointed about wealth and honor - for he had sought neither. It was not because he had not been successful - for no man had been more so."
3. "To be with Christ is synonymous with being in heaven - for Christ is in heaven, and is its glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I am in a strait betwixt two [œÉœÖŒΩŒµœáŒøŒºŒ±Œπ ŒµŒ∫ œÑœâŒΩ Œ¥œÖŒø]. The picture is that of a man pressed on both sides. Lit. I am held together, so that I cannot incline either way."
2. "To depart [Œ±ŒΩŒ±ŒªœÖœÉŒ±Œπ]. The verb means originally to unloose, undo again. So of Penelope's web: 'During the night she undid it'. Paul's metaphor here is the military one, to break camp."
3. "To be with Christ. Compare 2 Corinthians 5:6, 2 Corinthians 5:8; Acts 7:59; 1 Thessalonians 4:14, 1 Thessalonians 4:17."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is nothing said here as to earthly advantages, but as to spiritual benefit, which is on good grounds supremely desirable in the view of the pious."
2. "For death of itself will never be desired, because such a desire is at variance with natural feeling, but is desired for some particular reason, or with a view to some other end."
3. "Paul here reminds us, that death is the separation of the soul from the body. And this he expresses more fully immediately afterward, explaining as to what condition awaits believers after death ‚Äî that of dwelling with Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostle describes himself as thus holden and constrained of (i.e., by) the two things, death or the continuance of life that his work may bear its fruit." 
2. "He views the world as a place of temporary sojourn, not as a home, and so he uses to describe his departure a significant term which implies that he will be like one who has only been detained here."
3. "He intensifies his language by a doubly expressed comparative."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am in a strait (œÉœÖŒΩŒµœáŒøŒºŒ±). 'I am held together.'"
2. "Betwixt the two (ŒµŒ∫ œÑœâŒΩ Œ¥œÖŒø). 'From the two (sides).' Pressure to live on, pressure to die and be with Christ."
3. "Very far better (œÄŒøŒªŒªœâ ŒºŒ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒµŒπœÉœÉŒøŒΩ). Double comparative (triple Lightfoot calls it because of œÄŒøŒªŒªœâ) like Isocrates and the Koine often."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle desires to depart and be with Christ, for the only happy being after death is with him."
2. "If souls are not with Christ, they are with devils and damned spirits, in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone."
3. "To depart and be with Christ is better than to live in the flesh in this sinful world, in the midst of a variety of sorrows and troubles, and in which communion with Christ is but now and then enjoyed."

### John Wesley:
1. To depart ‚Äî Out of bonds, flesh, the world.
And to be with Christ ‚Äî In a nearer and fuller union. It is better to depart; it is far better to be with Christ.
