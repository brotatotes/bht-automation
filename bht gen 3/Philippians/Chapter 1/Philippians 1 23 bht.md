# Philippians 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I am held together in a strait between the desire to depart and be with Christ, for it is far better. This refutes the notion of the soul being dormant during its separation from the body, affirming that we enjoy Christ's presence when we are dissolved in death. To depart is better than to remain in the flesh, and to be with Christ is far, far better. Paul, like a soldier breaking camp, longs for that moment of departure, longing for the perfectional life eternal in the presence of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I am perplexed by the two, having my desire towards departing, and being with Christ.".
2. "This place suffices to refute their folly, who dream that our souls sleep when separated from our bodies: for Paul openly declares that we enjoy Christ‚Äôs presence when we are dissolved in death.".
3. "For it is by far better.".

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I know not ( :-), BUT am in a
	strait (am perplexed) betwixt the two (namely, 'to live' and
	'to die'), having the desire for departing (literally, 'to
	loose anchor,' 2 Timothy 4:6) and
	being with Christ; FOR (so
	the oldest manuscripts) it is by far better" - This refutes the notion of the soul being dormant
	during its separation from the body.
2. "To depart is better than to remain in the flesh; to be with Christ is far,
	far better" - It also shows that, while he
	regarded the Lord's advent as at all times near, yet that his death
	before it was a very possible contingency.
3. "The partial life eternal is in the interval between death and Christ's second advent;
	the perfectional, at that advent" - To be with Christ is a New Testament hope.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The words of the original are very emphatic. They appear to be derived from a ship when lying at anchor, and when violent winds blow upon it that would drive it out to sea. The apostle represents himself as in a similar condition."
2. "Paul believed that the soul of the Christian would be immediately with the Saviour at death. It was evidently his expectation that he would at once pass to his presence."
3. "The soul of the believer is made happy at death. To be with Christ is synonymous with being in heaven - for Christ is in heaven, and is its glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lit. I am held together, so that I cannot incline either way." 
2. "Paul's metaphor here is the military one, to break camp." 
3. "Which is far better [œÄŒøŒªŒªœâ ŒºŒ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒµŒπœÉœÉŒøŒΩ] . Lit., much more better."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is nothing said here as to earthly advantages, but as to spiritual benefit, which is on good grounds supremely desirable in the view of the pious."
2. "I desire to die, because I will, by this means, come into immediate connection with Christ."
3. "We enjoy Christ‚Äôs presence on being set free from the body."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostle describes himself as...holden and constrained of (i.e., by) the two things, death or the continuance of life that his work may bear its fruit."
2. "He views the world as a place of temporary sojourn, not as a home...he looked forward to the presence with Christ at the moment of his departure."
3. "He cannot forget the greatness of the gain, though his love for the salvation of men may reconcile him to forego it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am held together."
2. "I am hemmed in on both sides."
3. "To depart...to break up, to return...to depart...Very far better."

### John Gill:
1. "Death is desired for some other end; wicked men desire it, and desire others to put an end to their lives, or do it themselves to free them from some trouble they are in."
2. "Good men desire death, though always when right, with a submission to the will of God, that they may be rid of sin, which so much dishonours God as well as distresses themselves; and that they may be clothed upon with the shining robes of immortality and glory."
3. "To depart and be with Christ is better than to live in the flesh in this sinful world, in the midst of a variety of sorrows and troubles, and in which communion with Christ is but now and then enjoyed."

### John Wesley:
1. To depart ‚Äî Out of bonds, flesh, the world.
And to be with Christ ‚Äî In a nearer and fuller union. It is better to depart; it is far better to be with Christ.
