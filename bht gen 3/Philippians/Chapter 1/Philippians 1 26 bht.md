# Philippians 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May our rejoicing and boasting in Christ Jesus abound greatly, for it is through His presence among us that we possess the Gospel, which increases and assures our matter of glorying. In this case, it is Paul, as the worker of this material, who is the cause of our Christian joy. Though we would rejoice even more if he were to return to us, our rejoicing is ultimately in Christ and in what the Lord has done, for it is His grace that has been bestowed upon us.
