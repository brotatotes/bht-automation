# Philippians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To worship 'in the name of Jesus' is to worship Jesus Himself. The exaltation of Jesus is so great that it calls for every knee to bow and every tongue to confess that He is Lord. Even the demons and the lost will give homage to Jesus, though it may be out of fear, not love. This universal worship of Jesus is seen throughout the Bible, including in Romans 8:22, Ephesians 1:20-22, and Revelation 5:13. Therefore, all prayer should be made in the name of Jesus, acknowledging His majesty and power.
