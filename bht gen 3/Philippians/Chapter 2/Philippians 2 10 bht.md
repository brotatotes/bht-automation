## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That in the name of Jesus every knee should bend, i.e. all prayer should be made to JESUS, or to GOD THROUGH HIM?"
2. "The only way to answer this question is to regard the general aim of the passage. This undoubtedly is, the exaltation of Jesus."
3. "And this view is confirmed by the next clause, where every tongue is to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, when we remember the common expression, 'to call upon the name of the Lord,' for prayer."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To worship 'in the name of Jesus,' is to worship Jesus Himself."
2. "The demons and the lost may be included indirectly, as even they give homage, though one of fear, not love, to Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The knee should bow, or bend, in token of honor, or worship; that is, all people should adore him."
2. "The meaning here is, not that a special act of respect or adoration should be shown wherever the name 'Jesus' occurs in reading the Scriptures, or whenever it is mentioned, but that he was so exalted that it would be proper that all in heaven and on earth should worship him."
3. "The fallen and the lost will do this; for they will be constrained to yield an unwilling homage to him by submitting to the sentence from his lips that shall consign them to woe; and thus the whole universe shall acknowledge the exalted dignity of the Son of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The salutation is not at the name of Jesus, as by bowing when the name is uttered, but...the holy element as it were, in which every prayer is to be offered and every knee to bow."

3. "Paul's treatment of the creation collectively in Romans 8:19-22, and with the Old - Testament passages, in which all nature is represented as praising God."

### John Calvin:
1. "God is to be worshipped, not merely with the inward affection of the heart, but also by outward profession, if we would render to him what is his due."
2. "For he did not abase himself either as to his humanity alone, or as to his divinity alone, but inasmuch as, clothed in our flesh, he concealed himself under its infirmity."
3. "Since Paul represents all things from heaven to hell as subject to Christ, Papists trifle childishly when they draw purgatory from his words."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus is henceforth to be the glory, the way, the confidence, and the adoration of His people."
2. "Thus to Christ does the Father assign the worship which He solemnly under the old covenant claimed as specially His own."
3. "That they were made conscious of the redemption wrought by Christ is to be inferred from many parts of the New Testament, and from such passages is drawn the teaching concerning Christâ€™s descent into Hades after His death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not perfunctory genuflections whenever the name of Jesus is mentioned, but universal acknowledgment of the majesty and power of Jesus who carries his human name and nature to heaven." 
2. "This universal homage to Jesus is seen in Romans 8:22; Ephesians 1:20-22 and in particular Revelation 5:13." 
3. "Here only in the N.T."

### John Gill:

2. "Some really and heartily trust in his name, are baptized in his name, and ascribe honour, and glory, and blessing to him from their whole hearts; and others feignedly, and whether they will or not, are subject to him, and sooner or later shall acknowledge his authority over them."
3. "And he shall be owned to be Lord of [things] in heaven: the angels there, and the souls of departed saints, with those who are already clothed with their bodies; and [things] in earth; both good men, and bad men; and [things] under the earth; or 'in the abyss', as the Ethiopic version renders it; meaning either the devils in the bottomless pit; or rather the dead bodies of men in the grave, which shall come forth and stand before the judgment seat of Christ."
