# Philippians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our salvation is a work that requires both God's work in us and our own active participation. We must carry out our salvation to its full perfection, working it out with fear and trembling. This involves self-distrust, tenderness of conscience, and vigilance against temptation. We must not rest in the means of grace or hope for salvation without effort. Rather, we are called to be diligent in our obedience, both in the presence of others and when no one is watching. Let us work out our own salvation, knowing that God's work and our own work go hand in hand.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The more obedient answers to 'becoming obedient,' ver. 8, and salvation to the exaltation of Christ." 
2. "Carry out your own salvation...which is begun with justification by faith, but must be carried out, brought to an issue, by sanctification of the Spiritâ€”a life of holy obedience and advance to Christian perfection."
3. "Considering the immense sacrifice which Christ made for you, and the lofty eminence to which God hath now raised Him, be ye more than ever earnest that you miss not your own share in such salvation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Work outâ€”carry out to its full perfection. 'Salvation' is 'worked in' believers by the Spirit, who enables them through faith to be justified once for all; but it needs, as a progressive work, to be 'worked out' by obedience, through the help of the same Spirit, unto perfection."
2. "The sound Christian neither, like the formalist, rests in the means, without looking to the end, and to the Holy Spirit who alone can make the means effectual; nor, like the fanatic, hopes to attain the end without the means."
3. "See that, as 'servants' to God, after the example of Christ, ye be so 'with the fear and trembling' which becomes servantsâ€”not slavish fear, but trembling anxiety not to fall short of the goal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is a duty to make a personal effort to secure salvation, or to work out our salvation: (1) Because God commands it."
2. "It is a duty because it is our own personal interest that is at stake. No one else has, or can have, as much interest in our salvation as we have."
3. "Our earthly friends cannot save us. No effort of theirs can deliver us from eternal death without our own exertion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The work of your salvation is not completed in God's work in you. God's work must be carried out by yourselves."
2. "Just because God worketh in him, as the evidence and triumph of it, the true child of God works out his own salvation - works it out having really received it - not as a light thing, a superfluous labor, but with fear and trembling as a reasonable and indispensable service."
3. "This fear is self-distrust; it is tenderness of conscience; it is vigilance against temptation; it is the fear which inspiration opposes to high-mindedness... It is the caution and circumspection which timidly shrinks from whatever would offend and dishonor God and the Savior."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is the only befitting way in which the mind of man may learn gentleness, when one who, while viewing himself apart, pleased himself in his hiding-places, comes to examine himself as compared with God."
2. "He admonishes them not to shew themselves obedient in his presence merely, but also, and even much more, in his absence."
3. "Now the source of humility is this â€” acknowledging how miserable we are, and devoid of all good."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. The apostle has in his thought for a moment the influence which perhaps his own presence or absence may exert on the congregation at Philippi. He would have them learn to be independent of him, and so he says, Work out your own salvation, and adds, because he knows the many dangers and temptations which will beset them, with fear and trembling, that he may impress on them the need for watchfulness and constant anxiety in this work." 
2. "And he employs a verb expressive of complete and perfect accomplishment, that they may feel at now great results they are to aim."
3. "But in a moment, lest there should be any misapprehension of his meaning, and the Philippians should place trust in themselves, he adds a corrective."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They are not to render eye-service only when Paul is there, but much more when he is away."
2. "This exhortation assumes human free agency in the carrying on the work of one's salvation."
3. "Paul has no sympathy with a cold and dead orthodoxy or formalism that knows nothing of struggle and growth."

### John Gill:
1. "It becomes those who profess to be [Christ's] followers, to do all their affairs as men and Christians, with, and among one another, in all lowliness of mind."
2. "[The saints] were always abounding in the works of the Lord, doing his will; they abode by Christ, and continued steadfastly in his doctrines, and kept the ordinances as they were delivered to them, and walked in all the commandments of the Lord blameless."
3. "Do all [the work and business of your lives] with fear and trembling"; not with a slavish fear of hell and damnation, but with modesty and humility, ascribing it wholly to the grace of God.

### John Wesley:
1. "As ye have always obeyed â€” Both God, and me his minister."
2. "Now in my absence â€” When ye have not me to instruct, assist, and direct you."
3. "With fear and trembling â€” With the utmost care and diligence."
