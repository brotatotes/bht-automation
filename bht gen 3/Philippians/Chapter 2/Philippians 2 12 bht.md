## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The more obedient answers to 'becoming obedient,' ver. 8, and salvation to the exaltation of Christ." 
2. "carry out (bring to an accomplishment) your own salvation (which is begun with justification by faith, but must be carried out, brought to an issue, by sanctification of the Spiritâ€”a life of holy obedience and advance to Christian perfection)." 
3. "considering the immense sacrifice which Christ made for you, and the lofty eminence to which God hath now raised Him, be ye more than ever earnest that you miss not your own share in such salvation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Salvation" is "worked in" believers by the Spirit, who enables them through faith to be justified once for all; but it needs, as a progressive work, to be "worked out" by obedience, through the help of the same Spirit, unto perfection.
2. Now that I am not present to further the work of your salvation, "work out your own salvation" yourselves the more carefully.
3. "Servants" to God, after the example of Christ, should be obedient "with the fear and trembling" which becomes servants - not slavish fear, but trembling anxiety not to fall short of the goal.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is a duty to make a personal effort to secure salvation, or to work out our salvation."
2. "No person has a right either to throw away his life or his soul."
3. "No effort of [earthly] friends can deliver us from eternal death without our own exertion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The work of your salvation is not completed in God's work in you. God's work must be carried out by yourselves."
2. "Just because God worketh in him, as the evidence and triumph of it, the true child of God works out his own salvation."
3. "Fear and trembling. Compare 2 Corinthians 7:15; Ephesians 6:5. Not slavish terror, but wholesome, serious caution."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is the only befitting way in which the mind of man may learn gentleness, when one who, while viewing himself apart, pleased himself in his hiding-places, comes to examine himself as compared with God." 
2. "Now, therefore, when their monitor is at a distance from them, there is need that they should stir up themselves." 
3. "The source of humility is this â€” acknowledging how miserable we are, and devoid of all good."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their earlier zeal he had been witness of; he now begs that he may not find that his presence among them was necessary to sustain that zeal, but that they will prove it to have been of a true nature, a zeal for Christ, by their efforts while he is away from them." 
2. "This would be the surest evidence, if the earnestness increased instead of abating when the apostle was absent."
3. "Work out your own salvation, and adds, because he knows the many dangers and temptations which will beset them, with fear and trembling, that he may impress on them the need for watchfulness and constant anxiety in this work."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not as in my presence only... but much more when he is away."
2. "This exhortation assumes human free agency in the carrying on the work of one's salvation."
3. "Paul has no sympathy with a cold and dead orthodoxy or formalism that knows nothing of struggle and growth."

### John Gill:
1. "Do all that 'with fear and trembling'; not with a slavish fear of hell and damnation, or lest they should fall away, or finally miscarry of heaven and happiness; since this would be a distrust of the power and faithfulness of God, and so criminal in them; nor is it reasonable to suppose, that the apostle would exhort to such a fear, when he himself was so confidently assured, that the good work begun in them would be performed."
2. "This fear and trembling spoken of, is such as is consistent with the highest acts of faith, trust, confidence, and joy, and is opposed to pride and vain glory; see Psalms 2:11; and intends modesty and humility, which is what the apostle is pressing for throughout the whole context."
3. "The apostle urges to a cheerful and constant obedience to Christ, with all humility of soul, without dependence on it, or vain glorying in it, but ascribing it wholly to the grace of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Work out your own salvation â€” Herein let every man aim at his own things."
2. "With fear and trembling â€” With the utmost care and diligence."
3. "Having proposed Christ's example, he exhorts them to secure the salvation which Christ has purchased."
