# Philippians 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is the ultimate source of our will and power to do good. He not only brings about the will, but actually creates the will within us through His indwelling Spirit. We are both entirely active and entirely passive in this process â€“ we act, but only because God has produced the action. The fact that God is the energizer of the universe means that He empowers us to work out our own salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This working must not be explained away, with Pelagius, into 'a mere persuasion and encouraging by promises:' it is an efficacious working which is here spoken of."
2. "God not only brings about the will, but creates the willâ€”we owe both the will to do good, and the power, to His indwelling Spirit."
3. "For [the sake of] His good pleasure,â€”i. e. in order to carry out that good counsel of His will which He hath purposed towards you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The will, and the power to work, being first instalments of His grace, encourage us to make full proof of, and carry out to the end, the 'salvation' which He has first 'worked,' and is still 'working in' us, enabling us to 'work it out.'" 
2. "Man is, in different senses, entirely active, and entirely passive: God producing all, and we acting all. What He produced is our own acts."
3. "God makes a new heart, and we are commanded to make us a new heart; not merely because we must use the means in order to the effect, but the effect itself is our act and our duty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not God who acts for us. He leads us to 'will and to do.' It is not said that he wills and does for us, and it cannot be. It is man that 'wills and does' - though God so influences him that he does it."
2. "He does not compel or force us against our will. He leads us to will as well as to do. The will cannot be forced; and the meaning here must be that God exerts such an influence as to make us willing to obey Him."
3. "The fact that God works is an encouragement for us to work... What encouragement of a higher order can man ask? And what farmer is afraid of the agency of God in the case, or supposes that the fact that God exerts an agency is a reason why he should not plow and plant his field, or set out his orchard?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In you, not among you. Worketh...to be at work. In the middle voice, as here, to display one's activity; show one's self-operative."
2. "Both are from God, and are of one piece, so that he who wills inevitably does. The willing which is wrought by God, by its own nature and pressure, works out into action."
3. "For His good pleasure. Lit., for the sake of; in order to subserve."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is the true engine for bringing down all haughtiness â€” this the sword for putting an end to all pride, when we are taught that we are utterly nothing, and can do nothing, except through the grace of God alone."
2. "What more remains to us as a ground of glorying? Nor is there any reason to doubt that this division has the same force as if Paul had expressed the whole in a single word; for the inclination is the groundwork; the accomplishment of it is the summit of the building brought to a completion."
3. "Confidence in ourselves produces carelessness and arrogance. We know from experience, that all who confide in their own strength, grow insolent through presumption, and at the same time, devoid of care, resign themselves to sleep. The remedy for both evils is, when, distrusting ourselves, we depend entirely on God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first movement comes from God. He bestows His quickening gift, and then you may improve what He has given by your earnest labour."
2. "Even the wish to serve God comes from Himself, is roused first by Him in the heart of man; and when He has so awakened the mind, He bestows the energy, the working power, so that the wish may have its fulfilment."
3. "And Godâ€™s graces are bestowed because He willeth not the death of a sinner, but that all men should come to salvation. This is His good pleasure, and for the sake of its achievement, He is thus large in His bounty to menâ€™s souls."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God is the Energy and the Energizer of the universe."
2. "God does it all, then. Yes, but he puts us to work also and our part is essential."
3. "Whitney puts 'the will of God' behind gravitation and all the laws of nature."

### John Gill:
1. "all we have, and do, is from God"
2. "Men have no will naturally to come to Christ, or to have him to reign over them; they have no desire, nor hungerings and thirstings after his righteousness and salvation; wherever there are any such inclinations and desires, they are wrought in men by God."
3. "God therefore both implants in them principles of action to work from, as faith and love, and a regard for his glory, and gives them grace and strength to work with, without which they can do nothing, but having these, can do all things."

### John Wesley:
1. "That worketh in you according to his good pleasure â€” Not for any merit of yours. Yet his influences are not to supersede, but to encourage, our own efforts."
2. "Work out your own salvation â€” Here is our duty."
3. "For it is God that worketh in you â€” Here is our encouragement. And O, what a glorious encouragement, to have the arm of Omnipotence stretched out for our support and our succour!"

- Attempt 1 BHT: God is the ultimate source of our will and power to do good. He not only brings about the will, but actually creates the will within us through His indwelling Spirit. We are both entirely active and entirely passive in this process â€“ we act, but only because God has produced the action. The fact that God is the energizer of the universe means that He empowers us to work out our own salvation. His grace enables us to make full proof of the salvation that He has already worked in us. We are called to be active participants, using the means He has given us, while recognizing that without His influence, we would be incapable of any good work. So let us rely on God's empowering presence, trusting in His good pleasure, and working diligently in response to His grace.
