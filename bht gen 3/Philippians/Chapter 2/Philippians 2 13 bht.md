# Philippians 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's indwelling Spirit aids us in fulfilling His commands, working in us to create both the will and the power to do good. He is the Energy and Energizer of the universe, yet He does not compel us against our will. Rather, He exerts such an influence as to make us willing to obey Him. Our work begins with His movement in our hearts, and even the desire to serve God is first roused by Him. We must depend entirely on God, as all we have and do is from Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Encouragement to fulfil the last exhortationâ€”for you are not left to yourselves, but have the almighty Spirit dwelling in you to aid you."
2. "This working must not be explained away, with Pelagius, into 'a mere persuasion and encouraging by promises:' it is an efficacious working which is here spoken of: God not only brings about the will, but creates the will."
3. "We owe both the will to do good, and the power, to His indwelling Spirit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not that God does some, and we the rest. God does all, and we do all. God is the only proper author, we the only proper actors. Thus the same things in Scripture are represented as from God, and from us."
2. "We cannot of ourselves embrace the Gospel of grace: 'the will' comes solely of God's gift to whom He will; so also the power 'to do,' that is, effectual perseverance to the end, is wholly of God's gift."
3. "For His good pleasure'; in order to carry out His sovereign gracious purpose towards you."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He does not compel or force us against our will. He leads us to will as well as to do. The will cannot be forced; and the meaning here must be that God exerts such an influence as to make us willing to obey Him." 
2. "It must mean merely that he exerts such an influence as to secure this result."
3. "When a man is about to set out a peach or an apple tree, it is an encouragement for him to reflect that the agency of God is around him, and that he can cause the tree to produce blossoms, and leaves, and fruit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In you, not among you. Worketh. The verb means effectual working. In the active voice, to be at work."
2. "To will and to do. Both are from God, and are of one piece, so that he who wills inevitably does. The willing which is wrought by God, by its own nature and pressure, works out into action."
3. "Of His good pleasure. Lit., for the sake of; in order to subserve."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is the true engine for bringing down all haughtiness â€” this the sword for putting an end to all pride, when we are taught that we are utterly nothing, and can do nothing, except through the grace of God alone."
2. "He brings, therefore, to perfection those pious dispositions which he has implanted in us, that they may not be unproductive... From this we infer that perseverance, also, is his free gift."
3. "Confidence in ourselves produces carelessness and arrogance... The remedy for both evils is, when, distrusting ourselves, we depend entirely on God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thus only can your work have a beginning. The first movement comes from God."
2. "Even the wish to serve God comes from Himself, is roused first by Him in the heart of man."
3. "And Godâ€™s graces are bestowed because He willeth not the death of a sinner, but that all men should come to salvation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God is the Energy and the Energizer of the universe."
2. "Yes, but he puts us to work also and our part is essential."
3. "So Whitney puts 'the will of God' behind gravitation and all the laws of nature."

### John Gill:
1. "All we have, and do, is from God."
2. "Men have no will naturally to come to Christ, or to have him reign over them; wherever there are any such inclinations and desires, they are wrought in men by God."
3. "God both implants in them principles of action to work from, as faith and love, and a regard for his glory, and gives them grace and strength to work with, without which they can do nothing, but having these, can do all things."

### John Wesley:
1. "For it is God that worketh in you according to his good pleasure â€” Not for any merit of yours. Yet his influences are not to supersede, but to encourage, our own efforts."
2. "Work out your own salvation â€” Here is our duty."
3. "And O, what a glorious encouragement, to have the arm of Omnipotence stretched out for our support and our succour!"
