## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I trustâ€”Yet my death is by no means certain; yea, 'I hope (Greek) in the Lord (that is, by the Lord's help)' unto youâ€”literally, 'for you,' that is, to your satisfaction, not merely motion, to you."
2. "I alsoâ€”that not only you 'may be of good courage' (so Greek) on hearing of me (Philippians 2:23), but 'I also, when I know your state'."
3. "From Philippians 2:19-30, it appears Epaphroditus was to set out at once to allay the anxiety of the Philippians on his account, and at the same time bearing the Epistle; Timothy was to follow after the apostle's liberation was decided, when they could arrange their plans more definitely as to where Timothy should, on his return with tidings from Philippi, meet Paul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But I trust in the Lord Jesus - His hope was that the Lord Jesus would so order affairs as to permit this - an expression that no man could use who did not regard the Lord Jesus as on the throne, and as more than human."
2. "The narrative in the Acts, however, as Dr. Paley has remarked, is such as to render this altogether probable, and the manner in which the fact is adverted to here is such as would have occurred to no one forging an epistle like this, and shows that the Acts of the Apostles and the epistle are independent books, and are not the work of imposture."
3. "When I know your state - It was a considerable time since Epaphroditus had left the Philippians, and since, therefore, Paul had been informed of their condition."

### John Calvin:
1. "There will one come very shortly, who will set himself in opposition to the contrivances of our enemies."
2. "We must take notice of the condition - in respect of which he submits himself to the providence of God, forming no purpose, but with that leading the way."
3. "He declares his affection towards them, inasmuch as he was so much concerned as to their dangers, that he was not at ease until he received accounts of their prosperity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the Lord Jesus' is equivalent to 'through the Lord Jesus,' It was to Jesus he looked in all his need."
2. "The comfort which the apostle seeks is that encouragement which would be drawn from a knowledge that the Philippians remained steadfast in the faith."
3. "We cannot be far wrong, in view of these various events, if we place the date of the Epistle in the latter of the two years."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That I also may be of good comfort."
2. "In papyri and ÎµÏ…ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Îµ (be of good cheer) common in sepulchral inscriptions."
3. "When I know."

### John Gill:
1. "But I trust in the Lord Jesus,.... Or 'hope'; not in himself, his wisdom, will, resolutions, and purposes... but in the Lord Jesus."
2. "He hoped to send him to them 'shortly', in a very little time; this he said in order to encourage them, and thereby suggesting, that he thought his own deliverance was at hand."
3. "The comfort and pleasure of Gospel ministers lie in the good of the churches of Christ; it puts them in good heart and soul, as the word here used signifies, when they hear of their steadfastness in the faith of Christ, of their love to one another, and all the saints, and of their patience under sufferings."

### John Wesley:
1. When I know â€” Upon my return, that ye stand steadfast.
