### John Calvin:
1. "He was kept shut up in prison, and bound with chains; he was reckoned worthy of capital punishment ‚Äî before his view were tortures ‚Äî near at hand was the executioner; yet all these things do not prevent his experiencing unmingled joy, provided he sees that the Churches are in a good condition."
2. "The sum is this ‚Äî that they be joined together in views and inclinations. For he makes mention of agreement in doctrine and mutual love; and afterwards, repeating the same thing, (in my opinion,) he exhorts them to be of one mind, and to have the same views."
3. "The expression œÑ·Ω∏ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ω∏, (the same thing,) implies that they must accommodate themselves to each other. Hence the beginning of love is harmony of views, but that is not sufficient, unless men‚Äôs hearts are at the same time joined together in mutual affection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is reported to him some want among them of unity of spirit, and the apostle‚Äôs joy will not be complete till this is attained."
2. "An expression indicative of most complete unity, the high ideal after which the Christian must strive, and which Christ invokes in His prayer ‚Äòthat they all may be one.‚Äô"

1. "Paul's cup of joy will be full if the Philippians will only keep on having unity of thought and feeling."
2. "Being of one accord... harmonious in soul, souls that beat together, in tune with Christ and with each other."
3. "Like clocks that strike at the same moment. Perfect intellectual telepathy. Identity of ideas and harmony of feelings."

### John Gill:
1. "that ye be likeminded, or 'equally affected to one another'; that since they were but as one man, were one body, and had but one head, and one Spirit, that quickened and comforted them, and had but one faith and one baptism, they ought to be one in affection, practice, and judgment."
2. "having the same love; both for quality, being hearty, sincere, and unfeigned; and for quantity, returning the same that is measured to them; and with respect to objects, loving the same Christ, the same doctrines of Christ, the same ministers of the Gospel, and all the saints, rich and poor, high and low, weak or strong believers, without making any difference, by which means unity is preserved."
3. "of one accord, or 'being alike in soul'; having the same soul, not in substance and number, as some philosophers have asserted, but having the same affection, judgment, and will, as the first Christians are said to be of one heart and of one soul; or 'unanimous' in their sentiments about doctrines and ordinances, being all of a piece in their practices; and agreeing in all their counsels, debates, acts, and votes, in their church meetings."

### John Wesley:
1. "Think the same thing ‚Äî Seeing Christ is your common Head."
2. "Having the same love ‚Äî To God, your common Father."
3. "Being of one soul ‚Äî Animated with the same affections and tempers, as ye have all drank ill to one spirit."
