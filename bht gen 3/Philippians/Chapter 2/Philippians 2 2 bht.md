# Philippians 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's joy will be complete if the Philippians can have perfect unity, being of one mind and thinking the same thing. This unity entails having the same love, being equally disposed to love and be loved, and being of one accord with united souls. With such harmony, their souls will beat together and be in tune with Christ and each other. Paul longs for the Philippians to strive for this highest Christian grace of complete unity in sentiment, opinion, and plan, which Christ Himself desired for His followers.

1. "He was kept shut up in prison, and bound with chains; he was reckoned worthy of capital punishment ‚Äî before his view were tortures ‚Äî near at hand was the executioner; yet all these things do not prevent his experiencing unmingled joy, provided he sees that the Churches are in a good condition."
2. "The sum is this ‚Äî that they be joined together in views and inclinations. For he makes mention of agreement in doctrine and mutual love...

3. "The expression œÑ·Ω∏ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ω∏, (the same thing,) implies that they must accommodate themselves to each other. Hence the beginning of love is harmony of views, but that is not sufficient, unless men‚Äôs hearts are at the same time joined together in mutual affection."
