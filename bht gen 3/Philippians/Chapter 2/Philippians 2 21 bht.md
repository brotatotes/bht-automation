# Philippians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. It is not a hyperbole to say they all seek their own matters, with only a few sacrificing ease, fame, and gain for the Lord's cause. Most help when it aligns with their own gain. This likely refers to all except Timothy, who sacrificed for the cause. How many of us are like Timothy, willing to leave behind our business and homes for the sake of Christ? Examine your heart - do you seek the things of Jesus or your own gain?
