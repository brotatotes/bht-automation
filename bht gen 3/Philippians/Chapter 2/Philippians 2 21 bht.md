# Philippians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

It is remarkable how few Christians are willing to leave behind their comforts and personal ambitions in order to promote the cause of Christ. While there may be some genuine believers among them, they are often not as self-sacrificing as Timothy. The majority seek their own matters rather than the things of Jesus Christ. True dedication to the Lord's cause requires a willingness to put aside personal gain and prioritize the advancement of His kingdom above all else.

- Attempt 4 BHT: Many people today are focused on their own personal matters, their own comfort and gain, rather than the things that pertain to Jesus Christ. This is not a new phenomenon; even in Paul's time, there were few who were truly self-sacrificing for the sake of the Gospel. Only a select few, like Timothy, were willing to give up their own interests and conveniences to advance the cause of Christ. Sadly, it is rare to find helpers who are willing to fully devote themselves to the Lord's work, as most are only willing to support it if it aligns with their own desires. So let us not be quick to judge those who choose their own interests over the things of Jesus Christ, but rather let us examine our own hearts and ask ourselves if we are truly seeking the things that pertain to the kingdom of the Redeemer.

- Attempt 5 BHT: Today, many people are more concerned with their own matters and personal gain instead of prioritizing Jesus Christ. This self-focused mindset is not a new issue and Paul emphasizes the importance of not weakening this assertion. However, Timothy stood as a dedicated exception among the crowds. Sadly, it is uncommon to find helpers who are willing to sacrifice their own ease, fame, and gain for the Lord's cause. We should refrain from harshly judging others and instead evaluate our own devotion to advancing the kingdom of the Redeemer.
