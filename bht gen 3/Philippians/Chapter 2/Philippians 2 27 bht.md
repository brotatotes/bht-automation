### Henry Alford:
1. "sorrow upon sorrow."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "On me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow - In addition to all the sorrows of imprisonment...His grief might have been aggravated from the consideration that his life had been lost in endeavoring to do him good."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sorrow upon sorrow [Î»Ï…Ï€Î·Î½ ÎµÏ€Î¹ Î»Ï…Ï€Î·Î½] . The accusative implies motion. Sorrow coming upon sorrow, as wave after wave.


### John Calvin:
1. "It is, however, surprising that he should ascribe it to the mercy of God that Epaphroditus had had his period of life prolonged, while he had previously declared that he desired death in preference to life."
2. "Christian patience differs widely from philosophical obstinacy, and still more from the stubborn and fierce sterness of the Stoics."
3. "In the first place, that the dispositions which God originally implanted in our nature are not evil in themselves, because they do not arise from the fault of corrupt nature, but come forth from God as their Author."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For indeed he was sick nigh unto death. Such a sickness must also in all probability have extended over some time."
2. "St. Paul does not consider that for all men it is a mercy to them that they be taken away, though he can say of himself that â€˜to die is gain.â€™"
3. "St. Paul does not mean by this that he would have had the sorrow of mourning over Epaphroditusâ€™ death added to the grief which he had felt while he was sick. He rather regards his life as an heritage of sorrow, from which sorrow never departs, and he says that to this, his wonted grief, the death of his friend would have brought an addition of sorrow."

### John Gill:
1. "Good men, such as Christ loves, as he did Lazarus, are sometimes sick; though their spiritual diseases are healed, and their sins forgiven, so that the inhabitants of Zion have no more reason to say that they are sick, since Christ has took their infirmities, and bore their sickness, yet they are not exempt from bodily disorders."

### John Wesley:
1. God had compassion on him â€” Restoring him to health.
