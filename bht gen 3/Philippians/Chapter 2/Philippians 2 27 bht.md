3. "sorrow coming upon sorrow."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Epaphroditus' sickness proves that the apostles had not ordinarily the permanent gift of miracles, any more than of inspiration: both were vouchsafed to them only for each particular occasion, as the Spirit thought fit."
2. "Lest I should have sorrow upon sorrowâ€”namely, the sorrow of losing him by death, in addition to the sorrow of my imprisonment."
3. "Here only occurs anything of a sorrowful tone in this Epistle, which generally is most joyous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Dr. Paley has remarked (Hor. Paul. on Phil no. ii.) that the account of the sickness and recovery of Epaphroditus is such as to lead us to suppose that he was not restored by miracle."
2. "This account, he adds, shows also that this Epistle is not the work of an impostor. Had it been, a miracle would not have been spared."

1. Sorrow upon sorrow [Î»Ï…Ï€Î·Î½ ÎµÏ€Î¹ Î»Ï…Ï€Î·Î½] . The accusative implies motion. Sorrow coming upon sorrow, as wave after wave.


### John Calvin:
1. "It were tedious to enumerate all the things which tend to make death better than life to believers, and more to be desired."
2. "Paul acknowledges that the death of Epaphroditus would have been bitterly painful to him, and he recognises it as an instance of Godâ€™s sparing mercy toward himself, that he had been restored to health."
3. "What excellence were there in patiently enduring the cross, if there were in it no feeling of pain and bitterness?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such a sickness must also in all probability have extended over some time."
2. "St. Paul does not consider that for all men it is a mercy to them that they be taken away, though he can say of himself that â€˜to die is gain.â€™"
3. "He rather regards his life as an heritage of sorrow, from which sorrow never departs, and he says that to this, his wonted grief, the death of his friend would have brought an addition of sorrow."

### John Gill:
1. "Good men, such as Christ loves, as he did Lazarus, are sometimes sick; though their spiritual diseases are healed, and their sins forgiven, so that the inhabitants of Zion have no more reason to say that they are sick, since Christ has took their infirmities, and bore their sickness, yet they are not exempt from bodily disorders; and which are sometimes such as bring them to the brink of the grave, and, as it were, to the gates of death; and such was this good man's case."
2. "His recovery was not by man, but by God, and owing to his power, mercy, and goodness; and indeed, whenever means are made rise of, and they succeed to the restoration of health, it ought to be ascribed to the divine blessing on them."
3. "Grace, and the doctrine of grace, though they regulate the passions, and restrain them from immoderate sorrow, they do not destroy them, nor deny the proper use of them. Christianity does not countenance a stoical apathy, but requires and encourages a Christian sympathy, and directs us to weep with them that weep within due bounds."

### John Wesley:
1. God had compassion on him â€” Restoring him to health.
