## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "for the work [of Christ], viz. of the Gospel, or of Christ... part of which it was, to sustain the minister of the Gospel" 
2. "he came nigh unto death... not to be understood, as Chrysostom and others do, of danger incurred by the hostility of the authorities."
3. "that he might fill up your deficiency... in the ministration to me... Epaphroditus filled up, and in so doing risked his life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was probably in a delicate state of health in setting out from Philippi; but at all hazards he undertook this service of Christian love, which cost him a serious sickness."
2. "Not that Paul would imply, they lacked the will: what they 'lacked' was the 'opportunity' by which to send their accustomed bounty."
3. "That which ye would have done if you could (but which you could not through absence), he did for you therefore receive him with all joy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Every person who is virtuous and pious has some claim to esteem. It is one evidence, also, of true humility and of right feeling, when we esteem them as better than ourselves."
2. "We should be willing to occupy our appropriate place in the church. That is true humility; and why should anyone be unwilling to be esteemed just as he ought to be?"
3. "Let us diligently endeavor to work out our salvation. Nothing else so much demands our unceasing solicitude as this, and in nothing else have we so much encouragement."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul says that Epaphroditus recklessly exposed his life." 
2. "The brotherhoods of the ancient Church, who cared for the sick at the risk of their lives, were called parabolani, or reckless persons."
3. "All that was wanting in the matter of their service was their ministration in person, which was supplied by Epaphroditus."

### John Calvin:
1. "Sickness, indeed, is not an excellence, but it is an excellence not to spare yourself that you may serve Christ."
2. "Epaphroditus felt that his health would be in danger if he applied himself beyond measure; yet he would rather be negligent as to health than be deficient in duty."
3. "There is nothing in which we can better serve God, than when we help his servants who labor for the truth of the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "he willingly put it in jeopardy. Such a word gives a vivid picture of St. Paul‚Äôs opinion of the conduct of Epaphroditus. It represents him as encountering the labour and danger which attended on St. Paul‚Äôs circumstances with full free will, and an entire disregard of consequences to himself, such as only true devotion could supply."
2. "Epaphroditus came as the representative of many, and would fain have multiplied both his powers and services, that he might not only be the bearer of their bounty, but the impersonation of their united love."
3. "The knowledge of what his labours had been makes the apostle say: ‚ÄòHold such in honour.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hazarding his life...to expose oneself to danger."
2. "œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒµœÖœÉŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ... means 'exposing himself to danger' as here."
3. "The word œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒ±ŒΩ (riskers) was applied to the Christians who risked their lives for the dying and the dead."

### John Gill:
1. "Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death... brought upon him a disorder which greatly threatened his life, and had almost issued in his death."
2. "He rather despised it, and made no account of it, being very willing to deliver it up, and sacrifice it in such a good work and cause."
3. "What was done to him, and for him, was but a piece of service and duty to him; and which this good man and faithful minister and messenger of theirs having done for them to the hazard of his life, he ought therefore to be received by them with great joy, and to be highly honoured and respected."

### John Wesley:
1. To supply your deficiency of service ‚Äî To do what you could not do in person.
