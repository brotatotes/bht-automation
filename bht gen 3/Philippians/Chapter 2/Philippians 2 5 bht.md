## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Think this in yourselves, which was also (the mind) in Christ Jesus."
2. "(It is disputed whether this is said of the Son of God before, or since His Incarnation. See below. I assume now, and will presently endeavour to prove, that the Apostle‚Äôs reference is first to the taking on him of our humanity, and then to his further humiliation in that humanity)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Have this mind in you," &amp;c. He does not put forward himself (see on Philippians 2:4, and Philippians 2:4- :) as an example, but Christ, THE
	ONE pre-eminently who sought not His own, but "humbled
	Himself" (Philippians 2:8), first
	in taking on Him our nature, secondly, in humbling Himself further in
	that nature (Romans 15:3).

### Albert Barnes:
