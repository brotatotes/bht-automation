# Philippians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, in His pre-existent state, possessed equality with God and existed in the form of God. This emphasizes His eternal nature and divine essence. While He did not empty Himself of His deity, He willingly humbled Himself by relinquishing His outward self-manifesting glory. Christ's humility extends beyond mere appearance and involves truly taking on the lowly condition of a servant. His self-abasement serves as an example for us to refrain from pride, considering the immense height from which He descended for our sake.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Less cannot be implied in this word than eternal pr√¶-existence."
2. "The divine nature had an infinite beauty in itself, even without any creature to look on it."
3. "Our Lord possessed equality with God. In 'the mind which was in Him, He regarded not this His equality a thing to be grasped at by Him, so as to hold it firm for Himself, but'&c."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The divine nature had infinite BEAUTY in itself, even without any creature contemplating that beauty: that beauty was 'the form of God';"
2. "He never emptied Himself of the fulness of His Godhead, or His "BEING on an equality with God"; but between His being "in the FORM (that is, the outward glorious self-manifestation) of God," and His "taking on Him the form of a servant," whereby He in a great measure emptied Himself of His precedent "form," or outward self-manifesting glory as God."
3. "Being on an equality with God, is not identical with subsisting in the form of God"; the latter expresses the external characteristics, majesty, and beauty of the Deity, which "He emptied Himself of," to assume "the form of a servant."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In Philippians 2:7, it is applied to the appearance of a servant - and took upon him the form of a servant; that is, he was in the condition of a servant - or of the lowest condition."
2. "He chose to forego the dignity, and to assume the humble condition of a man."
3. "The natural and obvious meaning of the language is, that there was an equality of nature and of rank with God, from which he humbled himself when he became a man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Form [ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒ∑] . We must here dismiss from our minds the idea of shape. The word is used in its philosophic sense, to denote that expression of being which carries in itself the distinctive nature and character of the being to whom it pertains, and is thus permanently identified with that nature and character."
2. "To say, then, that Christ was in the form of God, is to say that He existed as essentially one with God."
3. "Christ held fast His assertion of divine dignity, but relinquished it... The fact of His equality with God is stated as a background, in order to throw the circumstances of His incarnation into stronger relief."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ‚Äôs humility consisted in his abasing himself from the highest pinnacle of glory to the lowest ignominy: our humility consists in refraining from exalting ourselves by a false estimation."
2. "Since, then, the Son of God descended from so great a height, how unreasonable that we, who are nothing, should be lifted up with pride!"
3. "For just as a man is known, when we mark the form of his appearance and his person, so the majesty, which shines forth in God, is his form or figure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He possessed this equality, but consented to forego it for a time, that He might work out the salvation of men."
2. "Christ did not think of His equality with God as something which He, having seized, must carefully guard, and so could not venture on laying it down at all."
3. "Christ for the sake of mankind laid down of His own will that which He had from eternity, and His right whereto none could question."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is a clear statement by Paul of the deity of Christ."
2. "That is to say Paul means a prize to be held on to rather than something to be won ('robbery')."
3. "Undoubtedly Christ gave up his environment of glory. He took upon himself limitations of place (space) and of knowledge and of power, though still on earth retaining more of these than any mere man."

### John Gill:
1. "This phrase, 'the form of God', is to be understood of the nature and essence of God, and describes Christ as he was from all eternity;...so his being in the form of God intends that he was really and truly God; that he partook of the same nature with the Father, and was possessed of the same glory."
2. "He reckoned that by declaring and showing forth his proper deity, and perfect equality with the Father, he robbed him of no perfection;...he did him no injury, nor deprived him of any glory, or assumed that to himself which did not belong to him."
3. "Others give this as the sense of them, that he did not in an ostentatious way show forth the glory of his divine nature, but rather hid it;...yet at other times we find, that he wrought miracles to manifest forth his glory, and frequently appeals to them as proofs of his deity and Messiahship."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who being in the essential form... real God, as real man." 
2. "Counted it no act of robbery... but his own strict and unquestionable right."
3. "To be equal with God... expresses not a bare resemblance, but a real and proper equality."
