# Philippians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, existing eternally in the form of God, had equality with God Himself. This form does not imply less than eternal preexistence. Christ willingly chose to empty Himself of the majesty and beauty associated with the divine nature. He took on the form of a servant, laying aside His equality with God, yet still affirming His deity. This act of self-abasement demonstrates the humility of Christ and serves as a profound example for us to follow.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Less cannot be implied in this word than eternal pr√¶-existence."
2. "Our Lord possessed equality with God. In 'the mind which was in Him, He regarded not this His equality a thing to be grasped at by Him, so as to hold it firm for Himself, but..."
3. "That one and the same person of the Son of God, 'existing in the form of God,' afterwards 'became in the likeness of men,' gathering to itself the humanity, in virtue of which He is now designated in the concrete, Christ Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The divine nature had infinite BEAUTY in itself, even without any creature contemplating that beauty: that beauty was 'the form of God."
2. "His argument is that the antithesis (Colossians 1:15- :) requires it, 'He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement, or emptying Himself.'"
3. "Being on an equality with God, is not identical with subsisting in the form of God"; the latter expresses the external characteristics, majesty, and beauty of the Deity, which "He emptied Himself of," to assume "the form of a servant.""

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'form' - ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒ∑ÃÅ morpheÃÑ - occurs only in three places in the New Testament, and in each place is rendered 'form'... In Philippians 2:7, it is applied to the appearance of a servant - and took upon him the form of a servant; that is, he was in the condition of a servant - or of the lowest condition."
2. "This passage...  indicates that Christ, before he became a man, was invested with honor, majesty, and glory, such as was appropriate to God himself."
3. "The natural and obvious meaning of the language is, that there was an equality of nature and of rank with God, from which he humbled himself when he became a man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Form [ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒ∑]. We must here dismiss from our minds the idea of shape. The word is used in its philosophic sense, to denote that expression of being which carries in itself the distinctive nature and character of the being to whom it pertains, and is thus permanently identified with that nature and character."
2. "To say, then, that Christ was in the form of God, is to say that He existed as essentially one with God... This form, not being identical with the divine essence, but dependent upon it, and necessarily implying it, can be parted with or laid aside. Since Christ is one with God, and therefore pure being, absolute existence, He can exist without the form."
3. "Taking the word aJrpagmon (A. V., robbery) to mean a highly prized possession, we understand Paul to say that Christ, being, before His incarnation, in the form of God, did not regard His divine equality as a prize which was to be grasped at and retained at all hazards, but, on the contrary, laid aside the form of God, and took upon Himself the nature of man."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ's humility consisted in his abasing himself from the highest pinnacle of glory to the lowest ignominy."
2. "Since, then, the Son of God descended from so great a height, how unreasonable that we, who are nothing, should be lifted up with pride!"
3. "As to myself, at least, not even all devils would wrest this passage from me ‚Äî inasmuch as there is in God a most solid argument, from his glory to his essence, which are two things that are inseparable."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ being in the form of God:‚Äô here the word ‚Äòbeing‚Äô is not the usual simple substantive verb, but a stronger word which is employed when the nature of a thing, in contradistinction to its mere existence, is to be predicated. Here it relates to the existence of Christ before His manifestation in the flesh, and its fuller force is fairly represented by the addition of the word ‚Äòoriginally.‚Äô"
2. "He did not count His equality with God as a prize to be held fast. He possessed this equality, but consented to forego it for a time, that He might work out the salvation of men. Thus he became an instance (how mighty!) of one who looked not at His own things, but also at the things of others."
3. "In the words ‚Äòto be on an equality with God,‚Äô the Greek shows the equality contemplated is in all the attributes and qualities of the Godhead. To express this the neuter plural is used, and so Christ is not mentioned as a person equal to God, but the equality is predicated of Him in all things."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is a clear statement by Paul of the deity of Christ."
2. "That is to say Paul means a prize to be held on to rather than something to be won."
3. "Undoubtedly Christ gave up his environment of glory. He took upon himself limitations of place (space) and of knowledge and of power, though still on earth retaining more of these than any mere man."

### John Gill:
1. "This phrase, 'the form of God', is to be understood of the nature and essence of God, and describes Christ as he was from all eternity."
2. "To be 'in the form of God', and to be 'equal with God', signify the same thing, the one is explanative of the other."
3. "Christ enjoyed this equality by nature; he thought, he accounted, he knew he had it this way; and he held it hereby, and of right, and not by any unlawful means."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who being in the essential form...real God, as real man." 
2. "Counted it no act of robbery...his own strict and unquestionable right."
3. "To be equal with God...a real and proper equality."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Before taking on the form of a servant, Christ existed eternally in the form of God, possessing equality with God Himself. The form of God refers not to a physical shape, but to the expression of the divine nature and character, inseparably linked to the essence of God. Christ, in His divine nature, emptied Himself of the external characteristics of deity to assume the form of a servant. This self-emptying was not an act of robbery but a conscious decision to lay aside the glory He rightfully held. Thus, Paul unequivocally affirms the preincarnate deity of Christ, who willingly humbled Himself and became an example for us to follow.
