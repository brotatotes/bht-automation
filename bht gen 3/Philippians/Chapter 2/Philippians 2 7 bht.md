## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He not only did not enrich himself, but he emptied himself."
2. "He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement."
3. "He was not a man pure and simple, and nothing else, but the Son of God manifest in the flesh and nature of men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His subjection to the law, His low state as a carpenter, His betrayal, and slave-like death to relieve us from the slavery of sin and death, finally and chiefly, His servant-like dependence on God while His divinity was not outwardly manifested, are all marks of His 'form as a servant.'" 
2. "He was in the form of a servant as soon as He was made man. He was 'in the form of God' before He was 'in the form of a servant.'"
3. "His emptying Himself presupposes His previous plenitude of Godhead. He remained full of this; yet He bore Himself as if He were empty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential idea is that of bringing to emptiness, vanity, or nothingness; and, hence, it is applied to a case where one lays aside his rank and dignity, and becomes in respect to that as nothing; that is, he assumes a more humble rank and station."
2. "The language before us fairly implies that he laid aside that which was expressive of his being divine - that glory which is involved in the phrase 'being in the form of God' - and took upon himself another form and manifestation in the condition of a servant."
3. "His object is to state the depth of humiliation to which he descended, and this was best done by saying that he descended to the lowest condition of humanity and appeared in the most humble garb."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He laid aside the form of God. In so doing, He did not divest Himself of His divine nature."
2. "What Christ grasped at in His incarnation was not divine sovereignty, but service."
3. "His mode of manifestation resembled what men are. This leaves room for the assumption of another side of His nature - the divine."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, indeed, could not divest himself of Godhead; but he kept it concealed for a time, that it might not be seen, under the weakness of the flesh. Hence he laid aside his glory in the view of men, not by lessening it, but by concealing it."
2. "He also declares in another place, (2 Corinthians 13:4,) that he suffered through the weakness of the flesh. In fine, the image of God shone forth in Christ in such a manner, that he was, at the same time, abased in his outward appearance, and brought down to nothing in the estimation of men; for he carried about with him the form of a servant, and had assumed our nature, expressly with the view of his being a servant of the Father, nay, even of men."
3. "Let one be truly man, he will nevertheless be reckoned unlike others, if he conducts himself as if he were exempt from the condition of others. Paul declares that it was not so as to Christ, but that he lived in such a manner, that he seemed as though he were on a level with mankind, and yet he was very different from a mere man, although he was truly man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He was still Himself, the Divine in person, though instead of the ‚Äòform of God‚Äô He for a time condescended to wear the ‚Äòform of a slave.‚Äô" 
2. "Christ had possessed from eternity all those qualities and attributes which are distinctly Divine; these He now, as it were, puts off, lets them not constantly be seen, and wears the character and manifests the attributes of a servant." 
3. "Christ at His incarnation entered on a new manifestation of Himself. He had before been in the form of God, He now assumes a human likeness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His humanity was as real as his deity."
2. "It was a likeness, but a real likeness, no mere phantom humanity as the Docetic Gnostics held."
3. "Note the difference in tense between œÖœÄŒ±œÅœáœâŒΩ (eternal existence in the ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒ∑ of God) and Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ (second aorist middle participle of Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒ±, becoming, definite entrance in time upon his humanity)."

### John Gill:
1. "The glory of his divine nature was covered, and out of sight; and though some rays and beams of it broke out through his works and miracles, yet his glory, as the only begotten of the Father, was beheld only by a few; the minds of the far greater part were blinded, and their hearts hardened, and they saw no form nor comeliness in him to desire him; the form of God in which he was, was hid from them."
2. "He willingly assented to it, to lay aside as it were his glory for a while, to have it veiled and hid, and be reckoned anything, a mere man, yea, to have a devil, and not be God: O wondrous humility! astonishing condescension!"
3. "Put these two together, 'the form of God', and 'the form of a servant', and admire the amazing stoop!"

### John Wesley:
1. "He was content to forego the glories of the Creator, and to appear in the form of a creature; nay, to he made in the likeness of the fallen creatures; and not only to share the disgrace, but to suffer the punishment, due to the meanest and vilest among them all."
2. "He emptied himself ‚Äî Of that divine fulness, which he received again at his exaltation. Though he remained full, John 1:14, yet he appeared as if he had been empty; for he veiled his fulness from the sight of men and angels."
3. "The form of a servant ‚Äî The form, the likeness, the fashion, though not exactly the same, are yet nearly related to each other. The form expresses something absolute; the likeness refers to other things of the same kind; the fashion respects what appears to sight and sense."
