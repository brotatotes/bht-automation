## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He not only did not enrich himself, but he emptied himself:â€”He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement."
2. "He emptied Himself of the form of God [not His essential glory, but its manifested possession."
3. "He was not a man pure and simple, and nothing else, but the Son of God manifest in the flesh and nature of men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His subjection to the law and to His parents, His low state as a carpenter, His betrayal for the price of a bond-servant, and slave-like death to relieve us from the slavery of sin and death, finally and chiefly, His servant-like dependence as man on God, while His divinity was not outwardly manifested, are all marks of His 'form as a servant.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential idea is that of bringing to emptiness, vanity, or nothingness; and, hence, it is applied to a case where one lays aside his rank and dignity, and becomes in respect to that as nothing; that is, he assumes a more humble rank and station."
2. "The language before us fairly implies that he laid aside that which was expressive of his being divine - that glory which is involved in the phrase 'being in the form of God' - and took upon himself another form and manifestation in the condition of a servant."
3. "His object is to state the depth of humiliation to which he descended, and this was best done by saying that he descended to the lowest condition of humanity and appeared in the most humble garb."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He did not divest Himself of His divine nature. The change was a change of state: the form of a servant for the form of God."
2. "What Christ grasped at in His incarnation was not divine sovereignty, but service."
3. "He became really and essentially the servant of men... His mode of manifestation resembled what men are... All that was possible was a real and complete likeness to humanity."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, indeed, could not divest himself of Godhead; but he kept it concealed for a time, that it might not be seen, under the weakness of the flesh."
2. "He who was the Son of God... did nevertheless lay aside his glory, when he in the flesh manifested himself in the appearance of a servant."
3. "The image of God shone forth in Christ in such a manner, that he was, at the same time, abased in his outward appearance, and brought down to nothing in the estimation of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ had possessed from eternity all those qualities and attributes which are distinctly Divine; these He now, as it were, puts off, lets them not constantly be seen, and wears the character and manifests the attributes of a servant."
2. "Christ at His incarnation entered on a new manifestation of Himself. He had before been in the form of God, He now assumes a human likeness."
3. "He wore on earth the human figure, a form such as is common to men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He took the characteristic attributes of a slave. His humanity was as real as his deity."
2. "It was a likeness, but a real likeness, no mere phantom humanity as the Docetic Gnostics held."
3. "Note the difference in tense between eternal existence in the form of God and definite entrance in time upon his humanity."

### John Gill:
1. "The glory of his divine nature was covered, and out of sight; and though some rays and beams of it broke out through his works and miracles, yet his glory, as the only begotten of the Father, was beheld only by a few."
2. "And to be thus esteemed, and had in such account, he voluntarily subjected himself, though infinitely great and glorious."
3. "O wondrous humility! Astonishing condescension!"

### John Wesley:
1. "He was content to forego the glories of the Creator, and to appear in the form of a creature; nay, to be made in the likeness of the fallen creatures; and not only to share the disgrace, but to suffer the punishment, due to the meanest and vilest among them all."
2. "He emptied himself â€” Of that divine fullness, which he received again at his exaltation. Though he remained full, yet he appeared as if he had been empty; for he veiled his fullness from the sight of men and angels."
3. "Taking â€” And by that very act emptying himself. The form of a servant â€” The form, the likeness, the fashion, though not exactly the same, are yet nearly related to each other. The form expresses something absolute; the likeness refers to other things of the same kind; the fashion respects what appears to sight and sense."
