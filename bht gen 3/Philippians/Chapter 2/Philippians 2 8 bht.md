2. "As a man: for this was the nature which He took up into Him: He himself was not this, but He put this on."
3. "He proves by Christâ€™s example, that they are blessed who voluntarily humiliate themselves with Christ: for from the most despised estate to the most exalted height, whoever humbles himself shall be in like manner exalted."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "He not only 'emptied Himself' of His previous 'form of God,' but submitted to positive HUMILIATION."
3. "Therefore 'God' is said to 'exalt' Him (Hebrews 5:8- :), even as it was God to whom He became voluntarily 'obedient.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When he was reduced to this condition he humbled himself, and obeyed even unto death. He took upon himself all the attributes of a man."
2. "He did not aspire to high honors; he did not affect pomp and parade; he did not demand the service of a train of menials; but he condescended to the lowest conditions of life."
3. "The highest honor that has been shown to the Law of God on earth was, that it was perfectly observed by him who made the Law - the great Mediator."

1. "Being found, that is of those by whom he was seen and known."
2. "His self-abasement went still farther, and went, too, of His own will."
3. "To accept death when it might be avoided is the extreme of humiliation. Yet even this Christ chose to do for men."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The contrast is between what He is in Himself, and what He appeared in the eyes of men."
2. "It is a voluntary humiliation on the part of Christ and for this reason Paul is pressing the example of Christ upon the Philippians, this supreme example of renunciation."
3. "Jesus came all the way down to the most despised death of all, a condemned criminal on the accursed cross."

### John Gill:
1. "Though he was seen and looked upon as a mere man, and therefore charged with blasphemy when he asserted himself to be the Son of God, he was more than a man."
2. "He humbled himself both to God and man."
3. "Even the death of the cross; which was both painful and shameful; it was an accursed one, and showed that he bore the curse of the law, and was made a curse for us."
