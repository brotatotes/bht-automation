2. "This supreme example of renunciation."
3. "Jesus came all the way down to the most despised death of all, a condemned criminal on the accursed cross."

### John Gill:
1. "...he was not begotten as man, but conceived in an extraordinary manner by the power of the Holy Ghost, yet he lay nine months in his mother's womb, as the human foetus ordinarily does; he was born as children are, was wrapped in swaddling bands when born, as an infant is; grew in stature by degrees, as men do; the shape and size of his body were like other men's, and he was subject to the same infirmities..."
2. "...he humbled himself: by becoming man, and by various outward actions in his life; as subjection to his parents, working at the trade of a carpenter, conversing with the meanest of men, washing his disciples' feet..."

### John Wesley:
1. "He humbled himself - to a still greater depth."
2. "Becoming obedient - to God, though equal with him."
3. "Yea, the death of the cross - inflicted on few but servants or slaves."
