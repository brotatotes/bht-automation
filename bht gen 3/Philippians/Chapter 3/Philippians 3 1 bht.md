## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The rejoice in the Lord, taken up again by the thus stand fast in the Lord, ch. iv. 1, is evidently put here emphatically, with direct reference to the warning which follows‚Äîlet your joy (your boast) be in the Lord."
2. "And this same exhortation, rejoice, is in fact the ground-tone of the whole Epistle."
3. "The description of this course as being safe is no objection to this: because the rejoicing in the Lord is in fact an introduction to the warning which follows: a provision, by upholding the antagonist duty, against their falling into deceit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Finally‚Äîrather, not with the notion of time, but making a transition to another general subject, 'Furthermore' [BENGEL and WAHL] as in :-. Literally, 'As to what remains,' c."
2. "the same things‚Äîconcerning 'rejoicing,' the prevailing feature in this Epistle"
3. "In the Lord‚Äîmarks the true ground of joy, in contrast with 'having confidence in the flesh,' or in any outward sensible matter of boasting"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the duty of Christians to rejoice in the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "The principal joy of the true Christian should be in the Lord. He should find his happiness not in riches, or gaiety, or vanity, or ambition, or books, or in the world in any form, but in communion with the Lord Jesus, and in the hope of eternal life through him."
3. "A cheerful countenance, an eye of benignity, a conversation pleasant and kind, should always evince the joy of his heart, and in all his contact with the world around him he should show that his heart is full of joy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Finally [œÑŒø ŒªŒøŒπœÄŒøŒΩ] . Lit., for the rest. Frequent in Paul 's writings in introducing the conclusions of his letters."
2. "Rejoice [œáŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœÑŒµ] . See on 2 Corinthians 13:11."
3. "Grievous [ŒøŒ∫ŒΩŒ∑œÅŒøŒΩ] . Only here, Matthew 25:26; Romans 12:11, in both instances rendered slothful."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a rare excellence when Satan endeavors to exasperate us by means of the bitterness of the cross, so as to make God‚Äôs name unpleasant, to take such satisfaction in the simple tasting of God‚Äôs grace, that all annoyances, sorrows, anxieties, and griefs are sweetened."
2. "In the first place, however, he calls them dogs; the metaphor being grounded upon this ‚Äî that, for the sake of filling their belly, they assailed true doctrine with their impure barking."
3. "In the third term employed, there is an elegant play upon words. They boasted that they were the circumcision: he turns aside this boasting by calling them the concision, inasmuch as they tore asunder the unity of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They must first imitate the Lord‚Äôs humiliation, and then they could rejoice in Him."
2. "We can hardly think that St. Paul would have felt it needful to notice such words as he has just used in such a manner as to say the writing of them was not irksome to him, and was safe for the Philippians to have repeated to them."
3. "Either, ‚ÄòI have told you before, but yet it is safe, and a way of making sure that my oral teaching is not forgotten, if I write it:‚Äô or, ‚ÄòIt may be that there is no present need for what I am going to say, but it is a safe course to warn you against errors which may arise among you.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is wholly needless to understand Paul as about to finish and then suddenly changing his mind like some preachers who announce the end a half dozen times."
2. "But Paul uses the idiom elsewhere also as in 1 Corinthians 7:29; 1 Thessalonians 4:1 before the close of the letter is in sight."
3. "Paul, as a true teacher, is not afraid of repetition."

### John Gill:
1. "A believer has always reason to rejoice in Christ; in the greatness of his person, he being in the form of God, and equal to him, and therefore able to save his to the uttermost by his obedience and death, and has interest enough in heaven to make his intercession prevalent and successful and power to keep safe all that are committed to him."
2. "They may, and should rejoice, as they sometimes do, in his salvation; in the contrivance of it by infinite wisdom; in the impetration of it by himself; and in the application of it by his spirit."
3. "For sometimes it is necessary to say and write the same things over and over again, partly that they may be the better understood, and partly that they may be more strongly fixed in the memory; as also, that the saints may be the more established in the present truth."

### John Wesley:
1. The same things ‚Äî Which you have heard before.
