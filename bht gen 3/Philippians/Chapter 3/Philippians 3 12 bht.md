# Philippians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Although I have already gained Christ and experienced the power of His resurrection, I have not yet reached the ultimate goal. My conversion was just the beginning of the chase, and I am continuously pressing forward towards the prize. Every day brings new opportunities for growth and progress, and although I have made great strides in my Christlikeness, there is still more to attain. The fact that Christ has called me into His service and desires to bestow the crown upon me should not dampen my zeal, but rather fuel my exertions.
