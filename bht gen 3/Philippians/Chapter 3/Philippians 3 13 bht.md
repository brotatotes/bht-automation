# Philippians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we must not cling to our past successes or failures, but rather keep our focus on the journey ahead. Just as a runner does not count the laps already completed, but looks to the remaining ones, we too should eagerly press on in our faith. We should not delude ourselves into thinking we have achieved perfection, but continually humble ourselves before God. By forgetting what is behind and stretching forward to what is ahead, we can run the race of faith with outstretched arms, pursuing the goal set before us with unwavering passion.

1. "Brethren, I (emphatic) do not reckon myself (emphatic) to have laid hold: but one thing (I do: there is nothing expressed in the original... nor can we say that no-thing requires to be supplied: the sense must have a logical supplement), forgetting the things behind"
2. "For a runner does not think how many times round the course he has completed, but how many remain to be completed:.... for what profit to us is the past if it be not completed?"
