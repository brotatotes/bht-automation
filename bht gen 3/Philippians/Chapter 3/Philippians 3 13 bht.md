# Philippians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Brothers and sisters, I do not reckon myself to have laid hold of everything I desire in my spiritual journey. For a runner does not think of how many laps they have completed, but rather how many remain. Looking back only leads to going back, and as Christians, we are constantly humbled by the contrast between who we are and who we desire to be. We must have a single great purpose in mind - to secure the prize and renounce anything that hinders our progress.
