# Philippians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I press on towards the goal for the prize of my heavenly calling of God. The high calling represents a real matter of fact, not restricted to Paul's own calling as an apostle. The metaphor is that of a footrace where the goal continually moves forward and the prize is the crown of righteousness. This calling is the common calling of all Christians to salvation in Christ Jesus. Forgetting what is behind, we reach forth to the things that are before, pursuing perfect holiness and eternal glory.
