## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let not...this diversity...produce any dissension in your Christian unity." 
2. "Nevertheless...as far as we have attained, walk by the same (path)." 
3. "Go on together, each one in his place and degree of advance, but all in the same path."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The expectation of a new revelation is not to make you less careful in walking according to whatever degree of knowledge of divine things and perfection you have already attained." 
2. "God makes further revelations to those who walk up to the revelations they already have."
3. "Whereunto we have attained, let us walk on in the same (the measure of knowledge already attained)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There were points in which all could agree; there were attainments which they all had made, and in reference to them they should walk in harmony and love."
2. "There were many things in which they could see alike, and where there were no jarring sentiments. In those things they could walk harmoniously."
3. "No better rule than this could be applied to the subjects of inquiry which spring up among Christians... If a man does not see things just as I do, let me try with mildness to Teach him, and let me believe that, if he is a Christian, God will make this known to him yet; but let me not quarrel with him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Whatever real christian and moral attainment you may have made, let that serve as a rule for your further advance." 
2. "The character of this standard of attainment is illustrated by the words in ver. 15, be thus minded, and by those in ver. 17, as ye have us for an example."
3. "The idea of a regulative standard is implied, but rule kanoni must be omitted from the Greek text. Rev. brings out the antithesis better : whereunto we have already attained, by that same rule let us walk."

### John Calvin:
1. "For my part, I rather prefer a different reading, implying that Paul exhorts the Philipplans to imitate him, that they may at last reach the same goal, so as to think the same thing, and walk by the same rule."
2. "As, therefore, they had not yet learned what true perfection was, in order that they might attain it he wishes them to be imitators of him; that is, to seek God with a pure conscience, to arrogate nothing to themselves, and calmly to subject their understandings to Christ."
3. "Observe, that the goal of perfection to which he invites the Philippians, by his example, is, that they think the same thing, and walk by the same rule He has, however, assigned the first place to the doctrine in which they ought to harmonize, and the rule to which they should conform themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Only, whereunto we have already attained, by that same rule let us walk."
2. "The verse itself is an enforcement of what he has been saying before."
3. "Those who would have more light and knowledge must make a right use of that which they have obtained."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By that same rule let us walk... Paul means simply this that, having come thus far, the thing to do is to go 'in the same path'." 
2. "A needed lesson for Christians weary with the monotony of routine in religious life and work."

### John Gill:
1. "Whatever degree of knowledge of Christ, and the truths of his Gospel, is attained to, let it be retained, and not departed from."
2. "Let us walk by the same rule...the Scriptures of truth, which are the rule of faith and practice, and the standard and test, to which all are to be brought and tried."
3. "Let us mind the same thing; be of one heart and affection to each other...and of the same judgment in the doctrines of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. But let us take care not to lose the ground we have already gained. Let us walk by the same rule we have done hitherto.
