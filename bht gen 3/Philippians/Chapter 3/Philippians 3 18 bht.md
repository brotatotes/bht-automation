## BHT:
Paul wept over those who lived in laxity and self-enjoyment, contrary to the Cross. These false brethren, with Epicurean tendencies and Judaic formalism, weakened the ministry and led others astray. We must weep over their inconsistencies and be aware of those who do not honor their religion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Why weeping? Because the evil was growing, because these even were well worth his tears... thus Paul weeps where others laugh and are wanton." 
2. "So full of sympathy is he; so does he bear all men in his heart." 
3. "There were some who professed indeed to be Christians, but were living in laxity and self-enjoyment: and this is contrary to the Cross."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Follow not evildoers, because they are 'many.' Their numbers are rather a presumption against their being Christ's 'little flock.'"
2. "There is need of constant warning."
3. "The Lord and His apostles, at the same time, speak more strongly against empty professors (as the Pharisees), than against open scoffers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There were many, even in the church, whom it would not be safe for them to imitate."
2. "The true way is, to admit that there are those in the church who do not honor their religion, and to warn others against following their example."
3. "He who loves religion will weep over the inconsistencies of its friends; he who does not, will exult and triumph."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No word is supplied describing the character of their walk; but this is brought out by enemies of the cross of Christ." 
2. "The persons alluded to were probably those of Epicurean tendencies." 
3. "This and Judaic formalism were the two prominent errors in the Philippian church."

### John Calvin:
1. "Many walk who mind earthly things...that those who are not regenerated by the Spirit of God think of nothing but the world."
2. "It becomes us, assuredly, to be affected in such a manner, that on seeing that the place of pastors is occupied by wicked and worthless persons, we shall sigh, and give evidence, at least by our tears, that we feel deeply grieved for the calamity of the Church."
3. "And unquestionably persons of this sort, who weaken the influence of the ministry by seeking their own interests, sometimes do more injury than if they openly opposed Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostle hates the sin, as we may see from the strong words which he soon writes, but yet he is moved to weeping for the sinners."
2. "They are nominally Christians, but refuse to bear the cross or to have any fellowship in Christ‚Äôs sufferings, and thus they prove worse foes than bitter opponents would be."
3. "They lead astray the weak by the tempting promises of liberty, which appeal so powerfully to the carnal part of man; and they also give occasion to others, who hate Christ‚Äôs cause, to blaspheme the whole Christian Church because of these false brethren."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I told you often (œÄŒøŒªŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒπœÇ ŒµŒªŒµŒ≥ŒøŒΩ). Imperfect active, repetition in Paul s warnings to them."
2. "Even weeping (Œ∫Œ± Œ∫ŒªŒ±ŒπœâŒΩ). Deep emotion as he dictated the letter and recalled these recreant followers of Christ (cf. 2 Corinthians 2:4)."
3. "The enemies of the cross of Christ (œÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒµœáŒ∏œÅŒøœÖœÇ œÑŒøœÖ œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ). Either the Judaizers who denied the value of the cross of Christ (Galatians 5:11; Galatians 6:12; Galatians 6:14) or Epicurean antinomians whose loose living gave the lie to the cross of Christ (1 John 2:4)."

### John Gill:
1. "They walked not as the apostle and his followers; they walked as men, as carnal men, 1 Corinthians 3:3, according to the course of the world, after their ungodly lusts, Ephesians 2:2."
2. "The few names in Sardis that have not defiled their garments with error or immorality should be marked for ensamples, Revelation 3:4, and the majority shunned."
3. "And so all such professors of Christ, who walk not according to the Gospel, though they are not open and direct enemies to the Gospel, which is the preaching of the cross, yet they are secret and indirect ones, and oftentimes do more mischief to it by their lives, than the keenest adversaries of it can by their pens."

### John Wesley:
1. Weeping ‚Äî As he wrote.
Enemies of the cross of Christ ‚Äî Such are all cowardly, all shamefaced, all delicate Christians.
