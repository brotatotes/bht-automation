# Philippians 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of the dogs ‚Äì profane, impure persons ‚Äì who claim to work for the Gospel but actually do the work of evil. These individuals have no true circumcision of the heart; their circumcision is merely the cutting off of the flesh. Christians, on the other hand, possess the only true circumcision - that of the heart. These false teachers are not of the true circumcision but are merely mutilated. Beware of these dogs, pay attention to them so as to avoid them, and do not follow their example.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Beware of the dogs - profane, impure persons."
2. "He seems to point out persons who actually wrought, and professedly for the Gospel, but who were ‚Äòdoing the work of evil,‚Äô not mere ‚Äòevil-doers.‚Äô"
3. "Observe (i.e., in fact, Beware of) the (I will not say, circumcision, but mere) concision - 'amputation who have no true circumcision of heart, but merely the cutting off of the flesh)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beware‚ÄîGreek, 'Have your eye on' so as to beware of. Contrast 'mark,' or 'observe,' namely, so as to follow."
2. "The Jews regarded the Gentiles as 'dogs;' but by their own unbelief they have ceased to be the true Israel and have become 'dogs.'"
3. "Christians have the only true circumcision, namely, that of the heart; legalists have only 'concision,' that is, the cutting off of the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Beware of dogs - Dogs in the east are mostly without masters; they wander at large in the streets and fields, and feed upon offals, and even upon corpses." 
2. "Beware of evil workers - Referring, doubtless, to the same persons that he had characterized as dogs... their teachings tended to set aside the great doctrine of salvation by the merits of the Redeemer."
3. "Beware of the concision - The word rendered 'concision' - Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÑŒøŒºŒ∑ÃÅ katatomeÃÑ - means properly a cutting off, a mutilation... their doctrine would cut and mangle the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul was the object of their special hatred and abuse. They challenged his birth, his authority, and his motives."
2. "Dogs was a term of reproach among both Greeks and Jews. Homer uses it of both women and men, implying shamelessness in the one, and recklessness in the other."
3. "The noun here is a play upon peritomh circumcision. It means mutilation. Paul bitterly characterizes those who were not of the true circumcision as merely mutilated."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Beware of the dogs. The word signifies 'Look out,' and would rather seem to imply that these teachers were not yet at Philippi, but might come, and so the apostle bids them 'watch.'"
2. "Evil workers, because they themselves who are circumcised do not keep the law, and their pains are bestowed only on pulling down the work of the Christian teachers, and giving nothing in its stead but mere ceremonial observance, weak and beggarly elements without any spiritual benefit."
3. "The thrice repeated 'beware' in reference to the same persons marks the apostle‚Äôs earnestness, and his sense of the peril to those who were again enslaved, after having been made free in Christ. He uses also a word for 'concision' which is found nowhere else in the New Testament. He calls their practice mere 'cutting,' a mutilation of the body for mutilation‚Äôs sake."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beware (Œ≤ŒªŒµœÄŒµœÑŒµ). Three times for urgency and with different epithet for the Judaizers each time."
2. "The dogs (œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ∫œÖŒΩŒ±œÇ). The Jews so termed the Gentiles which Jesus uses in a playful mood (Œ∫œÖŒΩŒ±œÅŒπŒøŒπœÇ, little dogs) to the Syro-Phoenician woman (Matthew 15:26). Paul here turns the phrase on the Judaizers themselves."
3. "The concision (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÑŒøŒºŒ∑ŒΩ). Late word for incision, mutilation (in contrast with œÄŒµœÅŒπœÑŒøŒºŒ∑, circumcision). In Symmachus and an inscription. The verb Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÑŒµŒºŒΩœâ is used in the LXX only of mutilations (Leviticus 21:5; 1 Kings 18:28)."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle calls them so, because they returned to Judaism, as the dog to its vomit."
2. "Likewise, they may be styled dogs for their covetousness, being such greedy ones."
3. "Beware of the concision; the men of the circumcision... whereby they made sad divisions, and cutting work among the churches."

### John Wesley:
1. "Beware of dogs ‚Äî Unclean, unholy, rapacious men."
2. "The title which the Jews usually gave the gentiles, he returns upon themselves."
3. "The apostle will not call them the circumcision, but coins a term on purpose."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Beware of the dogs ‚Äì profane, impure persons ‚Äì who claim to work for the Gospel but actually do the work of evil. These individuals have no true circumcision of the heart; their circumcision is merely the cutting off of the flesh. Christians, on the other hand, possess the only true circumcision ‚Äì that of the heart. These legalists, or concision, only engage in the cutting of the flesh. The Jews, who once regarded the Gentiles as dogs, have themselves become dogs due to their unbelief. Paul, who is the target of their hatred, challenges their birth, authority, and motives. Dogs, a term of reproach among Greeks and Jews, is used here to describe these individuals' shamelessness and recklessness. These false teachers are not of the true circumcision but are merely mutilated. Beware of these dogs, pay attention to them so as to avoid them, and do not follow their example. They are the very ones who called the Gentiles dogs, and they themselves have become the dogs. Their doctrine and teachings will only cut and mangle the church. These evil workers set aside the great doctrine of salvation by the merits of the Redeemer and instead focus on ceremonial observances that offer no spiritual benefit. The apostle urgently warns the Philippian believers against these teachers, using a word for concision that is found nowhere else in the New Testament to indicate their practice of mere cutting, a mutilation of the body for mutilation's sake.
