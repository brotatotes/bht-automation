As citizens of the heavenly Kingdom, our state and feelings are wholly different from those of the earthly realm. Our citizenship is in the Kingdom of God, the heavenly Jerusalem, which exists in heaven and has been established there from of old. We eagerly await the second coming of Christ, our Savior, who will rescue us from perdition. Just as the Israelites looked to the heavens, expecting Aaron's return, we must set our hearts and minds on heavenly things and not be consumed by the concerns of this world.
