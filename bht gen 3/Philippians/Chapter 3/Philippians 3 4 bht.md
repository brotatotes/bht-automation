### Philip Schaff:
1. "He had stood in a prominent place among those who could call themselves Abrahamâ€™s seed. Few could number so many distinctive marks of Jewish purity and observance. How thoroughly, then, must he have seen the unimportance of all this, who could cast all away and count it worthless for Christ!"
2. "If those things on which the Judaizers lay such stress were of any account, I could glory as largely as any. He mentions this that he may bring out into stronger contrast the small value (or rather no-value) which he sets on outward position and observances."
3. "That is, I have a right to think so still more than he. He does not mean that he does so think, though in words he says so. He is only meeting for a moment the Judaizers on their own ground."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Might have (ÎµÏ‡Ï‰Î½). Rather, "even though myself having."
Confidence (Ï€ÎµÏ€Î¿Î¹Î¸Î·ÏƒÎ¹Î½). Late word, condemned by the Atticists, from Ï€ÎµÏ€Î¿Î¹Î¸Î± (just used). See 2 Corinthians 1:15; 2 Corinthians 3:4. 


### John Gill:
1. "This he says, lest it should be objected to him, that the reason why he had no confidence in the flesh, and did not boast of it, was, because he could not; he had nothing to glory of, and put his confidence in, and therefore acted the common part of such persons, who despise what either they have not, or are ignorant of."
2. "He had as much reason, and as good a foundation for trust in himself, his privileges and attainments, as any man had, and more; and his meaning here is not, that he might lawfully have confidence in the flesh, for that is criminal in every one, but that he had as good pretensions to it."
3. "If there were any other person besides the false teachers he speaks of... who thought within himself he had... reasons for boasting and trusting in himself and in his carnal privileges and performances, the apostle had more, and which he enumerates..."

### John Wesley:
1. Though I â€” He subjoins this in the singular number, because the Philippians could not say thus.
