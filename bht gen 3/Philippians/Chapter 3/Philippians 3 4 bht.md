# Philippians 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though I may have every reason to put confidence in the flesh, to boast of my birth and external merits, I now realize that these things hold no value in the matter of salvation. Even if others think they have more reason to trust in the flesh, I have even more. However, I do not actually have confidence in the flesh, for I have found that it is worthless for Christ. Let us not allow others to triumph over Christ by boasting in their external advantages, but rather let us recognize that all confidence in the flesh is vain.

1. "This he says, lest it should be objected to him, that the reason why he had no confidence in the flesh, and did not boast of it, was because he could not; he had nothing to glory of, and put his confidence in, and therefore acted the common part of such persons, who despise what either they have not, or are ignorant of."
2. "The apostle had more, and which he enumerates in Philippians 3:5; not but that he might be exceeded by some in some one particular or another; as for instance, he was not of the tribe of Levi: nor of Judah; he was neither of the house of Aaron, nor of David; neither of the priestly line, nor of the blood royal."
