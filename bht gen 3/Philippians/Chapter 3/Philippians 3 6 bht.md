### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Paul, in Philippians 3:6, holds a rare and almost unparalleled commendation for his past righteousness. He was esteemed by others as holy and blameless in the eyes of the law, having shown great zeal and devotion. He went so far as to persecute the church and be the ringleader in the persecution of Christians. However, Paul himself acknowledges that he had not attained perfection. His zealous pursuit of the law, while commendable in the eyes of men, was not enough for salvation without Christ. The righteousness of the law, apart from Christ, is like a dead letter. Paul's estimation of his past righteousness serves as a reminder of the need for true understanding of God's righteousness and the limitations of the law.
