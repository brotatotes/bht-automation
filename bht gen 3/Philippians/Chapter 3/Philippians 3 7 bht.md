# Philippians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I have esteemed all things that were once gains to me as loss for the sake of Christ. These gains, which were once my confidence and joy, are now seen as one great loss. It is not just the law that I count as loss, but all the various gains I had. In fact, I still consider them as loss, for in comparison to Christ, they hold no value. These gains were hindrances to my salvation, obstacles that kept me from fully accepting Christ. Only through renouncing these legal merits can I find true and saving faith in Christ.
