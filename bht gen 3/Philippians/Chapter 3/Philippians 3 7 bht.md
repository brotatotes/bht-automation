# Philippians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All my perceived gains and esteemed privileges that were once of utmost importance to me, I now consider as loss for the sake of Christ. These various items of privilege, which I once counted separately, are now all viewed as one great loss. My own righteousness, which I once found pride in, actually hinders me from fully experiencing salvation through Christ. Therefore, I joyfully relinquish all reliance on my legal merits and renounce them for the sake of Christ. In comparison to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ, these formerly cherished things are nothing.
