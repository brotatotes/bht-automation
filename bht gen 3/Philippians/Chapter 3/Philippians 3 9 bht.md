# Philippians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I desire to be found in Christ, living and being in Him, with a righteousness that is not my own and does not come from the law. Instead, I seek the righteousness that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness that is from God and is built on my faith. This righteousness, the righteousness of faith, is not something that I possess of my own accord but is the perfect holiness of Christ that I appropriate through faith.
