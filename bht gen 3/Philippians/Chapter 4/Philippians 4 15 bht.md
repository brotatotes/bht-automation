# Philippians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the beginning of the Gospel, the Philippians were the only church that opened an account with Paul in regards to giving and receiving. While they were the ones who gave, Paul was the one who received. This did not make it any less of an account of giving-and-receiving. We should not wait for others in doing good works, but rather go forward, even if we are alone. The Philippians demonstrated a grateful and beneficent spirit from the moment the Gospel was preached to them, and their past favors were greatly commended.
