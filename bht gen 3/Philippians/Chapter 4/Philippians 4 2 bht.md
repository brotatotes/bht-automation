I beseech you, my sisters, to be of the same mind and reconcile your differences. In the Lord, as true believers, it is inconsistent to be at odds with one another.

Fix your gaze on Him and bury your animosities for the sake of our oneness, as a witness to Christ on earth.

### John Calvin:
1. "We must take notice, however, that, whenever he speaks of agreement, he adds also the bond of it‚Äîin the Lord."
