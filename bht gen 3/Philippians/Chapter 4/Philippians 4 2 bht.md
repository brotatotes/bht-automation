2. "For every combination will inevitably be accursed, if apart from the Lord, and, on the other hand, nothing is so disjoined, but that it ought to be reunited in Christ."
3. "It was a thing greatly requisite and necessary that they should be in a state of agreement."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "...either that they agree together, and be reconciled to each other, considering the relation they stood in to one another, and to the Lord..."
3. "...or that they become of the same mind, and embrace the same truths, and profess and maintain the same principles the church did..."
