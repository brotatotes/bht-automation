## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All the saints... they that are of CÃ¦sarâ€™s household." 
2. "These perhaps were slaves belonging to the (technically so called) familia... who had been converted by intercourse with St. Paul."
3. "The reason of these being specified is not plain: the connexion perhaps between a colony, and some of the imperial household, might account for it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "they that are of CÃ¦sar's householdâ€”the slaves and dependents of Nero who had been probably converted through Paul's teaching while he was a prisoner in the PrÃ¦torian barrack attached to the palace."
2. "Philippi was a Roman 'colony,' hence there might arise a tie between the citizens of the mother city and those of the colony; especially between those of both cities who were Christians, converted as many of them were by the same apostle, and under like circumstances, he having been imprisoned at Philippi, as he now is at Rome."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is reason to believe that the bonds of affection among the churches then were much stronger than they are now. There was a generous warmth in the newness of the Christian affection - the first ardor of love; and the common trials to which they were exposed would serve to bind them closely together."
2. "That is, of Nero, who was at that time the reigning emperor. The name Caesar was given to all the emperors after the time of Julius Caesar, as the name Pharaoh was the common name of the kings of Egypt."
3. "The phrase used here - 'the household of Caesar' - may refer to the relatives of the emperor; and it is certainly possible that some of them may have been converted to Christianity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of Caesar's household. Probably the slaves and freedmen attached to the palace. 


### John Calvin:
1. "It is no common evidence of divine mercy, that the gospel had made its way into that sink of all crimes and iniquities."
2. "It is also the more to be admired, in proportion as it is a rare thing for holiness to reign in the courts of sovereigns."
3. "The conjecture formed by some, that Seneca is here referred to among others, has no appearance of foundation; for he never gave any evidence, even the smallest, of his being a Christian."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though unknown, they were now brethren in Christ, and so could not be without interest in one another."
2. "The reason why they specially send a salutation may be that they, more than any others, had heard of all the love which the Philippians felt toward the apostle."
3. "And these converts, brought into closest communion with St. Paul, would have special desire to show their sense of what had been done to give consolation to an affliction, which themselves would see, but could do little to lighten."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was made known to some there likewise; though Nero, the then reigning emperor, was a very wicked prince, and his court a very debauched one, yet the grace of God reached some there."
2. "Who these were cannot be said; as for the conjecture that Seneca the philosopher, Nero's master, was one of them, it is without foundation."
3. "There is nothing in his writings, or in any account of him, any more than in the former, that shows him to be a Christian."
