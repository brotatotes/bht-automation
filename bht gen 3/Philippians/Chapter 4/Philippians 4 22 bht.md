# Philippians 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Philippi, there were believers from Caesar's household, likely slaves or dependents of Nero who had been converted through Paul's teaching during his time as a prisoner in Rome. It is improbable that any members of Nero's actual family embraced Christianity. The connection between Philippi and Caesar's household may have been strengthened by their shared Christian faith, conversion experiences, and the fact that both cities were touched by Paul's ministry. It is remarkable that the gospel penetrated the sinful environment of Caesar's court, demonstrating the extent of God's grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All the saints... they that are of CÃ¦sar's household.". 
2. "These perhaps were slaves belonging to the (technically so called) familia... of Nero, who had been converted by intercourse with St. Paul."
3. "This is much more likely than that any of the actual family of Nero should have embraced Christianity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "they that are of CÃ¦sar's householdâ€”the slaves and dependents of Nero who had been probably converted through Paul's teaching while he was a prisoner in the PrÃ¦torian barrack attached to the palace."
2. "Philippi was a Roman 'colony,' hence there might arise a tie between the citizens of the mother city and those of the colony; especially between those of both cities who were Christians, converted as many of them were by the same apostle, and under like circumstances, he having been imprisoned at Philippi, as he now is at Rome."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is reason to believe that the bonds of affection among the churches then were much stronger than they are now."
2. "The phrase used here - 'the household of Caesar' - may refer to the relatives of the emperor; and it is certainly possible that some of them may have been converted to Christianity."
3. "But it does not of necessity refer to those related to him, but may be applied to his domestics, or to some of the officers of the court that were more particularly employed around his person."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Of Caesar's household. Probably the slaves and freedmen attached to the palace. 


### John Calvin:
1. "It is no common evidence of divine mercy, that the gospel had made its way into that sink of all crimes and iniquities."
2. "It is also the more to be admired, in proportion as it is a rare thing for holiness to reign in the courts of sovereigns."
3. "The conjecture formed by some, that Seneca is here referred to among others, has no appearance of foundation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though unknown, they were now brethren in Christ, and so could not be without interest in one another."
2. "The reason why they specially send a salutation may be that they, more than any others, had heard of all the love which the Philippians felt toward the apostle."
3. "And these converts, brought into closest communion with St. Paul, would have special desire to show their sense of what had been done to give consolation to an affliction, which themselves would see, but could do little to lighten."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of God reached some there: who these were cannot be said; as for the conjecture that Seneca the philosopher, Nero's master, was one of them, it is without foundation."
2. "Though Nero, the then reigning emperor, was a very wicked prince, and his court a very debauched one, yet the grace of God reached some there."
3. "Torpes, a man in great favour and dignity in Nero's court, and Evellius his counsellor, who both suffered martyrdom under him, according to the Roman martyrology, are also mentioned."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Among the believers in Philippi were those who were part of Caesar's household, most likely slaves and dependents of Nero who had likely been converted through Paul's teaching. It is highly unlikely that any of Nero's actual family members embraced Christianity. Since Philippi was a Roman colony, there may have been a connection between the citizens of both cities who had been converted by the same apostle. It is remarkable that the gospel had reached the despicable and sinful environment of Caesar's household, as it is unusual for holiness to exist in royal courts. While it is unknown who exactly among Caesar's household believed, their salutation to the Philippians may have been motivated by hearing about the love the believers had shown to Paul in his suffering.
