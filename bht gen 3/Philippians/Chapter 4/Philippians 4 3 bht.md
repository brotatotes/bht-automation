## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yea ... a yoke-fellow." 
2. "Help them ... in the work of their reconciliation." 
3. "In the book of life ... the names of all those having the right of citizenship."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The term 'yoke-fellow' - ÏƒÏ…Î¶Ï…Î³Î¿Ï‚ suzugos - some have understood as a proper name (Syzygus); but the proper import of the word is yoke-fellow, and there is no reason to believe that it is used here to denote a proper name."
2. "The kind of 'help' which was to be imparted was probably by counsel, and friendly cooperation in the duties which they were called to perform."
3. "The use of this phrase here [book of life] implies the belief of Paul that these persons were true Christians. Names that are written in the book of life will not be blotted out. If the hand of God records them there who can obliterate them?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase occurs seven times in Revelation. Compare Luke 10:20; Hebrews 12:23, and see on Revelation 3:5. The figure is founded on the register of the covenant people."
2. "The verb is used of conception, Luke 1:24; arrest, Matthew 26:55; Acts 12:3; catching, as fish, Luke 5:9."
3. "The word rendered yoke - fellow is a proper name, Synzygus, and that true is to be explained as rightly so called."

### John Calvin:
1. "The book of life is the roll of the righteous, who are predestinated to life, as in the writings of Moses. God has this roll beside himself in safekeeping. Hence the book is nothing else than His eternal counsel, fixed in His own breast."
2. "Should any one allege, that Paul therefore acts rashly in usurping to himself the right of pronouncing as to the secrets of God, I answer, that we may in some measure form a judgment from the token by which God manifests his election, but only in so far as our capacity admits."
3. "It belongs, it is true, to God alone now to know them that are his, and to separate at least the lambs from the kids; but it is our part to reckon in charity all to be lambs who, in a spirit of obedience, submit themselves to Christ as their Shepherd, who betake themselves to his fold, and remain there constantly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But whoever may have been intended, neither the apostle nor the amanuensis thought the mention of a name of any consequence. The appeal was intelligible by him to whom it was made, and charity (such as he was to use and foster) 'vaunteth not herself.'"
2. "These women, like the apostle, had entered on the heavenward struggle, and like him were zealous that the Gospel should be spread abroad."
3. "The conception is of Godâ€™s record of all those who are striving to serve Him. It is clear from the language of St. John that the names were not considered to be written there unchangeably, but if found unworthy to continue, they might be blotted out."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "True yokefellow (Î³Î½Î·ÏƒÎ¹Îµ ÏƒÏ…Î½Î¶Ï…Î³Îµ). All sorts of suggestions have been made here, one that it was Lydia who is termed Paul's wife by the word ÏƒÏ…Î½Î¶Ï…Î³Îµ." 
2. "Help these women (ÏƒÏ…Î½Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î±Î½Î¿Ï… Î±Ï…Ï„Î±Î¹Ï‚). Present middle imperative of ÏƒÏ…Î½Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î±Î½Ï‰... 'Take hold with them.'"
3. "In the book of life (ÎµÎ½ Î²Î¹Î²Î»Ï‰ Î¶Ï‰Î·Ï‚). The only instance of this expression in the N.T. outside of the Apocalypse (Philippians 3:5; Philippians 13:8; Philippians 17:8, etc.). Hence real Christians in spite of their bickerings."

### John Gill:
1. "and therefore it is not likely that he should marry a wife within this compass of time, and much less that he should have one at Philippi"
2. "and giving them proper instructions in the doctrines of the Gospel, that they might be brought to think the same things the church did"
3. "the book of God's eternal purposes and decrees, divine predestination to eternal life; and this being called a 'book', and the names of persons being said to be in it, denote the love of God to his elect"


### John Wesley:
1. "Help those women who laboured together with me â€” Literally, who wrestled. The Greek word doth not imply preaching, or anything of that kind; but danger and toil endured for the sake of the gospel..."
2. "Whose names, although not set down here, are in the book of life - As are those of all believers. An allusion to the wrestlers in the Olympic games, whose names were all enrolled in a book."
3. "Reader, is thy name there? Then walk circumspectly, lest the Lord blot thee out of his book!"
