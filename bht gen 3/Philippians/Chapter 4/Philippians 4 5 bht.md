## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Let no man know of you any inconsistency with this reasonableness."

2. "There are included in 'moderation,' candor and kindliness. Joy in the Lord raises us above rigorism towards others."
3. "Exercise 'forbearance' even to your persecutors. None is so ungracious as not to be kindly to someone, from some motive or another, on some occasion; the believer is to be so 'unto all men' at all times."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let your moderation be known unto all men... This does not mean that they were to make an ostentatious display of it, but that it should be such a characteristic of their lives that it would be constantly visible to others."
2. "The word 'moderation'... refers to restraint on the passions, general soberness of living, being free from all excesses."

Moderation [œÑŒø ŒµœÄŒπŒµŒπŒ∫ŒµœÇ] . Wrong. Rev., correctly, forbearance. See on gentle, 1 Peter 2:18. 
The Lord is at hand. See on 1 Corinthians 16:22.


### John Calvin:
1. "The term modesty does not seem appropriate here, because Paul is not in this passage cautioning them against haughty insolence, but directs them to conduct themselves peaceably in everything, and exercise control over themselves, even in the endurance of injuries or inconveniences."
2. "Here we have a most beautiful sentiment, from which we learn, in the first place, that ignorance of the providence of God is the cause of all impatience, and that this is the reason why we are so quickly, and on trivial accounts, thrown into confusion, and often, too, become disheartened because we do not recognize the fact that the Lord cares for us."
3. "But as he has received them under his protection and guardianship, and defends them by his hand, which is everywhere present, let them rest upon this consideration, that they may not be intimidated by the rage of the wicked."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let your forbearance be known unto all men. Let them see that you behave with gentleness even in all the opposition of your adversaries."
2. "Thus shall they be taught that there is a power in Christianity, and be led to glorify your Master."
3. "The words are meant first as an encouragement to those who had much to suffer, that they should not faint, for the Deliverer was near; next for a warning, that none should relax, lest Christ should come, and those who were called by His name should be found not watchful."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Your forbearance (œÑŒø ŒµœÄŒπŒµŒπŒ∫ŒµœÇ œÖŒºœâŒΩ). 'Your gentleness,' 'your sweet reasonableness' (Matthew Arnold), 'your moderation.'" 
2. "The Lord is at hand (Œø Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒøœÇ ŒµŒ≥Œ≥œÖœÇ). 'The Apostle's watchword' (Lightfoot), as in 1 Corinthians 16:22 (ŒúŒ±œÅŒ±ŒΩ Œ±Œ∏Œ±, Aramaic equivalent, Our Lord cometh)."
3. "Unless, indeed, ŒµŒ≥Œ≥œÖœÇ here means near in space instead of nigh in time."

### John Gill:
1. "Moderation lies not in exerting authority and power to the uttermost, at least with rigour, but in showing clemency and lenity."
2. "Putting up with affronts and injuries, and bearing them with patience; and interpreting things in the best sense, and putting the best constructions on words and actions they will bear."
3. "The Lord is near... and therefore they should behave according to equity, and with kindness and tenderness towards their fellow creatures and fellow Christians."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let your gentleness ‚Äî Yieldingness, sweetness of temper, the result of joy in the Lord."
2. "Be known ‚Äî By your whole behaviour."
3. "The Lord ‚Äî The judge, the rewarder, the avenger."
