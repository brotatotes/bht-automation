## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The peace of God, that peace which rests in God and is wrought by Him in the soul, the counterpoise of all troubles and anxietiesâ€”see John xvi. 33."
2. "The understanding here is the intelligent faculty, the perceptive and appreciative power. On the sentiment itself, compare Eph. iii. 19."
3. "In Christ Jesus is not the predicate after shall keepâ€”shall keep&c. in Christ, i.e. keep them from falling from Christ: but, as usual, denotes the sphere or element of the custody thus bestowedâ€”that it shall be a Christian security."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "peaceâ€”the dispeller of 'anxious care' (Philippians 4:6)." 
2. "passethâ€”surpasseth, or exceedeth, all man's notional powers of understanding its full blessedness (1 Corinthians 2:9; 1 Corinthians 2:10; Ephesians 3:20; compare Proverbs 3:17)."
3. "shall keepâ€”rather, 'shall guard'; shall keep as a well-garrisoned stronghold (Isaiah 26:1; Isaiah 26:3). The same Greek verb is used in Isaiah 26:3- :. There shall be peace secure within, whatever outward troubles may besiege."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The peace which God gives. The peace here particularly referred to is that which is felt when we have no anxious care about the supply of our needs, and when we go confidently and commit everything into the hands of God."
2. "The Christian, committing his way to God, and feeling that he will order all things aright, has a peace which is nowhere else known. Nothing else will furnish it but religion."
3. "The way to find peace, and to have the heart kept from trouble, is thus to go and spread out all before the Lord."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Which passeth all understanding... which surpasses every (human) reason, in its power to relieve anxiety." 
2. "God's peace, like a sentinel, patrols before the heart."
3. "The peace of God is said to garrison the believer's heart and mind. He is surrounded with such blessed privileges that he is as safe as one in an impregnable castle."

### John Calvin:
1. "The peace of God will guard you, so as to prevent you from turning back from God in wicked thoughts or desires."
2. "The peace of God...does not depend on the present aspect of things...but is founded on the firm and immutable word of God."
3. "Nothing is more foreign to the human mind, than in the depth of despair to exercise, nevertheless, a feeling of hope."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A peace which shall banish all the over-anxious care, a peace which the world can neither give nor take away."
2. "It is better than all that the wit of man or his forethought can devise, and therefore is to be preferred before the results which can be gained by over-anxiety for worldly things."
3. "God's peace shall stand as sentinel, and let no hostile disturbance enter."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The peace of God shall guard." 
2. "God's peace as a sentinel mounts guard over our lives."
3. "Love as doing."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that peace which God calls his people to among themselves in their effectual calling; and which he requires of them to cultivate and maintain; and which he encourages in them by the promise of his gracious presence among them; and which indeed he is the author of, and therefore is so called."
2. "But either that peace which is made with God by the blood of Christ, and is published in the Gospel of peace, which passes and surprises all understanding of men and angels, that it should be."
3. "Or else that peace of conscience, which arises from a view of peace made by Christ; of justification by his righteousness, and atonement by his sacrifice; and which may be called 'the peace of Christ', as the Alexandrian copy reads; both because it is founded upon, and springs from him, and is what he is the donor of."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the peace of God â€” That calm, heavenly repose, that tranquility of spirit, which God only can give."
2. "Which surpasseth all understanding â€” Which none can comprehend, save he that receiveth it."
3. "Shall keep â€” Shall guard, as a garrison does a city."
