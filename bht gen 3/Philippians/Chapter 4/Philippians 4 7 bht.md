The peace of God, that surpasses all understanding, is a remarkable blessing. This peace, which rests in God and is wrought by Him in the soul, acts as a counterpoise to troubles and anxieties. It is not simply a mental state, but a Christian security, a sphere of protection in Christ Jesus. Like a sentinel, this peace patrols before the heart and guards our lives, banishing anxious care. It is a peace that comes from God and, in either sense, preserves the saints and brings a calm, heavenly repose that only He can provide.
