## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This beautiful sentence, full of the Apostle‚Äôs fervour and eloquence, derives much force from the frequent repetition of 'whatsoever,' and then of 'if there be any.'"
2. "right] not ‚Äòjust,‚Äô in respect of others, merely‚Äîbut right, in that wider sense in which righteousness is used‚Äîbefore God and man."
3. "virtue, in the most general ethical sense: praise, as the companion of virtue."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "True‚Äîsincere, in words."
2. "Piety is love with its face towards God; morality is love with its face towards man."
3. "They should live so as to deserve men's praise."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were not to exhibit partial virtues; not to perform one set of duties to the neglect or exclusion of others; not to be faithful in their duties to God, and to neglect their duty to people, not to be punctual in their religious rites, and neglectful of the comment laws of morality; but they were to do everything that could be regarded as the fair subject of commendation, and that was implied in the highest moral character." 
2. "A man who is false to his engagements, or false in his statements and promises, is one who will always disgrace religion."
3. "A sour and crabby temper in a professor of religion will undo all the good that he attempts to do."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Honest [œÉŒµŒºŒΩŒ±]...There lies in it the idea of a dignity or majesty which is yet inviting and attractive, and which inspires reverence. Grave, as Trench observes, does not exhaust the meaning." 
2. "Lovely [œÄœÅŒøœÉœÜŒπŒªŒ∑]...Adapted to excite love, and to endear him who does such things."
3. "Praise [ŒµœÄŒ±ŒπŒΩŒøœÇ]...Commendation corresponding to the moral value of the virtue. The two ideas seem to be coordinated."

### John Calvin:
1. "In the first place, he commends truth, which is nothing else than the integrity of a good conscience, with the fruits of it."
2. "Paul, therefore, does not bid them try to gain applause or commendation by virtuous actions, nor even to regulate their life according to the judgments of the people, but simply means, that they should devote themselves to the performance of good works, which merit commendation."
3. "Now meditation comes first, afterwards follows action."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "whatsoever things are true. Not merely in words only, but in thoughts and actions."
2. "whatsoever things are lovely. Which win favour from those among whom they are done; which gather men friends."
3. "think on these things. The word is not, as will be seen from the notes, the common word for ‚Äòthink,‚Äô but indicates the making up of a reckoning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Without these no ideals can exist. They are pertinent now when so much filth is flaunted before the world in books, magazines and moving-pictures under the name of realism."
2. "Old word, here only in N.T., from œÄœÅŒøœÇ and œÜŒπŒªŒµœâ, pleasing, winsome."
3. "We are responsible for our thoughts and can hold them to high and holy ideals."

### John Gill:
1. "To close all with respect to the duties of Christianity incumbent on the professors of it, the apostle exhorts to a regard to everything that is true."
2. "whatsoever [are] lovely; which are amiable in themselves, and which serve to cultivate and increase love, friendship, and amity among men."
3. "and if [there be] any praise; that is praiseworthy among men, and deserves commendation, even though in an unjust steward, it should be regarded."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whatsoever things are true ‚Äî Here are eight particulars placed in two fourfold rows; the former containing their duty; the latter, the commendation of it."
2. "Lovely ‚Äî And what more lovely than truth? Of good report - As is honesty, even where it is not practised."
3. "Think on these things ‚Äî That ye may both practise them yourselves, and recommend them to others."
