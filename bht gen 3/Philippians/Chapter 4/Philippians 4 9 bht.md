# Philippians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
May Paul's exhortation to the Philippian believers be a reminder to us as well. Just as they had learned, received, heard, and seen in him, so too are we to practice these things in our own lives. The example of a holy and upright life is often more powerful than mere words, and it is through our faithful performance of our duties to God and our fellowmen that we obtain the blessing of the God of peace. Let us therefore imitate Paul's joy in the Lord, even in difficult circumstances, and be assured that not only will the peace of God be with us, but the God of peace Himself will be our constant companion.
