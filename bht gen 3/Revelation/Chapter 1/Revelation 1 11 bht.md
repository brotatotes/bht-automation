## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The trumpet is the instrument of festal proclamation."
2. "The similarity to the sound of the trumpet here was in the loudness and clearness of the voice."
3. "From this [reference to ch. iv. 1] it appears that this voice was not that of our Lord, but of one who there also spoke to the Apostle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To this book, having such an origin, and to the other books of Holy Scripture, who is there that gives the weight which their importance demands, preferring them to the many books of the world?" 
2. "These seven are representative churches; and, as a complex whole, ideally complete, embody the chief spiritual characteristics of the Church, whether as faithful or unfaithful, in all ages." 
3. "In the historic scheme of interpretation, which seems fanciful, Ephesus represents the waning period of the apostolic age. Smyrna, bitter suffering, yet sweet and costly perfume, the martyr period of the Decian and Diocletian age. Pergamos, the Church possessing earthly power and decreasing spirituality from Constantine's time until the seventh century. Thyatira, the Papal Church in the first half of the Middle Ages; like 'Jezebel,' keen about its so-called sacrifice of the mass, and slaying the prophets and witnesses of God. Sardis, from the close of the twelfth century to the Reformation. Philadelphia, the first century of the Reformation. Laodicea, the Reformed Church after its first zeal had become lukewarm."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase, 'what thou seest,' refers to what would pass before him in vision, what he there saw, and what he would see in the extraordinary manifestations which were to be made to him." 
2. "The fair and obvious interpretation of this is, that he was to make the record in the island of Patmos, and then send it to the churches." 
3. "They were to derive from it themselves the consolation which it was suited to impart in time of trial, and to transmit it to future times, for the welfare of the church at large."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Under the â€˜seeingâ€™ is included all that is to be written in the roll, not merely chaps, 2 and 3; and the command to write is so given in the original as to show that it is urgent and that it must be obeyed at once."
2. "These are the seven churches already spoken of in Revelation 1:4, and no reasonable doubt can be entertained that they represent the universal Church in all countries and ages."
3. "The symbolism of the whole book is thus preserved. On any other supposition than that we have here a representation of the whole Church of Christ, chaps. 2 and 3 must be regarded as simply historical, and the harmony of the Apocalypse is destroyed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Write in a book... The commission covers the whole series of visions which all grow out of this first vision of the Risen Christ."
2. "The names of the seven churches of Revelation 1:4 are now given, and the particular message to each church comes in chapters 2 and 3 and in the same order, the geographical order going north from Ephesus, then east and south to Laodicea."
3. "But apparently the whole book was to be read to each of the seven churches. It would probably also be copied at each church."

### John Gill:
1. "These characters, which are repeated here, :-; are left out in the Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions; but are very fitly retained, to point out the person that speaks; to express his dignity, deity, and eternity; to excite the attention of John, and to give weight to what he said."
2. "that it might remain, and be read of all men, and be profitable to the churches in the then present age, and in all future ones"
3. "this is now a miserable desolate place, not a city, but a village; and is called by the Turks, Aiasalik"

### John Wesley:
1. "He both saw and heard. This command extends to the whole book."
2. "All the books of the New Testament were written by the will of God; but none were so expressly commanded to be written."
3. "The whole book was sent to them all."
