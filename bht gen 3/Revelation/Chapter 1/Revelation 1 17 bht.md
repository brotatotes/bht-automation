2. "The 'touch' of His hand, as of old, imparted strength."
3. "From eternity, and enduring to eternity: 'the First by creation, the Last by retribution: the First, because before Me there was no God formed; the Last, because after Me there shall be no other: the First, because from Me are all things; the Last, because to Me all things return.'"

### Albert Barnes:
