2. "He ever lives to make intercession for them; he rose again from the dead for their justification; their being quickened together with him, and their being begotten again to a lively hope, are owing to his being alive; and as their reconciliation is by his death, so their salvation, or the application of it to them, is by his interceding life."
3. "His power over death is seen in taking away persons by death when he pleases...and in raising persons from the dead...and in his raising up his own body when dead, and which will also appear in raising all the dead at the last day."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he that liveth â€” Another peculiar title of God." 
2. "And I have the keys of death and of hades â€” That is, the invisible world." 
3. "Christ hath the keys of, that is, the power over, both; killing or quickening of the body, and disposing of the soul, as it pleaseth him."
