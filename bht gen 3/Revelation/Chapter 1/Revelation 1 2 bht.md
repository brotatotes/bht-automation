## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words must, in all fairness of construction, be referred to this present book, and not, as by some of the older Expositors, and recently by Ebrard, to the Gospel of St. John."
2. "The Evangelist distinctly tells us, John xx. 30, that in writing his Gospel, he did not set down as much as he saw, but only a portion of the things which Jesus did in the presence of His disciples, whereas in the case of this Revelation it was otherwise: he set down all which he saw."
3. "As a faithful transmitter of the Apocalyptic vision to the churches."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word of God constitutes his testimony." 
2. "The testimony of Jesus - 'the Spirit of prophecy'."
3. "Translate, 'whatsoever things he saw' in apposition with 'the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was a characteristic of the writer to bear simple but faithful testimony to the truth which God communicated to people in the gospel."
2. "He concealed nothing; he held nothing back; he made it known precisely as it was seen by him."
3. "Among the most gentle and amiable of people... he yet had mental characteristics which made it proper that he should be called 'a son of thunder.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reference is to the present book and not to the Gospel."
2. "The words and the idea are characteristic of Revelation as of the Gospel and Epistles."

2. "The verse as a whole is thus to be understood of the revelation of this book."
3. "The emphasis lies upon 'bare witness,' upon the attitude of the Seer rather than upon the things seen."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word of God (œÑŒøŒΩ ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ). Subjective genitive, given by God. The prophetic word as in Revelation 1:9; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 20:4, not the personal Word as in Revelation 19:14."
2. "The testimony of Jesus Christ (œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒπŒ±ŒΩ ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ). Subjective genitive again, borne witness to by Jesus Christ."
3. "Even of all the things that he saw (ŒøœÉŒ± ŒµŒπŒ¥ŒµŒΩ). Relative clause in apposition with ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøŒΩ and ŒºŒ±œÅœÑœÖœÅŒπŒ±ŒΩ."

### John Gill:
1. "And of the testimony of Jesus Christ; that is, the Gospel, which testifies of the person of Christ, of the truth of his divinity, and reality of his human nature; of the union of the two natures, divine and human, his person." 
2. "And of all things that he saw; with his bodily eyes, as the human body of Christ, the miracles he wrought in it, the transfiguration of it on the mount, the crucifixion of it, and the piercing of it with a spear, and the resurrection of it from the dead."
3. "And such a faithful witness serves greatly to confirm the authority of this book, and to recommend the perusal of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The word of God - Given directly by God."
2. "The testimony of Jesus - Which he hath left us, as the faithful and true witness."
3. "Whatsoever things he saw - In such a manner as was a full confirmation of the divine original of this book."
