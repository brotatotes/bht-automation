## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stars, concentrated sparks of light, should represent some actually existing persons in or connected with the churches."
2. "The interpretation of angels as bishops by the analogy of the legate of the congregation, in the synagogue, appears to be futile, inasmuch as that officer held quite an inferior place, in no way corresponding to a bishop, or any kind of president of the church."
3. "Stars are the symbols of the angels of the churches, inasmuch as angels are beings of light."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mystery signifies the hidden truth, veiled under this symbol, and now revealed; its correlative is revelation." 
2. "Stars symbolize lordship of faithful teachers." 
3. "The term angel, designating an office, is, in accordance with the enigmatic symbolism of this book, transferred from the heavenly to the earthly superior ministers of Jehovah."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here...is, that they were symbols, and that their meaning as symbols, without a suitable explanation, would remain hidden or unknown."
2. "The general and obvious truths which they would serve to convey would be that the ministers of the churches, and the churches themselves, were designed to be lights in the world, and should burn clearly and steadily."
3. "To the most beloved of the apostles, now the only surviving one of the number...it was appropriate that such communications should be made. In a lonely island; far away from the homes of people; surrounded by the ocean, and amid barron rocks; on the day consecrated to the purposes of sacred repose and the holy duties of religion - the day observed in commemoration of the resurrection of his Lord, it was most fit that the Redeemer should appear."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Seer beholds the churches â€˜inâ€™ the hand of their Lord as His absolute property and in His safe keeping. The Lord Himself beholds them â€˜uponâ€™ His right hand, in a more upright and independent position: they are churches which He is about to send forth to struggle in His place."
2. "Angels of a church are a method of expressing the church itself, the church being spoken of as if it were concentrated in its angel or messenger."
3. "The one is the Church in action, the other the Church in her inner life; and hence, probably, the mention of the former before the latter, for throughout the Apocalypse it is with the working, struggling Church that we have to do."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The mystery of the seven stars... means the inner meaning (the secret symbol) of a symbolic vision."
2. "The seven golden candlesticks... identifying the stars with the lampstands."
3. "These seven churches are themselves lampstands reflecting the light of Christ to the world."

### John Gill:
1. "The ministers of the Gospel are not only compared to 'stars,' for which Revelation 1:19; but likewise to 'angels,' which signifies 'messengers', as ministers are sent forth by Christ with the message of the Gospel to publish to the sons of men."
2. "There is some agreement between [ministers of the Gospel] and [angels] in holiness, knowledge, zeal, diligence, and watchfulness, in their work; as also they may be so called for the honour and esteem in which they are, both with Christ and his churches."
3. "The whole book [of Revelation] is called a prophecy, and a revelation of things that were shortly to come to pass, and it would be very strange, and very unsuitable to its title, should the three first chapters contain nothing prophetic in them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The seven stars are angels of the seven churches - Mentioned in the eleventh verse. In each church, there was one pastor or ruling minister, to whom all the rest were subordinate."
2. "This pastor, bishop, or overseer, had the peculiar care over that flock: on him the prosperity of that congregation in a great measure depended, and he was to answer for all those souls at the judgment seat of Christ."
3. "A candlestick, though of gold, has no light of itself; neither has any church, or child of man. But they receive from Christ the light of truth, holiness, comfort, that it may shine to all around them."
