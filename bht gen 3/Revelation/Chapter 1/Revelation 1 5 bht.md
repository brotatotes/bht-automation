## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was the faithful witness, because all things that He heard of the Father He faithfully made known to His disciples... Lastly, because He will give true testimony of the works of good and bad at the day of judgment."
2. "Christ rose to die no more... It was then that His divine Sonship as the God-man was manifested and openly attested by the Father. So our resurrection and our manifested sonship, or generation, are connected."
3. "The kingship of the world which the tempter offered to Jesus on condition of doing homage to him, and so shunning the cross, He has obtained by the cross... Those who are wise in time and kiss the Son shall bring their glory unto Him at His manifestation as King of kings, after He has destroyed His foes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is faithful in the sense that he is one on whose testimony there may be entire reliance, or who is entirely worthy to be believed."
2. "The exaltation of the Redeemer is elsewhere expressed in different language, but the idea is one that everywhere prevails in regard to him in the Scriptures."
3. "The doctrine that the blood of Christ cleanses us from sin, or purifies us, is one that is common in the Scriptures."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A faithful witness, because He gave faithful testimony concerning all things which were to be testified to by Him in the world. A faithful witness, because whatever He heard from the Father, He faithfully made known to His disciples. A faithful witness, because He taught the way of God in truth, neither did He care for any one nor regard the person of men. A faithful witness, because He announced condemnation to the reprobate and salvation to the elect. A faithful witness, because He confirmed by miracles the truth which He taught in words. A faithful witness, because He denied not, even in death, the Father's testimony to Himself. A faithful witness, because He will give testimony in the day of judgment concerning the works of the good and of the evil."
2. "The risen Christ regarded in His relation to the dead in Christ. He was not the first who rose from the dead, but the first who so rose that death was thenceforth impossible for Him (Romans 6:9); rose with that resurrection-life in which He will finally bring with Him those who sleep in Him (1 Thessalonians 4:14)."
3. "The comparison with the kings of the earth is suggested by Psalms 2:2. Compare Psalms 89:27; Isaiah 52:15; 1 Timothy 6:16; and see Revelation 6:15; Revelation 17:4; Revelation 19:16."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The witness the faithful."
2. "The first-born of the dead."
3. "Christ loosed us once for all, but loves us always."

### John Gill:
1. "He is described in all his offices: in his prophetic office, the faithful witness; in his priestly office, the first begotten of the dead; and in his kingly office, the Prince of the kings of the earth."
2. "This character supposes that he died for the sins of his people and that he rose again from the dead for their justification."
3. "Love was the cause of washing, and not washing the cause of love; hence it appears that they were in themselves filthy, and unclean through sin; and that such was the love of Christ to them, that he shed his precious blood for them, which is a fountain opened, to wash in for sin, and which cleanses from all sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was the faithful witness of the whole will of God before his death, and in death, and remains such in glory."
2. "He rose from the dead, as 'the first fruits of them that slept;' and now hath all power both in heaven and earth."
3. "He is here styled a prince: but by and by he hears his title of king; yea, King of kings, and Lord of lords."
