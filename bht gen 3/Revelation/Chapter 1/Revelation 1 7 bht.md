2. "Everyone...will see the Son of God coming as a Judge."
3. "The coming of the Saviour will be an occasion of...lament, to cry aloud in intense grief...Nothing would fill the earth with greater consternation than the coming of the Son of God in the clouds of heaven; nothing could produce so deep and universal alarm."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The clouds are frequently used in the descriptions of the Lord's second coming."
2. "The verb denotes the physical act, but emphasizes the mental discernment accompanying it, and points to the result rather than to the act of vision."
3. "The expression here refers not to the Jews only, but to all who reject the Son of Man; those who 'in any age have identified themselves with the Spirit of the Savior's murderers' (Milligan)."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "And every eye shall see him, not the eyes only of those who shall then be alive upon the earth, as it would thus be impossible to explain the mention of those who pierced Him, but the eyes of all who, in any age and of any nation, have rejected His redemption."
3. "We have still to ask, In what sense shall all â€˜seeâ€™ and â€˜wailâ€™? The latter word must determine the interpretation of the former. Is this a wailing of penitence or of dismay? or is it both, so that the wailers embrace alike the sinful world and the triumphant Church?"

3. "All the wicked, in the several parts of the world, will lament, and wring their hands, and express the inward terror and horror of their minds, at his appearing; they will fear his resentment of all their wicked words and actions; will dread his wrath, and tremble at his righteous judgment."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold â€” In this and the next verse is the proposition, and the summary of the whole book."
2. "And yet it is not said, He cometh again: for when he came before, it was not like himself, but in 'the form of a servant.' But his appearing in glory is properly his coming; namely, in a manner worthy of the Son of God."
3. "They who have pierced him â€” They, above all, who pierced his hands, or feet, or side. Thomas saw the print of these wounds even after his resurrection; and the same, undoubtedly, will be seen by all, when he cometh in the clouds of heaven."
