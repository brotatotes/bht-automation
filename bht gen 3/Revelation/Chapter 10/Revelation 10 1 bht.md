## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The last vision witnessed the destruction of a third part of the ungodly by the horsemen from the East, and left the remainder in a state of impenitent idolatry and sin." 
2. "Manifestly then the prayers of the saints are not yet answered, however near the time may be for that answer."
3. "If then this Episode contains some assurance of the approach of that answer in its completeness, it will be what we might expect at this point in the series of visions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "another mighty angel‚Äîas distinguished from the mighty angel who asked as to the former and more comprehensive book, 'Who is worthy to open the book?'" 
2. "clothed with a cloud‚Äîthe emblem of God coming in judgment."
3. "feet as pillars of fire‚Äî(Revelation 1:15; Ezekiel 1:7). The angel, as representative of Christ, reflects His glory and bears the insignia attributed in Revelation 1:15; Revelation 1:16; Revelation 4:3, to Christ Himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He looked with a benign aspect upon people, and the effect of his coming would be like that of sunshine after a storm."
2. "The brightness is probably the main idea, but the appearance of the angel would naturally suggest the ideas of intelligence and benignity."
3. "The symbol would denote that the new order of things would be attended with light; with knowledge; with what would be benign in its influence on human affairs."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A cloud. The expression occurs seven times in Revelation, and in all of them is connected with the Son of Man."
2. "Rainbow. See on ch. Revelation 4:3."
3. "Pillars of fire. Compare ch. 1 15."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "And the rainbow was upon his head. The article does not lead us to the well-known ordinary rainbow, or to the rainbow of Genesis 9:13, but to that already mentioned at chap. Revelation 4:3."
3. "And his face was as the sun. These words take us back to chap. Revelation 1:16, and again bring the sun before us in a light similar to that in which it is presented there, as the source of burning, scorching heat."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But the seventh trumpet does not sound till Revelation 11:15."
2. "The rainbow (Œ∑ ŒπœÅŒπœÇ). See Revelation 4:3 for this word."
3. "As the sun (œâœÇ Œø Œ∑ŒªŒπŒøœÇ). The very metaphor applied to Christ in Revelation 1:16."

### John Gill:
1. "He appears now as 'another' angel, distinct from the seven angels who had trumpets given them to sound, and six of which had already sounded."
2. "Christ appearing in this form at this time when the world was overflowed with Popery and Mahometanism, shows that God was still mindful of his covenant."
3. "His goings forth towards them in a way both of providence and grace, were in such a manner, as to strengthen and confirm them in the faith of him against all the powers of hell and earth."

### John Wesley:

2. "And yet it is not too glorious for a creature: the woman, Revelation 12:1, is described more glorious still."
