2. "The contents of the 'little hook' cannot well be confined to ch. xi. 1‚Äì13, or we should not have had so solemn an inauguration of it."
3.

2. "Thou must prophesy again (Œ¥Œµ œÉŒµ œÄŒ±ŒªŒπŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒµœÖœÉŒ±). Not a new commission (Revelation 1:19), though now renewed."
3. "Over (ŒµœÄ). In the case, in regard to as in John 12:16 (with Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜœâ), not in the presence of (ŒµœÄ with genitive, Mark 13:9) nor against (ŒµœÄ with the accusative, Luke 22:53)."
