## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The most natural reason for its use is to be found by comparison with the book of ch. v. ff. That was the great sealed roll of Godâ€™s purposes: this [see below] but one portion of those purposes, which was to be made the Seerâ€™s own for his future prophesyings." 
2. "The diminutive has been taken by some to point to the subsequent eating of the book by the Apostle: but DÃ¼sterdieck remarks that if so, even the little book would he too large."
3. "On the signification, &c., of this little book or roll, see below, ver. 8, notes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a roll little in comparison with the 'book' which contained the whole vast scheme of God's purposes, not to be fully read till the final consummation." 
	
2. "The New Testament begins with the word 'book' (Greek, 'biblus'), of which 'the little book' (Greek, 'biblaridion') is the diminutive, 'the little bible,' the Bible in miniature."

2. "The Bible became, at the Reformation, in fact an 'open' book. it was made accessible. It became the popular book of the world - the book that did more than all other things to change the aspect of affairs, and to give character to subsequent times." 
3. "That great work was designed manifestly by Providence to affect all the world - the sea and the land - the dwellers in the islands and in the continents - those who 'go down to the sea in ships, and do business in the great waters,' and those who have a permanent dwelling on shore."

### Marvin Vincent:

1. "By which is meant not the Bible, the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament; or the book of the Gospel, the substance of which lies in a little room, and is no other than the preaching of Christ, and him crucified, as God's way of salvation." 
2. "He was Lord and possessor of both, of the whole terraqueous globe, being the Maker and supporter of it; and that his Gospel should be spread all over the world, both on the continent and in the islands of the sea."
3. "That the abundance of the sea should be converted to him, or the maritime parts of the world should be subject to the sceptre of his grace and government; and that the earth, and the uttermost parts of it, should be his possession, though it was now almost wholly in the hands of the Turk and pope."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he had in his hand â€” His left hand: he swore with his right. He stood with his right foot on the sea, toward the west; his left, on the land, toward the east: so that he looked southward." 
2. "And so St. John (as Patmos lies near Asia) could conveniently take the book out of his left hand." 
3. "From this place the Revelation speaks more clearly and less figuratively than before."
