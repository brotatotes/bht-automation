## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole imagery represents the glory and majesty of Him whose messenger this angel is."
2. "The seven thunders... form a complete portion of the apocalyptic machinery."
3. "They were to be concealed, remaining unwritten: and this fact, I conceive, reflects back a tinge on the possessive genitive, making it so far emphatic: the voices were, and remained, their own: not shared by being perpetuated."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ, whom the angel represents, is often so symbolized: 'the Lion of the tribe of Juda.'" 
2. "The seven thunders. They form part of the Apocalyptic symbolism; and so are marked by the article as well known."
3. "Their full meaning shall be only known at the grand consummation marked by the seventh seal, the seventh trumpet, and the seventh vial."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The voice that sounded forth at the Reformation among the nations of Europe, breaking the slumbers of the Christian world, awaking the church to the evil of the existing corruptions and abominations, and summoning princes to the defense of the truth, might well be symbolized by the voice of an angel that was heard afar."
2. "The use of the article here naturally implies either that these seven thunders were something which had been before referred to, either expressly or impliedly; or that there was something about them which was so well known that it would be at once understood what was referred to."
3. "In like manner, the anathemas were hurled from Rome because the nations had been aroused by the loud cry for reformation, as if an angel had uttered that cry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb here is originally applied to the lowing of cattle, expressing the sound, moo - ka - omai." 
2. "The Jews were accustomed to speak of thunder as 'the seven voices.' Compare the sevenfold 'voice of the Lord,' Psalms 29:0."
3. "As usual, interpretation has run wild as to the seven thunders."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The seven thunders...perhaps John assuming them to be known."
2. "In Revelation 10:29 the Lord speaks in the sevenfold voice of the thunderstorm upon the sea."
3. "In John 12:28 the voice of the Father to Christ was thought by some to be thunder."

### John Gill:
1. "And cried with a loud voice....the voice of the lion of the tribe of Judah, which was heard far and near, throughout the whole world, by his people, and is terrible to his enemies."
2. "[The ministers of the Gospel] were 'Boanergeses', sons of thunder."
3. "These may signify the denunciations of God's judgments, and of his wrath, both upon the eastern and western antichrist, the Turk and pope."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he cried â€” Uttering the words set down, verse6." 
2. "Seven thunders uttered their voices â€” In distinct words, each after the other." 
3. "Those who spoke these words were glorious, heavenly powers, whose voice was as the loudest thunder."
