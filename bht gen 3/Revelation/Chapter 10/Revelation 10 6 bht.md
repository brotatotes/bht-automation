### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential idea in such an oath is an appeal to God; a solemn reference to Him as a witness; an utterance in the presence of Him who is acquainted with the truth or falsehood of what is said, and who will punish him who appeals to him falsely."
2. "He is now a witness, and he ever will be; he has now the power to detect and punish, and he ever will have the same power."
3. "The proper sense of this passage, then, according to the above interpretation would be 'And the angel lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth forever and ever, That the time should not yet be; but, in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be finished.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Swear by [œâŒºŒøœÉŒµŒΩ ŒµŒΩ] . Lit., 'swear in,' a Hebrew idiom."

3. "The words will bear to be rendered, as some have observed, 'that there should be delay no longer'; that is, of the coming and kingdom of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "By him that liveth for ever and ever ‚Äî Before whom a thousand years are but a day."
2. "Who created the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the things that are therein ‚Äî And, consequently, has the sovereign power over all."
