# Revelation 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The voice from heaven commanded, Go take the book which lieth open in the hand of the angel. This symbol of eating the book refers to a mission and commission from heaven, before the mystery should be finished. Just as it is necessary for ordinary prophesying or preaching to be called and sent by God, so too should one receive the Gospel and its doctrines with a commission from Jesus Christ, who has all power in heaven and in earth. This parallels the Angel's oath and the fulfilling of the mystery of God, explained in later chapters.
