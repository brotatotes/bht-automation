# Revelation 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel gives John a little book and commands him to eat it. This act represents the complete assimilation of its contents and the understanding of God's will. Initially, the taste is sweet as honey, symbolizing the pleasure derived from divine truth. However, as John comprehends the bitter message of judgment and impending persecutions, the sweetness turns to bitterness. This highlights the importance of diligently reading and meditating on the Scriptures, thoroughly considering and digesting their truths. Assimilating the Word brings both joy and sorrow.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And I went away to the angel telling him to give me the little book."
2. "Take and eat it up, and it shall embitter thy belly, but in thy mouth shall be sweet as honey."
3. "It shall embitter thy belly, but in thy mouth shall be sweet as honey."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His finding the roll sweet to the taste at first, is because it was the Lord's will he was doing, and because, divesting himself of carnal feeling, he regarded God's will as always agreeable, however bitter might be the message of judgment to be announced."
2. "Honey, sweet to the mouth, sometimes turns into bile in the stomach. The thought that God would be glorified gave him the sweetest pleasure. Yet, afterwards the belly, or carnal natural feeling, was embittered with grief at the prophecy of the coming bitter persecutions of the Church."
3. "The revelation of the secrets of futurity is sweet to one at first, but bitter and distasteful to our natural man, when we learn the cross which is to be borne before the crown shall be won."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Would not the readiness with which God gives his Bible into the hands of human beings, in contradistinction from all human efforts to restrain its use, and to prevent its free circulation, be well symbolized by this act?"
2. "He was to possess himself of the contents of the book; to receive it into his mind; to apply it, as we do food, for spiritual nourishment - truth having, in this respect, the same relation to the mind which food has to the body."
3. "It would well represent the pleasure derived from divine truth - the sweetness of the Word of God - the relish with which it is embraced by those that love it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "It shall make thy belly bitter... There is no reference in Ezekiel or Jeremiah to the bitterness here mentioned."
