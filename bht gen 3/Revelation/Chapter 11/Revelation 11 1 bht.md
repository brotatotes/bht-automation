## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thus understood, they can only bear one meaning viz. that of the Church of the elect servants of God, every where in this book symbolized by Jews in deed and truth."
2. "These are they who, properly speaking, alone are measured: estimated again and again in this book by tale and numberâ€”partakers in the first resurrection,â€”the Church of the first-born."
3. "The result of it is found in the subsequent prophecies: in the minute and careful distinctions between the servants of God and those who receive the mark of the wild-beastâ€”in all those indications which point out to us the length and breadth and depth and height, both of faith, and of unfaithfulness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reed, the canon of Scripture, the measuring reed of the Church, our rule of faith, speaks."
2. "The measurement of the Holy place seems to me to stand parallel to the sealing of the elect of Israel under the sixth seal."
3. "The literal temple at Jerusalem shall be the typical forerunner of the heavenly Jerusalem, in which there shall be all temple, and no portion exclusively set apart as temple."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The simple meaning is, that he who is thus addressed is directed to take an accurate estimate of the true church of God; as accurate as if he were to apply a measuring-reed to ascertain the dimensions of the temple at Jerusalem."
2. "There would be, therefore, a fulfillment of this, if at the time here referred to there should be occasions, from any cause, to inquire what constituted the true church; if it was necessary to separate and distinguish it from all other bodies; and if there should be any such prevailing uncertainty as to make an accurate investigation necessary."
3. "The direction here is equivalent, therefore, to a command to make an investigation on these subjects, and all that is implied would be fulfilled if a state of things should exist where it would be necessary to institute an examination into the prevailing views in the church on the subject of the atonement, and the true method of justification before God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The temple [Ï„Î¿Î½ Î½Î±Î¿Î½] . See on Matthew 4:5."
2. "The altar. Of incense, as that alone stood in the sacred place."
3. "Them that worship. Note the peculiar expressed, measuring the worshippers with a reed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reed is for measuring, but it is stronger than a common reed, and is thus more able to effect its purpose: it is like unto a rod." 
2. "The last clause alone is a sufficient proof that the three things to be measured are not to be understood literally. How could those who worship in the temple be thus measured with a reed?"
3. "His temple imagery is always drawn not from that building but from the Tabernacle first erected in the wilderness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A reed (ÎºÎ±Î»Î±Î¼Î¿Ï‚). Old word for a growing reed (Matthew 11:7) which grew in immense brakes in the Jordan valley, a writer's reed (3 John 1:7), a measuring-rod (here, Revelation 21:15; Ezekiel 40:3-6; Ezekiel 42:16-19)." 
2. "Some (Wellhausen) take it to be a scrap from the Zealot party before the destruction of Jerusalem, which event Christ also foretold (Mark 13:2; Matthew 24:2; Luke 21:6) and which was also attributed to Stephen (Acts 6:14)."
3. "There are three points in the interlude, however understood: the chastisement of Jerusalem or Israel (verses Revelation 11:1; Revelation 11:2), the mission of the two witnesses (Revelation 11:3-12), the rescue of the remnant (Revelation 11:13)."

### John Gill:
1. "and by it seems to be designed the holy Scripture, or the word of God, which is sometimes called a line, a rule, and rod..."
2. "and this is the use John, or those whom he represents, were to make of it..."
3. "a set of men in the last age were raised up, who drew a plan of churches, and of church discipline, according to the ancient model; gathered churches out of the world, and constituted them according to the order of the Gospel..."
