# Revelation 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Spirit of life from God entered into the witnesses, just as it did with Israel's dry bones in Ezekiel. This resurrection should not be understood as a physical one, but rather a civil one, where their spirits are revived and they have the courage to stand up again for Christ. Just like when Jesus was resurrected and the guards were struck with great fear, the same fear fell upon those who saw the witnesses standing on their feet.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And after the three days and an half, the Spirit of life from God entered in them." 
2. "The whole diction is closely imitated from that used of the dry bones in Ezek." 
3. "Great fear fell upon those who beheld them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Spirit of life—the same which breathed life into Israel's dry bones."
2. "The passage here, as there, is closely connected with Israel's restoration as a nation to political and religious life."
3. "Great fear—such as fell on the soldiers guarding Christ's tomb at His resurrection, when also there was a great earthquake."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The living, or life-giving Spirit that proceeds from God entered into them."
2. "If, when they had been compelled to cease from prophesying, they should, after the interval here denoted by three days and a half, again prophesy, or their testimony should be again borne to the truth as it had been before, this would evidently be all that would be implied in the language here employed."
3. "The fact that they seemed to come to life again would, therefore, fill them with consternation, for they would anticipate a renewal of their troubles, and they would see in this fact evidence of the divine favor toward those whom they persecuted, and reason to apprehend divine vengeance on themselves."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Spirit of life [πνευμα ζωης] . Rev., breath. See on John 3:8. 
Entered into them. Compare Ezekiel 37:1-10. 
Saw [θεωρουντας] . See on John 1:18.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The short time of the world’s triumph passes away." 
2. "A spirit of life out of God enters into them."
3. "They stand up upon their feet, and strike all beholders with terror."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The breath of life from God (πνευμα ζωης εκ του θεου). This phrase (πνευμα ζωης) occurs in Genesis 6:17; Genesis 7:15; Genesis 7:22 of the lower animals, but here there is clearly an allusion to Ezekiel 37:5; Ezekiel 37:10 (also 2 Kings 13:21), where the dead bones lived again."
2. "Entered into them (εισηλθεν εν αυτοις). Second aorist active indicative of εισερχομα with εν rather than εις after it (cf. Luke 9:46). The prophecy has here become fact (change from future πεμψουσιν to aorist εισηλθεν)."
3. "They stood upon their feet (εστησαν επ τους ποδας αυτων). Ingressive second aorist active indicative of ιστημ (intransitive). Reference to Ezekiel 37:10, but with the accusative in place of genitive there after επ as in 2 Kings 13:21."

### John Gill:
1. "This resurrection of the witnesses is not to be understood of a corporeal resurrection...but a civil resurrection of them, or a resurrection of them as witnesses, when their spirits will revive, and they will take heart and courage again to appear for Christ."
2. "And this may be understood of the same individual persons that were silenced, or of those that succeeded such that corporeally died in the war of the beast...they appearing in the same spirit they did."
3. "And great fear fell upon them which saw them; in this posture; either on their enemies...that the things which they had foretold concerning their ruin are now coming upon them; that they shall be turned out of their places of profit, and lose all their worldly advantages, and carnal pleasures now, and be miserable to all eternity."

### John Wesley:
1. And great fear fell upon them that saw them — And now knew that God was on their side.
