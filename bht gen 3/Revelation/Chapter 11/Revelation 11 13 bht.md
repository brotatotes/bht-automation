### Henry Alford:
1. "The number is carefully and precisely stated, as if the name of each were recounted."

3. "The giving glory to God is not equivalent in the Scriptures to thanking God, but is, as Bengel notices, 'a mark of conversion or at all events, of the recognition of God.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Six is the number of the world power's greatest triumph, but at the same time verges on seven, the divine number, when its utter destruction takes place."
2. "The nine-tenths remain and become when purified the center of Christ's earthly kingdom."

2. "The destruction, we may suppose, would extend to all that was represented by the persecuting power."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Gave glory to the God of heaven."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The city is without doubt â€˜the great cityâ€™ of Revelation 11:8; but only a tenth part falls because judgment does not yet descend in all its fullness."
3. "The two witnesses are thus believers who, amidst all the defection of others, remain faithful to their Lord.

3. "and gave glory to the God of heaven; will acknowledge the justice of God, and the righteousness of his judgments upon those that were slain, and his goodness to them who are spared; will confess their transgressions and sins they have been guilty of; and give the glory of their deliverance, not to their idols and images, but to the true God, whose religion they now embrace."

### John Wesley:
