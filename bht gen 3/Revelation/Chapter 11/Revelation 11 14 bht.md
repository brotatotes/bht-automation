## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Behold, the third woe cometh quickly."
2. "Before he [the Seer] does so, another series of prophetic visions must be given, regarding not merely the dwellers on the earth, but the Church herself, her glory and her shame, her faithfulness and her apostasy."
3. "Godâ€™s avenging judgments on the earth, in answer to the prayers of His saints, having reached their final point of accomplishment, and the armies of heaven having given solemn thanks for the hour being come, again the veil is dropt, and again a new procession of visions begins from the beginning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The second woeâ€”that under the sixth trumpet... Woe to the world, joy to the faithful, as their redemption draweth nigh."
2. "The third woe cometh quickly... Instead of the third woe being detailed, the grand consummation is summarily noticed, the thanksgiving of the twenty-four elders in heaven for the establishment of Christ's kingdom on earth..."
3. "...attended with the destruction of the destroyers of the earth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "During that long period of apostasy, darkness, corruption, and sin, there would be faithful witnesses for the truth, who, though they were few in number, would be sufficient to keep up the knowledge of the truth on the earth, and to bear testimony against the prevailing errors and abominations." 
2. "No events have ever taken place in history that would be better compared with the shock of an earthquake than those which occurred when the long-established governments of Europe, and especially the domination of the papacy, so long consolidated and confirmed, were shaken by the Reformation."
3. "The sudden destruction of a tenth part of a great city by an earthquake would well represent the convulsion at the breaking out of the Reformation, by which a considerable portion of the papal power would fall."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The object of the verse, therefore, is to remind us of what we might perhaps have forgotten, that the second woe had closed some time before."
