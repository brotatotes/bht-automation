## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ark of the Covenant is seen, the symbol of Godâ€™s faithfulness in bestowing grace on His people, and inflicting vengeance on His peopleâ€™s enemies." 
2. "It is from this temple that the judgments proceed forth...from His inmost and holiest place that those acts of vengeance are wrought which the great multitude in heaven recognize as faithful and true."
3. "The symbolism of this verse, the opening for the first time of the heavenly temple, also indicates of what nature the succeeding visions are to be: that they will relate to Godâ€™s covenant people and His dealings with them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. ". . . the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven vials, are not consecutive, but parallel, and ending in the same consummation. They present the unfolding of God's plans for bringing about the grand end under three different aspects, mutually complementing each other."
2. "Here first His secret place, the heavenly sanctuary, is opened for the assurance of His people; and thence proceed His judgments in their behalf."
3. "This then is parallel to the scene at the heavenly altar, at the close of the seals and opening of the trumpets, and at the close of the episode and opening of the vials."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I regard this verse, therefore, which should have been separated from the eleventh chapter and attached to the twelfth, as the introduction to a new series of visions, similar to what we have in the introduction of the previous series." (Commentary on Revelation 11:19)
2. "The grand instrumentality in overcoming this foe was 'the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their testimony'; that is, the great doctrines of truth pertaining to the work of the Redeemer would be employed for this purpose." (Commentary on Revelation 12:10-12)
3. "The church is persecuted; becomes obscure and almost unknown, but still is mysteriously sustained; and when most in danger of being wholly swallowed up, is kept as if a miracle were performed in its defense." (Commentary on Revelation 12:13-15)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The temple [Î¿ Î½Î±Î¿Ï‚] . The sanctuary. Compare ver. 1 and see on Matthew 4:5."
2. "The ark of His covenant [Î· ÎºÎ¹Î²Ï‰Ï„Î¿Ï‚ Ï„Î·Ï‚ Î´Î¹Î±Î¸Î·ÎºÎ·Ï‚ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï…] . Kibwtov ark, meaning generally any wooden box or chest used of the ark in the tabernacle only here and Hebrews 9:4."
3. "The solemn salvos, so to speak, of the artillery of heaven, with which each series of visions is concluded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word â€˜templeâ€™ is apt to mislead, for we immediately think of the temple on Mount Moriah; but the innermost shrine is alone spoken of in the original, that most Holy Place which belonged not only to the later temple but to the Tabernacle in the wilderness."
2. "The â€˜ark of Godâ€™s covenantâ€™ is the symbol of Godâ€™s covenant love to His people; the type of the Incarnate Lord in whose heart the Law of God is laid up, and who is the â€˜propitiatoryâ€™ (Romans 3:25) or Mercy-seat."
3. "We have similar judgments... They do not yet fall upon the earth, but are symbols of what is to come."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For the symbols of majesty and power in nature here see also Revelation 6:12; Revelation 8:5; Revelation 11:13; Revelation 16:18; Revelation 16:21."
2. "The sacred ark within the second veil of the tabernacle (Hebrews 9:4) and in the inner chamber of Solomon's temple (1 Kings 8:6) which probably perished when Nebuchadrezzar burnt the temple (2 Kings 25:9; Jeremiah 3:16)."
3. "The sanctuary (Î½Î±Î¿Ï‚) of God in heaven see Revelation 3:12; Revelation 7:15; Revelation 15:5; Revelation 21:22."

### John Gill:
1. "The sense is, that at this time the pure worship of God will be restored, and there will be a free and uninterrupted exercise of it; the temple will be open to all; here everyone may come, and sit, and worship without fear."
2. "Now in this spiritual Gospel church state, through the pure ministry of the word, and the faithful administration of ordinances, the mysteries of the Gospel, into which angels desire to look, signified by the cherubim over the mercy seat, will be clearly revealed to all Christians, Jews and Gentiles."
3. "which may be understood of the vials of God's wrath, that will be poured out upon the pope and Turk; which though mentioned last, will be first, and make way for this spiritual state; particularly the things here spoken of may be compared with what will be at the pouring out of the seventh vial."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the ark of the covenant was seen in his temple â€” The ark of the covenant which was made by Moses was not in the second temple, being probably burnt with the first temple by the Chaldeans. But here is the heavenly ark of the everlasting covenant, the shadow of which was under the Old Testament, Hebrews 9:4." 
2. "The inhabitants of heaven saw the ark before: St. John also saw it now; for a testimony, that what God had promised, should be fulfilled to the uttermost."
3. "And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail â€” The very same there are, and in the same order, when the seventh angel has poured out his phial; Revelation 16:17-21: one place answers the other. What the trumpet here denounces in heaven, is there executed by the phial upon earth. First it is shown what will be done; and afterwards it is done."
