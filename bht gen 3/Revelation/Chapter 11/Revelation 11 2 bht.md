# Revelation 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of tribulation, the outer court of the temple, symbolizing those who are not true worshippers, will be measured and left to its fate for forty-two months, representing the triumph of the Gentiles. The outer court, including all that is outside the Holy and Most Holy places, will be thrown out and profaned by the Gentiles. This will be a period when many faithless Church members fall into the power of the nations, while the true worshippers who have access to the inner court and altar are preserved.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That only the temple itself, in the strictest sense, is to be measured, is significant for the meaning above maintained."
2. "The outer church being in subjection to them: see Luke xxi. 24, Dan. viii. 13."
3. "An apocalyptic commentary which explains every thing, is self-convicted of error."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not to be measured; whereas the Holy Place is."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is undoubtedly reference here to the 'court of the Gentiles,' as it was called among the Jews... In forming an estimate of those who... were true worshippers of God, only those would be regarded as such who had the privilege of access to the inner court, and to the altar." 
2. "The interpretation would demand that they should sustain some relation to the church, or that they would seem to belong to it - as the court did to the temple; but still that this was in appearance only, and that in estimating the true church it was necessary to leave them out altogether." 
3. "And, if the preceding exposition of the tenth chapter is correct, then it may be presumed that this would refer to something that was to occur at about the period there referred to. Regarding it, then, as applicable to the time of the Reformation, and as being a continuation of the vision... we shall find, in the events of that period, what would be properly symbolized by the language used here."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The court which is without the temple. Not merely the outer court, or Court of the Gentiles, but including all that is not within the naov, the Holy and Most Holy places."
2. "Leave out [ÎµÎºÎ²Î±Î»Îµ ÎµÎ¾Ï‰]. Lit., throw out, i e., of the measurement."
3. "Forty and two months. A period which appears in three forms in Revelation: forty - two months (ch. 13 5); twelve hundred and sixty days (ver. 3, ch. 12 6); a time, times and half a time, or three years and a half (12, 14, compare Daniel 7:25; Daniel 12:7)"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The faithless members of the Church, those who have yielded to the power of the world, have been given over to the nations, the nations of chap. Revelation 10:11, of chap. Revelation 20:3."
2. "The sense, whatever it be, is metaphorical, as in the case of the â€˜temple,â€™ the â€˜altar,â€™ and the â€˜court.â€™ Jerusalem was the place which God had originally designed to be the residence of His people."
3. "All the three numbers have essentially the same mystic meaning. Not only, however, is this the case; the considerations now adduced lead to the further conclusion that the three periods referred to denote not three periods of the same length but the same period, and that the change of nomenclature is due to the difference of aspect under which the period is viewed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This outer court is left to its fate."
2. "John is to cast it out and leave to its fate (given to the Gentiles in another sense) to be profaned by them."
3. "This period, however its length may be construed, covers the duration of the triumph of the Gentiles, of the prophesying of the two witnesses, of the sojourn of the woman in the wilderness."

### John Gill:
1. "this outward court, or the worshippers in it, intend a distinct set of worshippers from the internal worshippers, the priests of God in the temple, altar, and inner court, and from the Gentiles...and which are very numerous, as the worshippers in the outward court were."
2. "the bulk of the reformed churches, the crowd of outward court worshippers, will be gained over to the Popish party, and fall off to the church of Rome, to which their doctrines and practices are plainly verging"
3. "the holy city" is meant all the kingdoms of Europe, or what has been called Christendom, the western empire as Christian...and the duration of this tyrannical and oppressive reign will be forty and two months"

### John Wesley:
1. "The old temple had a court in the open air, for the heathens who worshipped the God of Israel."
2. "And it has been trodden almost ever since by the Romans, Persians, Saracens, and Turks."
3. "But that severe kind of treading which is here peculiarly spoken of, will not be till under the trumpet of the seventh angel, and toward the end of the troublous times."
