## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The actions of the two witnesses are just those of Moses when witnessing for God against Pharaoh...and of Elijah causing fire by his word to devour the enemy."
2. "The two olive trees are channels of the oil feeding the Church, and symbols of peace. The Holy Spirit is the oil in them."
3. "Their very exterior aspect accorded with their teachings: so Elijah, and John who came in His spirit and power. The sackcloth of the witnesses is a catch word linking this episode under the sixth trumpet, with the sun black as sackcloth in righteous retribution on the apostates who rejected God's witnesses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential meaning of this passage then is, that there would be 'a competent number' of witnesses in the case; that is, as many as would be regarded as sufficient to establish the points concerning which they would testify, with perhaps the additional idea that the number would be small."
2. "The word, as used here, refers to those who, during this period of 'forty and two months,' would thus be witnesses for Christ in the world; that is, who would bear their testimony to the truth of his religion, to the doctrines which he had revealed, and to what was required of man - who would do this amidst surrounding error and corruption, and when exposed to persecutions and trials on account of their belief."
3. "Though the 'holy city' - the church - would seem to be wholly trodden down, yet there would be a few at least who would assert the great doctrines of true godliness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The conception of the Apocalypse is powerfully molded by John's recollections of the life of Jesus; that there is a close parallelism between the Apocalypse and the delineation of the life of Christ contained in the fourth Gospel; and that the Apocalypse is, in the deeper conceptions which pervade it, a repetition of the Gospel."
2. "They shall prophesy [œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒµœÖœÉŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ]. See on prophet, Luke 7:26. Commonly explained of preaching repentance, though some take it in the later sense of foretelling future events."
3. "Clothed in sackcloth. The garb of preachers of repentance. Compare Isaiah 22:12; Jeremiah 4:8; Jonah 3:5; Matthew 3:4. For sackcloth see on Luke 10:13."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The witnesses receive both the words of their prophecy and the power to utter them."
2. "The duty of ‚Äòprophesying‚Äô laid upon them is that of proclaiming the truth of God for the instruction or warning of men."
3. "The clothing with sackcloth...indicates the sufferings which the witnesses shall endure in delivering their message."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The idiom that follows is Hebraic instead of either the infinitive after Œ¥ŒπŒ¥œâŒº as in Revelation 2:7; Revelation 3:21; Revelation 6:4; Revelation 7:2; Revelation 13:7; Revelation 13:15; Revelation 16:8 or ŒπŒΩŒ± with the subjunctive (Revelation 9:5; Revelation 19:8) we have Œ∫Œ± œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒµœÖœÉŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ (and they shall prophesy)."
2. "The article seems to point to two well-known characters, like Elijah, Elisha, but there is no possible way to determine who they are. All sorts of identifications have been attempted."
3. "The dress suited the message (Matthew 11:21)."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom are meant, not Enoch and Elias, as some of the ancient fathers thought...but these witnesses intend the ministers of the Gospel and churches of Christ, who have bore testimony for Christ, and against antichrist."
2. "No two individual persons can be meant, since these witnesses were to prophesy 1260 days, that is, so many years, but a succession of ministers and churches."
3. "Clothed in sackcloth; expressive...of their outward state and condition, being poor, mean, and abject, while the followers of the beast are clad in silks, and live deliciously; or else of the inward frame of their minds, as mourning for the sad estate of the church of Christ, groaning under the tyranny and persecutions of antichrist."

### John Wesley:
1. "These seem to be two prophets; two select, eminent instruments."
2. "So long will they prophesy, both by word and deed, witnessing that Jesus is the Son of God, the heir of all things."
3. "The habit of the deepest mourners, out of sorrow and concern for the people."
