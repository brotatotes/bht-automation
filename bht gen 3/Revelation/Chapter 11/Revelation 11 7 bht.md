## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The character of the beast is that he cometh up out of the abyss."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word, then, may here refer not to 'time,' meaning that, these events would occur at the end of the 'thousand two hundred and threescore days,' but to the fact that what is here stated would occur when they had completed their testimony in the sense of having testified all that they were 'appointed' to testify; that is, when they had borne full witness for God, and fully uttered his truth."
2. "These things serve to characterize the 'beast' as distinguished from all other things, and they are so numerous and definite, that it would seem to have been intended to make it easy to understand what was meant when the power referred to should appear."
3. "Will endeavor to exterminate them by force. This clearly is not intended to be a general statement that they would be persecuted, but to refer to the particular manner in which the opposition would be conducted.

"But their prophesying will continue to the end of the beast's reign, these two being contemporary, of equal date, beginning and ending together; for they will prophesy when they are dead; being dead they will yet speak, and their very death will be a prophesying or foretelling that the ruin of antichrist is at hand."

"Now this filthy and savage beast shall make war against them the witnesses; a war he has been making against the saints ever since he was in power, by his decrees, his counsels, his anathemas, and by sword, fire, and faggot...this will be his last war, and it will be a dreadful one; it will be the last struggle of the beast."
3. "not but that in this war there may be a great slaughter, and much blood shed, in a literal sense: but the killing spoken of seems to regard them, not as men, but as witnesses; they will not be suffered to bear an open testimony any longer; they will be silenced...so that their ministrations will be quite shut up, and at an end."
