## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "On this period we may remark, that these 3 Â½ days are connected by analogy with the periods previously mentioned: with the 1260 days and 42 months = 3 years: and that in each case the half of the mystic number 7 enters."
2. "Elliottâ€™s calculation of this period as 3 Â½ years...labours under this fatal defect;â€”that whereas his 3 years...are years of 365 days, his half-year...is '180, or half 360 days:' i.e. wanting 2 Â½ days of the time required according to that reckoning."
3. "I may observe, that in his Apocalypsis Alfordiana...he has repeated this inconsistency."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Three and a half days answer to the three and a half years, the half of seven, the full and perfect number."
2. "In righteous retribution in kind, the flesh of the Antichristian hosts is not buried, but given to all the fowls in mid-heaven to eat."
3. "The prophetic present."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential idea is, that there would be an assemblage of different classes of people to whom their carcasses would be exposed, and that they would come and look upon them."
2. "This might be either literally three days and a half, or, more in accordance with the usual style of this book, these would be prophetic days; that is, three years and a half."

2. "Shall not suffer [Î¿Ï…Îº Î±Ï†Î·ÏƒÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î½] . Read ajfiousin do not suffer."
3. "To be put in graves [Ï„ÎµÎ¸Î·Î½Î±Î¹ ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ Î¼Î½Î·Î¼Î±Ï„Î±] . Read mnhma a tomb, as Rev. Compare Genesis 23:4; Isaiah 14:19, Isaiah 14:20."
