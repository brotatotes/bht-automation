## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And a great (important in its meaning, as well as vast in its appearance) sign (one of those appearances by which God signified to John the revelations of this book, ch. i. 1) was seen in heaven..."
2. "The whole symbolism points to the Church, the bride of God: and of course, from the circumstances afterwards related, the Old Test. church, at least at this beginning of the vision."
3. "And this result is a most important one for the fixity of reference of the whole prophecy. It forms one of those landmarks by which the legitimacy of various interpretations may be tested; and of which we may say, notwithstanding the contradiction sure to be given to the saying, that every interpretation which oversteps their measure is thereby convicted of error."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Clothed with the Sun, the Church is the bearer of divine supernatural light in the world."
2. "The moon, though standing above the sea and earth, is altogether connected with them and is an earthly light: sea, earth, and moon represent the worldly element, in opposition to the kingdom of God."
3. "The woman cannot mean, literally, the virgin mother of Jesus, for she did not flee into the wilderness and stay there for 1260 days, while the dragon persecuted the remnant of her seed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The woman, beyond all question, represents the church."
2. "Is the splendor of the sunlight designed to denote the brightness of the gospel? Is the moon designed to represent the comparatively feeble light of the Jewish dispensation?"
3. "If the woman here is designed to symbolize the church, then the number twelve has, in all probability, some allusion either to the twelve tribes of Israel... or to the twelve apostles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Wonder. Better, as Rev., sign."
2. "Clothed. Rev., better, arrayed."
3. "The symbol is usually taken to represent the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The woman is completely enveloped in light. This is not secured by the simple mention of the sun as her garment, for that only wraps her body round from the shoulders to the feet. The other bodies of light which shine in heaven are therefore called into requisition. By means of them she has light around, beneath, and above her." 
2. "The stars are not set as jewels in her crown. They are her crown, a crown of victory." 
3. "The woman is a conqueror, and twelve is the number of the Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first 'sign in heaven' is a Woman--the earliest appearance of a female figure in the Apocalyptic vision."
2. "Certainly she is not the Virgin Mary, as verse Revelation 12:17 makes clear."
3. "The figure is a bold one with the moon 'under her feet' and 'a crown of twelve stars,' a possible allusion to the twelve tribes or to the twelve apostles."

### John Gill:
1. "This vision begins a new account of things, and represents the church in the apostles' times, and purer ages of Christianity, and under the Heathen and Arian persecutions."
2. "The church apostolical is here called 'a woman', because the church was not now in its infancy, in nonage, as under the former dispensation, but grown up, mature, and at full age."
3. "The church openly owned the doctrine of the apostles, and was not ashamed of it before men, and publicly preached, and held it forth in her ministers, to all the world."
