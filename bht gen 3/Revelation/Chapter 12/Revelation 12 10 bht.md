2. "the salvation (namely, fully, finally, and victoriously accomplished... yet future; hence, not till now do the blessed raise the fullest hallelujah for salvation to the Lamb."
3. "Hence the need that the oppressed Church, God's own elect (like the widow, continually coming, so as even to weary the unjust judge), should cry day and night unto Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now is come salvation - That is, complete deliverance from the power of Satan."
2. "And strength - That is, now is the mighty power of God manifested in casting down and subduing the great enemy of the church."
3. "Perhaps the most skillful thing that Satan does, and the thing by which he most contributes to diminish the influence of the church, is in thus causing 'accusations' to be brought against the people of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Now is come the salvation, etc., means that these are realized and established." 
2. "The correct form of the Greek for accuser is a transcript of the Rabbinical Hebrew, kathgwr." 
3. "The aorist tense. Once and for all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Now is come (Œ±œÅœÑ ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒµœÑŒø). ŒëœÅœÑ (John 13:33) shows how recent the downfall of Satan here proleptically pictured as behind us in time (aorist tense ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒµœÑŒø)."
2. "The power (Œ∑ Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπœÇ). Gods power over the dragon (cf. Revelation 7:12; Revelation 11:17; Revelation 19:1)."
3. "Which accuseth them (Œø Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅœâŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖœÇ). Articular present active participle of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒµœâ, old verb, to accuse, usually with the genitive of the person (John 5:45), but here with the accusative. This is the devil's constant occupation (Job 1:6)."

### John Gill:
1. "salvation" was come when Christ obtained it by his sufferings and death, and comes to particular persons in the effectual calling, and it will only be fully come when it is perfectly enjoyed in heaven.
2. now was come "strength"; not the strength of Christ personal, displayed in the redemption of his people; but rather of Christ mystical, of his church and interest, which had been very weak and low, and under oppression and persecution, but was now exalted, and in a flourishing condition, and was become strong and mighty.
3. here was now an illustrious appearance of the kingdom of God in the world, such as had never been before; and which was a pledge and presage of the greatness of the kingdom, or of that everlasting kingdom which will be set up hereafter, when all other kingdoms will be at an end.

### John Wesley:
1. "The might ‚Äî whereby the enemy is cast out."
2. "The kingdom ‚Äî Here the majesty of God is shown."
3. "The accuser of our brethren ‚Äî So long as they remained on earth."
