## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His voice is heard before God no more: the day of acceptance in Christ Jesus has dawned." 
2. "Satan‚Äôs being cast out of heaven to the earth is the result...of the appointed conflict with his faithful fellow-angels led on by the archangel Michael."
3. "I would appeal...to the solemnity of the terms here used, and the particularity of the designation, and ask whether it is possible to understand this of the mere casting down of paganism from the throne of the Roman empire?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is a vision of the persecuted church - of the woman fleeing into the desert - and the course of the narrative is here interrupted by going back Revelation 12:7-13 to describe the conflict which led to this result."
2. "Michael, the archangel, is here represented as the guardian of the church, and as contending against Satan for its protection."
3. "If Satan is permitted to make war against the church, there is no improbability in supposing that, in those higher regions where the war is carried on, and in those aspects of it which lie beyond the power and the knowledge of man, good angels should be employed to defeat his plans."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Wesley:
1. "There was war in heaven - Here Satan makes his grand opposition to the kingdom of God; but an end is now put to his accusing the saints before God." 
2. "And Michael executes the sentence. That Michael is a created angel, appears from his not daring, in disputing with Satan, Jude 9, to bring a railing accusation; but only saying, 'The Lord rebuke thee.'" 
3. "And this modesty is implied in his very name; for Michael signifies, 'Who is like God?' which implies also his deep reverence toward God, and distance from all self-exaltation."
