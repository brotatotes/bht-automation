### John Gill:
1. "And besides, as the dragon was contriving a new way of persecuting the saints, and about to raise up a beast out of the sea, by which he might do it, to whom he would give his power, seat, and authority, he is represented as standing in a proper place for this purpose; it was upon the sand, which may signify a multitude of people employed by him, and also may denote the weakness and failure of his efforts in the issue."
2. "nor the old Roman empire, though there are many things which seem to agree; the Roman monarchy is called a beast it is one of the four beasts in Daniel 7:2; which rose up out of the sea, from a multitude of people and nations, which were gathered to it and composed it."
3. "it remains then, that by it meant the Roman empire, when divided into ten kingdoms, and united in the Papacy; or it designs Christ in his secular power, with the ten kings, that receive power with him as such one hour, and give their kingdom to him: now this beast is said to 'rise up out of the sea'; either out of the abyss, the bottomless pit of hell, see Revelation 11:7; or out of the sea of this world, and the wicked in it, who are like a troubled sea that cannot rest;"

### John Wesley:
1. "The danger is near. Be armed both against force and fraud, even with the whole armour of God."
2. "The beast is the Romish Papacy, as it came to a point six hundred years since, stands now, and will for some time longer."
3. "Thus the time of the ascent of the beast is clear. The apostasy and mystery of iniquity gradually increased till he arose, 'who opposeth and exalteth himself above all.'"
