## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And it worketh all the power (performs all the acts of authority) of the first beast in his presence."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This shows a remarkable relationship between these two beasts; and proves that it was intended to refer to the same power substantially, though manifested in a different form."
2. "In fact, on these points they have been identical. The one has sustained the other; either one would long since have fallen if it had not been upheld by the other."
3. "The Roman civil power would have long ago lost all its influence and been unknown if it had not been for the papacy; and, in fact, all the influence which it has had since the irruption of the northern barbarians...can be traced to that new power which arose in the form of the papacy."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "Making war with the saints by preaching and writing against them, by anathemas, excommunications, and bulls, and so overcame and silenced them."
2. "Ruling over the consciences of men in a tyrannical way, in all nations, kindreds, and tongues, in the empire."
