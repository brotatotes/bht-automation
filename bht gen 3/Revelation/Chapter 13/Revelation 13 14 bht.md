# Revelation 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The imposture of the pagan sacerdotal power succeeds because of the miracles performed in its presence. However, the credibility of a professed revelation lies in its harmony with God's revealed will. The mentioned image could be a likeness of the emperor worshipped by the people. The papacy sustains itself through deception and pretends miracles, drawing parallels to the Roman power's decline and the rise of the papacy. This warns against the gullibility of the public and the danger of false teaching.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The imposture succeeds, because of the miracles which it was given to him to work in the presence of the beast." 
2. "This part of the prophecy seems to describe the acts of the pagan 'sacerdotal power then presently to follow."
3. "See more below."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Even a miracle is not enough to warrant belief in a professed revelation unless that revelation be in harmony with God's already revealed will."
2. "On account of (because of; in consequence of) those miracles."
3. "Marking, perhaps, a personal Antichrist."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nothing could possibly be more descriptive of the papacy than this. It has been kept up by deception and delusion, and its pretended miracles have been, and are to this day, the means by which this is done."
2. "The main fact here stated, that the papacy would endeavor to sustain itself by pretended miracles, is confirmed by an incidental remark of Mr. Gibbon... 'The credulity or the prudence of Gregory was always disposed to confirm the truths of religion by the evidence of ghosts, miracles, and resurrections'"
3. "All this in fact occurred in the decline of the Roman power after the time of Constantine, and its final apparent extinction, as if 'wounded to death,' in the exile of the last of the emperors... In the empire which then sprung up, and which owed much of its influence to the sustaining aid of the papacy, we discern the 'image' of the former Roman power; the prolongation of the Roman ascendency over the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word also involves the idea of manifestation." (Commentary)
2. "The image involves the likeness, but the likeness does not involve the image." (Commentary)
3. "Christ is therefore the eijkwn of God." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'deceiveth' again leads us to the thought of false teaching."
2. "The thought of the Seer appears to be as follows: first, we have God, the Son the true 'image' of God, and man 'renewed' in the Son 'after the image of Him that created him.' Secondly, we have the first beast or the world-power in all the ungodliness of its spirit, that spirit supposed to be incarnated in its 'image,' and men so created after that image that they may be said to be 'of their father the devil.'"
3. "But, according to the constant teaching of St. John, men who are made make. They love the darkness; they choose the evil; their will is active not passive in the matter."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a constant cause for wonder, the gullibility of the public at the hands of new charlatans who continually bob up with their pipe-dreams."
2. "This 'image'... of the emperor could be his head upon a coin... a bust in metal or stone, a statue, anything that people could be asked to bow down before and worship."
3. "This language can refer to the death of Nero by his own sword."

### John Gill:
1. "The Complutensian edition, and two of Stephens's copies, read 'mine', instead of 'them'; creatures of God, and professors of Christ, carnal and unregenerate men; not the elect of God, and true believers in Christ, these cannot be deceived."
2. "The secular power of the Papacy encouraging, confirming, and giving a sanction to those lying miracles, and obliging all to believe them, and come into the things, doctrines, or practices, they are designed to promote."
3. "But rather this designs the image worship, or the worshipping of idols of gold and silver, of wood and stone, which he caused the inhabitants of the earth to make, and give adoration to; or else the whole Papal religion, and the Papacy itself, for the beast, and the image of the beast, are all along in this book afterwards mentioned together as being the same."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The imposture of the pagan sacerdotal power succeeds through the miracles performed in the presence of the beast, but even these miracles do not validate the professed revelation unless it aligns with God's already revealed will. The image that is mentioned could be the likeness of the emperor upon a coin or a statue, anything that people are asked to bow down before and worship. The papacy, described by its deception and pretenses, sustains itself through these pretended miracles, and its influence over the world can be seen as the prolongation of the Roman ascendency. Ultimately, this verse warns against the gullibility of the public and the danger of false teaching.
