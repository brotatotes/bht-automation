### Henry Alford:
1. "The Seer is now describing facts which history substantiates to us in their literal fulfilment."

3. "We cannot help, as we read, thinking of the moving images, and winking and speaking pictures, so often employed for purposes of imposture by their far less excusable Papal successors."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "This image may be said to speak by the decrees, canons, anathemas, curses, threatenings, persuasions, doctrines, and blasphemies of the pope and his clergy."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Seer is describing the historical reality and literal fulfillment of the events mentioned in the verse. The image of Caesar, which people were made to worship, led to the testing and martyrdom of Christians. This brings to mind the moving and speaking images used by the less excusable Papal successors for deceitful purposes. The refusal to worship the image by the three Hebrews, who were then cast into a furnace, serves as a type of the last apostasy. False doctrine will give a philosophical appearance to the foolish apotheosis of the creaturely, personified by Antichrist, just as Julian, the apostate, set up his own image with idols, making Christians appear to worship the idols. The power to work magical tricks, like ventriloquism, was endowed to the second beast, and refusal to worship the image of the emperor was punishable by death. This reflects the authority and submissive nature demanded by the governing power, enforcing civil homage. The image may be said to speak through the decrees, doctrines, and blasphemies of the pope, and refusal to embrace the Popish religion often resulted in death.
