# Revelation 13:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The calculated numerical value of letters in names point to commercial and spiritual restrictions imposed on non-conformity by both Pagan and Papal persecutors. Conformity and addiction to the beast's behests are symbolized by the mark, which may not be visible but rather allegorical. This mark resembles the sign of the cross in Popery, representing allegiance. The number of the name serves as a boycott against those who do not worship the emperor. The struggle of the Church against its enemies mirrors Christ's own struggle, facing degenerate Judaism within the Christian Church.
