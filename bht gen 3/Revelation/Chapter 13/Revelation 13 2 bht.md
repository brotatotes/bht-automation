## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And the beast...was like...a leopard...feet as of a bear...and its mouth as...a lion..." 
2. "...this beast, this earthly persecuting power, was the vicegerent and instrument of the devil...and used by him for his purposes of hostility..."
3. "...hostility against the remnant of the seed of the woman."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It represents comprehensively in one figure the world power of all times and places, not merely of one period and one locality, viewed as opposed to God." 
2. "This view is favored also by the fact, that the beast is the vicarious representative of Satan, who similarly has seven heads and ten horns: a general description of his universal power in all ages and places of the world." 
3. "Satan appears as a serpent, as being the archetype of the beast nature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this description, it is observable that John has combined in one animal or monster, all those which Daniel brought successively on the scene of action as representing different empires."
2. "At the same time there was an obvious propriety in the symbol itself; for the bloodthirstiness and cruelty of the leopard would well represent the ferocity and cruelty of the Roman power, especially as John saw it here as the great antagonistic power of the true church, sustaining the papal claim, and thirsting for blood."
3. "The authority was great. It extended over a large part of the earth, and, alike in its extent and character, it was such as we may suppose Satan would set up in the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A leopard [œÄŒ±œÅŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒµŒπ]...stands for either. Leopard is leo - pard, the lion - pard, which was supposed to be a mongrel between a panther and a lioness." 
2. "Bear. Compare Daniel 7:5."
3. "Lion. Compare Daniel 7:4."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The qualities represented are the most offensive of their kind, the swift cruel spring of the leopard, the brutish relentlessness of the bear, and the devouring power of the lion."
2. "The ‚Äòbeast‚Äô before us is thus the symbol of the world-power in its absoluteness and universality."
3. "Finally, we may remark that, in so far as the power of Rome enters into the description, it can only be that of Pagan, not Christian, Rome."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The leopard (ŒªŒµŒø, œÄŒ±œÅŒ¥) was considered a cross between a panther and a lioness."
2. "The strength and brutality of the Babylonian, Median, and Persian empires appeared in the Roman Empire. The catlike vigilance of the leopard, the slow and crushing power of the bear, and the roar of the lion were all familiar features to the shepherds in Palestine (Swete)."
3. "The beast is simply Satan's agent. Satan claimed this power to Christ (Matthew 4:9; Luke 4:6) and Christ called Satan the prince of this world (John 12:31; John 14:30; John 16:11). So the war is on."

### John Gill:
1. "And to which the Roman Papal monarchy bears some resemblance; for as the Grecian monarchy was divided into several parts, which the leopard's spots may also point out, so the Roman empire was divided into ten parts, and united under the pope, as the head of them..."
2. "It lies in wait for its prey, and suddenly falls upon it, and devours it; and is a lively picture of the cunning sleight of the antichristian party, who lie in wait to deceive, and of their blood thirstiness and barbarity."
3. "He gave him his cunning and subtlety, as the old serpent, and taught him his arts and tricks to deceive mankind; and gave him a power to do signs and lying wonders, as well as communicated his malice and cruelty to persecute and oppress the saints..."
