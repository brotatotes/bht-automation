# Revelation 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This seems to represent the Roman pagan Empire, which having long been a head of the beast, was crushed and to all appearance exterminated. The stroke of its death was healed in the establishment of the Christian Roman Empire. The whole earth wondered after the beast, as they followed or gazed after it. Though seemingly slain, it remains the beast still, to rise again in another form. A new and worse heathenism breaks in upon the Christianized world, more devilish than the old one.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This seems to represent the Roman pagan Empire, which having long been a head of the beast, was crushed and to all appearance exterminated."
2. "The stroke of its death was healed in the establishment of the Christian Roman Empire."
3. "And the whole earth wondered after (wondered at, as they followed, or gazed, after) the beast."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Contrast the change whereby Nebuchadnezzar, being humbled
from his self-deifying pride, was converted from his beast-like
form and character to MAN'S
form and true position towards God; symbolized by his eagle wings
being plucked, and himself made to stand upon his feet as a man." 
2. "Though seemingly slain, it remains the beast still, to rise again in another form." 
3. "A new and worse heathenism breaks in upon the Christianized world, more devilish than the old one of the first heads of the beast. The latter was an apostasy only from the general revelation of God in nature and conscience; but this new one is from God's revelation of love in His Son."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A blow was struck that would be naturally fatal, but there was something that prevented the fatal result."
2. "The wound was healed - this power was restored - by being brought into alliance with the papacy."
3. "The beast received such universal reverence, or inspired such universal awe, as to be properly called worship or adoration."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs eight times in Revelation, and in seven of these it must be rendered slain or slaughtered."
2. "In both cases there had been actual death, and in both revival."
3. "A pregnant construction for wondered at and followed after."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The statement in the verse is the counterpart of that in chap. Revelation 5:6, where we read of the ‚ÄòLamb as though it had been slaughtered.‚Äô In both cases there had been actual death, although in both there had also been a revival, a resurrection, to life."
2. "The words ‚Äòas though‚Äô before ‚Äòit had been slain‚Äô no more imply that there had not been a real death than they imply this in chap. Revelation 5:6, where they are used of the slain Lamb."
3. "What is spoken of is the world-power in the form of its sixth head. That power received a mortal stroke by the work of Christ. The world was then ideally and really overcome. It revived, and resumed its working."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As though it had been smitten (œâœÇ ŒµœÉœÜŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ)."
2. "And his death-stroke was healed (Œ∫Œ± Œ∑ œÄŒªŒ∑Œ≥Œ∑ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµœÖŒ∏Œ∑)."
3. "Wondered after the beast (ŒµŒ∏Œ±œÖŒºŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ∑ ŒøœÄŒπœÉœâ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏Œ∑œÅŒπŒøœÖ)."

### John Gill:

2. "Some choose to understand this of the wound which antichrist received at the Reformation, by Luther, Calvin, and others, which has since been healing."
3. "The universality the Papists boast of, as a note of the true church, is manifestly a mark of the beast, or of antichrist."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse appears to symbolize the Roman pagan Empire, which was initially crushed and seemingly exterminated but later revived in the establishment of the Christian Roman Empire. While there are similarities with the story of Nebuchadnezzar's transformation, this new form of heathenism is even more devilish than the old one. The word slain occurs several times in Revelation and signifies both actual death and revival. The beast received universal worship and awe, and its wound was healed by aligning with the papacy. Some interpret the wound as the one inflicted by the Reformation, which has been gradually healing. The universality claimed by the Papists is seen by others as a mark of the beast or antichrist.
