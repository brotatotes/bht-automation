## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words are a sort of parody, in their blasphemy, on ascriptions of praise to God."
2. "They represent the relapse into all the substantial blasphemies of paganism under the resuscitated Empire of Rome."
3. "The retention of pagan titles and forms."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the language appropriated to God"
2. "a parody of the name 'Michael' meaning, 'Who is like unto God?'"
3. "assigned to the beast blasphemously"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Can anyone doubt that this was the case under papal Rome; that the power which was set up under that entire domination, civil and ecclesiastical, was such as Satan approved, and such as he sought to have established on the earth?"
2. "This was, in fact, ascribing honors to him which belonged only to God; and this was the manner in which that civil and secular power was regarded in the period here supposed to be referred to."
3. "They thus attributed to him omnipotence - an attribute belonging only to God. This found a fulfillment in the honor shown to the civil authority which sustained the papacy; for the policy was to impress the public mind with the belief that that power was invincible."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who is like unto the beast? A parody on a similar ascription to God." 
2. "See Isaiah 40:18, Isaiah 40:25; Isaiah 46:5; Psalms 113:5; Micah 7:18; Jeremiah 49:19."
3. "Compare ch. 18 18."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse contains a parody of the ascriptions of praise given to the true God in many passages of the Old Testament."
2. "But there is not a tittle of evidence to prove that homage of this kind was paid even to the thought of the resuscitated tyrant."
3. "As invariably happens when a tyrant dies, the sentiment of the masses underwent an immediate and profound revulsion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The beast is merely the tool of the devil for worship. Recall the fact that the devil even proposed that Jesus worship him. Emperor-worship, like all idolatry, was devil-worship. The same thing is true today about self-worship (humanism or any other form of it)."
2. "The worship of such a monster as Nero was indeed a travesty of the worship of God."
3. "Worship of the devil and the devil's agent is justified purely on the ground of brute force. It is the doctrine of Nietzsche that might makes right."

### John Gill:
1. "They worshipped the dragon... in the idols, images, angels, and saints departed."
2. "Woe to them that worship this beast."
3. "Who is able to make war with him?"
