# Revelation 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And all shall worship it who dwell upon the earth, [every one] whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb which is slain from the foundation of the world. The Lamb's book of life contains the names of those destined for eternal life, an act determined by God from the beginning. It distinguishes between those on earth and those in heaven, highlighting the ungodly who worship the beast. The responsibility lies with individuals, for only through the death of the Lamb can atonement be effective. Let us heed this solemn call.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And all shall worship it who dwell upon the earth, [every one] whose (the change into the singular arises from resolving all into its component individuals) name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb which is slain from the foundation of the world."
2. "That death of Christ which was foreordained from the foundation of the world, is said to have taken place in the counsels of Him with whom the end and the beginning are one."
3. "Of course, where simply the writing in the hook of life from the foundation of the world is expressed, no other element is to be introduced: but it does not therefore follow, that where, as here, other elements are by the construction introduced, that, and that alone is to be understood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "all that dwell upon the earth‚Äîbeing of earth earthy; in contrast to 'them that dwell in heaven.'" 
2. "The elect. The former is in the Greek more obvious and simple."
3. "Whatsoever virtue was in the sacrifices, did operate through Messiah's death alone. As He was 'the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,' so all atonements ever made were only effectual by His blood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The representation here is, that the Lord Jesus keeps a book or register, in which are recorded the names of all who shall obtain everlasting life."
2. "The purpose was so certain, it was so constantly represented by bloody sacrifices from the earliest ages, all typifying the future Saviour, that it might be said that he was 'slain from the foundation of the world'."
3. "Either construction makes good sense; but it seems to me that what is found in our common version is the most simple and natural."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Render, as Rev., the lamb that hath been slain from the foundation of the world."
2. "Alford, pertinently as I think, urges the position of the words in favor of the connection with slain."
3. "Katabolh foundation is literally a throwing or laying down, from kataballw to throw down; hence a laying down of a foundation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These dwellers upon the earth are in contrast with those who ‚Äòtabernacle in heaven.‚Äô They are the ungodly as distinguished from the godly; and again they are not confined to the Roman Empire, but include all who anywhere worship the beast."
2. "The connection of the last clause is doubtful. It may be joined, as in the Authorised Version, with the ‚ÄòLamb that hath been slain;‚Äô but chap. Revelation 17:8 seems to determine in favour of connecting it with the word ‚Äòwritten.‚Äô Besides which, the clause is less appropriate to the slaying of the Lamb, an act which took place in time, than to those counsels of the Almighty which are from eternity."
3. "Revelation 13:9 contains a solemn call to listen, and is best connected with what follows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Redundant use of genitive Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ (his) with ŒøœÖ (whose) as common in this book, and singular instead of plural œâŒΩ with antecedent œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ (all, plural), thus calling attention to the responsibility of the individual in emperor-worship."
2. "It occurs again in Revelation 17:8; Revelation 20:12; Revelation 20:15; Revelation 21:27. 'Here and in Revelation 21:27, the Divine Register is represented as belonging to 'the Lamb that was slain' (Swete)."
3. "For the phrase Œ±œÄŒø Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒ∑œÇ Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒøœÖ (not in the LXX) there are six other N.T. uses (Matthew 13:35 without Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒøœÖ; Revelation 25:34; Luke 11:50; Hebrews 4:3; Hebrews 9:26; Revelation 17:8), and for œÄœÅŒø Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒ∑œÇ Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒøœÖ three (John 17:24; Ephesians 1:4; 1 Peter 1:20). It is doubtful here whether it is to be taken with œÑŒøœÖ ŒµœÉœÜŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÖ (cf. 1 Peter 1:20) or with Œ≥ŒµŒ≥œÅŒ±œÄœÑŒ± as in Revelation 17:8."

### John Gill:
1. "By which book is meant God's predestination of men to eternal life, or his decree of election... and that it is of particular persons, and not of bodies of men, of nations and churches, and still less of propositions, or of persons so and so qualified, or under such conditions and circumstances."
2. "And this is called the Lamb's book; that is, Christ, who is compared to a Lamb for its harmlessness, meekness, and patience, and was typified by the lambs in the legal sacrifices."
3. "Now such whose names are not written in this book of the Lamb, who have no interest in electing grace, nor in redemption by Christ... these are the followers and worshippers of antichrist."
