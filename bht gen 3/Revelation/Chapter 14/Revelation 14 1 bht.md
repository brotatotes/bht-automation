## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The nations of the earth, constrained to receive the mark of the beast on their forehead and hand, and the Lambs elect, marked with His name and that of His Father."
2. "Are these 144, 000 identical with the same number in ch. vii, 4? The presumption certainly is that the same number occurring here...must be descriptive of the same body of persons."
3. "Those, as these, will represent the first-fruits or choice ones among Godâ€™s people...and not the totality of those who shall form the great multitude which no man can number."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the 144,000 of Israel are 'the first-fruits,' so 'the harvest' is the general assembly of Gentile saints to be translated by Christ as His first act in assuming His kingdom." 
2. "Those who shall reign with Christ shall first suffer with Him, being delivered out of the judgments, but not out of the trials." 
3. "The common affliction will draw closely together, in opposing the beast's worship, the Old Testament and New Testament people of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And I looked - My attention was drawn to a new vision. The eye was turned away from the beast and his image to the heavenly world - the Mount Zion above."
2. "Stood on the mount Zion - That is, in heaven. See the notes on Hebrews 12:22. Zion, literally the southern hill in the city of Jerusalem, was a name also given to the whole city; and, as that was the seat of the divine worship on earth, it became an emblem of heaven - the dwelling-place of God."
3. "Having his Fatherâ€™s name written in their foreheads - Showing that they were his. See the notes on Revelation 7:3; Revelation 13:16. In Revelation 7:3, it is merely said that they were 'sealed in their foreheads'; the passage here shows how they were sealed. They had the name of God so stamped or marked on their foreheads as to show that they belonged to him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His name and the name of His Father."
2. "Here, in short, where all is human and natural in form, the spiritual depths of our nature are stirred."
3. "We feel these creatures to be beings from whose eyes God has wiped away all tears - who will hunger and thirst no more."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The scene of preservation is not heaven but earth."
2. "Now that they have been preserved and admitted as priests within the veil, our attention may be directed to the contents of the seal."
3. "These are in part at least it is not necessary to think wholly the â€˜nameâ€™ which belongs at once to the Father and to the Lamb, the name Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This proleptic vision of the Lamb 'standing on the mount Zion' is reasoning after the visions of the two beasts."
2. "Mount Zion is the site of the new city of God, the Jerusalem above, the seat of the Messianic Kingdom."
3. "These victors have the name of the Lamb and God upon their foreheads, in place of the mark of the beast."

### John Gill:
1. "the Lamb,.... The Alexandrian copy, and some others, read 'the Lamb'; the same that had been seen before in, the midst of the throne"
2. "here Christ the Lamb stood, as presiding over it, being King of Zion, or the church"
3. "a remnant according to the election of grace, who were called out of the world, and brought to Zion, and were on the side of the Lamb, and abode by him, and cleaved unto him"

### John Wesley:
1. "An hundred forty-four thousand â€” Either those out of all mankind who had been the most eminently holy, or the most holy out of the twelve tribes of Israel..."
2. "They are now in safety, and have the name of the Lamb and of his Father written on their foreheads, as being the redeemed of God and of the Lamb..."
3. "The church above, making suitable reflections on the grand events which are foretold in this book, greatly serves to raise the attention of real Christians, and to teach the high concern they have in them."
