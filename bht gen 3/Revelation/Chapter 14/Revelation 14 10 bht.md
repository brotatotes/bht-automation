## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... which is mingled (i.e. as A.V. poured into the cup... From the almost universal custom of mixing wine with water, the common term for preparing wine, putting it into the cup came to be to mingle." 
2. "The figure of the cup of the Lord‚Äôs wrath is found in Ps. lxxiv. 8, in the Septuagint version, 'In the hand of the Lord is a cup, full of the mixture of pure wine... all the sinners of the earth shall drink it,' from which this is evidently taken)."
3. "The meaning is as in Luke xvi 23 ff, that the torments are visible to the angels and the Lamb."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is no drop of water to cool its heat. Naught of grace or hope is blended with it."
2. "This unmixed cup is already mingled and prepared for Satan and the beast's followers."
3. "God's enemies are regarded by the saints as their enemies, and when the day of probation is past, their mind shall be so entirely one with God's, that they shall rejoice in witnessing visibly the judicial vindication of God's righteousness in sinners' punishment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ‚Äòwine of the wrath of God‚Äô is the cup in the hand of the Lord, which, when drunk, makes them reel and fall."
2. "Without being diluted with water - that is, in its full strength. In other words, there would be no mitigation of the punishment."
3. "Both of these things will be true in regard to him; and it will be no small aggravation of the punishment of the wicked, that it will occur in the very presence of their slighted and rejected Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Poured out without mixture. From the universal custom of mixing wine with water for drinking, the word mingle came to be used in the general sense of prepare by putting into the cup. Hence, to pour out."
2. "Cup of His anger."
3. "Brimstone. Commonly taken as the neuter of qeiov divine; that is, divine incense, since burning brimstone was regarded as having power to purify and to avert contagion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The punishment of such is now described in four particulars, the number four being perhaps taken because it is the ungodly world with which we are dealing, and because it is a lex talionis that is illustrated."
2. "The wine is said (literally) to be ‚Äòmingled unmingled;‚Äô but there is no play upon the words, for, owing to the practice of the ancients to mingle water with wine, the verb to mingle had come to be used in the simple sense of pouring out."
3. "And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the angels and before the Lamb."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The white heat of God's anger, held back through the ages, will be turned loose."
2. "A bold and powerful oxymoron, 'the mixed unmixed.' ŒëŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒøœÇ is an old adjective...used of wine unmixed with water...here only in N.T."
3. "This holy environment adds to the punishment."

### John Gill:
1. "Which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation... and though it seems to carry in it a contradiction, yet is true in different senses; it may be said to be mixed as wine with various sorts, which is the stronger, and sooner inebriates and intoxicates."
2. "He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... which is expressive of the horrible torments of hell, and the dreadful punishment of the antichristian party there."
3. "What will aggravate their misery is, that it will be in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; the latter will be their Judge, and will condemn them to everlasting burnings, and pronounce the sentence on them."

### John Wesley:
1. "In all the scripture there is not another so terrible threatening as this."
2. "And God by this greater fear arms his servants against the fear of the beast."
3. "The wrath of God, which is poured unmixed ‚Äî Without any mixture of mercy; without hope."
