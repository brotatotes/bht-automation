## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth...the complete blessedness of the holy dead commences: when the garner is filled and the chaff cast out."

3. "The words of God the Father (the 'voice from heaven') are echoed back and confirmed by the Spirit... All 'God's promises in Christ are yea.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Blessed are the dead - That is, the condition of those who die in the manner which is immediately specified, is to be regarded as a blessed or happy one." 
2. "To 'die in the Lord' implies the following things: (2) To 'die in the Lord' would seem also to imply that there should be, at the time, the evidence of his favor and friendship." 
3. "From henceforth... They would rise to eternal life and peace... It may be added that the declaration here made is true still, and ever will be. It is a blessed thing to die in the Lord."

### John Gill:
1. "Merely to die is not an happiness, for death is common to all, good and bad; it is a disunion of soul and body, and cannot be in itself desirable; it is the fruit of sin, and has something in it awful and terrible; and though it is the privilege of believers, as its sting is removed by Christ, yet not as simply and absolutely considered; but to die in the Lord is a blessedness."
2. "To suffer death for the sake of Christ and his Gospel is a gift and an honour, and what glorifies Christ; and there is a glory consequent upon it, which such shall enjoy."
3. "This is directly opposite to the notions of the Jews, who say, that when a man departs this life, his works 'go before him', and say unto him, thou hast done so and so, in such a place, and on such a day; and that whoever does a good work in this world, it shall 'go before him' in the world to come; and so they represent good works as saying to a man when he is about to die, 'go in peace; before thou gettest thither, we will go before thee.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Happy are the dead - From henceforth particularly: 1. Because they escape the approaching calamities: 2. Because they already enjoy so near an approach to glory."
2. "Who die in the Lord - In the faith of the Lord Jesus. For they rest - No pain, no purgatory follows; but pure, unmixed happiness."
3. "Their works - Each one's peculiar works. Follow - or accompany them; that is, the fruit of their works. Their works do not go before to procure them admittance into the mansions of joy; but they follow them when admitted."
