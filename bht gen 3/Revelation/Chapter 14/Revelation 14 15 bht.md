# Revelation 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Son receives the command from the angel to put forth His sickle and reap the harvest of the earth, as the time has come.

The temple is where God's judgments are proclaimed at their appointed seasons. The world is ripe for Christ's second coming, when the righteous will be gathered and the wicked will be dealt with accordingly.
