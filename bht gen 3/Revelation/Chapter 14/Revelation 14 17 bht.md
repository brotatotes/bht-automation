# Revelation 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The angel with the sharp sickle emerges from the heavenly temple, commissioned by God to gather the enemies of God. This gathering represents the battle of God Almighty, fought with the word of God, which leads to the destruction of the beast and false prophet. The angel's task mirrors Christ gathering the wheat, but here it is the enemies of God who are gathered like a vintage. Ultimately, the ministering spirits, symbolized as reapers, will gather the wicked and cast them into the furnace of fire.
