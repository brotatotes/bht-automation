## BHT:
The vine of the earth, representing the apostate world of Christendom, will be gathered into the great wine-press of God's wrath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No such expression is used above, ver. 16. There it is, 'He that sat upon the cloud.' All these signs of difference are worthy of notice."
2. "Any thing corresponding to this feature is entirely wanting in the previous description of the harvest."
3. "See on it ch. xix. 15, and the prophetic passages in reff. especially Isaiah, from which the symbolism comes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The vine" is what is the subject of judgment because its grapes are not what God looked for considering its careful culture, but "wild grapes." 
2. The apostate world of Christendom, not the world of heathendom who have not heard of Christ, is the object of judgment.
3. Compare the emblem, Revelation 19:15; Isaiah 63:2; Isaiah 63:3; Joel 3:13.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth...into the great wine-press of the wrath of God." 
2. "The wine-press where the grapes are crushed, and where the juice, resembling blood, flows out, may be used as a symbol to denote the destruction of the wicked in the last day."
3. "The symbol appears to be used here alike with reference to the color of the wine resembling blood, and the pressure necessary to force it out; and thus employed it is one of the most striking emblems conceivable to denote the final destruction of the wicked."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Rev., in rendering more literally, is more forcible: the wine-press, the great wine-press."
2. "The Greek student will note the masculine adjective with the feminine noun, possibly because the gender of the noun is doubtful."
3. "See on Matthew 21:33."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not merely the grapes but the vine of the earth itself is gathered"

### John Gill:
1. "This vine may be said to be cut down at the burning of the world, and to be gathered at the second resurrection, as the wheat harvest of the saints will be at the first resurrection."

3. "And it is said to be a great one, as it must needs be, to hold the vine of the whole earth, or all the wicked of the world, who will be like the sand of the sea, innumerable; and this will be big enough for them all, and they will all be cast into it at once."
