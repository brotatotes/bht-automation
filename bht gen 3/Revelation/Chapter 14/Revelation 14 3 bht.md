## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And they sing [as it were] a new song...before the throne, and before the four living-beings, and the elders...and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand..." 
2. "The song has regard to matters of trial and triumph, of deep joy and heavenly purity of heart, which none other among men but these pure and holy ones are capable of apprehending." 
3. "Even so this heavenly song speaks only to the virgin heart, and can be learnt only by those who accompany the Lamb whithersoever He goeth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The song is that of victory after conflict with the dragon, beast, and false prophet: never sung before, for such a conflict had never been fought before; therefore new: till now the kingdom of Christ on earth had been usurped; they sing the new song in anticipation of His blood-bought kingdom with His saints." 
2. "Not as ALFORD, 'the harpers and song are in heaven, but the 144,000 are on earth.'"
3. "Not even the angels can learn that song, for they know not experimentally what it is to have 'come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "None could understand it but the redeemed. That is, none who had not been redeemed could enter fully into the feelings and sympathies of those who were."
2. "To appreciate fully the songs of Zion; to understand the language of praise; to enter into the spirit of the truths which pertain to redemption; one must himself have been redeemed by the blood of Christ."
3. "Of all the joy ever experienced in the universe, so far as we can see, that must be the most sublime and transporting, which will be experienced when the redeemed shall stand on Mount Zion above, and shall realize that they are saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Beasts [Œ∂œâœâŒΩ] . Rev., living creatures. See on ch. Revelation 4:6. 
Redeemed [Œ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒ±œÉŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπ] . Rev., correctly, purchased.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The song referred to is not said to be sung by the 144,000, and perhaps we ought to think simply of a great body of praise going up before the throne."
2. "They are described as 'purchased out of the earth,' a designation which, like that of Revelation 14:4, 'from among men,' must be accepted in a general sense, there being nothing to suggest the idea of Judaism alone."
3. "The word 'earth' rather leads us to the thought of our natural condition as sons of Adam."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They sing as it were a new song...here 'before' them and so apparently by the throng who were themselves redeemed by the Lamb."
2. "No man could learn the song save...the Song of Moses and the Lamb."
3. "Even they that had been purchased out of the earth...the 144,000...must embrace both men and women."

### John Gill:
1. "and no man could learn that song but the hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth; out of every kindred, tongue, people, and nation... to none but these is it given to know spiritually and experimentally the mysteries of electing and redeeming grace." 
2. "The natural and carnal man neither knows nor receives the things of the Spirit of God; nor can he learn them by hearing, reading, study, and conversation unless it be only in a notional and speculative way."
3. "and indeed the song of redeeming love is peculiar to men."

### John Wesley:
1. "They sing a new song - and none could learn that song." 
2. "To sing and play it in the same manner." 
3. "But the hundred forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth - from among men; from all sin."
