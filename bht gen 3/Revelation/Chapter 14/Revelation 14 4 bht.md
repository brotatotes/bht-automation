## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These are they who were not (the past tense shews that their course is ended and looked back on as a thing past: and serves to confute all interpretations which regard them as representing saints while in the midst of their earthly conflict and trial) defiled with women (see below); for they are (always were and have kept themselves till the time present) virgins..."
2. "There are two ways of understanding these words. Either they may be figurative, merely implying that these pure ones lived in all chastity, whether in single or in married life, and incurred no pollution [2 Cor. xi 2]: or they may be meant literally, that these purest ones had lived in that state of which St. Paul says, 1 Cor. vii. 1, it is good for a man."
3. "And if He is to have round Him a peculiar and closer band, standing with Him on Mount Sion, none will surely grudge this place to those who were not defiled with women. Among these will be not only those who have lived and served Him in holy virginity, but also the dear children whom He has claimed from us for Himself, the youths and maidens who were gathered to His side before the strife began."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their not being defiled with women means they were not led astray from Christian faithfulness by the tempters who jointly constitute the spiritual 'harlot.'" 
2. "Follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth‚Äîin glory, being especially near His person; the fitting reward of their following Him so fully on earth."
3. "Israel's 144,000 elect are the first-fruit, the Jewish and Gentile elect Church is the harvest; in a further sense, the whole of the transfigured and translated Church which reigns with Christ at His coming, is the first-fruit, and the consequent general ingathering of Israel and the nations, ending in the last judgment, is the full and final harvest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The general idea is, that they are chaste; that they are the followers of the Lamb; that they are redeemed from among people; and that they are without guile."
2. "The redeemed as chaste, and thus brings into view one of the prominent things in which Christians are distinguished from the devotees of nearly every other form of religion, and, indeed, exclusively from the world at large."
3. "One characteristic of true Christians that they follow the Saviour wherever he leads them. Be it into trouble, into danger, into difficult duty; be it in Christian or pagan lands; be it in pleasant paths, or in roads rough and difficult, they commit themselves wholly to his guidance, and submit themselves wholly to his will."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Were not defiled [ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµŒºŒøŒªœÖŒΩŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ]. The verb means properly to besmear or besmirch... See on 1 Peter 1:4."
2. "Virgins [œÄŒ±œÅŒ∏ŒµŒΩŒøŒπ]. Either celibate or living in chastity whether in married or single life." 
3. "First-fruits [Œ±œÄŒ±œÅœáŒ∑]. See on James 1:18."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of this word rules out marriage, which was not considered sinful."
2. "The New Testament exalts marriage and this passage should not be construed as degrading it."
3. "The Christian life is following the Lamb of God as Jesus taught."

### John Gill:
1. "These are they which were not defiled with women,.... With the whore of Rome, and her harlots, she is the mother of; while the kings and inhabitants of the earth were drunk with the wine of their fornication, or committed idolatry with them, which is spiritual fornication, and is here meant by being defiled with them..."
2. "for they are virgins; for their beauty and comeliness in Christ, chastity, sincerity of their love, uncorruptness in doctrine and worship, and for the uprightness of conversation..."
3. "these were redeemed from among men; 'by Jesus', as the Syriac and Arabic versions add, and so the Complutensian edition; by the blood of Christ, for all men are not redeemed by it..."

### John Wesley:
1. "These are they who had not been defiled with women ‚Äî It seems that the deepest defilement, and the most alluring temptation, is put for every other."
2. "They are virgins ‚Äî Unspotted souls; such as have preserved universal purity."
3. "These are they who follow the Lamb ‚Äî Who are nearest to him. This is not their character, but their reward. Firstfruits - Of the glorified spirits. Who is ambitious to be of this number?"
