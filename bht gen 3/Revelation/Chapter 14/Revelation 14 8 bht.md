## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, which hath made all the nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
2. "The latter is the retribution for the former: the former turns into the latter: they are treated as one and the same."
3. "This is the first mention of Babylon, hereafter to be so much spoken of, I reserve treatment of the interpretation till ch. xvii.: only mentioning by anticipation that Rome, pagan and papal, but principally papal, is intended."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "another, a second angel." 
2. "Babylon the great." 
3. "As she made the nations drunk with the wine of her fornication, so she herself shall be made drunk with the wine of God's wrath."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Babylon, the great enemy, would fall to rise no more."
2. "Rome had been, like Babylon, a desolating power, having destroyed the capital of the Holy Land, and burnt its beautiful temple, and reduced the country to a province. Rome, like Babylon of old, was the most formidable power with which the church had to contend."
3. "The design of this verse also is to impart consolation by the assurance that this great enemy - this mighty, formidable, persecuting power - would be entirely overthrown."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Another. Add deuterov a second. 
Is fallen [ÎµÏ€ÎµÏƒÎµÎ½] . Lit., fell. The prophetic aorist expressing the certainty of the fall. Compare Isaiah 21:9; Jeremiah 51:7, Jeremiah 51:8.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The proclamation is simply anticipatory of what is to be more fully described hereafter."
2. "In her ungodly influence Babylon is spoken of as making 'all the nations to drink,' etc."
3. "A third angel follows."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Fallen, fallen... The English participle 'fallen, fallen' is more musical and rhythmical than the literal rendering 'fell, fell.' The language is an echo of Isaiah 21:9."
2. "There is no doubt that Rome is meant by Babylon, as is probably seen already in 1 Peter 5:13. As a prisoner in Patmos John can speak his mind by this symbolism."
3. "Rome is pictured as the great courtesan who intoxicates and beguiles the nations to fornication, but the cup of God's wrath for her and her paramours is full."

### John Gill:
1. "A set of ministers in the spiritual reign of Christ are meant, who will not only signify the fall of Babylon to be certain, and near at hand, but will live to see and declare her actual fall." 
2. "Rome is called Babel...which is a confused mixture of Judaism, Paganism, and Christianity." 
3. "By her 'fornication' is meant the idolatry of the church of Rome...and the wine of it designs the alluring methods used to draw into it."

### John Wesley:
1. "With the overthrow of Babylon, that of all the enemies of Christ, and, consequently, happier times, are connected."
2. "Whenever Babylon is mentioned in this book, the great is added, to teach us that Rome then commenced Babylon, when it commenced the great city."
3. "Of this wine she hath, indeed, made all nations drink - More especially by her later missions."
