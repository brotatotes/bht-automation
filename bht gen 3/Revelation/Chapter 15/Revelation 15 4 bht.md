# Revelation 15:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who can but fear [Thee] and [who] shall [not] glorify thy Name? Cause Thou only art holy. Because Thy righteous acts have been made manifest. The present preaching of the Gospel is gathering out the elect remnant; meanwhile 'the mystery of iniquity' is at work, and will at last come to its crisis; then shall judgment descend on the apostates at the harvest-end of this age. The conversion of all nations, therefore, shall be when Christ shall come, and not till then.
