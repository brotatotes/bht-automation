### John Gill:
1. "These seven vials are for the seven last plagues to be put into, and out of which they are to be taken, or poured, and inflicted; hence it appears, that the seven plagues, and the wrath of God, are the same thing, and both design God's judgments upon antichrist."
2. "And it will be very terrible; it will be, not the wrath of men, but of God, and a cup of the fierceness of his wrath; it will be the wrath of the living God, of him that lives for ever, and as he is, such will his wrath be; it will continue for ever, for this wrath will issue in the everlasting destruction of antichrist."
3. "These vials were given to the seven angels by one of the living creatures, the ministers of the word; from whence it seems that these angels design members of churches, as distinct from ministers; and may intend civil magistrates, and very principal ones, as kings of the earth, who, in this state of things, and times, will belong to the churches, and will be the instruments of destroying antichrist."

### John Wesley:
1. "Seven golden phials â€” Or bowls. The Greek word signifies vessels broader at the top than at the bottom."
2. "Full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever."
3. "A circumstance which adds greatly to the dreadfulness of his wrath."
