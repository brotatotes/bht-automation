## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And the temple was filled with smoke from (arising from) the glory of God and from His might... the unapproachableness of God, when immediately present and working, by any created being."
2. "No one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished... the wrathful presence and agency of God being withdrawn, He might again be approached."
3. "Many other meanings more or less far-fetched have been given, but where Scripture analogy is so plain, the simplest is the best."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "temple . . . filledâ€” ( :-); compare Exodus 40:34; 2 Chronicles 5:14, as to the earthly temple, of which this is the antitype."
2. "the glory of God and . . . powerâ€”then fully manifested."
3. "no man was able to enter . . . the templeâ€”because of God's presence in His manifested glory and power during the execution of these judgments."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The smoke was the proper accompaniment of the Divine Being when appearing in majesty."
2. "The purpose here seems to have been, partly to represent the smoke as the proper symbol of the divine presence, and partly to represent it as so filling the temple that no one could enter it until the seven plagues were fulfilled."
3. "The point, therefore, at which this vision leaves us is, that where all the preparations are made for the infliction of the threatened punishment on the grand anti-Christian power which had so long stood up against the truth; where the agents had prepared to go forth; and where no intercession will ever avail to turn away the infliction of the divine wrath."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Smoke."
2. "None was able to enter."
3. "God cannot be approached at the moment when He is revealing Himself in all the terrors of His indignation."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "God cannot be approached at the moment when He is revealing Himself in all the terrors of His indignation."
3. "The meaning of these words is perhaps best to be ascertained by comparing them with Exodus 19:21."

### John Wesley:
1. "The cloud of glory was the visible manifestation of God's presence in the tabernacle and temple."
2. "So proper is the emblem of smoke from the glory of God, or from the cloud of glory, to express the execution of judgment, as well as to be a sign of favour."
3. "Till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled â€” Which did not take up a long time, like the seven trumpets, but swiftly followed each other."
