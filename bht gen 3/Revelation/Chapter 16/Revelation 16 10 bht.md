# Revelation 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The pouring out of the fifth vial upon the throne of the beast, representing Rome, results in a darkened kingdom. This darkness, similar to the plagues in Egypt, intensifies the pain caused by previous plagues, leading those under the beast's rule to gnaw their tongues in frustration and unfulfilled vengeance. The imagery of darkness and agonizing suffering portrays the imminent destruction of Rome, reducing its power and authority, and making it a despised place. This vial serves as another step in the series of judgments that will ultimately bring about the downfall of the beast's kingdom.
