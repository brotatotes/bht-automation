# Revelation 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The judgment of plagues seen here is not a mere succession, but a cumulative effect. Those afflicted by sores and pains show no sign of repentance in their wicked works, persisting in blasphemy against the God of heaven. The intensified darkness and suffering they experience deepen their refusal to turn away. Their unrepentant state resembles the pride of Nebuchadnezzar and their works of darkness persist, causing continued distress and torment in their hearts and souls.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The judgment and plagues described in this passage are not simply successive, but cumulative. The people who are afflicted with sores and pains from the previous plagues continue to suffer, without repenting of their works. As their distress and darkness increase, so does their blasphemy and impiety against the God of heaven. Even in the face of supernatural darkness, their refusal to repent is not solely due to fear, but also because of their deep pains and sores. Their stubbornness and pride resemble that of Nebuchadnezzar against Jehovah, and despite their inner distress and remorse, they continue to curse God and refuse to turn from their antichristian deeds.
