# Revelation 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The drying up of the great river Euphrates signifies the gathering of transfigured saints from the East to accompany Jesus, the King of kings. This prepares the way for the reign over His people as the antichristian power of Babylon is stripped, eaten, and burned. The destruction of the Turkish empire, mainly situated west of the Euphrates, could pave the way for the conversion of the Jews and the spread of Christ's kingdom. Through God's divine intervention, He will fight on behalf of His people, securing their deliverance and defeating their enemies.
