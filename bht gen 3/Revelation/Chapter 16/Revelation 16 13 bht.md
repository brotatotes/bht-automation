## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the entire absence of Scripture symbolism,â€”for the only mention of frogs besides this is in, or in regard to, the relation of the plague in Egypt,â€”we can only explain the similitude from the uncleanness, and the pertinacious noise, of the frog."
2. "This is a plain declaration of the interpretation of these three, and by it the limits of interpretation are clearly set, and must not be overpassed. The explanation of these as men, or sects of men, is therefore clearly wrong."
3. "That day viz. which is explained in detail in the subsequent part of the prophecy, ch. xix. 17 ff. This great gathering of the beast and the kings of the earth against God and the Lamb, is the signal for the immediate and glorious appearing of the Lord. And therefore follows an exhortation to be ready, and clad in the garments of righteousness, when He shall come."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They talk of liberty, but it is not Gospel liberty, but license for lust."
2. "The dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, "the mystery of iniquity," form a blasphemous Antitrinity, the counterfeit of "the mystery of godliness" God manifests in Christ, witnessed to by the Spirit."
3. "While the false prophet, like the Holy Ghost, speaks not of himself, but tells all men to worship the beast, and confirms his testimony to the beast by miracles, as the Holy Ghost attested similarly to Christ's divine mission."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They assumed a visible form which would well represent their odiousness - that of frogs - but still they are spoken of as 'spirits.'"
2. "The frog is here employed clearly as a symbol, and it is designed that certain qualities of the 'spirits' here referred to should be designated by the symbol."
3. "They are not here, probably, symbols of persons, but of influences or opinions which would be spread abroad, and which would characterize the age referred to."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Frogs. Possibly With reference to Exodus 8:1-14.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "They are the three great enemies of the people of God who have already been described... The point to be chiefly noticed is that all the great enemies of God's people are gathered together." 
2. "All the demoniacal powers of the world in their united forces are on the stage."
3. "The spirits are as 'frogs,' unclean, boasting, noisy, offensive animals... so does this spiritual Egypt."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of the dragon... That is Satan."
2. "The brute force of the World-power represented by the Roman Empire."
3. "Like loathsome frogs in form."

### John Gill:
1. "Rome, the seat of antichrist, being destroyed, and the kingdom of the beast darkened, and brought into great contempt, Mahometanism greatly declining, the Gospel succeeding everywhere, the Jews being converted, and resettled in their own land, the devil bestirs himself more than ordinary."
2. "they are said to be 'unclean'; as the evil spirits and devils are, being so by nature, and delighting in uncleanness, and giving themselves up to work it with greediness. and they are 'like frogs'; the allusion is to the plague of frogs in Egypt."
3. "these antichristian emissaries are fitly compared to them, for their impurity, and pleasure they take in it, as frogs do in dirt and filth; and for their being talkative, impudent, and troublesome, like the noisy croaking frogs."

### John Wesley:
1. "It seems, the dragon fights chiefly against God; the beast, against Christ; the false prophet, against the Spirit of truth." 
2. "The false prophet - ...works by lies and deceit."
3. "To gather them - To the assistance of their three principals."
