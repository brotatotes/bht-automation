# Revelation 16:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kings of the whole world, unlike the saints, are of this world and under the influence of Satan's lies. They are driven by the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet to wage a war against God. This war goes beyond mere national conflicts; it is a battle against the truth and God Himself. These deceptive spirits lead the ungodly kings to their own destruction, as they are enticed and ensnared in this futile attempt to fight against the Almighty.

2. "God, in permitting Satan's miracles, as in the case of the Egyptian magicians who were His instruments in hardening Pharaoh's heart, gives the reprobate up to judicial delusion preparatory to their destruction."
3. "So this, or whatever is antitypical to it, will be the last effort of the dragon, beast, and false prophet."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Working what seemed to be miracles; that is, such wonders as to deceive the world with the belief that they were miracles."
2. "No class of people have been more under the influence of pagan superstition, Muhammedan delusion, or the papacy, than kings and princes."
