Behold, the Lord comes as a thief, suddenly and unexpectedly. Those who watch and keep their garments of righteousness, acquired through faith in Him, will be blessed. Neglecting these garments will lead to walking naked, stripped of righteousness and exposed in shame. Therefore, believers must remain vigilant, guarding against sin and staying prepared for Christ's coming. Let us be found watching, clothed in the garments of justification and sanctification, so that we may be accepted and not ashamed before men and angels.
