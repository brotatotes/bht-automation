## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words 'the place which is called' would surely not be used except of a real place habitually so named."
2. "Harmagiddo, the 'mountain of Megiddo,' designates at least the neighborhood where the Canaanitish Kings were overthrown by Barak."
3. "Nor must it be forgotten, that Megiddo was connected with another overthrow and slaughter, viz. that of Josiah by Pharaoh-Necho."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If English version be retained, 'He' will refer to God who gives them over to the delusion of the three unclean spirits." 
2. "The great plain of Esdraelon. Josiah, too, as the ally of Babylon, was defeated and slain at Megiddo; and the mourning of the Jews at the time just before God shall interpose for them against all the nations confederate against Jerusalem, is compared to the mourning for Josiah at Megiddo." 
3. "Megiddo comes from a root, gadad, 'cut off,' and means slaughter. Compare Joel 3:2; Joel 3:12; Joel 3:14, where 'the valley of Jehoshaphat' (meaning in Hebrew, 'judgment of God') is mentioned as the scene of God's final vengeance on the God-opposing foe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There will be a mustering of spiritual forces; there will be a combination and a unity of opposition against the truth; there will be a rallying of the declining powers of paganism, Mohammedanism, and Romanism, as if the forces of the earth, marshalled by kings and rulers, were assembled in some great battlefield, where the destiny of the world was to be decided."
2. "There has been for centuries a gradual weakening of the Turkish power. It has done nothing to extend its empire by arms. It has been resting in inglorious ease, and, in the meantime, its wealth and its strength have been gradually decreasing."
 
3. "We may look for a general turning of the princes, and rulers, and people of the Eastern world to Christianity...How rapidly, we may suppose, the gospel would spread in the East, if all the obstacles thrown in its way by the Turkish power were at once removed!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To this cause mainly it owes its celebrity, as the battle - field of the world, which has, through its adoption into the language of Revelation, passed into an universal proverb."
2. "If that mysterious book proceeded from the hand of a Galilean fisherman, it is the more easy to understand why, with the scene of those many battles constantly before him, he should have drawn the figurative name of the final conflict between the hosts of good and evil, from the 'place which is called in the Hebrew tongue Harmagedon'"
3. "The word, like Euphrates, is the expression of an idea; the idea that swift and overwhelming destruction shall overtake all who gather themselves together against the Lord"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The simple meaning of the word is ‚Äòthe mountain of destruction.‚Äô"
2. "No particular place either in Palestine or elsewhere is pointed at; nor is any particular event referred to."
3. "The word, like Euphrates, is the expression of an idea, the idea that swift and overwhelming destruction shall overtake all who gather themselves together against the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They gathered (œÉœÖŒΩŒ∑Œ≥Œ±Œ≥ŒµŒΩ). Second aorist active indicative of œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâ, singular (the three unclean spirits), like ŒµŒ∫œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒµœÑŒ± in verse Revelation 16:14."
2. "Har-Magedon (HŒ±œÅ-ŒúŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒ¥œâŒΩ). John proceeds now after the interruption in verse Revelation 16:15. Perhaps 'the mountains of Megiddo' though not certain."
3. "Megiddo is in the valley of Esdraelon, and by the waters of Megiddo (the Kishon) Israel gained a decisive victory over Sisera (Judges 5:19), celebrated in Deborah's song. See also Revelation 20:8; Revelation 20:4."

### John Gill:
1. "They gathered them together; will persuade the Papal, Pagan, and Mahometan powers, the remains of them in the several parts of the world, to join together, and make one effort for the reviving of their declining, and almost ruined interests."
 
2. "This refers either to the slaying of Josiah in the valley of Megiddo, which occasioned such mourning, that it became proverbial for any great sorrow; or rather to the slaughter of Sisera's army at the waters of Megiddo, by Barak, suggesting that the same would be the fate of these united powers."
3. "Since it is a Hebrew name that will be given it, it may lead us to conclude it will be somewhere in Judea, and very likely no other than the valley of Jehoshaphat, where all nations will be gathered."

### John Wesley:
1. "Mageddon, or Megiddo, is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament."
2. "Armageddon signifies the city or the mountain of Megiddo; to which the valley of Megiddo adjoined."
3. "Here the narrative breaks off. It is resumed, Revelation 19:19."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse mentions a place called Harmagedon, which could refer to Megiddo, a real place associated with significant battles in history. This place was connected to the defeat of the Canaanite kings and the slaughter of Josiah. Megiddo, meaning slaughter, symbolizes the final conflict between good and evil, where swift and overwhelming destruction will befall those who gather against the Lord. The mention of this place in the Revelation is significant because it draws from the Galilean fisherman's knowledge of the many battles that took place there. The term Harmagedon, like the Euphrates, represents the idea that all those who oppose God will face decisive judgment. The verse also suggests that the three unclean spirits will gather together to persuade the declining powers of Papal, Pagan, and Mahometan influences to unite and make one final effort to revive their interests. Ultimately, the narrative breaks off at this point and is later resumed in Revelation 19:19.
