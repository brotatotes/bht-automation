## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The voice, as in ver. 1, of God himself."
2. "The plagues are the last plagues: if therefore they are done, all is done."
3. "The declaration is of course made in anticipation, and imports that the outpouring of the seventh vial had done that which should accomplish all and bring in the end."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is doneâ€”"It is come to pass." God's voice as to the final consummation, as Jesus' voice on the cross when the work of expiation was completed, 'It is finished.'" 
2. "But A and B, 'upon' (Greek, 'epi')."
3. "greatâ€”so B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The most probable supposition as to the idea intended to be represented is, that, as storms and tempests seem to be engendered in the air, so this destruction would come from some supernatural cause, as if the whole atmosphere should be filled with wind and storm; and a furious and desolating whirlwind should be aroused by some invisible power."
2. "And there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven - The voice of God."
3. "The meaning here is, that that destruction was so certain, that it might be spoken of as now actually accomplished."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "It is done, i.e all Godâ€™s purposes are accomplished: all the plagues are poured out; the end is reached."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Upon the air. All men breathe the air and this is worse than the smiting of the earth, the sea, the fresh waters, the sun."
2. "A great voice. The voice of God."
3. "It is done. The whole series of plagues is now complete."

### John Gill:
1. "This vial differs from all the rest; that whereas the rest only affect some part or branch of the antichristian state, this will affect all the remains of the Pagan, Papal, and Mahometan powers, gathered and united together at Armageddon."
2. "The first accomplishment of this vial will be the decisive battle at Armageddon, when the remains of all Christ's and his church's enemies will have a total defeat; and this will be the third and last woe, which will utterly destroy those that have destroyed the earth, Pagans, Papists, and Mahometans, even all the open enemies of Christ, so that nothing will lie in the way of his kingdom."
3. "But though antichrist will be no more, and Satan will have no more in form an open kingdom upon earth; yet, towards the close of this reign, great lukewarmness and coldness will seize professors of religion, and immorality and profaneness will abound again; which will bring on the times of the coming of the son of man."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the seventh poured out his phial upon the air â€” Which encompasses the whole earth." 
2. "This is the most weighty phial of all, and seems to take up more time than any of the preceding."
3. "It is done â€” What was commanded, verse 1. The phials are poured out."
