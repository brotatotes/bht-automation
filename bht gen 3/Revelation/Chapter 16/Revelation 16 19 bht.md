## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And the great city became into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell."
2. "Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath."
3. "The sense is, that all these material judgments were but prefatory; the divine intent, in the midst of them, being to make Babylon drink the cup of His wrath in her judgment which follows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "It is now that the last call to escape from Babylon is given to God's people in her."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The certain and entire ruin of the power is predicted by this, but still it is not improbable that it will be by such divisions, or such successions of judgments, that it is proper to represent the city as divided into three portions."
2. "The cities of numerous 'nations' are now, and have been for ages, under the control of the papal power, or the spiritual Babylon; and the calamity that will smite the central power as such - that is, as a spiritual power - will reach and affect them all."
3. "If it falls in Rome, there is not influence enough out of Rome to continue it in being - and in all its extended ramifications it will die as the body dies when the head is severed; as the power of provinces ceases when ruin comes upon the capital."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning is that the city was broken up and overthrown."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Came into three parts" (Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒ± again). In Revelation 11:3 a tenth part of the city fell. Babylon (Rome) is meant (Revelation 17:18)."

### John Gill:
1. "the whole Romish jurisdiction, which is the great city, that reigns over the kings of the earth"

3. "the pouring out of all his vengeance, to the utter ruin of the Romish antichrist"

### John Wesley:
