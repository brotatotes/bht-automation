## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And the first departed and poured out his vial into the earth...and there came an evil and painful sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast and that worshipped his image." 
2. "The earth, which before in ver. 1 was general, is now particular, and correlative with the objects of the other vials."
3. "The allegorical and historical interpretations have been very various: see them in Elliott, vol. iv. Notice the parallel with the sixth Egyptian plague, Exod. ix. 8 ff. Compare Deut. xxviii, 27, 35."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reason why the sixth Egyptian plague is the first here is because it was directed against the Egyptian magicians, Jannes and Jambres, so that they could not stand before Moses; and so here the plague is sent upon those who in the beast worship had practiced sorcery." 
2. "As they submitted to the mark of the beast, so they must bear the mark of the avenging God."
3. "This first vial is subsequent to the period of the beast's rule."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The symbol would properly denote that 'tremendous outbreak of social and moral evil, of democratic fury, atheism, and vice, which was specially seen to characterize the French revolution: that of which the ultimate source was in the long and deep-seated corruption and irreligion of the nation; the outward vent, expression, and organ of its Jacobin clubs, and seditious and atheistic publications...the dissolution of all society, all morals, and all religion.'" 
2. "Of this sad chapter in the history of man, it is unnecessary to give any description here. For scenes of horror, pollution, and blood, its parallel has never been found in the history of our race."
3. "The whole history of the race there has never been an outbreak of evil that showed so deep pollution and corruption within."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Noisome and grievous [Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄŒøŒΩŒ∑œÅŒøŒΩ]. Similarly the two cognate nouns kakia and ponria malice and wickedness occur together in 1 Corinthians 5:8." 
2. "Sore [ŒµŒªŒ∫ŒøœÇ]. See on Luke 16:20. Compare the sixth Egyptian plague, Exodus 9:8-12, where the Septuagint uses this word elkov boil."
3. "Also of the boil or scab of leprosy, Leviticus 13:18; king Hezekiah 's boil, 2 Kings 20:7; the botch of Egypt, Deuteronomy 28:27, Deuteronomy 28:35."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole earth is thought of, and no more only a third part of it as at chap. Revelation 8:7." 
2. "The idea of the plague is taken from that of Egypt in Exodus 9:8-12, but it cannot be literally understood, for literal interpretation is wholly inapplicable to the sixth bowl."
3. "All the bowls must be interpreted on the same principles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Each angel 'went off' to perform his task." 
2. "There came a noisome and grievous sore." 
3. "The magicians were attacked in Egypt and the worshippers of Caesar [were attacked] here."

### John Gill:
1. "Though these vials are so many plagues upon antichrist, they are each of them so many steps to the advancement of Christ's kingdom and glory."
2. "This may design something internal, either the remorse of their consciences, reflections on their past practices, and black despair and horror of mind."
3. "Their secret and wicked practices, both in political and ecclesiastical affairs, will be discovered, and they will appear with boils and blotches upon them all over, which will render them odious to the people, and be the means of a general reformation."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the first went ‚Äî So the second, third, etc., without adding angel, to denote the utmost swiftness; of which this also is a token, that there is no period of time mentioned in the pouring out of each phial."
2. "They have a great resemblance to the plagues of Egypt, which the Hebrews generally suppose to have been a month distant from each other. Perhaps so may the phials; but they are all yet to come."
3. "All those plagues seem to be described in proper, not figurative, words."
