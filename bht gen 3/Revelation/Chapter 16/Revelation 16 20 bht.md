# Revelation 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the final and decisive judgment, the earth will witness a tremendous upheaval, as the mountains are nowhere to be found and hailstones of immense weight fall upon it. Astonishingly, despite the severity of these divine judgments, humanity, instead of repenting, chooses to blaspheme God and remains stubbornly unrepentant. This parallel description of the last judgment depicts the complete eradication of all evil forces, both on islands and the mainland, suggesting the dissolution and plundering of monasteries. Ultimately, this cataclysm brings about a new world order, free from sea and mountains, displaying the earth-shaking power of God's judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "not as A. V., 'the mountains were not found,' The expression is far stronger than this: amounting to that in ch, vi. 14, that every mountain was removed out of its place and was looked for in vain"
2. "i. e. having each hail stone of that weight. Diodorus Siculus speaks of hailstones of a mina each in weight as being enormous: and the talent contained sixty minÃ¦."
3. "mankind in general,â€”not those who were struck by the hailstones, who would instantly die,â€”so far from repenting at this great and final judgment of God, blasphemed him and were impenitent."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 20. Plainly parallel to :-, and by anticipation descriptive of the last judgment. 
	
the mountainsâ€”rather as
	Greek, "there were found no mountains."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Expressive of great and terrible judgments, as if the very earth were convulsed, and everything were moved out of its place."
2. "The mountains were not found."
3. "The same image occurs in Revelation 6:14."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found." The language used is even stronger than that of chap. Revelation 6:14.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Islands sometimes sink in the sea in earthquakes."
2. "Were not found."
3. "See Revelation 20:11 for the same idea."

### John Gill:
1. "And every island fled away... there will be no more sea, Revelation 21:1 and so consequently no islands."
2. "and the mountains were not found... new heavens, and a new earth, without sea or mountains, will succeed."
3. "this may signify the utter extirpation of all the antichristian powers in every shape, whether on islands or on the continent... may particularly respect the dissolution of monasteries, and the plundering them of their riches and revenues."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every island and mountain was 'moved out of its place'... What a change must this make in the face of the terraqueous globe!" 
2. "Here they all flee away... And yet the end of the world is not come."
