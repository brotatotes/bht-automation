# Revelation 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the description of the final judgment is portrayed with tremendous intensity. The language used parallels the scene in another Scripture, depicting the removal of mountains from their places. This signifies the eradication of wicked powers, not only restricted to islands but extending to the mainland as well. Although the magnitude of this judgment may give the impression of the end of the world, it is essential to recognize that it symbolizes a critical turning point rather than the ultimate conclusion.

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Revelation 16:20, the vivid imagery used to describe the final judgment is striking. Similar to the scene in Revelation 6:14, where every mountain was removed and no longer found, here we see an escalation in the magnitude of judgment.

The extent of this judgment is such that it seems like the dissolution of the world itself, yet it is important to note that this represents a significant turning point, but it is not the end of the world.
