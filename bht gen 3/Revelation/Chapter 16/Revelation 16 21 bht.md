# Revelation 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the hail of divine wrath descends upon the people, it does not invoke repentance or reverence for God; on the contrary, they blaspheme Him. This is in stark contrast to previous instances where calamities led to acknowledgement and glorification of God. The hailstones themselves are symbolic of God's judgement, and their immense weight signifies the complete and awful destruction that they bring. The men who blaspheme are the ungodly, and their defiance serves as evidence that the final judgement is imminent.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "fellâ€”Greek, 'descends.' upon menâ€”Greek, 'the men.' and men blasphemed Godâ€”not those struck who died, but the rest."
2. "Unlike the result in the case of Jerusalem (Revelation 11:13), where 'the remnant . . . affrighted . . . gave glory to the God of heaven.'"
3. "wasâ€”Greek, 'is.'"
