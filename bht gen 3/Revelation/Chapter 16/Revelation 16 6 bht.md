Because they shed the blood of saints and prophets, they have been given blood to drink as a measure for measure. The absence of any particle before these words emphasizes their strength.

Their abundant shedding of blood has caused their drinking-water to be replaced with coagulated blood, symbolizing their guilt.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Blood hast thou given them to drink (Î±Î¹Î¼Î± Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Î¹Ï‚ Î´ÎµÎ´Ï‰ÎºÎ±Ï‚ Ï€ÎµÎ¹Î½). HÎ±Î¹Î¼Î± (blood) is the emphatic word, measure for measure for shedding the blood of saints and prophets."
2. "Î ÎµÎ¹Î½ is the abbreviated second aorist active infinitive of Ï€Î¹Î½Ï‰ for Ï€Î¹ÎµÎ¹Î½ (ÎµÏ€Î¹Î¿Î½). It is the epexegetical infinitive after Î´ÎµÎ´Ï‰ÎºÎ±Ï‚. There was no more drinking-water, but only this coagulated blood."
3. "They are worthy (Î±Î¾Î¹Î¿ ÎµÎ¹ÏƒÎ¹Î½). 'Terrible antithesis' (Swete) to Revelation 3:4. The asyndeton adds to it (Alford)."

### John Gill:
1. "Rivers and fountains cannot be literally understood, but men are designed, wicked and bloody men."
2. "It is notorious to all, how much of the blood of the saints, of the preachers of the Gospel, of the prophets and witnesses, have been shed in Italy, Savoy, and other places near Rome, as well as in Rome itself."
3. "For they are worthy; or deserving, to have their blood shed by the law of retaliation."

### John Wesley:

2. "Is subjoined with a beautiful abruptness."
3. "They are worthy."
