# Revelation 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the men experienced the plagues and were scorched with great heat, they refused to repent and give God glory. Instead, this affliction hardened their hearts and caused them to blaspheme God. They blamed Him for the plagues and failed to recognize His power over them. This highlights the sobering reality that even deserved punishment can lead to further hardness of the heart, rather than repentance. Truly, repentance is not a power within ourselves, but a gracious gift from God.
