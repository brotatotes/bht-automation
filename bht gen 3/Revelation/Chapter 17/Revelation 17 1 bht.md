# Revelation 17:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The symbolism in this verse presents the whore as the apostate Church, contrasting with the faithful Church represented by 'the woman'. Satan's failure using violence pushes him to allure the apostate Church with worldly enticements. The whore is described as spiritually Sodom, no longer associated with Jerusalem. Some interpretations identify her as Babylon, pagan Rome, Papal Rome, or Jerusalem, given her sitting upon many waters, symbolizing the wealth sourced from the Euphrates and canals. An angel, associated with the seven bowls, explains the judgment on Babylon using the word that Jeremiah used to describe Babylon's doom.
