## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The beast is not actually put out of existence, but has only received a deadly wound which is again healed."
2. "He is of the seven,â€”not 'one of the seven,' but the successor and result of the seven, following and springing out of them."
3. "There can be little doubt in the mind of the student of prophecy, who is thus described: that it is the ultimate antichristian power."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That a personal Antichrist will stand at the head of the Antichristian kingdom, is likely from the analogy of Antiochus Epiphanes, the Old Testament Antichrist." 
2. "He is essentially a child of destruction, and hence he has but a little time ascended out of the bottomless pit when he 'goes into perdition.'" 
3. "The eighth is not merely one of the seven restored, but a new power or person proceeding out of the seven, and at the same time embodying all the God-opposed features of the previous seven concentrated and consummated."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident that, by the 'beast' here, there is some one power, dominion, empire, or rule, whose essential identity is preserved through all these changes, and to which it is proper to give the same name."
2. "This seems to be the fair meaning, though there is much that is enigmatical in the form of the expression."
3. "The papacy...constituting that mighty dominion which was to be set up for so many centuries over what had been the Roman world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'beast' here is, therefore, identical with that of Revelation 17:8; that is, with the beast as it was thought of at a time prior to any mention, in Revelation 17:9, of the successive forms of its manifestation."
2. "At the same time it is possible that the Seer desires to bring out this fact in connection with the beast, that he may identify it with the 'Little Horn' of Daniel 7:8. That Little Horn takes the place of three out of ten horns which are plucked up by the roots, that is of the eighth, ninth, and tenth horns."
3. "The 'eighth' world-power is not then wholly new. It is the old world-power concentrating in itself all the rage of the seven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is the angel's interpretation and it looks like a reference to Domitian as the eighth, who is regarded as one of the seven because he was considered a second Nero (Nero redivivus)." 
2. "John may have used ÎµÎº Ï„Ï‰Î½ instead of ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ ÎµÎº Ï„Ï‰Î½ to avoid absolute identity between Domitian and Nero." 
3. "The tyrant's end was a symbol of the end to which the Beast which he personated was hastening."

### John Gill:
1. "The pope of Rome is the eighth king, and seventh head, the latter with respect to his temporal power, and the former with respect to his ecclesiastical authority."
2. "His government is quite of a different sort from the rest, being of a mixed kind, partly civil, and partly ecclesiastical."
3. "He is the son of perdition, and is justly deserving of it."
