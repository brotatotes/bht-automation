# Revelation 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The waters symbolize the harlot's dominion over peoples, nations, and languages, a deliberate parody of God's eternal reign. The Pope claims supremacy over all, spiritual and temporal, represented by the two keys. However, this false claim is contrasted with Christ's true authority, who will exercise twofold dominion. The association with Babylon and the confusion of tongues at Babel highlights the harlot's idolatrous apostasy. Rome's greatest danger lies in the vast multitudes she controls, but these very waters will bring about her eventual downfall.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages."
2. "The king of Assyria and his invading people are compared to the waters of the river, strong and many."
3. "There is also doubtless an impious parody intended in the position of the harlot to that of Him who sitteth above the water-flood, and remaineth King for ever."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Pope, as the chief representative of the harlot, claims a double supremacy over all peoples, typified by the 'two swords' according to the interpretation of Boniface VIII in the Bull, 'Unam Sanctam,' and represented by the two keys: spiritual as the universal bishop, whence he is crowned with the miter and temporal, whence he is also crowned with the tiara in token of his imperial supremacy." 
2. "Contrast with the Pope's diadems the 'many diadems' of Him who alone has claim to, and shall exercise when He shall come, the twofold dominion (Revelation 19:12)."
3. "Babylon is the appropriate name of the harlot. The 'tongues' remind us of the original Babel, the confusion of tongues, the beginning of Babylon, and the first commencement of idolatrous apostasy after the flood, as the tower was doubtless dedicated to the deified heavens."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The waters which thou sawest - See the notes on Revelation 17:1. Are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."
2. "The meaning here is: (a) that these waters represent a multitude of people. This is a common and an obvious symbol - for outspread seas or raging floods would naturally represent such a multitude."
3. "Perhaps under no one government - not even the Babylonian, the Macedonian, or the ancient Roman - was there so great a diversity of people, speaking so many different languages, and having so different an origin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The waters. The explanation of the symbol given here is in accordance with Isaiah 8:7; Psalms 18:4, Psalms 18:16; Psalms 124:14. 
Peoples and multitudes, etc. See on 1 Peter 2:9; Mark 12:37.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fourfold designation of those who constitute the waters."
2. "A clear proof that the harlot exercises her sway over the whole world."
3. "In travesty of Him 'who sitteth upon the flood,' who 'sitteth King for ever'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Where the harlot sitteth...Are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues." 
2. "The O.T. uses 'waters' as symbol for 'peoples.'" 
3. "Rome's greatest danger lay in the multitudes which were under her sway."

### John Gill:
1. "The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues." 
2. "And because of their overbearing force, carrying all before them."
3. "They will hate the whore they love; and as they frequently change and alter in their form, at last they will utterly cease."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The waters where the harlot sits in Revelation symbolize the extent of her dominion over peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. It is a deliberate mockery of the position of God, who reigns above the floods forever. The harlot, represented by the Pope as the chief representative, claims a dual supremacy over all people, spiritual and temporal. However, this false claim contrasts with the true authority of Christ, who will exercise twofold dominion when He returns. The association with Babylon and the confusion of tongues at Babel further emphasizes the idolatrous apostasy represented by the harlot. Rome's greatest danger lies in the vast multitudes under her sway, but eventually, these very waters will turn against her and bring about her downfall.

- Attempt 4 BHT: The waters depicted in Revelation symbolize the broad scope of the harlot's influence, encompassing peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. It is a blasphemous imitation of God's sovereignty over the floods. The harlot, embodied in the Pope as the primary representative, asserts a twofold supremacyâ€“spiritual and temporalâ€“over all people. However, this claim stands in contrast to the true dominion of Christ. Rome's greatest peril lies in the multitudes under its control, yet these very waters will eventually turn against the harlot, leading to its eventual demise.

- Attempt 5 BHT: The harlot seated upon the waters in Revelation signifies her dominion over peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. This position intentionally mocks God, symbolizing the one who reigns above the floodwaters eternally. The Pope, as the harlot's representative, claims superiority over all, both in a spiritual sense as the universal bishop and in a temporal sense as the supreme ruler. However, this false claim contrasts with the true authority of Christ, who alone possesses the twofold dominion. Ultimately, the waters that were once under Rome's sway will turn against her and lead to her downfall.
