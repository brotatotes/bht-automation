## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These shall hate the harlot, and shall make her deserted and naked... She shall lose... her spiritual power over them, and her temporal power to adorn herself." 
2. "They shall eat her flesh, and shall consume her with fire... The burning of the city would be a signal fulfillment: but we cannot positively say that that, and nothing else is intended." 
3. "The woman may be here also intended: and all the more probably, because the very words 'shall consume her with fire' are quoted from the legal formula of the condemnation of those who had committed abominable fornications."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But the Church, having apostatized to the world, shall have judgment executed on her first by the beast and his allies; and these afterwards shall have judgment executed on them by Christ Himself in person."
2. "So the Church when it goes a-whoring after the world as if it were the reality, instead of witnessing against its apostasy from God, is false to its profession."
3. "How striking a retribution, that having obtained her first temporal dominions, she should be stripped of her dominions by another usurper!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These shall hate the whore - There seems to be some incongruity between this statement and what was previously made. In the former Revelation 17:12-14, these ten governments are represented as in alliance with the beast; as 'giving all their power and strength' unto it; and as uniting with it in making war with the Lamb."
2. "That is, it will be accomplished if the nations of Europe, embraced within the limits of those ten kingdoms, shall become hostile to the papacy, and shall combine for its overthrow."
3. "And shall make her desolate and naked - Strip her of all her power and all her attractiveness. That is, applied to papal Rome, all that is so gorgeous and alluring - her wealth, and pomp, and splendor - shall be taken away, and she will be seen as she is, without anything to dazzle the eye or to blind the mind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall eat her flesh. A token of extreme hostility."
2. "No one of the pure Spartans could conceal his readiness to eat the Helot raw."
3. "Burn [ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±ÎºÎ±Ï…ÏƒÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î½] . Rev., giving the force of kata down, burn utterly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The bond which in prosperity had bound the wicked co-labourers together is dissolved, the partners in evil fall out, the one section turns round upon the other, and she who had found ready instruments in the beast and its heads for accomplishing the work to which she had spurred them on sees them, in the hour of common despair, fall upon herself and mercilessly destroy her."
2. "A great principle is proceeded upon, one often exemplified in the world, that combinations of the wicked for a common crime soon break up, leaving the guilty associates to turn upon and destroy one another."
3. "But it is difficult not to think that there was especially one great drama present to the Seerâ€™s mind, and suggestive of this lesson that drama which embodied in intensest action all the great forces that move the world the drama of the life and death of Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The downfall of Rome will come from the sudden change in subject peoples."
2. "Shall make her desolate and naked."
3. "Shall burn her utterly with fire."

### John Gill:
1. "The ten kings and states in particular, who have defended antichrist, and the whole empire in general, which has bore up and supported the whore of Rome: these shall hate the whore."
2. "They will repent of their fornications with her, and cease from them; their love will be turned to hatred, and the latter will be greater than ever the former was, like Amnon's to Tamar."
3. "And we may learn from hence, that Rome, and the Romish antichrist, will not be destroyed by the Turks, but by the Christians; and by the same states, and kingdoms, and princes, by which the whore of Rome has been supported in her grandeur, power, and authority, who will revolt from Popery, and embrace the pure Gospel of Christ."
