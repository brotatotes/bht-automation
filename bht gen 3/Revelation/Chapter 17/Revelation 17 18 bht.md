## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The 'city on seven hills which rules the world,' can be but one, and that one ROME."
2. "If we understand it thus, nothing is left us but to say, as indeed some of this school are not afraid to say, that only the Seerâ€™s wish dictated his words, and that history has not verified them."
3. "For us, who believe the prophecy is to be fulfilled, what was Rome then, is Rome now. Her fornications and abominations, as well as her power and pride, are matter of history and of present fact: and we look for her destruction to come, as we believe it is rapidly coming, by the means and in the manner here foretold."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The harlot cannot be a mere city literally, but is called so in a spiritual sense."
2. "Also the beast cannot represent a spiritual power, but a world power."
3. "In this verse the harlot is presented before us ripe for judgment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Rome, either as pagan or as Christian, is referred to."
2. "The chapter shows that its power is limited; and that, although for purposes which he saw to be wise, God allows it to have a wide influence over the nations of the earth, yet, in his own appointed time, the very powers that have sustained it will become its foes, and combine for its overthrow."
3. "Europe needs but little further provocation, and the fires of liberty... will again be aroused in a manner which cannot be allayed, and that mighty power...will come to an end."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Reigneth [ÎµÏ‡Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ± Î²Î±Î¿Î¹Î»ÎµÎ¹Î±Î½] . Lit., hath a kingdom. 


### Philip Schaff:
1. "That Rome may be here present to the mind of St. John it would be difficult to deny."
2. "The idea of the Seer is certainly wider than that of any single city or power of the world."
3. "The city must be some faithless spiritual power which, under the last manifestation of the beast, enters into a league with the world, ministers to it, and lends to its material forces an influence for evil which they would not otherwise possess."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The woman is the city of Rome 'which reigneth over the kings of the earth.'" 
2. "Rome followed Babylon, and other cities may follow in their train."

### John Gill:
1. "And the woman which thou sawest... is that great city, often mentioned in this book; great Babylon, the city of Rome, which reigneth over the kings of the earth." 
2. "This clearly points out the city of Rome, for there was no other city then, but that, which reigned over the kings of the earth; that was then the metropolis of the Roman empire, to which the whole world was subject."
