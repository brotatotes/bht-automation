## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "she is contented to have her portion in this moral wilderness."
2. "Rome, resting on the world power and ruling it by the claim of supremacy, is the chief, though not the exclusive, representative of this symbol."
3. "Still, there is some check on the God-opposed world power while ridden by the harlot; the consummated Antichrist will be when, having destroyed her, the beast shall be revealed as the concentration and incarnation of all the self-deifying God-opposed principles which have appeared in various forms and degrees heretofore."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The imagery is changed somewhat from the first appearance of the harlot in Revelation 17:1. There she is represented as 'sitting upon many waters.' Now she is represented as 'riding on a beast,' and of course the imagery is adapted to that."
2. "On the supposition, now, that the inspired author of the Apocalypse had Rome, in that state when the civil power declined and the papacy arose, in his eye, what more expressive imagery could he have used to denote it than he has employed?"
3. "It is applicable in the description of papal Rome, because this is a favorite color there. Thus it is used in Revelation 12:3, where the same power is represented under the image of a 'red dragon.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. sitting. To manage and guide the beast. 
A scarlet - colored beast. The same as in ch. 13 1. This beast is ever after mentioned as to qhrion the beast. For scarlet, see on Matthew 27:6.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Amidst all Babylon's pomp and luxury, the place where she reigns is really desolate."
2. "The attitude of the woman towards the beast...is that she is the beast's directress and guide."
3. "The harlot holds the reins, and with skillful hand guides the beast to the accomplishment of its aims."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He carried me away (Œ±œÄŒ∑ŒΩŒµŒ≥Œ∫ŒµŒΩ ŒºŒµ). Second aorist active indicative of Œ±œÄŒøœÜŒµœÅœâ, to bear away, prophetic aorist. This verb is used of angels at death (Luke 16:22) or in an ecstasy (Revelation 21:10 and here)."
2. "Into a wilderness (ŒµŒπœÇ ŒµœÅŒ∑ŒºŒøŒΩ). In Isaiah 21:1 there is œÑŒø ŒøœÅŒ±ŒºŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµœÅŒ∑ŒºŒøœÖ (the vision of the deserted one, Babylon), and in Isaiah 14:23 Babylon is called ŒµœÅŒ∑ŒºŒøŒΩ. John may here picture this to be the fate of Rome or it may be that he himself, in the wilderness (desert) this side of Babylon, sees her fate."
3. "The harlot city (Rome) sits astride this beast with seven heads and ten horns (Roman world power). The beast is here personified with masculine participles instead of neuter, like Œ∏Œ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ (Œ≥ŒµŒºŒøŒΩœÑŒ± accusative singular, ŒµœáœâŒΩ nominative singular, though some MSS. read ŒµœáŒøŒΩœÑŒ±), construction according to sense in both instances."

### John Gill:
1. "Not in body, as if he was removed from the isle of Patmos to some other place; but in a visionary way, just as Ezekiel was carried between earth and heaven, in the visions of God, to Jerusalem."
2. "By which may be meant either the wilderness of the people, the world, the church hereafter described, being a worldly one, and consisting of worldly men; or Gentilism, the Gentile world is often in the prophecies of the Old Testament called a wilderness."
3. "The beast is the same with that in Revelation 13:1 as the description shows, and is no other than the Roman empire as Papal; the 'scarlet' colour is expressive of its imperial dignity, its power and authority, it received from the dragon."

### John Wesley:
1. "The campagna di Roma, the country round about Rome, is now a wilderness, compared to what it was once."
2. "Both the scripture and other writers frequently represent a city under this emblem."
3. "From the time of Hildebrand, the blasphemous titles of the Pope have been abundantly multiplied."
