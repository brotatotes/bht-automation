# Revelation 17:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman's name on her forehead is not a literal designation, but rather a spiritual and enigmatic symbol. It represents the corrupt Church of Rome, which leads to spiritual fornication and corruption. This stands in stark contrast to the holiness represented by the inscription on the high priest's forehead. The name signifies the worldliness and harlotry of the Roman Church, and highlights the contrast between the corrupted Church of Rome and the chaste evangelical Protestant Church. The city of Rome is depicted as the metropolis of idolatry and wickedness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For though no such word would in the nature of things be attached to her forehead as part of her designation, so neither would the description which follows Babylon the great, to which the word mystery seems partly to refer." 
2. "But whether part of the name or not, the meaning will be the same: viz. that the title following is to be taken in a spiritual and an enigmatical sense." 
3. "All spiritual fornication and corruption are owing to her, and to her example and teaching."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What a contrast to 'HOLINESS TO THE LORD,' inscribed on the miter on the high priest's forehead!"
2. "The Church conforming to the world and thereby becoming a harlot is a counter 'mystery.'"
3. "The Romish Church is not only accidentally and as a matter of fact, but in virtue of its very PRINCIPLE, a harlot, the metropolis of whoredom, 'the mother of harlots'; whereas the evangelical Protestant Church is, according to her principle and fundamental creed, a chaste woman; the Reformation was a protest of the woman against the harlot."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That is, it was made prominent and public, as if written on the forehead in blazing capitals."
2. "The meaning in both places is substantially the same, that it was prominent, and unmistakable."
3. "There was something hidden, obscure, or enigmatical, under the title adopted; that is, the word 'Babylon,' and the word 'mother,' were symbolical."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Upon her forehead a name. As was customary with harlots, who had their names inscribed on a ticket."
2. "Some understand this as a part of the name, others as implying that the name is to be interpreted symbolically."
3. "The harlot is the corrupted Church of Rome; the seven heads are the seven hills on which the city is built; or perhaps, with an entirely different exegesis, the seven gifts of the Spirit, or the seven sacraments With which that Church had, in its outset, been endowed : the ten horns are the ten commandments."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word â€˜mysteryâ€™ may be understood either as a part of the name, or as an intimation of the writer that the name is to be understood symbolically."
2. "The name of the harlot is thus limited to what follows. Some would even restrict it still further."
3. "The name thus borne upon the forehead is a parody of the name borne upon the forehead of the high priest."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is undoubtedly a contrast between this woman here and the woman in chapter Revelation 17:12."
2. "The Metropolis of the Empire is the mother of harlotry and of the world's idolatries."
3. "Rome as the city 'quo cuncta undique atrocia aut pudenda confluunt celebranturque_.'"

### John Gill:
1. "And this is expressive of the openness and impudence of the church of Rome, in her idolatrous worship; she openly declares it, and pleads for it, and invites and ensnares persons to join with her in it."
2. "Her name is 'mystery'; not the mystery of godliness, that she dislikes and opposes, but the mystery of iniquity."
3. "The church of Rome may well be called [Babylon], because of the signification of it, confusion, its doctrine and worship being a confused mixture of Paganism, Judaism, and Christianity."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whereas the saints have the name of God and the Lamb on their foreheads."
2. "The mother of harlots â€” The parent, ringleader, patroness, and nourisher of many daughters, that loosely copy after her."
3. "And abominations â€” Of every kind, spiritual and fleshly."
