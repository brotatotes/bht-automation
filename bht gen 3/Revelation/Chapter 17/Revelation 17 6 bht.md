## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If this woman is the same as he before saw, who fled into the wilderness from the face of the dragon, 'the faithful city become an harlot,' he might well wonder."
2. "The joint symbolism of the wilderness and the woman could not fail to call up in the mind of the Seer the last occasion when the two occurred together: and insists that this symbol must be continuous throughout."
3. "We may see from it two prophetic truths: first, that the church on earth in the main will become apostate and faithless... and secondly, that while this shall be so, the apostasy shall not embrace the whole church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "John's wonder called forth; not the beast, but the woman sunken into the harlot, the Church become a world-loving apostate, moves his sorrowful astonishment at so awful a change."
2. "That the world should be beastly is natural, but that the faithful bride should become the whore is monstrous, and excites the same amazement in him as the same awful change in Israel excited in Isaiah and Jeremiah."
3. "It is striking that in Revelation 13:3- :, 'woman' has not the article, 'the woman,' as if she had been before mentioned: for though identical in one sense with the woman, Revelation 13:3- :, in another sense she is not."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that the persecuting power referred to had shed the blood of the saints; and that, in its fury, it had, as it were, drunk the blood of the slain, and had become, by drinking that blood, intoxicated and infuriated."
2. "The meaning is, that the warfare, in which so much blood was shed, was directed against the saints as such, and that, in fact, it terminated particularly on those who, amidst cruel sufferings, were faithful witnesses for the Lord Jesus, and deserved to be called, by way of eminence, 'martyrs.'"
3. "I was astonished at her appearance, at her apparel, and at the things which were so significantly symbolized by her."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Saints - martyrs. The saints include the martyrs or witnesses, but the latter word emphasizes the testimony of the saints which has been the cause of their death. For martyr; see on 1 Peter 5:1.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "She drinks, and makes herself drunk with the blood of the saints and of the martyrs of Jesus... Being a woman, she should exhibit such tokens of a cruel and bloodthirsty spirit, denying the nature that properly belonged to her."
2. "He is overwhelmed with astonishment at the spectacle, yet not so much probably at the royal magnificence of the woman, as that, being a woman, she should exhibit such tokens of a cruel and bloodthirsty spirit."
3. "At this point it might have been well to inquire into the meaning of â€˜Babylonâ€™ in these verses, but so much has still to be said of that city that it seems better to delay the inquiry until we have finished the exposition of the whole passage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Drunk with blood" is a common idea with the ancients (Euripides, Josephus, Philo, Cicero, Pliny).
2. "Witnesses" (Revelation 2:13) for Jesus (objective genitive) unto blood (Revelation 16:6; Revelation 18:24) and so martyrs in the modern sense of the word.
3. With a great wonder (Î¸Î±Ï…Î¼Î± Î¼ÎµÎ³Î±). Cognate accusative with ÎµÎ¸Î±Ï…Î¼Î±ÏƒÎ±.

### John Gill:
1. "To see a woman drunk is a shameful sight; but to see one drunk, not with wine, but with blood, is monstrous, cruel, and shocking."
2. "The woman being drunk with their blood denotes the blood thirstiness of the church of Rome, her greedy and insatiable desire after the blood of the saints, and her delight in it."
3. "He wondered at her drunkenness with the blood of the saints; at her inhumanity and cruelty, being as savage as the beast she rode on."

### John Wesley:
1. "So that Rome may well be called, 'The slaughter-house of the martyrs.'"
2. "She hath shed much Christian blood in every age; but at length she is even drunk with it."
3. "And I wondered exceedingly â€” At her cruelty and the patience of God."
