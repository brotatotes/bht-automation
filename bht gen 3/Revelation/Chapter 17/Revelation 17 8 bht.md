# Revelation 17:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The vivid imagery of this vision protests against interpreting it as mere events and persons, instead depicting world-wide and world-long empires and changes. The beast represents the Antichristian world power, which temporarily suspends its beast-like character during the time of the seventh head becoming Christian externally. Following its healing of the deadly wound, the beast's return is accompanied by satanic powers from hell. In contrast, the harlot signifies spurious Christianity, while Christ's little flock constitutes the third class in this spiritual battle. Ultimately, the beast's reign will be short-lived, descending into perdition forever.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Against such a view it seems to me the whole imagery and diction of the vision protest."
2. "She is that city: but she is also mystery."
3. "The present words of our text... will be interpreted as those were interpreted, not of mere passing events and persons, but of world-wide and world-long empires and changes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The time when the beast 'is not' is the time during which it has 'the deadly wound'; the time of the seventh head becoming Christian externally, when its beast-like character was put into suspension temporarily."
2. "The healing of its wound answers to its ascending out of the bottomless pit. The beast, or Antichristian world power, returns worse than ever, with satanic powers from hell."
3. "We are endangered on one side by the spurious Christianity of the harlot, on the other by the open Antichristianity of the beast; the third class is Christ's little flock."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There are three things affirmed here: first, that there is a sense in which it might be said of the power here referred to, that it 'was,' or that, before this, it had an existence."
2. "The power would seem to come up from the nether world... and would, in its revived character, be such as might be expected from such an origin."
3. "It will be so contrary to the regular course of events, so difficult of explanation, so remarkable in itself, as to excite attention and surprise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In ordinary New Testament Greek these words would belong to are written." 
2. "And yet is [Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÄŒµœÅ ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ] . Read kai parestai, and shall come."
3. "For the verb, see on John 6:21; John 8:21."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whatever may be the difficulty of interpreting these words, one thing is clear, that they contain no reference to Nero or any supposed rising of his from the grave."
2. "The evil of the world, beheld by the Seer as concentrating itself in the Roman Empire, is to him the particular form in which the beast existed in his day. Then, by the work of Jesus it was ideally destroyed... Lastly, it bursts forth again to be overwhelmed for ever."
3. "In what he is about to say, he would tell us, the thought of the seven-hilled city may most readily occur to the superficial reader. But we are not to think of it. 'Wisdom' leads to a less literal, to a more spiritual, interpretation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is a picture of the beast of Revelation 13:1 which the woman is riding, but no longer just the empire, but one of the emperors who died (ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ, is not)." 
2. "Most interpreters see here an allusion to the 'Nero redivivus' expectancy realized in Domitian, who was ruling when John wrote and who was called Nero redivivus." 
3. "John had wondered (ŒµŒ∏Œ±œÖŒºŒ±œÉŒ±) in verse Revelation 17:6 'with the amazement of a horrible surprise; the world will wonder and admire'" (Swete).

### John Gill:
1. "It is added at the end of the verse where the same description is given, 'and yet is'; this beast is to be understood not of the devil, who 'was' the god of this world, 'is not', being cast out by Christ, and yet is in being" 
2. "but the Roman empire itself is intended...which carried and supported the Papacy" 
3. "the meaning is, that this beast 'was' the Roman empire, as Pagan, described by a dragon with seven heads, and ten horns, with crowns on the heads, but is not as yet in the Apostle John's time, as Papal, described with seven heads, and ten horns, and crowns on the horns."

### John Wesley:
1. "And is not ‚Äî The fifth phial brought darkness upon his kingdom: the woman took this advantage to seat herself upon him. Then it might be said, He is not."
2. "Yet shall he afterwards ascend out of the bottomless pit - Arise again with diabolical strength and fury."
3. "But he will not reign long: soon after his ascent he goeth into perdition for ever."
