## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Here [is] the mind that hath wisdom." 
2. "The seven heads are seven mountains, where (so literally) the woman sitteth upon them."
3. "The city on seven hills, that ruleth all the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The connection between mountains and kings must be deeper than the mere outward fact to which incidental allusion is made, that Rome (the then world city) is on seven hills."
2. "The true connection is, as the head is the prominent part of the body, so the mountain is prominent in the land. Like 'sea' and 'earth' and 'waters...peoples,' so 'mountains' have a symbolical meaning, namely, prominent seats of power."
3. "The woman sitting on the seven hills implies the Old and New Testament Church conforming to, and resting on, the world power, that is, on all the seven world kingdoms."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Here is what requires wisdom to interpret it; or, here is a case in which the mind that shows itself able to explain it will evince true sagacity."
2. "It is undoubtedly implied that the symbol might be understood - whether in the time of John, or afterward, he does not say; but it was a matter which could not be determined by ordinary minds, or without an earnest application of the understanding."
3. "The city represented as a woman, in accordance with a common usage in the Scriptures."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bespeaking attention and spiritual discernment for that which follows."
2. "Noux is the organ of mental perception and apprehension - of conscious life, the mind, comprising the faculties of perceiving and understanding, of feeling, judging, determining."
3. "Many interpreters regard this as conclusively defining the reference of the woman to Rome, which was built upon seven hills."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is the mind which hath wisdom...the intelligence which has wisdom." 
2. "Rome was known as the city on seven hills." 
3. "In Revelation 13:1 it is the beast that has the seven heads, while here the woman riding the beast has seven heads, a slight change in the symbolism."

### John Gill:
1. "This refers either to what goes before, concerning the beast, his various states, rise, and ruin, and his admirers; or to what follows after, concerning the meaning of his heads and horns, or to both; and the sense is, that notwithstanding the interpretation of these things by the angel, yet it requires a large share of wisdom to understand them."
2. "The words may be rendered, 'here is the mind, he that hath wisdom'; that is, let him make use of it, as in Revelation 13:18 and so the Vulgate Latin version renders it, 'and this is the sense, he that hath wisdom'; this is the sense of the beast, and of his heads and horns."
3. "This confirms that the beast before spoken of, on whom the woman sat, is the Roman empire, since she is here said to sit on the seven mountains, on which Rome, the metropolis of that empire, was built; and this shows the pope of Rome to be antichrist, the great whore, Babylon, the mother of harlots, since no other has his seat at Rome but he."

### John Wesley:
1. Here is the mind that hath wisdom â€” Only those who are wise will understand this. The seven heads are seven hills.
