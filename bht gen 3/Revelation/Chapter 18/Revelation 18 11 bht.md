## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difficulty is however not confined to the application of the prophecy to Rome papal, but extends over the application of it to Rome at all, which last is determined for us by the solution given ch. xvi. 18."
2. "The main features of the description are taken from that of the destruction of and lamentation over Tyre in Ezek. xxvii., to which city they were strictly applicable."
3. "But certainly, as has been observed, the details of this mercantile lamentation far more nearly suit London, than Rome at any assignable period of her history."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The merchandise must therefore be spiritual, even as the harlot is not literal, but spiritual."
2. "She cared not for the sheep, but for the wool."
3. "Professing Christian merchants in her lived as if this world not heaven, were the reality, and were unscrupulous as to the means of getting gain."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The image is that of a rich and splendid city. Of course, such a city depends much on its merchandise; and when it declines and falls, many who had been accustomed to deal with it, as merchants or traffickers, are affected by it, and have occasion to lament its fall."
2. "Shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise anymore - The merchandise which they were accustomed to take to the city, and by the sale of which they lived."
3. "The enumeration of the articles of merchandise which follows, seems to have been inserted for the purpose of filling out the representation of what is usually found in such a city, and to show the desolation which would occur when this traffic was suspended."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Merchandise [Î³Î¿Î¼Î¿Î½] . Only here, ver. 12, and Acts 21:3. From gemw to be full. Hence, literally, lading or cargo." 
2. "The main features of the following description are taken from that of the destruction of Tyre, Ezekiel 26:27."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The dirge of the merchants follows the wail of the kings."
2. "Reason enough for their sorrow over Rome's fall."
3. "Many of the items here are like those in the picture of the destruction of Tyre."

### John Gill:
1. "What their merchandise is, is expressed in the two next verses; and this shows that it is not to be understood merely in a literal sense."
2. "The decline of trade in one city does not put a stop to business all the world over; and often so it is, that the ruin of commerce in one place is the rise of it in another."
3. "It looks as if this must be understood of such kind of wares as will be disused and despised all the world over, and they will meet with no customers any where to deal with them in them."
