## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Various accounts are given of its origin, but Herodotus, who ascribes it to the country where Dionysus [Bacchus] was born, i.e. to India, seems to give the right statement, if at least it is the modern cinnamon, which comes from Ceylon." 
2. "It seems vain to attempt to draw a distinction between the bodies before mentioned and these souls or persons of men." 
3. "If any is to be sought, the most obvious is that pointed out by Bengel, and adopted by Ewald, Hengstenberg, and D√ºsterdieck, that bodies expresses such slaves as belong to the horses and chariots, and persons of men slaves in general."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "cinnamon‚Äîdesigned by God for better purposes: being an ingredient in the holy anointing oil, and a plant in the garden of the Beloved; but desecrated to vile uses by the adulteress." 
2. "souls of men‚ÄîSaid of slaves. Appropriate to the spiritual harlot, apostate Christendom, especially Rome, which has so often enslaved both bodies and souls of men."
3. "Popery has derived its greatest gains from the sale of masses for the souls of men after death, and of indulgences purchased from the Papal chancery by rich merchants in various countries, to be retailed at a profit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Cinnamon is the aromatic bark of the Laurus Cinnamomam, which grows in Arabia, India, and especially in the island of Ceylon. It was formerly, as it is now, a valuable article in the Oriental trade."
2. "And slaves - The Greek here is œÉœâŒºŒ±ÃÅœÑœâŒΩ soÃÑmatoÃÑn - 'of bodies.' Prof. Stuart renders it 'grooms,' and supposes that it refers to a particular kind of slaves who were employed in taking care of horses and carriages."
3. "The use of the two words would include all that is implied in the traffic, for, in most important senses, it extends to the body and the soul. In slavery both are purchased; both are supposed, so far as he can avail himself of them, to become the property of the master."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cinnamon...mentioned as one of the ingredients of the holy oil for anointing..."
2. "A fragrant Indian plant, with seed in grape-like clusters, from which ointment was made."
3. "Chariots...a Latin word though of Gallic origin, rheda. It had four wheels."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of bodies," treated as animals or implements, like the horses and the chariots (cf. rickshaw men in China).
2. This use of œÉœâŒºŒ± for slave occurs in Genesis 34:29; Tob 10:11 (œÉœâŒºŒ±œÑŒ± Œ∫Œ± Œ∫œÑŒ∑ŒΩŒ∑, slaves and cattle); II Macc. 8:11.
3. The slave merchant was called œÉœâŒºŒ±œÑŒµŒºœÄŒøœÅŒøœÇ (body merchant).

### John Gill:
1. "Cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense...things for delight and pleasure, for the gratifying of the senses." 
2. "Tyre had its merchants for these things...it may be these rather respect the ecclesiastical use of them." 
3. "And souls of men...the pope[s] have...been the means of destroying of thousands of others; they assume a power over the souls of men, of binding and loosing the consciences of men, imposing new laws upon them, and freeing them from obligation to the laws of God and men, to the ruin of their souls."

### John Wesley:
1. "And beasts ‚Äî Cows and oxen."
2. "And of chariots ‚Äî a purely Latin word is here inserted in the Greek. This St. John undoubtedly used on purpose, in describing the luxury of Rome."
3. "And souls of men ‚Äî For these also are continually bought and sold at Rome. And this of all others is the most gainful merchandise to the Roman traffickers."
