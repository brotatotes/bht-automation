# Revelation 18:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All the desire of thy soul, the riches and splendid things that thou cherished, are gone forever. The merchants who profited from thee shall stand afar off, full of fear of thy torment, weeping and mourning, exclaiming, Woe, woe, the great city! In just one hour, all thy wealth has been completely destroyed. The fruits that thy soul longed for, the sumptuous and dainty things, have perished and will never be found again.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fruits. Originally, the late summer or early autumn; then, generally, used of the ripe fruits of trees."
