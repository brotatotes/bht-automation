2. "All the accumulated wealth of so great and rich a city."
3. "Those less venturesome, or experienced, or bold than others... this class of seamen here referred to is 'coasters'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shipmaster [κυβερνητης] . From kubernaw to govern. Strictly, steersman. Only here and Acts 27:11."
2. "All the company in ships [πας επι των πλοιων ο ομιλος] . The best texts substitute oJ ejpi topon plewn, that saileth anywhere, lit., saileth to a place. So Rev."

1. "Shipmaster (κυβερνητης). Old word (from κυβερναω, to steer), helmsman, sailing-master, in N.T. only here and Acts 27:11. Subordinate to the ναυκληρος (supreme commander)."
2. "That saileth any whither (ο επ τοπον πλεων). 'The one sailing to a place.' See Acts 27:2, τους κατα την Ασιαν πλεοντας (those sailing down along Asia). Nestle suggests ποντον (sea) here for τοπον (place), but it makes sense as it is."
3. "Mariners (ναυτα). Old word (from ναυς, ship), in N.T. only here and Acts 27:27; Acts 27:30.
Gain their living by the sea (την θαλασσαν εργαζοντα). 'Work the sea.' This idiom is as old as Hesiod for sailors, fishermen, etc. See verses Revelation 18:10; Revelation 18:15."

### John Gill:
1. "For in one hour so great riches is come to nought... expressing the suddenness and speediness of Rome's destruction..."
