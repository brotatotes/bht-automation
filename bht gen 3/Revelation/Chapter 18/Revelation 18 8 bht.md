# Revelation 18:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For this cause in one day shall come her plagues, death and mourning and famine...and with fire shall she be burnt...because strong is the Lord God who hath judged her. The judgments here are more fearful: death, for her scorn of the prospect of widowhood; mourning, for her inordinate revelling; famine, for her abundance. Whether this is to be understood of the literal destruction of the city of Rome by fire, surely doubtful, considering the mystical character of the whole prophecy.
