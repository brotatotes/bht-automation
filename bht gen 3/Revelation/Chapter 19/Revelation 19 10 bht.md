## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason en by DÃ¼sterdieck, that in both cases John imagined the Lord Himself to be speaking to him, is sufficiently contradicted by the plain assertion, here in ch. xvii. 1, and there in ch. xxii. 8 itself, that was not a divine Person, but simply an angel."
2. "The stress is on both words: let worship be reserved for Him."
3. "Thou and I and our brethren are all 'those who have the testimony of Jesus,' i.e. are witnesses to Jesus; and the way in which we bear this witness, the substance and essence of this testimony, is the spirit of prophecy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It forms a marked contrast to the sorrowful wonder with which he had looked on the Church in her apostasy as the harlot. It exemplifies the corrupt tendencies of our fallen nature that even John, an apostle, should have all but fallen into 'voluntary humility and worshipping of angels,' which Paul warns us against."
2. "We angels, and you apostles, all alike have the testimony of (bear testimony concerning) Jesus by the operation of one and the same Spirit, who enables me to show you these revelations and enables you to record them: wherefore we are fellow servants, not I your lord to be worshipped by you."
3. "A clear condemnation of Romish invocation of saints as if they were our superiors to be adored."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "...] it may be that he mistook the rank of him who addressed him, and supposed that he was the Messiah whom he had been accustomed to worship, and who had first appeared to him. If so, his error was soon corrected. He was told by the angel himself who made these communications that he had no claims to such homage, and that the praise which he offered him should be rendered to God alone."
2. "It should be observed that there is not the slightest intimation that this was the Messiah himself, and consequently this does not contain any evidence that it would be improper to worship him. The only fair conclusion from the passage is, that it is wrong to offer religious homage to an angel."
3. "The sentiment is, that in promoting religion in the world, we are associated with angels. It is no condescension in them to be engaged in the service of the Redeemer, though it seems to be condescension for them to be associated with us in anything; it constitutes no ground of merit in us to be engaged in the service of the Redeemer, though we may regard it as an honor to be associated with the angels, and it may raise us in conscious dignity to feel that we are united with them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "See not (to do it). The testimony of Jesus."
2. "Jesus, by imparting this testimony to believers imparts to them the spirit of prophecy."
3. "The way of bearing this witness, the substance and essence of this testimony is the Spirit of prophecy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant and the fellow-servant of thy brethren that have the witness of Jesus: worship God." 
2. "The angel reminds the Apostle that worship is due to God alone; that he himself is only his fellow-servant and the fellow-servant of all who have the witness of Jesus."
3. "For the witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was tempted to worship an angel."
2. "The angel refuses worship from John on this ground."
3. "The possession of the prophetic spirit shows itself in witness to Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Being transported with the news he brought him of the marriage, or conversion of his countrymen the Jews, and struck with reverence and awe of the glory and majesty in which the angel appeared to him; and forgetting himself, that worship was only due to God, he behaved in this manner."
2. "the words are in the original very short and concise, and are spoken in an abrupt manner, and in great haste; as fearing he would be guilty of idolatry, before he could speak all his mind, and use the arguments that were necessary to dissuade from it."
3. "the testimony of Jesus, or the Gospel which John and his brethren had, is the very spirit, life, and soul of the prophecy of this book; for as all the prophets bore witness to Christ, so does the Spirit of God in this; or the testimony which they had, and bore to Christ, was equal to the spirit of prophecy with which this angel was endowed."

### John Wesley:
1. "To pray to or worship the highest creature is flat idolatry."
2. "I am now employed as your fellowservant, to testify of the Lord Jesus, by the same Spirit which inspired the prophets of old."
