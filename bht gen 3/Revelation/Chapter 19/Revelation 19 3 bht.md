# Revelation 19:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And a second time they said Hallelujah, a heavenly encore, as her smoke goes up to the ages of the ages. The image comes from the description of the smoke that ascended from the cities of the plain. The fate of the first city out of which God's people were called turns out to have been a prophecy of the fate of the last, where her smoke rose up for ever and ever. (44 words)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A second time (Œ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ). Adverbial accusative, a heavenly encore."
2. "They say (ŒµŒπœÅŒ∑Œ∫Œ±ŒΩ). Perfect active indicative of ŒµŒπœÄŒøŒΩ. 'They have said,' not an 'aoristic' perfect for 'they say,' but vivid dramatic perfect as in Revelation 5:7 and the form in -Œ±ŒΩ instead of -Œ±œÉŒπŒΩ as in Revelation 18:3; Revelation 21:6."
3. "Goeth up (Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≤Œ±ŒπŒΩŒµ). Linear present active indicative of Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≤Œ±ŒπŒΩœâ, 'keeps on going up,' 'a last touch to the description already given (Revelation 18:21) of Babylon's utter collapse' (Swete). The smoke of the city's ruin (Revelation 14:11; Revelation 18:8; Revelation 18:18) instead of incense (Revelation 8:4). Cf. Isaiah 34:9."

### John Gill:
1. "And again they said, Alleluia.... So some psalms begin and end with this word, translated in the Old Testament by the words 'Praise ye the LORD', as in Psalms 106:1 c."
2. "Or the words may be rendered, 'for her smoke rose', and so are a reason for the second 'hallelujah': it looks as if Rome, like another Sodom and Gomorrah, would sink into a sulphurous burning lake, and continue so."
3. "Respect is had to the everlasting punishment of antichrist and his followers in hell, and to the everlasting burnings that will follow Rome's temporal destruction, which was an example and symbol of the vengeance of eternal fire."
