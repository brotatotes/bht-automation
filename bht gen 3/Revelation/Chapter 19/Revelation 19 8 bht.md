## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It seems to me that the latter alternative is rendered necessary by the fact of the explanation, ‚Äúfor the fine linen,‚Äù&c., being subjoined."
2. "The fine linen garment is the righteousness of the saints, i.e. their pure and holy state, attained by their having washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
3. "The white robe is not Christ's righteousness imputed or put on, but the saints' righteousness, by virtue of being washed in His blood. It is their own; inherent, not imputed; but their own by their part in and union to Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is He who, by giving Himself for her, presents her to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, but holy and without blemish."
2. "Translate, 'bright and pure'; at once brilliantly splendid and spotless as in the bride herself."
3. "The righteousness of the saint is not, as ALFORD erroneously states, inherent, but is imputed: if it were otherwise, Christ would be merely enabling the sinner to justify himself."

### John Gill:

2. "Christ's righteousness may be compared to fine linen, clean and white, because of its spotless purity... their being arrayed with it will be owing to the grace of Christ, who grants it"
3. "Not only the garment is a gift of grace, but the putting of it on is a grant from Christ, and what he himself does"
