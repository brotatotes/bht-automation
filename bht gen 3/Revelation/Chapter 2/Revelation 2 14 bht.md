## BHT:
The temptation to eat idol-meats was a peculiarly strong one for Gentile converts. For not to do so involved almost a withdrawal from partaking of any social meal with the heathen around. Fornication often connected with idolatry. Thus, refusal to partake of the idol-meats involved absence from public and private festivity, a withdrawal from the social life of his time. A party in the church resisted emperor-worship, yet were caught in the insidious wiles of the Nicolaitans.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The temptation to eat idol-meats was a peculiarly strong one to the Gentile converts. For not to do so involved almost a withdrawal from partaking of any social meal with the heathen around." 
2. "For idol-meats, after a part had been offered in sacrifice, were nearly sure to be on the heathen entertainer's table; so much so, that the Greek 'to kill' (thuein) meant originally 'to sacrifice.'"
3. "Fornication often connected with idolatry."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their general course had been such that the Saviour could approve it; he did not approve, however, of their tolerating those who held to pernicious practical error - error that tended to sap the very foundation of morals."
2. "The meaning is, that they taught substantially the same doctrine which Balaam did, and deserved to be classed with him."
3. "So accustomed had the pagan world been to this vice, that many who had been converted from idolatry might be disposed to look on it with less severity than we do now, and there was a necessity of incessant watchfulness lest the members of the church should fall into it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The eating of idol meats, which was no temptation to the Jewish Christian, was quite otherwise to the Gentile. The act of sacrifice, among all ancient nations, was a social no less than a religious act. Commonly only a part of the victim was consumed as an offering, and the rest became the portion of the priests, was given to the poor, or was sold again in the markets."
2. "Thus, for the Gentile, refusal to partake of the idol - meats involved absence from public and private festivity, a withdrawal, in great part, from the social life of his time."
3. "In times of persecution, tasting the wine of the libations or eating meat offered to idols, was understood to signify recantation of Christianity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There were in Pergamos some that held fast the teaching of Balaam."
2. "The sins next mentioned are in all probability to be literally understood."
3. "These teachers of erroneous doctrine, these seducers to grievous sin, were not merely inhabitants of the city; they were members of the church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A party in the church that resisted emperor-worship, to the death in the case of Antipas, yet were caught in the insidious wiles of the Nicolaitans which the church in Ephesus withstood."
2. "These early Gnostics practised licentiousness as a principle since they were not under law, but under grace."
3. "Balaam, as Josephus and Philo also say, showed Balak how to set a trap for the Israelites by beguiling them into the double sin of idolatry and fornication, which often went together (and do so still)."

### John Gill:
1. "The members of this church before their open separation from the apostasy; who still continued in the communion of the corrupt church of Rome, though they remonstrated against the errors and evil practices that crept in; and so were a stumbling block, and a snare to others to join in their idolatry and superstition."
2. "By Balaam may be meant the pope of Rome, for that name signifies, 'the lord of the people'; and is very appropriate to him, who in this interval took upon him to be universal bishop, and lorded it over both church and state, in a most haughty and tyrannical manner."
3. "The Balaamites were those who submitted to his power and authority, and received his doctrines; and by Balak, king of Moab, may be intended the secular powers, the emperors, kings, and princes of the earth, who were instructed by the popes of Rome, to draw their subjects into idolatry, which is spiritual fornication, to eat the breaden God, to worship the host, images, and saints departed; and which proved a snare, and a stumbling to some of this church, as to the Israelites of old, to do the same things."

### John Wesley:
1. "But thou hast there â€” Whom thou oughtest to have immediately cast out from the flock."
2. "Who taught Balak â€” And the rest of the Moabites."
3. "To eat things sacrificed to idols â€” Which, in so idolatrous a city as Pergamos, was in the highest degree hurtful to Christianity."
