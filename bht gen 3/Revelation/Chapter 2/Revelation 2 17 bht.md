## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christâ€™s gifts may all be summed up in the gift of Himself: on the other hand, He may describe any of the manifold proprieties of his own Person and office as His gift."
2. "The most probable view is that which Bengel gives a hint of, and which Hengstenberg and DÃ¼sterdieck hold, that the figure is derived from the practice of using small stones, inscribed with writing, for various purposes, and that, further than this, the imagery belongs to the occasion itself only."
3. "But what name is this? not what name in each case, for an answer to this question is precluded by the very terms, 'which none,&c.: but of what kind? Is it the name of Christ Himself, or of God in Christ? This supposition is precluded also by the same terms: for any mysterious name of God or of Christ would either be hidden from all [so ch. xix. 12], or known to all who were similarly victorious through grace."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ Himself is the manna 'hidden' from the world, but revealed to the believer, so that he has already a foretaste of His preciousness."
2. "The white stone is a glistening diamond, the Urim borne by the high priest within the choschen or breastplate of judgment, with the twelve tribes' names on the twelve precious stones, next the heart."
3. "The 'new name' is Christ's: some new revelation of Himself which shall hereafter be imparted to His people, and which they alone are capable of receiving."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His eyes are like a flame of fire - as if they would pierce and penetrate to the recesses of the heart." 
2. "They would have power over the nations; they would be associated with the Redeemer in ruling them; they would have the morning star."
3. "Christianity exists there in name, but it is the bare name. Its spirit has long since fled."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ as the bread from heaven, the nourishment of the life of believers, the true manna, of which those who eat shall never die...hidden, in that He is withdrawn from sight, and the Christian's life is hid with Him in God." 
2. "The satisfaction of the believer's desire when Christ shall be revealed...the hidden manna shall not remain forever hidden. We shall see Christ as He is, and be like Him."
3. "The seeing of Christ as He is, and, through this beatific vision, being made like to Him, is identical with the eating of the hidden manna, which shall, as it were, be then brought forth from the sanctuary, the holy of holies of God's immediate presence where it was withdrawn from sight so long, that all may partake of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This â€˜living breadâ€™ is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, who is now â€˜hidden,â€™ but will at length be revealed to the perfect satisfaction and joy of them that wait for Him."
2. "Those referred to receive a stone, an ordinary stone of acquittal, but glistering with heavenly brightness, and bearing upon it the motto or legend spoken of in the next clause."
3. "It is a name which speaks of the believerâ€™s glorious condition when he is united to the Son and, in Him, to the Father."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The white stone with one's name on it was used to admit one to entertainments and also as an amulet or charm."
3. "The true Christian has a charmed life."

### John Gill:
1. "Will I give to eat of the hidden manna; in opposition to eating things sacrificed to idols, refused by him...the Gospel, which is soul quickening, comforting, strengthening, and satisfying food, by which the saints are nourished up unto everlasting life, and which is hid to the world, which the men of it know nothing of; and especially Jesus Christ, the sum and substance of it, may be meant, and that secret spiritual consolation enjoyed in communion with him." 
2. "Christ promises, to his people that overcome, happy days, after the times of Popish darkness and persecution were over: white stones were also given to the conquerors in the Olympic games, with their names upon them, and the value of the prize they won; and, here applied, may respect the crown of life and glory given to them who are more than conquerors through Christ, with their right and title to it, and the excellency of it." 
3. "The church, though in the wilderness, is regarded by Christ, is bore upon his heart and cared for by him; and also its spotless purity in him, and justification by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "It seems properly to mean, the full, glorious, everlasting fruition of God."
2. "Here may be an allusion to both."
3. "Thou wilt then read it on the white stone."
