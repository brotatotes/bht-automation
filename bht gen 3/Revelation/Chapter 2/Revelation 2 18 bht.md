## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thyatira—in Lydia, south of Pergamos... probably the instrument of first carrying the Gospel to her native town." 
2. "The title 'Son of God,' is from Psalms 2:7; Psalms 2:9, which is referred to in Revelation 2:27." 
3. "The attribute, 'feet like . . . brass,' answers to Revelation 2:27- :, 'as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers,' He treading them to pieces with His strong feet."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Perhaps the severity of the rebuke contemplated here made it proper that there should be a more impressive reference to the authority of the speaker; and hence he is introduced as the 'Son of God.'" (Commentary)
2. "Before the glance of his eye all is light, and nothing can be concealed from his view. Nothing would be better suited to inspire awe then, as nothing should be now, than such a reference to the Son of God as being able to penetrate the secret recesses of the heart." (Commentary)
3. "Perhaps indicative of majesty and glory as he walked in the midst of the churches." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is interesting to notice in connection with Acts 16:14, though it does not concern us at present, that Thyatira was famous for its purple or scarlet dyes."
2. "The most remarkable part of it is that in which He designates Himself the Son of God. It was as One ‘like unto a Son of man’ that He had been beheld by the Seer in chap. Revelation 1:13, although that description was in no degree intended to exclude the thought of His essential Divinity."
3. "She has been hitherto regarded in what she is. She is now to be looked at in her struggle with the world (see remarks at close of the seven Epistles); let her learn that ‘God is on her side.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "His eyes like a flame of fire (τους οφθαλμους αυτου ως φλογα πυρος). As in Revelation 1:14."
3. "His feet like burnished brass (ο ποδες αυτου ομοιο χαλκολιβανω). As in Revelation 1:15."

### John Gill:
1. "when there were such swarms of monks and friars, and religious orders of several sorts, as Franciscans and Dominicans, who claimed her as their patroness; when such numbers of them clad themselves in cowls and long garments, that they looked more like women in hoods and petticoats, than really men"
2. "he who is truly, properly, naturally, and essentially the Son of God"
3. "expressing fury, wrath, and vengeance against the Romish antichrist and his followers"

### John Wesley:
1. "And to the angel of the church at Thyatira — Where the faithful were but a little flock."
2. "These things saith the Son of God — See how great he is, who appeared 'like a son of man!'"
3. "Who hath eyes as a flame of fire — 'Searching the reins and the heart,' [...] And feet like fine brass - Denoting his immense strength."
