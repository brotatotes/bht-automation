## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thy labourâ€”Two oldest manuscripts omit 'thy'; one supports it. The Greek means 'labor unto weariness.'" 
2. "Bearâ€”evil men are a burden which the Ephesian Church regarded as intolerable. We are to 'bear (the same Greek) one another's burdens' in the case of weak brethren; but not to bear false brethren." 
3. "Say they are apostlesâ€”probably Judaizers. IGNATIUS [Epistle to the Ephesians, 6], says subsequently, 'Onesimus praises exceedingly your good discipline that no heresy dwells among you'; and [Epistle to the Ephesians, 9], 'Ye did not permit those having evil doctrine to sow their seed among you, but closed your ears.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is designed to impress upon them deeply the conviction that he was intimately acquainted with all that they did, good and bad, and that therefore he was abundantly qualified to dispense rewards or administer punishments according to truth and justice."
2. "They had patiently borne the opposition made to the truth, they had manifested a spirit of firm endurance amidst many arts of those opposed to them to draw them off from simple faith in Christ."
3. "The point here commended in the Ephesian church is, that they had sought to have a 'pure ministry,' a ministry whose claims were well founded. They had felt the importance of this, had carefully examined the claims of pretenders, and had refused to recognize those who could not show, in a proper manner, that they had been designated to their work by the Lord Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The kindred verb kopiaw is often used of apostolic and ministerial labor."
2. "Compare Paul's exhortation to Timothy in Ephesus, 2 Timothy 2:25, 2 Timothy 2:26."
3. "It is the stranger, as this hatred of evil, purely as evil, however little thought of or admired now, is eminently a Christian grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I know thy works, and thy toil and patience...These works are then resolved into two parts; â€˜toil,â€™ which is more than labour in the service of the Lord; and â€˜patience,â€™ which is more than the passive virtue commonly represented by that word." 
2. "The Ephesian church had a holy impatience of those who, by their evil deeds, brought disgrace upon the Christian name, and she is commended for it."
3. "The Ephesian church knew what these deceivers would show themselves to be, and turned from them with the instinct of the Christian heart before it put them to a formal proof."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I know...emphasizes better the absolute clearness of mental vision which photographs all the facts of life as they pass."
2. "Both thy toil and patience...endurance in hard toil."
3. "These evil men were indeed a heavy burden...a recent crisis when these Nicolaitans were condemned."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, as the omniscient God, knows all the works of his people, and the springs, and principles, and ends, and views of them."
2. "And though they may not have it from men, yet Christ takes notice of them and their labours, and commends them for them, and will reward them."
3. "The apostles, ministers, and churches of those times, tried their pretensions and doctrines by the word of God, and by the fruits which they produced in themselves and others; and through that discerning of spirits which they had, they found them to be liars."

### John Wesley:
1. "Weighty word, 'I know,' how dreadful will it one day sound to the wicked, how sweet to the righteous!"
2. "Happy is he that conceives less good of himself, than Christ knows concerning him."
3. "Notwithstanding which thou canst not bear that incorrigibly wicked men should remain in the flock of Christ."
