# Revelation 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To the faithful in Thyatira who have not embraced the false teaching, I say, you are free from any contact with it. No other burden is laid upon you, for your main duty is to hold fast to the complete Christian doctrine and hope that was once delivered to the saints. Beware of those who claim to know the depths of Satan; such knowledge is reserved for God alone. There are no deeper truths beyond your reach, only the old faith and rule of practice you must cling to.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (contrast to those addressed before) to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not (not only do not hold, but are free from any contact with) this teaching..."
2. "I cast not upon you any other burden... This burden resolved itself into keeping the faith once delivered to the saints, as enjoined in the next sentence."
3. "that which ye have (see ch. iii. 11: not to be restricted in its sense to their stedfastness in resisting Jezebel and hers, but representing the sum total of Christian doctrine and hope and privilege; the 'faith once for all delivered to the saints' of Jude 3), hold fast..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Spirit here declares their so-called 'depths,' (namely, of knowledge of divine things) to be really 'depths of Satan'; just as in Revelation 2:9, He says, instead of 'the synagogue of God,' 'the synagogue of Satan.'" 
2. "The original sin of Adam was a desire to know EVIL as well as good, so...those who professed to know 'the depths of Satan.' It is the prerogative of God alone to know evil fully, without being hurt or defiled by it." 
3. "No 'depths' beyond your reach, such as they teach, no new doctrine, but the old faith and rule of practice once for all delivered to the saints."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But I say unto you, the remainder in Thyatira, so many as hold not this doctrine, etc. That is, he addresses now all the members of the church who were not involved in the charges already made."  
2. "There are doctrines of error, and arguments for sin, to originate which seems to lie beyond the power of people, and which would appear almost to have exhausted the talent of Satan himself." 
3. "Often the most severe punishment that God can bring upon people is to 'lay upon them no other burden' than to leave them to the inevitable consequences of their own folly, or to the trouble and vexation incident to the effort to free themselves from what they had for a long time tolerated or practiced."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They have not this teaching; that is, they have it not as their possession, they do not make it their own."
2. "The prevalent idea is, that these persons spoke only of â€˜the depthsâ€™ or of â€˜the depths of God,â€™ and that in bitter irony the Lord of the Church either adds here the words â€˜of Satan,â€™ or substitutes the name of Satan for the name of God."
3. "The church at Thyatira â€˜sufferedâ€™ Jezebel. The â€˜burdenâ€™ of that part of it which remained true to its Lord was that this was done. Jezebel ought to have been put away: the alliance with the world ought to have been broken."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Know not the deep things of Satan."
2. "Perhaps both ideas are involved."
3. "None other burden."

### John Gill:
1. "The persons spoken to are the same, the pastor of this church, with his colleagues, and all the rest of the faithful in it; which shows that this epistle, and so the rest, were not written to the pastors only, but to the churches."
2. "God does, and will reserve a people for himself."
3. "The depths of Satan, or doctrines of devils."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who have not known the depths of Satan â€” O happy ignorance!" 
2. "Our Lord owns they were deep, even deep as hell: for they were the very depths of Satan."
3. "I will lay upon you no other burden - Than that you have already suffered from Jezebel and her adherents."

- Attempt 1 BHT: But to those of you in Thyatira who have not embraced this false teaching, I say, you have not only resisted but have been kept entirely separate from these deceitful doctrines. I do not lay upon you any additional burdens, for the main burden for you is to hold fast to the true faith, the complete body of Christian doctrine and hope and privilege once delivered to the saints. Be cautious, for the so-called depths of knowledge they claim to possess are not depths of God, but truly depths of Satan. Only God possesses the knowledge of evil without being harmed by it, and it is not for human beings to seek after this knowledge. Rest assured that there are no deeper truths beyond your reach; all you need to hold onto is the old faith and rule of practice that will sustain you.
