# Revelation 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The threat in question is not the extinguishing of the flame, but rather the removal of the lampstand, highlighting the possibility of both judgment and mercy. Ephesus, formerly a vibrant Christian community, now scarcely has any believers. The Nicolaitans embraced indulgence in sensual desires to overcome or destroy God's people. Urgency lies in the appeal for an immediate change of demeanor before it's too late, including a return to the fervent love that may have diminished. Reflecting on the past ardor contrasting with the present situation could facilitate this transformation in behavior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not merely 'feel thy first feelings,' but do works flowing from the same principle as formerly, 'faith which worketh by love.'" 
2. "It is removal of the candlestick, not extinction of the candle, which is threatened here; judgment for some, but that very judgment the occasion of mercy for others."
3. "One who lately visited Ephesus found only three Christians there, and these so ignorant as scarcely to have heard the names of St. Paul or St. John."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Call to distinct recollection the former state - the ardor, the zeal, the warmth of love which once characterized us."
2. "There is nothing better adapted to do this than a just view of what we might have been, as compared with what we now are."
3. "The counsel of the Saviour to all such, however, is to do their first works."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Its candlestick has been for centuries removed out of his place; the squalid Mohammedan village which is nearest to its site does not count one Christian in its insignificant population; its temple is a mass of shapeless ruins; its harbor is a reedy pool; the bittern booms amid its pestilent and stagnant marshes; and malaria and oblivion reign supreme over the place where the wealth of ancient civilization gathered around the scenes of its grossest superstitions and its most degraded sins."
2. "The Nicolaitans taught that, in order to master sensuality, one must know the whole range of it by experience; and that he should therefore abandon himself without reserve to the lusts of the body, since they concerned only the body and did not touch the spirit."
3. "The Nicolaitans are the Balaamites; no sect bearing the one name or the other; but those who, in the new dispensation, repeated the sin of Balaam in the old, and sought to overcome or destroy the people of God by the same temptations whereby Balaam had sought to overcome them before."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Remember therefore from whence thou hast fallen; her first condition being regarded as a height."
2. "The Lord does not bid His Church act as if acting were everything and feeling nothing. Feeling is rather the thing mainly thought of."
3. "Surely also, it may be remarked in passing, the warning distinctly shows us that the 'angel' of the church cannot possibly be its bishop."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
- "Down in the valley, look up to the cliff where pure love is and whence thou hast fallen down."
- "Urgent appeal for instant change of attitude and conduct before it is too late."
- "Including the first love which has now grown cold."

### John Gill:
1. "Believers cannot totally and finally fall away from the grace which they have received; but they may fall into sin, and from a degree of grace, and the exercise of it."
2. "Former good works are to be remembered and done, to show the truth of repentance for evil ones."
3. "This was not a commination or threatening of divine vengeance to that church literally, but to the state of the church, which that represented."

### John Wesley:
1. "Do the first works â€” Outwardly and inwardly, or thou canst never regain the first love."
2. "But even in the threatening the promise is implied, in case of true repentance."
3. "I will remove, unless thou repent, the flock now under thy care to another place, where they shall be better taken care of."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse emphasizes the importance of not just feeling the same love as before, but also manifesting it through works. Judgment is not simply the extinguishing of the candle, but the removal of the candlestick, which presents an opportunity for mercy. Ephesus, once a thriving center of Christianity, now stands devoid of Christians, its temple in ruins and its harbor a stagnant swamp. The Nicolaitans, similar to the Balaamites, advocated indulging in bodily lusts to overcome or destroy the people of God. The urgent appeal calls for an immediate change of attitude before it's too late, including a return to the first love which may have grown cold. Reflecting on the former ardor and zeal, and realizing the contrast between what could have been and what currently is, can help foster this change in conduct.
