## BHT:
There is one thing that the church in Pergamum is commended for, and that is their hatred towards the teachings and deeds of the Nicolaitans, which Christ himself also hates. These Nicolaitans were not only a sect, but professing Christians who sought to introduce false freedom and licentiousness into the Church. Despite the church in Pergamum tolerating them, they still held firm to their hatred for such wickedness. Even though they had departed from their first love, their shared abhorrence for sinful practices was recognized by Christ and commended.
