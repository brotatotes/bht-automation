## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There are both poor rich-men, and rich poor-men in God's sight."
2. "Jews by national descent, but not spiritually of 'the true circumcision.'"
3. "The Jews, who might have been 'the Church of God,' had now, by their opposition and unbelief, become the synagogue of Satan."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Poverty is no hindrance to the favor of God, and there are some things in it which are favorable to the promotion of a right spirit toward God which are not found where there is abundant wealth."
2. "However keen the feeling arising from the reflection 'I am a poor man,' the edge of the sorrow is taken off if the mind can be turned to a brighter image - 'but thou art rich.'"
3. "That spirit of bitter opposition was indeed often manifested in their treatment of Christians, as it had been of the Saviour, but still it was foreign to the true nature of their religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Because, like all the other early Christian churches, the majority of its members were of the poorer classes, and also, perhaps, with reference to their robbery by persecutors."
2. "Not primarily direct blasphemy against God, but reviling at believers."
3. "The title is not given them by the Spirit, nor by the seer, but by themselves; and none would use that title except such as were Jews by birth and by religion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Like all the churches of that early time, the church at Smyrna was composed of members for the most part poor... But in the possession of a better inheritance it was 'rich,' 'rich in faith, and an heir of the kingdom which the Lord promised to them that love Him.'"
2. "The Jews at least worshipped God, and assembled in His synagogue to study the Law and the Prophets; of these blasphemers it could only be said that they were a synagogue of Satan."
3. "That mixing of Jews and Christians in the same congregation, which had marked the dawn of the Churchâ€™s history, had come to an end. A complete separation had taken place between the adherents of the old and the new faith. Christians were a 'church,' the Jews alone met in 'synagogue.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "thy tribulation and thy poverty...the tribulation was probably persecution, which helped to intensify the poverty of the Christians...in contrast with the wealthy church in Laodicea."
2. "But thou art rich...rich in grace toward God and in good deeds...rich in contrast with the spiritual poverty in Laodicea."
3. "a synagogue of Satan...serving the devil instead of the Lord."

### John Gill:
1. "But thou art rich; they were rich, in faith, and heirs of a kingdom, though poor in this world."
2. "They were rich with the riches of Christ, with the blessings of the covenant, with the graces of the Spirit, and in good works."
3. "And [I know] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not; who asserted themselves to be the true Israel of God, Jews that were so inwardly, regenerate persons, or truly Christians."

### John Wesley:
1. "A poor prerogative in the eyes of the world!"
2. "In faith and love, of more value than all the kingdoms of the earth."
3. "A synagogue of Satan - who, like them, was a liar and a murderer from the beginning."
