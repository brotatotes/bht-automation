- Attempt 1 BHT: An angel descended from heaven, holding the key of the abyss. This key had formerly been in Satan's possession, allowing him to bring forth plagues upon the earth, but now it is entrusted to different hands for a new purpose. With the destruction of the beast and the false prophet, Satan's representatives, he himself is bound for a thousand years.

The angel's descent from heaven represents the second coming of Christ, not His incarnation, and signifies that this event will be physical and visible. The key of the bottomless pit perfectly belongs in the hand of the One who has the keys of hell and death and holds all power in heaven and earth.
