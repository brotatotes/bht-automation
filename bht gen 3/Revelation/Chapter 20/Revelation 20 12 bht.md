# Revelation 20:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The dead, both great and small, will stand before the throne. The saints, having been declared just by Christ from the book of life, will join as assessors. Books will be opened, including the book of life, serving as evidence. Judgment will then be based on the contents of the books, specifically the works of the individuals. It becomes clear that the books, distinct from the book of life, contain the record of the names and deeds of the wicked.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne..." 
2. "Books were opened, and another book was opened which is the book of life..." 
3. "The dead were judged out of the things written in the books according to their works."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wicked who had died from the time of Adam to Christ's second advent, and all the righteous and wicked who had died during and after the millennium, shall then have their eternal portion assigned to them."
2. "The saints having been first pronounced just themselves by Christ out of 'the book of life,' shall sit as assessors of the Judge."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair meaning in this place therefore is, that all the dead would be there, and of course this would preclude the idea of a 'previous' resurrection of any part of the dead, as of the saints, at the beginning of the millennium."
2. "None can judge the secrets of the heart; none can pronounce on the moral character of all mankind, of all countries and ages, and determine their everlasting allotment, but he who is divine."
3. "The fact that the name of anyone was found in the book of life would seem, as above remarked, to determine the 'certainty' of salvation; but the amount of reward would be in proportion to the service rendered to the Redeemer, and the attainments made in piety."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "The natural conclusion from the words before us is that what are spoken of as the 'books,' in distinct contrast with 'the book of life,' contain nothing but the names of the wicked and their works."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The record of each human being has been kept in God's books."
2. "The books are 'the vouchers for the book of life'."

### John Wesley:

2. "O how many hidden things will then come to light; and how many will have quite another appearance than they had before in the sight of men!"
