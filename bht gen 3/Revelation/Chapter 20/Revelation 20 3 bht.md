## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "that he deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years shall be accomplished." 
3. "after that he must (according to the necessity of Godâ€™s purposes) be loosed for a little time."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
(1) "This will be subsequent to the downfall of the papacy and the termination of the Muhammedan power in the world."

(3) "It will be a time when the Hebrew people - the Jews - will be brought to the knowledge of the truth, and will embrace the Messiah whom their fathers crucified."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Sealed. See on John 3:33. 
Must [Î´ÎµÎ¹] . According to God 's purpose. See on Matthew 16:21; Luke 2:49; Luke 24:26.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "And sealed it over him, not only locking the door, but sealing it in order to make it doubly fast."
2. "The only admissible interpretation, therefore, of the phrase 'the nations' is that which understands by it the unchristian godless world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Already he has been cast out of Heaven, now he is cast out of the earth, and returns to his own place."

2. "The end of this apprehension, binding, imprisonment, and security of Satan is, that he should deceive the nations no more."
3. "Now he will be under such restraint, and in such close confinement, that he will not be able to move the wicked nations to anything of this kind, as he will when he is loosed at the end of the thousand years."

### John Wesley:
1. "But how many and great blessings are implied! For the grand enemy being removed, the kingdom of God holds on its uninterrupted course among the nations; and the great mystery of God, so long foretold, is at length fulfilled." 
2. "Quickly he will be bound: when he is loosed again, the martyrs will live and reign with Christ. Then follow his coming in glory, the new heaven, new earth, and new Jerusalem."
3. "It is no time to settle upon our lees. This is not, if it be rightly understood, an acceptable message to the wise, the mighty, the honourable, of this world. Yet that which is to be done, shall be done: there is no counsel against the Lord."
