# Revelation 20:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The souls of the martyrs, who were beheaded for their testimony of Jesus and devotion to the Word of God, are seen in a disembodied state. They will come to life again, in the body, to be visible. They are mentioned first because they are most like Jesus in their sufferings and death, therefore nearest Him in their life and reign. They are constituted judges, having the authority to reign and participate in the judgment of the wicked.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is nothing to hinder this in the souls of the saints not being seen till the next clause: for there is no mark of temporal sequence connecting the two verses."
2. "They were constituted judges."
3. "It would certainly appear that this reigning includes the office of judgment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though in one sense having to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, yet in another sense they 'do not come into judgment (Greek), but have already passed from death unto life.'" 
2. "'Souls' expresses their disembodied state as John saw them at first; 'and they lived' implies their coming to life in the body again, so as to be visible, as the phrase, Revelation 20:5, 'this is the first resurrection,' proves."
3. "The martyrs are put first, because most like Jesus in their sufferings and death, therefore nearest Him in their life and reign; for Christ indirectly affirms there are relative degrees and places of honor in His kingdom, the highest being for those who drink his cup of suffering."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'persons' on whom this judgment is to pass are specified, in the course of the verse, as those who were 'beheaded for the witness of Jesus, who had the Word of God, who had not worshipped the beast,' etc."
2. "John undoubtedly intends to describe some honor conferred on the 'spirits or souls' of the saints and martyrs during this long period, as if they were raised from the dead, or which might be represented by a resurrection from the dead."
3. "In this view of the meaning of this passage there is nothing that forbids us to suppose that the martyrs will be 'conscious' of the honor thus done to their names, their memory, and their principles on earth, or that this consciousness will increase their joy even in heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thrones. See on ch. Revelation 2:13." 
2. "They sat. All the faithful members of Christ's Church. Compare they reigned with Christ." 
3. "Beheaded [œÄŒµœÄŒµŒªŒµŒ∫ŒπœÉŒºŒµŒΩœâŒΩ]. From pelekuv an ax. Only here in the New Testament."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They can be no other than all the faithful members of Christ‚Äôs Church, or at least all of whom it is said in the last clause of the verse that they ‚Äòreigned‚Äô with Christ."
2. "As they had victory before they fought, so they were acquitted before they were tried."
3. "How often has there been more true martyrdom in bearing years of pining sickness or meeting wave after wave of sorrow than in encountering sword or axe or fire!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Judgment was given unto them (Œ∫œÅŒπŒºŒ± ŒµŒ¥ŒøŒ∏Œ∑ Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒπœÇ). Picture of the heavenly court of assizes."
2. "The souls (œÑŒ±œÇ œàœÖœáŒ±œÇ). Accusative after ŒµŒπŒ¥ŒøŒΩ at the beginning of the verse."
3. "And they lived (Œ∫Œ± ŒµŒ∂Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ). If the ingressive aorist, it means 'came to life' or 'lived again'... If it is the constative aorist here and in verse Revelation 20:5, then it could mean increased spiritual life."

### John Gill:
1. "There will be thrones set, or pitched, for all the saints, who will sit on them, in the character of kings, and as conquerors, and shall sit quiet, and undisturbed..."
2. "And so it may respect their being judged themselves, but not their judging of others, the wicked, which is the sole work of Christ..."
3. "The sense is, that they lived again... their bodies lived again, the soul being sometimes put for the body..."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I saw thrones...And they...sat upon them; and Judgment was given to them."
2. "And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded...For the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God."
3. "And those who had not worshipped the wild beast, nor his image... And they lived...And reigned with Christ."
