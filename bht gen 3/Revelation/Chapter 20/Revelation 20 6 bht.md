## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "They shall be priests of God and of Christ."
3. "They [shall] reign with Him a (or, the) thousand years."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Blessed‚Äî(Compare Revelation 14:13; Revelation 19:9). on such the second death hath no power‚Äîeven as it has none on Christ now that He is risen."
2. "A new time of revelation will begin by the outpouring of the fulness of the Spirit."
3. "The heavenly Church is elected not merely to salvation, but to rule in love, and minister blessings over the whole earth, as king-priests."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Blessed - That is, his condition is to be regarded as a happy or a favored one. This is designed apparently to support and encourage those who, in the time of John, suffered persecution, or who might suffer persecution afterward."
2. "The ‚Äúsecond death‚Äù is properly the death which the wicked will experience in the world of woe. See Revelation 20:14. The meaning here is, that all who are here referred to as having part in the first resurrection will be secure against that. It will be one of the blessed privileges of heaven that there will be absolute security against death in any and every form."
3. "What could better symbolize it - and we must remember that this is a symbol - than to say that at the commencement of this period there was, as it were, a solemn preparation for a judgment, and that the departed dead seemed to stand there, and that a sentence was pronounced in their favor, and that they became associated with the Son of God in the honors of his kingdom, and that their principles were now to reign and triumph in the earth?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Hath part [ŒµœáœâŒΩ ŒºŒµœÅŒøœÇ] . A phrase peculiar to John as referring to a person. Compare John 13:8. 
Second death. See on ch. Revelation 2:11.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection."
2. "Over these the second death hath no power."
3. "But they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The second death. The spiritual death of Revelation 2:11; Revelation 20:14; Revelation 21:8 in contrast to the first or physical death."
2. "This language raises a question about the interpretation of the first and the second resurrections, whether both are of the body or one of the spirit."
3. "The servants of God are to be priests with Christ and to reign with him."

### John Gill:
1. "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection... they shall be perfectly blessed in soul and body, and perfectly holy in both." 
2. "They shall escape everlasting burnings, the fire of hell... they shall be delivered from wrath to come."
3. "They will be wholly devoted to and employed in the service of God and of Christ... adoring the grace and goodness of God and Christ unto them."

### John Wesley:
1. They shall be priests of God and of Christ ‚Äî Therefore Christ is God.
And shall reign with him ‚Äî With Christ, a thousand years.
