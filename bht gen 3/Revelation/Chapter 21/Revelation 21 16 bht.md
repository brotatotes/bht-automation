# Revelation 21:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The New Jerusalem, portrayed as an immense city, captivates the imagination with its faultless symmetry and incredible dimensions. As a perfect cube, much like the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle, its equal length, breadth, and height emphasize its transcendent glory. The measurements of twelve thousand furlongs in each dimension serve as a symbolic representation of the vastness and capacity of heaven, accommodating the multitude of the redeemed. Rather than fixating on mathematical precision, the primary focus should be on the idea that heaven will be spacious enough to fulfill Jesus' promise of a place for all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And the city lieth foursquare... her length is as great as her breadth... the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."
2. "The supposition of many expositors... really does not appear to be necessarily included in these words."
3. "Some such idea seems also to be pointed out in the rabbinical books, which describe the future Jerusalem as twelve miles high."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The stupendous height, length, and breadth being exactly alike, imply its faultless symmetry, transcending in glory all our most glowing conceptions."
2. "one thousand furlongs being the space between the several twelve gates."
3. "The stupendous height, length, and breadth being exactly alike, imply its faultless symmetry, transcending in glory all our most glowing conceptions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The New Jerusalem, on the contrary, had been built according to a plan of the utmost regularity, which had not been modified by the circumstances, or varied as the city grew."
2. "Of course, this must preclude all idea of there being such a city literally in Palestine. This is clearly a figurative or symbolical representation; and the idea is, that the city was on the most magnificent scale, and with the largest proportions."
3. "The idea of vastness and of capacity is the main idea designed to be represented. The image before the mind is, that the numbers of the redeemed will be immense."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The description seems to be that of a vast cube, which may have been suggested by the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle, which was of that shape."
2. "These are enough to show how utterly futile are attempts to reduce these symbolic visions to mathematical statement."
3. "No reduction brings them within the bounds of verisimilitude; and no effort in that direction is required. The idea is alone to be thought of."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The city itself is first measured. It lieth four square ... the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. It was thus a perfect cube; and, remembering the general imagery of this book, there can be no doubt that the Seer has the Holy of Holies of the Tabernacle in his eye. That part of the Tabernacle was a cube."
2. "The symbolism which marks the general shape marks also the details, each dimension measuring 12,000 furlongs, 12 the number of the people of God multiplied by 1000 the heavenly number."
3. "No reduction brings them within the bounds of verisimilitude, and no effort in that direction is required. The idea is alone to be thought of."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a tetragon or quadrilateral quadrangle."
2. "It is rectangular, both walls and city within."
3. "Surely the meaning is that heaven will be large enough for all, as Jesus said without insisting on the materialistic measurement of a gorgeous apartment house full of inside rooms."

### John Gill:
1. "And the city lieth four square,.... To the four corners of the world, from whence its inhabitants come, and denotes the regularity, uniformity, perfection, and immovableness of it."
2. "And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs; or fifteen hundred miles; a monstrously large city indeed! such an one as never was upon earth."
3. "The length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal. A perfectly uniform state! according to the Ethiopic version, it is in length twelve thousand furlongs, and every measure equal, so that it is so many furlongs in length, breadth, and height."
