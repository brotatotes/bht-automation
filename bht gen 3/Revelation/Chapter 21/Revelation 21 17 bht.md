# Revelation 21:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The height of the walls of the New Jerusalem is measured according to the measure of a man, which is that of an angel. Even though the walls are far below the height of the city, they provide sufficient security, as even the smallest wall can exclude impurity. The New Jerusalem is to be the dwelling place of men, and therefore, even when an angel measures it, the measure used is according to that of a man. This signifies the angelic state of the saints, who will be like the angels of God in immortality and glory.
