# Revelation 21:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heavenly city requires no natural light sources like the sun or moon because it is illuminated by the glory of God and the Lamb. The direct light of God and the Lamb makes the saints independent of earthly light. The splendor of the sun and moon would pale in comparison to the radiance of God Himself. This highlights the purely spiritual nature of John's vision, as the saints rely solely on the divine illumination, rendering the need for natural light obsolete.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The city hath not need of the sun nor yet of the moon, that they should shine on her: for the glory of God... lightened her." 
2. "Her lamp was (or is) the Lamb."
3. "No assignment of the members of the sentence must be thought of, such as that the glory of God is her Sun, and the Lamb her moon, as has been done by some Commentators."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The direct light of God and the Lamb shall make the saints independent of God's creatures, the sun and moon, for light."
2. "The light...shall make the saints independent of God's creatures."
3. "(Shine) on it," or literally, "for her."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No language could give a more striking or beautiful representation of the heavenly state than what is here employed."
2. "For the glory of God did lighten it - By the visible splendor of his glory. That supplied the place of the sun and the moon."
3. "And the Lamb is the light thereof - The Son of God; the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The glory of God did lighten it. Compare Isaiah 60:19, Isaiah 60:20. 
The light [Î¿ Î»Ï…Ï‡Î½Î¿Ï‚] . Rev., better, lamp. See on John 5:35.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "It hath no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine upon it. In our present condition all nature is sacramental to the believing eye or ear. All tells of the supernatural behind nature."
2. "The glory of God spoken of is again the Shechinah, the visible symbol of His presence."
3. "The Lamb is the lamp thereof. It may seem as if mention of the â€˜lampâ€™ detracted from the loftiness of the imagery; but, when there is neither sun nor moon, we naturally think of the lamp which men use at night. May there not also be an allusion to the lamps of the Golden Candlestick of the Sanctuary?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If the sun and moon did shine, they would give no added light in the presence of the Shekinah Glory of God."
2. "Their splendour is simply put to shame by the glory of God Himself."
3. "No words could more clearly demonstrate the purely spiritual character of St. John's conception of the New Jerusalem."

### John Gill:
1. "And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it... which all earthly cities need; and which, though they may be in being in the new heavens, yet will not have the use with respect to this city they now have."
2. "...nor shall everyone teach his neighbour, but all shall know the Lord perfectly..."
3. "In whose light they will see the face of God, and see God face to face; they will see Christ as he is, and behold his glory; and look upon the angels, those glorious forms of light, and all the glorified saints, and know and converse with each other..."

### John Wesley:
1. The glory of God â€” Infinitely brighter than the shining of the sun.
