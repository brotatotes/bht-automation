# Revelation 21:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
And there shall never enter into her every thing unclean, and working abomination and falsehood, but only they that are written in the book of life of the Lamb... if then the kings of the earth, and the nations, bring their glory and their treasures into her, and if none shall ever enter into her that is not written in the book of life, it follows, that those kings, and these nations, are written in the book of life. As all the filth of the old Jerusalem was carried outside the walls and burnt there, so nothing defiled shall enter the heavenly city, but be burnt outside... There shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie, but only they which are written in the Lambâ€™s book of life.
