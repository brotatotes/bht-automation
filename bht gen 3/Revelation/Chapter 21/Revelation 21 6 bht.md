# Revelation 21:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Resting on the unchanging word of God, all His promises are as certain as if they had already come to pass. While we can drink from the stream now, in the future, we will be able to drink freely from the Fountain of the water of life. It is an extraordinary display of God's gratuitous love for man. These words signify the fulfillment of God's plan and the arrival of a new heaven and earth, where God, as the Alpha and Omega, will graciously provide the Water of Life to those who thirst for Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All is as sure as if it actually had been fulfilled for it rests on the word of the unchanging God."
2. "In our present state we may drink of the stream, then we shall drink at the Fountain."
3. "As gratuitous as was man's hatred of God, so gratuitous is God's love to man: there was every cause in Christ why man should love Him, yet man hated Him; there was every cause in man why (humanly speaking) God should have hated man, yet God loved man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is done - It is finished, complete; or, still more expressively, ‚Äúit is‚Äù - Œ≥ŒµÃÅŒ≥ŒøŒΩŒ±ŒΩ. The meaning in the passage before us evidently is, 'The great work is accomplished; the arrangement of human affairs is complete.'"
2. "I am now indeed the Alpha and the Omega - the first and the last... The scheme for setting up a kingdom in the lost world began in me, and it ends in me - the glorious and triumphant king."
3. "I will give unto him that is athirst... Of the fountain of the water of life... Freely - Without money and without price... The freeness and the fulness of salvation will be one of the most striking things made manifest when the immense hosts of the redeemed shall be welcomed to their eternal abodes."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The future for which the saints of God have longed, and of which the prophets spoke, has come. All expectations are fulfilled; all hopes are realized; the end to which all things pointed is reached."
2. "God is the unchangeable, the everlasting, One; the first cause, the last end, of all things."
3. "Not the longing after salvation, but the longing for a continued and ever deepening participation in its blessings, is expressed by the word ‚Äòathirst.‚Äô"
