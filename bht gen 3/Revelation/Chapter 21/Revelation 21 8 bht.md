# Revelation 21:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The cowardly, faithless, and liars will face eternal punishment for their lack of courage in the good fight and their rejection of truth. Along with sorcerers, idolaters, and the abominable, they will share in the lake of fire. Excluded from the blessed state of those who embrace the Kingdom of God, their part will be in the second death, a just consequence for their disbelief and sinful actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the cowardly," who do not quit themselves like men so as to "overcome" in the good fight; who have the spirit of slavish "fear," not love, towards God (Revelation 21:8).
2. "faithless" (Revelation 21:8).
3. "all who are liars"; compare 1 Timothy 4:1; 1 Timothy 4:2, where similarly lying and dealings with spirits and demons are joined together as features of "the latter times" (Revelation 21:8).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'fearful' denote those who had not firmness boldly to maintain their professed principles, or who were afraid to avow themselves as the friends of God in a wicked world." 
2. "All who are false in their statements, their promises, their contracts. The word would embrace all who are false toward God and false toward human beings."
3. "They will be excluded from heaven, and punished forever."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fearful [Œ¥ŒµŒπŒªŒøŒπœÇ] . The dative case...Only here, Matthew 8:26, and Mark 4:40."
2. "Abominable [ŒµŒ≤Œ¥ŒµŒªœÖŒ≥ŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπœÇ]...Properly, defiled with abominations."
3. "Whoremongers [œÄŒøœÅŒΩŒøŒπœÇ]...Much better, as Rev., fornicators."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‚Äòfearful‚Äô are mentioned first as occupying a position the reverse of them that ‚Äòovercome;‚Äô they have shrunk from the struggle; they have yielded to the foe instead of conquering him."
2. "They are such as have chosen the darkness rather than the light; as have loved the lie rather than the truth (John 8:44); as have deliberately resisted and cast aside the grace that might have been theirs."
3. "Their part can be only in the second death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In contrast to the state of the blessed (verses Revelation 21:3-7) the state of 'those who have disfranchised themselves from the Kingdom of God' (Charles) is given."
2. "Disloyalty is close kin to cowardice."
3. "Not a 'light' sin."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the timorous sheep and lambs of Christ, the dear children of God, who are sometimes of a fearful heart, on account of sin, temptation, and unbelief; but such who are of cowardly spirits, and are not valiant for the truth..."
2. "...such who profess his name, and are called by it, and yet do not truly believe in him, nor embrace his Gospel and the truths of it, but believe a lie; these are condemned already, and on them the wrath of God abides, and they will be damned at last..."
3. "And sorcerers; conjurers, dealers with familiar spirits, necromancers, and such as use the magic art, as many of the popes did to get into the chair, and poisoners of kings and princes; whoredoms and witchcrafts go together sometimes, as they did in Jezebel, an emblem of the Romish antichrist."

### John Wesley:
1. "But the fearful and unbelieving ‚Äî Who, through want of courage and faith, do not overcome."
2. "And abominable ‚Äî That is, sodomites."
3. "And whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters ‚Äî These three sins generally went together; their part is in the lake."
