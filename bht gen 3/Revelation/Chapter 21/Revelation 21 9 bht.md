1. "The bride, his wife, is not any particular believer, nor any particular church; not the Gentile church, nor the Jewish church only, but all the elect of God, consisting of the raised and living saints at the coming of Christ; who will make up one body, one general assembly, and be as a bride, prepared and adorned for her husband."
2. "These were first betrothed to Christ in eternity, and were openly espoused by him, one by one, at conversion; and now being all gathered in by the effectual calling, the dead being raised, and the living changed, and all glorified, the marriage is consummated, and they are declared publicly to be the bride, the Lamb's wife."
3. "And now, though John had had a sight of her before, Revelation 21:2 yet that was but a glimmering one, at a distance, he being in the wilderness, Revelation 17:3 wherefore the angel calls him to him, and proposes to give him a clear, distinct, and particular view of her, in all her glory; and a glorious sight this indeed!"

### John Wesley:
1. "And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven phials ‚Äî Whereby room had been made for the kingdom of God."
2. "Saying, Come, I will show thee the bride ‚Äî The same angel had before showed him Babylon, Revelation 17:1, which is directly opposed to the new Jerusalem."
