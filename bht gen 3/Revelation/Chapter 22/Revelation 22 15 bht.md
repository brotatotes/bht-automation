# Revelation 22:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Outside the heavenly city, impure persons, sorcerers, fornicators, murderers, idolaters, and those who love and practice falsehood are compared to dogs. These individuals, like scavengers in Eastern cities, are without a home or owner, feeding on refuse and filth. The term dogs was originally used by the Judaizers to label Gentiles as impure. Those outside the city are separated forever from the ones within, who experience eternal fellowship with God. Satan, the father of lies, finds a congenial place among those who propagate falsehood, depicting the state of hell.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Outside the heavenly city, Revelation reveals that there are those who are impure, practicing falsehood, and engaging in sinful behaviors like fornication and murder. These individuals are likened to scavenging dogs, despised in Eastern cities, as they feed on the refuse and filth of the streets. The term dogs was originally used by the Judaizers to denigrate Gentiles as impure. Satan, the father of lies, also finds a congenial place for those who love and propagate falsehood. In contrast, within the city are those separated forever from these wicked individuals, experiencing eternal fellowship with God. The dogs and the other condemned ones symbolically represent the state of hell and the absence of God's presence.
