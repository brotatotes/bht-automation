## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And the Spirit (in the churches, and in the prophets) and the Bride (the Church herself) say Come [...] and let him that thirsteth come: let him that will, take the water of life freely." 
2. "this verse is best understood as a reply Of the Apostle to our Lordâ€™s previous words."
3. "let him that will, take the water of life freely"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The invitation, 'Come,' only holds good while the Church is still but an affianced Bride, and not the actually wedded wife."
2. "Let him that heareth the Spirit and Bride saying to the Lord Jesus, 'Come,' join the Bride as a true believer, become part of her, and so say with her to Jesus, 'Come.'"
3. "As the Bride, the Church, prays to Jesus, 'Come,' so she urges all whosoever thirst for participation in the full manifestation of redemption-glory at His coming to us, to COME in the meantime and drink of the living waters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of this whole verse is, evidently, to show the freeness of the offers of the gospel; to condense in a summary manner all the invitations of mercy to mankind; and to leave on the mind at the close of the book a deep impression of the ample provision which has been made for the salvation of a fallen race."
2. "The authority to make the invitation is not limited to the ministers of religion; it is not even confined to those who accept it themselves. All persons, even though they should not accept of it, are authorized to tell others that they may be saved."
3. "Every one that is disposed to come, that has any sincere wish to be saved, is assured that he may live. No matter how unworthy he is; no matter what his past life has been...the invitation is freely made to all to come and be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The Spirit. In the Church. 
The Bride. The Church. 
Heareth. The voice of the Spirit and the Bride.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "If this be allowed, the first two clauses will be the answer of the Church to Him who has just described Himself by the glorious titles of Revelation 22:16."
2. "The Spirit working in the Church, and teaching her to long and cry for that Coming with which all her hopes are associated, together with the Church herself, no sooner think of the testimony of Christ as ended than they can restrain themselves no longer, and by the voice of the Church they both cry 'Come'."
3. "The thirst referred to is not the first thirst of the sinner after salvation. It is the constant longing of one who has already been refreshed for deeper and fuller draughts; and to each one who so thirsts the Lord says 'Come'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The call for Christ is to be repeated by every hearer... Let him come himself before it is too late."
2. "The thirsty man is bidden to come... thirsting for the water of life."
3. "The door of mercy still stands wide open today, for the end has not yet come."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the Spirit' may be meant the Spirit of God in the hearts of his people, who not only convinces them of, and acquaints with the coming of Christ to judgment, and gives them reason to expect it, but fills their souls with the love of his appearance, so that they look and long for it."
2. "Hence, some interpreters, by the spirit, understand such as have the Spirit, and are spiritual men; either have spiritual gifts, the gift of prophecy, as John, who in Revelation 22:20 expresses an ardent desire that Christ would come quickly; or regenerate men in common, who are born of the Spirit, and bear his name."
3. "The water of life designs the free favour and love of God, and the communications and displays of it in the new Jerusalem state, even the comfort, refreshment, and glories of that state: to 'take' it is to enjoy it, to partake of it, being led unto it, and that being given to them by Christ the Lamb in the midst of the throne."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Spirit and the bride â€” The Spirit of adoption in the bride, in the heart of every true believer."
2. "And let him that thirsteth, come â€” Here they also who are farther off are invited."
3. "And whosoever will, let him take the water of life â€” He may partake of my spiritual and unspeakable blessings, as freely as he makes use of the most common refreshments; as freely as he drinks of the running stream."
