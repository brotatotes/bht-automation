# Revelation 22:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the heavenly city stands the tree of life, with twelve fruits representing the promised redemption. Just as Adam and Eve were driven from the tree of life in Paradise, now Christ, the second Adam, appears with His Bride, the Church, in a better Paradise. The leaves of the tree are not for healing sickness but serve as a preventive measure for the redeemed. This tree of life, freely accessible in the streets and by the river, nourishes and brings comfort, health, and happiness to the saints.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the midst of the street of it, the tree of life producing twelve fruits according to each month. "
2. "The leaves of the tree are for healing of the nations."
3. "Trees on each side in the middle of the space between the street and the river."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How striking it is that, as in the beginning we found Adam and Eve, his bride, in innocence m Paradise, then tempted by the serpent, and driven from the tree of life, and from the pleasant waters of Eden, yet not without a promise of a Redeemer who should crush the serpent; so at the close, the old serpent cast out for ever by the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, who appears with His Bride, the Church, in a better Paradise, and amidst better waters."
2. "To make good sense, supposing there to be but one tree, we should either, as MEDE, suppose that the Greek for street is a plain washed on both sides by the river (as the first Paradise was washed on one side by the Tigris, on the other by the Euphrates), and that in the midst of the plain, which itself is in the midst of the river's branches, stood the tree: in which case we may translate, 'In the midst of the street (plain) itself, and of the river (having two branches flowing) on this and on that side, was there the tree of life.'"
3. "The leaves shall be the health-giving preventive securing the redeemed against, not healing them of, sicknesses, while 'the fruit shall be for meat.' In the millennium described in Ezekiel 47:1-23; Revelation 20:1-15, the Church shall give the Gospel-tree to the nations outside Israel and the Church, and so shall heal their spiritual malady; but in the final and perfect new Jerusalem here described, the state of all is eternally fixed, and no saving process goes on any longer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The more common interpretation, however, is doubtless admissible, and would give a more beautiful image; that in the street, or streets of the city, as well as on the banks of the river, the tree of life was planted." (Commentary on Revelation 22:2)
2. "The writer undoubtedly conceives of a single river running through the city - probably as meandering along - and that river lined on both sides with the tree of life. This gives great beauty to the imagery." (Commentary on Revelation 22:2)
3. "In the future state of the blessed, that tree [of life] will abound, and all may freely partake of it; the emblem, the pledge of immortal life, will be constantly before the eyes, whatever part of the future abode may be traversed, and the inhabitants of that blessed world may constantly partake of it." (Commentary on Revelation 22:2)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the midst of the street thereof."
2. "On this side and on that."
3. "Twelve fruits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are again...the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations." 
2. "The idea of the ‚Äòtree of life‚Äô is no doubt taken from Genesis 2:9." 
3. "The supply of fruit, at once for the nourishment and the delectation of the saints, never fails."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The tree of life (ŒæœÖŒªŒøŒΩ Œ∂œâŒ∑œÇ). For the metaphor see Genesis 1:11 and Revelation 2:7; Revelation 22:14."
2. "Twelve manner of fruits (Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄŒøœÖœÇ Œ¥œâŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±). 'Twelve fruits.'"
3. "For the healing of the nations (ŒµŒπœÇ Œ∏ŒµœÅŒ±œÄŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ œÑœâŒΩ ŒµŒ∏ŒΩœâŒΩ). Spiritual healing, of course, as leaves (œÜœÖŒªŒªŒ±) are often used for obtaining medicines."

### John Gill:
1. "By the tree of life is meant not the Gospel, nor godliness, nor eternal life, nor any other of the divine Persons, but Christ, who is the author of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal..." (100 words)
2. "The situation of the tree of life, between the street of the city and the river of God's everlasting love, shows that Christ will be seen and enjoyed by all in the most delightful and comfortable manner that can be wished for." (40 words)
3. "Everything in Christ will contribute to the comfort, health, and happiness of the saints." (15 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "In the midst of the street ‚Äî Here is the paradise of God." 
2. "Is the tree of life ‚Äî Not one tree only, but many."
3. "And the leaves are for the healing of the nations ‚Äî For the continuing their health, not the restoring it; for no sickness is there."
