## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who hath all the fulness of the Spirit... implies His infinite power by the Spirit to convict of sin and of a hollow profession." 
2. "The human ministry is the fruit of Christ's sending down the gifts of the Spirit." 
3. "Sardis was famed among the churches for spiritual vitality; yet the Heart-searcher, who seeth not as man seeth, pronounces her dead; how great searchings of heart should her case create among even the best of us!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I know thy works - That thou hast a name that thou livest - Thou dost profess attachment to me and my cause. The word 'life' is a word that is commonly employed, in the New Testament, to denote religion, in contradistinction from the natural state of man, which is described as death in sin."
2. "And art dead - That is, spiritually. This is equivalent to saying that their profession was merely in name; and yet this must be understood comparatively, for there were some even in Sardis who truly lived unto God."
3. "The Saviour does not, as in the case of the churches of Ephesus and Thyatira, specify any prevailing form of error or false doctrine; but it would seem that here it was a simple waist of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Become what thou art not."
2. "Strengthen."
3. "I have found no works of thine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that hath the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars...The fact that He has also the â€˜seven Spirits of God,â€™ or in other words, the Holy Spirit in His fulness, is on the one hand a proof of the doctrine of the Western Church on the relation of the Holy Spirit to our Lord."
2. "They that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth. This last is precisely what the church at Sardis failed to do."
3. "The outward is not the inward, and that power and splendour of position have no value in the sight of Heaven compared with spirituality of heart and life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The paradox of death under the name of life."
2. "A name in contrast with reality."
3. "Not complete death, but rapidly dying."

### John Gill:
1. "This church represents the state of the church from the time of the Reformation by Luther and others, until a more glorious state of the church appears, or until the spiritual reign of Christ in the Philadelphian period; under the Sardian church state we now are."
2. "This stone, naturalists say, drives away fear, gives boldness, cheerfulness, and sharpness of wit, and frees from witchcrafts and sorceries; which may be expressive of the boldness and courage of the first reformers; of the cheerfulness, joy, and pleasure, which appeared in their countenances, and which they spread in others by preaching the doctrines of the Gospel."
3. "the reformed churches have had a name for spiritual living, by faith on Christ's righteousness only for justification, that article being the great article of the Reformation: there was in them an appearance of liveliness, by their zeal for Gospel doctrine and worship, and a form of living according to godliness."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Holy Spirit, from whom alone all spiritual life and strength proceed."
2. "The seven stars â€” which are subordinate to him."
3. "That Spirit seeth through all things, and every empty appearance vanishes before him."
