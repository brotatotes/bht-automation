### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reference is neither to any precepts of Christ concerning patience, nor to any accounts given us of the patience of Christ Himself, but simply to Christ‚Äôs ‚Äòword,‚Äô which cannot be kept without much patient endurance on the part of His people."
2. "Out of‚Äô (comp. John 17:15) this trial believers are to be kept, not that they are to be kept in it, when in the course of providence it comes upon the Church as well as others, but that they are to be kept entirely out of it; it shall not touch them."
3. "The trial comes upon the whole inhabited world; no part of the world shall escape it. But at the same time, it comes to try them that dwell upon the earth, not all living men without exception, but, as clearly shown by the use of this expression in the Apocalypse, only the wicked."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Patience (œÖœÄŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑œÇ). 'Endurance' as in Revelation 13:10; Revelation 14:12 as also in 2 Thessalonians 3:5."
2. "From the hour of trial (ŒµŒ∫ œÑŒ∑œÇ œâœÅŒ±œÇ œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒµŒπœÅŒ±œÉŒºŒøœÖ). This use of ŒµŒ∫ after œÑŒ∑œÅŒµœâ in John 17:15, Œ±œÄŒø in James 1:27. Trial brings temptation often (James 1:2; James 1:13). Jesus endured (Hebrews 12:1) and he will help them."
3. "To try (œÄŒµŒπœÅŒ±œÉŒ±). First aorist active infinitive of purpose from œÄŒµŒπœÅŒ±Œ∂œâ, probably to tempt (cf. the demons in Revelation 9:1-21), not merely to afflict (Revelation 2:10)."

### John Gill:
1. "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience...; that patience, which bears a resemblance to his, in enduring afflictions, reproaches, persecutions, desertions, and temptations, and in waiting for his kingdom and glory." 
2. "This word, the churches, in the Philadelphian state, will keep pure and incorrupt, and observe the ordinances of it according to the directions given in it; and will believe the promise of Christ's personal coming, and patiently wait for it."
3. "It seems to be the last struggle of the beast of Rome, and to denote some violent and sharp persecution, such as what Daniel mentions, that never was before nor since; but it will be but short, but one hour, the twenty fourth part of a prophetical day or year, perhaps about a fortnight; yet it will be very extensive; it will reach all the world, the whole Roman empire, and all that dwell upon the earth, that are called by the name of Christians, and will try them, whether they are so or not."

### John Wesley:
1. "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience ‚Äî The word of Christ is indeed a word of patience." 
2. "O happy exemption from that spreading calamity! From the hour of temptation - So that thou shalt not enter into temptation; but it shall pass over thee."
3. "The whole Roman empire. It went over the Christians, and over the Jews and heathens; though in a very different manner... and did throughly try them that dwelt upon the earth."
