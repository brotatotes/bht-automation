# Revelation 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A lukewarm state, neither cold nor hot, signifies a superficial faith lacking fervor and earnestness. It is a dangerous condition because it gives a false sense of security, having enough religion to calm the conscience but not enough to save the soul. Those attached to the world and opposed to the church, though cold, have more hope of redemption, for they can potentially be warmed by the Gospel call. However, those who are lukewarm, having been brought near the holy fire without being heated by it, are in a perilous state.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I have thy whole course of life before me, and its testimony is, that thou art neither cold nor hot."
2. "Hot keeps its meaning of fervent, warm and earnest in the life of faith and love."
3. "A man in earnest, be he right or wrong, is ever a better man than one professing what he does not feel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The lukewarm state, if it be the transitional stage to a warmer, is a desirable state (for a little religion, if real, is better than none); but most fatal when, as here, an abiding condition, for it is mistaken for a safe state."
2. "There is more hope of the 'cold,' that is, those who are of the world, and not yet warmed by the Gospel call; for, when called, they may become hot and fervent Christians."
3. "The lukewarm has been brought within reach of the holy fire, without being heated by it into fervor: having religion enough to lull the conscience in false security, but not religion enough to save the soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Anything better than this condition, where love is professed, but where it does not exist; where vows have been assumed which are not fulfilled."
2. "Such a state of open and professed coldness or indifference is more honest. There is no disguise; no concealment; no pretense."
3. "The most hopeless of all persons, in regard to salvation, are those who are members of the church without any true religion; who have made a profession without any evidence of personal piety; who are content with a name to live."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cold, attached to the world and actively opposed to the Church."
2. "A man in earnest, be he right or wrong, is ever a better man than one professing what he does not feel."
3. "Hot, from zew to boil or seethe."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In no circumstances could either of these states be to the Lord an object of desire, for experience shows that there is none out of which it is so difficult to awaken the heart to a proper reception of the Divine message."
2. "It seems only possible to think of 'coldness' as real attachment to the world, and active opposition to the Church."
3. "The church at Laodicea was neither 'cold' nor 'hot.' It had received the truth outwardly, but no deep impression had been made upon it. Its members were not zealous for the truth, but neither were they zealous against it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Neither cold (ŒøœÖœÑŒµ œàœÖœáœÅŒøœÇ). Old word from œàœÖœáœâ, to grow cold (Matthew 24:12), in N.T. only Matthew 10:42 and this passage."
2. "Nor hot (ŒøœÖœÑŒµ Œ∂ŒµœÉœÑŒøœÇ). Late verbal from Œ∂Œµœâ, to boil, (Romans 12:11), boiling hot, here only in N.T."
3. "I would thou wert (ŒøœÜŒµŒªŒøŒΩ Œ∑œÇ). Wish about the present with ŒøœÜŒµŒªŒøŒΩ (really œâœÜŒµŒªŒøŒΩ, second aorist active indicative of ŒøœÜŒµŒπŒªœâ, without augment) with the imperfect Œ∑œÇ (instead of the infinitive) as in 2 Corinthians 11:1, when the old Greek used ŒµŒπŒ∏Œµ or Œµ Œ≥Œ±œÅ."

### John Gill:
1. "she was alive, but not lively: nor was she wholly without spiritual affections and love; to God, and Christ, to his people, ways, truths, and ordinances; she had love, but the fervency of it was abated: nor was she without spiritual breathings and desires altogether, as dead men are; or without the light and knowledge of the Gospel, and a profession of it, and yet she was not 'hot'"
2. "he alludes to what is natural among men, it being generally more agreeable to have anything entirely hot, or entirely cold, than to be neither; and so uses this phrase to show his detestation of lukewarmness"
3. "Christ desires not simply that she might be cold, but that she might be sensible of her need of spiritual heat and fervency."

### John Wesley:
1. "I know thy works ‚Äî Thy disposition and behaviour, though thou knowest it not thyself."
2. "Nor hot ‚Äî As boiling water: so ought we to be penetrated and heated by the fire of love."
3. "Even if thou wert cold, without any thought or profession of religion, there would be more hope of thy recovery."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse speaks of a lukewarm state that is considered neither cold nor hot. Being lukewarm means having a superficial faith, lacking fervor and earnestness. This condition is deemed dangerous because it gives a false sense of security, having enough religion to soothe the conscience but not enough to save the soul. Those who are cold, attached to the world and opposed to the church, have more hope of redemption because they can potentially be warmed by the Gospel call. However, those who are lukewarm, having been brought within reach of the holy fire without being heated by it, are in a perilous state. The desire is that they either be cold, fully aware of their need for spiritual heat, or hot, fervent and zealous in their faith.

- Attempt 3 BHT: Being lukewarm, neither cold nor hot, signifies a superficial faith lacking fervor. This dangerous state offers a false sense of security, with enough religion to pacify the conscience but not save the soul. While the cold are attached to the world and hostile to the Church, there is more hope for them to be warmed by the Gospel. The lukewarm are reached by the holy fire without being ignited, making their condition precarious. Ideally, they should be either cold, recognizing their need for spiritual heat, or hot, zealous and fervent in their faith.

- Attempt 5 BHT: A lukewarm state, neither cold nor hot, is a dangerous condition, providing false security with just enough religion to pacify the conscience. While the cold are attached to the world and opposed to the Church, there is hope for their redemption when called to the warmth of the Gospel. However, the lukewarm have been exposed to the holy fire but remain unaffected, their condition mistaken for safety. It is better to be fervent, passionate, and zealous in faith, or even cold with awareness, than to be tepid and lukewarm.
