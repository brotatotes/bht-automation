## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The great self-deceit of which the Lord here complains was not concerning worldly wealth, which was a patent fact, but concerning spiritual, which was a baseless fiction."
2. "Thou art the wretched and the pitiable one."
3. "Poor and blind and naked."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Self-sufficiency is the fatal danger of a lukewarm state."
2. "The riches on which they prided themselves were spiritual riches; though, doubtless, their spiritual self-sufficiency was much fostered by their worldly wealth."
3. "How different Christ's estimate of men, from their own estimate of themselves, 'I have need of nothing!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no doubt that there was much wealth in Laodicea, and that, as a people, they prided themselves on their riches... It is not easy to determine which is the true sense; but may it not have been that there was an allusion to both, and that, in every respect, they boasted that they had enough?"
2. "There is no just impression in regard to the real poverty and wretchedness of your condition."
3. "With all the decorations that wealth can impart, there may be a nakedness of the soul as real as that of the body would be if, without a rag to cover it, it were exposed to cold, and storm, and shame."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Increased with goods. The reference is to imagined spiritual riches, not to worldly possessions." (Quote 1)
2. "Thou. Emphatic." (Quote 2)
3. "Miserable. An object of pity." (Quote 3)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The spiritually proud have too many positive elements of character to justify such a description in their case. It was worldly prosperity that had made the church indifferent to the energy and power of Divine truth."
2. "To such a state of mind riches are a bar. The rich may no doubt enter into the kingdom of God as well as the poor, but they do so with difficulty."
3. "'Thou callest the poor wretched: thou art the wretched one: to thee really belong the misery and the poverty and the blindness and the nakedness for which thou pitiest or professest to pity others.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The church 'carried the pride of wealth into its spiritual life'." 
2. "This church was in a rich city and was rich in pride and conceit, but poor in grace and ignorant of its spiritual poverty."
3. "The figure completes the picture of actual poverty."

### John Gill:
1. "Riches seldom do any good to the churches of Christ, they did not in Constantine's time...they will usher in the Laodicean church state." 
2. "True believers, as considered in Christ, stand in need of nothing indeed, they are complete in him, and have everything in him; but, as considered in themselves, they are daily in need of daily food for their souls."
3. "True believers account themselves wretched, as the Apostle Paul did, on account of indwelling sin, and the plague of their own hearts, which the members of this church, the greater part of them, were ignorant of."

### John Wesley:
1. "I am rich â€” In gifts and grace, as well as worldly goods."
2. "And knowest not that thou art â€” In God's account, wretched and pitiable."
3. "Therefore 'I counsel thee,' etc."
