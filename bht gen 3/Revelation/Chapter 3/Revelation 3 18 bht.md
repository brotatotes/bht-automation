# Revelation 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's counsel to buy gold, raiment, and ointment is a metaphorical invitation to embrace our neediness and surrender our self-sufficiency. By renouncing our own righteousness and worldly attachments, we can obtain the true wealth of Christ's salvation. The white raiment represents His righteousness, purified and imparted to believers, while the eye-salve symbolizes spiritual illumination. These treasures are freely given by Christ, but they come at the cost of surrendering ourselves and seeking His grace, life, and supply of all our spiritual needs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That a pauper should be advised to buy gold and raiment, and ointment, might of itself shew what kind of buying is meant, even if Isa. lv. 1, 'Nay, without money and without price,' had not clearly defined it."
2. "The term, in fact, continues the irony. 'All this lofty self-sufficiency must be expended in the labour of getting from Me these absolute necessaries.'"
3. "The lack of righteousness, which can be only bought from Christ, and that at the price of all fancied righteousness of our own, is just as much a poverty as the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Take My advice, thou who fanciest thyself in need of nothing. Not only art thou not in need of nothing, but art in need of the commonest necessaries of existence."
2. "Buy at the cost of thine own self-sufficiency and the giving up of all things, however dear to us, that would prevent our receiving Christ's salvation as a free gift."
3. "Christ offers infinitely whiter raiment. As 'gold tried in the fire' expresses faith tested by fiery trials: so 'white raiment,' Christ's righteousness imputed to the believer in justification and imparted in sanctification."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Gold here is emblematic of religion - as being the most precious of the metals, and the most valued by human beings."
2. "With true religion; with the favor and friendship of the Redeemer, they would have all that they really needed, and would never be in want."
3. "The grace of the gospel enables people who were before blind to see clearly the character of God, the beauty of the way of salvation, the loveliness of the person and work of Christ, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The goods of Christ are freely given, yet they have their price - renunciation of self and of the world."
2. "Anoint thine eyes with eye-salve... The figure sets forth the spiritual anointing by which the spiritual vision is purged."
3. "By the smarting anointings of healthful sorrows, [the troubled and bedimmed eyesight of the mind] was from day to day healed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined out of fire, not that gold which cannot stand the fire of the great day, but the true gold of My kingdom, purified by being burnt in the furnace of trial, that thus thou mayest be rich." 
2. "White garments, that thou mayest appear clothed when I come."
3. "Eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Refined by fire... Purity by removing dross." 
2. "That thou mayest become rich... spiritual riches."
3. "Be not made manifest... Nakedness."

### John Gill:
1. "The substance of it is, to come to him for grace, life, and salvation; for pardon, peace, and righteousness; for spiritual light and knowledge, and every supply of grace."
2. "Christ and his grace are given freely; Christ of whom it is to be had and of him only, does not sell it, but he gives it to those that come to him for it, and desire to have it, and are willing to part with all, so they may but enjoy it."
3. "Persons are not to be accounted truly rich who have only this world's goods; none are rich but those who have an interest in Christ and his grace; and they who are poor in this world, and yet have grace, are really rich."

### John Wesley:
1. "Gold purified in the fire â€” True, living faith, which is purified in the furnace of affliction."
2. "And white raiment â€” True holiness."
3. "And eyesalve â€” Spiritual illumination; the 'unction of the Holy One,' which teacheth all things."
