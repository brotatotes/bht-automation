# Revelation 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Awake and be watchful, for you have been weighed and found wanting. Strengthen and preserve what little life remains, as your works have not measured up to God's standard. Do not be deceived by the vestiges of life, but be vigilant against spiritual pride. Revive the dying truths of the Gospel, for they are almost lost. Depart from evil doctrines and practices, striving for perfection and fulfilling your works before God. Hold on to the knowledge of truth and let the fruits of the Spirit flourish within you, for they are ready to die when pride or laziness resurface.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Become, what thou art not, 'watchful,' or 'wakeful,' literally, 'waking.'" 
2. "'The things that remain' can hardly mean 'the PERSONS that are not yet dead, but are ready to die'; for :- implies that the 'few' faithful ones at Sardis were not 'ready to die,' but were full of life."
3. "Weighed in the balance of Him who requires living faith as the motive of works, and found wanting."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be watchful...in contradistinction from the drowsy condition of the church."
2. "An important duty in a low and languishing state of religion is, to 'strengthen the things that still survive.'"
3. "In the lowest state of religion in a church...good may always be done to the cause itself by preserving and strengthening what there may be of life among those few, amidst the general desolation and death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Become watchful. Sardis had failed to ‚Äòwatch,‚Äô the very sin into which spiritual pride is sure to fall. Therefore must she first of all awake, discover what her temptation is, and put herself on her guard against the foe."
2. "And stablish the things that remain which were ready to die; that is, which were ready, at the moment when the searching eye of her Lord was first directed towards her, to sink into the state characterized as ‚Äòdead.‚Äô Christian graces, not persons, are alluded to."
3. "For I have found no works of thine fulfilled before my God...so long, therefore, as she is not spiritual, her works are not ‚Äòfulfilled.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Be thou watchful...He does not say 'Arise from the dead'...for there are vestiges of life." (Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒøœÖ Œ≥œÅŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅœâŒΩ. Periphrastic imperative...as in Matthew 24:42) 
2. "Stablish the things that remain...Those not actually dead, but in grave peril...Every new pastor faces such a problem." (œÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπœÉŒøŒΩ œÑŒ± ŒªŒøŒπœÄŒ±...Titus 1:5) 
3. "For I have found no works of thine...Their works have not measured up to God's standard." (ŒøœÖ Œ≥Œ±œÅ ŒµœÖœÅŒ∑Œ∫Œ± œÉŒøœÖ ŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±...ŒµŒΩœâœÄŒπŒøŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ ŒºŒøœÖ)

### John Gill:
1. "And this may also respect the members of these churches, who ought to be watchful, and constant attenders on the word and ordinances, and in the duty of prayer."
2. "...the truths of the Gospel, which at the beginning of the Reformation were revived, and were preached with great life and liveliness; but towards the close of this state, as now, would be just ready to expire, to be almost lost, and dead, and buried, as they are..."
3. "This church, though she has departed from the corrupt church of Rome, and from her evil doctrines and practices; yet did not go on to that perfection which might have been expected and desired, and which would have rendered her praiseworthy, whereas she is now discommended."

### John Wesley:
1. "The things which remain ‚Äî In thy soul; knowledge of the truth, good desires, and convictions."
2. "Which were ready to die ‚Äî Wherever pride, indolence, or levity revives, all the fruits of the Spirit are ready to die."
