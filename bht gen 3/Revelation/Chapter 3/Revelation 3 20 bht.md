## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This blessed admission of Christ into our hearts will lead to His becoming our guest, ever present with us and sharing in all our blessingsâ€”and, which is even more, to our being ever in close union with Him, partaking ever of His fulness, until we sit down at His table in His Kingdom."
2. "Our verse is a striking and decisive testimony to the practical freedom of our will to receive or reject the heavenly Guest: without the recognition of which, the love and tenderness of the saying become a hideous mockery."
3. "These promises cannot be regarded, as this by some, as partially fulfilled in this life: for thus the following analogy, 'as I also,&c.' would fail."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who is Himself 'the Door,' and who bids us 'knock' that it may be 'opened unto' us, is first Himself to knock at the door of our hearts." 
2. "The Sun of righteousness, like the natural sun, the moment that the door is opened, pours in His light, which could not previously find an entrance." 
3. "Here again He alludes to the imagery of Song of Solomon 4:16, where the Bride invites Him to eat pleasant fruits, even as He had first prepared a feast for her, 'His fruit was sweet to my taste.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though they had erred, the way of repentance and hope was not closed against them. He was still willing to be gracious, though their conduct had been such as to be loathsome."
2. "He does not obtrude himself upon us, nor does he employ force to find admission to the heart. If admitted, he comes and dwells with us; if rejected, he turns quietly away."
3. "The truths, then, which are taught in this verse, are: That the invitation of the gospel is made to all; That the movement toward reconciliation and friendship is originated by the Saviour; That there is a recognition of our own free agency in religion; The ease of the terms of salvation; and The blessedness of admitting him, arising from his friendship."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He at whose door we ought to stand... condescends Himself to stand at ours." 
2. "Love for men emptied God... He goes Himself and seeks him;... nor does He withdraw from him who repels Him, nor is He disgusted at his insolence; but, pursuing him, remains sitting at his doors."
3. "Christ is the Bread of Life, and invites to the great feast."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold, I stand at the door... that He will immediately admit His people to the full enjoyment of His promised blessedness."
2. "No knocking in various ways... The words simply show how near Jesus is, and how ready to bless."
3. "The picture is one of the heavenly reward... the glory and joy of the future world, where the believer shall be forever with his Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I stand at the door... Picture of the Lord's advent as in Matthew 24:33; James 5:9." 
2. "If any man hear--and open... See the picture reversed (Swete) in Luke 13:25; Matthew 25:10." 
3. "I will come in to him... Fellowship in the Messianic kingdom (Luke 22:30; Mark 14:25; Matthew 26:29)."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase of standing at the door may be expressive of the near approach, or sudden coming of Christ to judgment."
2. "His knocking may signify the notice that will be given of it, by some of the immediate forerunners and signs of his coming."
3. "When they shall enjoy a thousand years communion with him in person here on earth; when the Lamb on the throne will feed them with the fruit of the tree of life, and lead them to fountains of living water, and his tabernacle shall be among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "I stand at the door, and knock â€” Even at this instant; while he is speaking this word."
2. "If any man open â€” Willingly receive me."
3. "I will sup with him â€” Refreshing him with my graces and gifts, and delighting myself in what I have given."
