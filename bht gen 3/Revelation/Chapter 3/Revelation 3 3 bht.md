## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Remember [therefore] how (not subjective, ‚Äúwith what manner of reception,‚Äù but objective, ‚Äúafter what sort:‚Äù as in Eph. iv. 20; 1 Cor. xv. 11) thou hast received (perfect tense; said of the permanent deposit of doctrine entrusted) and heardest (merely past tense: said of the act of hearing, when it took place), and keep (what thou hast received and heardest: keep, as an abiding habit), and repent (the command is of a quick and decisive act of amendment)." 
2. "If therefore (the therefore is hardly because it is assumed, in the present evil state of the Sardian church, that the exhortation will be in vain: far rather, because repentance is so grievously needed. And it follows on the plain declaration which has been made of that present evil state; coming forcibly and unexpectedly where we should rather have looked for 'But if') thou dost not watch (shalt not have awaked and become watchful, before the time about to be indicated in the threat which is coming), I will come as a thief (these words do not here refer to our Lord‚Äôs final coming, but to some signal judgment in which He would overtake the Sardian church."
3. "Just as the formula derived from the great truth of the suddenness of His second coming is frequently applied to His final judgment in Jerusalem, so is it to other His partial and special advents to judgment in the case of individuals and churches), and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What Sardis is to 'remember' is, not how joyfully she had received originally the Gospel message, but how the precious deposit was committed to her originally." 
2. "The word 'keep' or observe the commandment which thou hast received and didst hear." 
3. "As the thief gives no notice of his approach. Christ applies the language which in its fullest sense describes His second coming, to describe His coming in special judgments on churches and states."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was something marked and unusual in the way in which they had been led to embrace the gospel."
2. "It is always well for Christians to call to remembrance the 'day of their espousals,' and their views and feelings when they gave their hearts to the Saviour."
3. "No one who is warned of his guilt and danger can feel that he is for one moment safe."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou hast received the truth as a permanent deposit."
2. "Thief, as distinguished from a robber, a plunderer on a larger scale, who secures his booty not by stealth, but by violence."
3. "The Greek proverb says that the feet of the avenging deities are shod with wool."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exhortation to Sardis is to remember, not the simple fact that she had received, but how she had done so, after what manner thou hast received, the earnestness, the faithfulness, and the zeal which had marked the first stages of her spiritual life."
2. "It is not the suddenness or unexpectedness of the hour only that is thought of under the image of a ‚Äòthief,‚Äô for that image has rather its expression in the last clause of the verse. It is the object with which the thief comes that is in view, to break up and to destroy."
3. "Thus the Lord ‚Äòcomes as a thief;‚Äô and the hour shall not be known till He is come."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Keep in mind, as in Revelation 2:5."
2. "Hold on to what thou hast."
3. "Turn at once."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of the advice is to put this church in mind of the doctrines of grace she had heard at the beginning of the Reformation, from Luther and others; such as justification by the righteousness of Christ, pardon through his blood, and atonement by his sacrifice, doctrines now almost lost and buried in forgetfulness."
2. "It looks as if there was danger, as there is, that they would be entirely wrested out of her hands."
3. "and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee: which, though applicable to the spiritual coming of Christ in the next church state, and to his second coming in his kingdom and glory, which will be both sudden and unexpected, yet these will be to the joy and comfort of the church; whereas what is here spoken is by way of threatening, and must relate to some severe dispensation on her."

### John Wesley:
1. "Remember how - Humbly, zealously, seriously. Thou didst receive the grace of God once, and hear - His word."
2. "And hold fast - The grace thou hast received."
3. "And repent - According to the word thou hast heard."
