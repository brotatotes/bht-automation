3. "The absence of defilement is only explained by 'They washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "names‚Äîpersons named
	in the book of life (Revelation 3:5)
	known by name by the Lord as His own. These had the reality
	corresponding to their name; not a mere name among men as
	living, while really dead (Revelation 3:5- :). The gracious Lord does not overlook any exceptional cases
	of real saints in the midst of unreal professors."

	garments‚Äînamely, the garments of their Christian profession, of
	which baptism is the initiatory seal, whence the candidates for
	baptism used in the ancient Church to be arrayed in white."
3. "they shall walk with me in
	white‚ÄîThe promised reward accords with the character of those
	to be rewarded: keeping their garments undefiled and white

	while hereafter."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou hast a few, etc. Compare verse 1, thou hast a name, and see on chapter Revelation 11:13. Names is equivalent to persons, a few who may be rightly named as exceptions to the general conception." 
2. "Garments. See the same figure, Jude 1:23. The meaning is, have not sullied the purity of their Christian life." 
3. "The same shall be clothed [ŒøœÖœÑŒøœÇ œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ≤Œ±ŒªŒµŒπœÑŒ±Œπ] . For ou=tov this, or the same, read outwv thus : 'shall thus be arrayed.' so Rev. The verb denotes a solemn investiture, and means literally to throw or put around."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did not defile (ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµŒºŒøŒªœÖŒΩŒ±ŒΩ). First aorist active indicative of ŒºŒøŒªœÖŒΩœâ (1 Corinthians 8:7; 1 Peter 1:4), pollution."
2. "They shall walk (œÄŒµœÅŒπœÄŒ±œÑŒ∑œÉŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ). Future active of œÄŒµœÅŒπœÄŒ±œÑŒµœâ, promise of fellowship with Christ (ŒºŒµœÑ' ŒµŒºŒøœÖ, with me) "in white" (ŒµŒΩ ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫ŒøŒπœÇ), as symbols of purity (Revelation 7:9; Revelation 7:13) like the angel (Matthew 28:3), with possibly a reference to Enoch (Genesis 5:22)."
3. "For they are worthy (ŒøœÑ Œ±ŒæŒπŒø ŒµŒπœÉŒπŒΩ). To walk with Christ, not worthy in the same sense as God and Christ (Revelation 4:11; Revelation 5:9), but in a relative sense. See Revelation 16:6 for bad sense of Œ±ŒæŒπŒøœÇ."

### John Gill:
1. "These are said to be but 'few', not in comparison of the world, in which sense all the elect of God are but few, though a large number, considered in themselves; but in comparison of formal lifeless professors of religion."

3. "There is a walking in Christ by faith; and a walking before him as in his sight; and a walking worthy of him, in all well pleasing in his ways and ordinances; and here a walking with him, in a way of special and comfortable communion, both here and hereafter."
