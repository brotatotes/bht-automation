# Revelation 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thou art worthy, O Lord and our God, to receive the glory and the honour and the might. The elders, though themselves belonging to creation, in this ascription of praise look on creation from without, and that thanksgiving, which creation renders for its being, becomes in their view a tribute to Him who called them into being, and thus a testimony to His creative power. With God to will is to effect: to determine is to perform. It is THOU who didst create. Their thanksgiving is a tribute to the creative power which called them into being.
