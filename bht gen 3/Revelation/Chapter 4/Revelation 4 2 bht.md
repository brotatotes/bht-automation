## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Immediately I was (became) in the Spirit..."
2. "...a throne stood in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting..."
3. "This fundamental vision contains all that may serve for terror to the enemies, and consolation to the friends, of Him that sitteth on the throne..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I was completely rapt in vision into the heavenly world."
2. "the Eternal Father: the Creator"
3. "The Father in essence is invisible, but in Scripture at times is represented as assuming a visible form."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was at once absorbed in the contemplation of the visions before him."
2. "They appeared as real to him as if he saw them, and they were in fact a real symbolical representation of things occurring in heaven."
3. "So much do their representations accord with what is demanded by correct taste; and so sedulously have they guarded against any encouragement of idolatry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Appropriate to the sudden and unconscious transportation of the seer into the ecstatic state."
2. "But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site, Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest."
3. "He is commonly understood to be God the Father; but some understand the triune God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. John is prepared for [the visions] by passing into the spiritual or ecstatic state...the word 'was,' which is properly 'became,' may be designed to call our attention to the renewal of the first vividness or fervour of his spiritual condition."
2. "The whole scene is founded upon Isaiah 6, where we have not only the throne high and lifted up, the seraphim, and the train filling the temple, but also the Trisagion, 'Holy, holy, holy,' etc. The vision of Isaiah...is always justly regarded as one of the greatest adumbrations of the Trinity contained in the Old Testament."
3. "It has to be observed that one great distinction between the visions of chap. 4 and chap. 5 seems to lie in this, that in the former we have the Almighty presented to us as He is in Himself absolutely, that in the latter only are we directly introduced to the Covenant of grace in which we learn to know God as Father."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "At once I found myself in the Spirit" (Swete), not "I came to be in the Spirit" as in Revelation 1:10.
2. "This bold imagery comes chiefly from 1 Kings 22:19; Isaiah 6:1; Ezekiel 1:26-28; Daniel 7:9. One should not forget that this language is glorious imagery, not actual objects in heaven."
3. "The picture of God on the throne is common in the O.T. and the N.T. (Matthew 5:34; Matthew 23:22; Hebrews 1:3 and in nearly every chapter in the Revelation)."

### John Gill:
1. "The Spirit of God at once possessed and filled him, in an extraordinary manner; and his soul or spirit was immediately taken from the consideration of all sensible objects, and was fixed and intent upon the things presented to it in the vision, so that it was as if it was out of the body." 
2. "This is a symbol of the power, authority, and dominion now exercised by God, not over the world in general, but which he exercises in his church, signified by 'heaven'."
3. "Here he exercises a jurisdiction and government; he is King and lawgiver in it; he has enacted laws, and he writes them on the hearts of his people, and puts his Spirit within them, and makes them both able and willing to obey them."

### John Wesley:
1. "And immediately I was in the spirit â€” Even in an higher degree than before." 
2. "The court of heaven is here laid open; and the throne of God is, as it were, the centre from which everything in the visible world goes forth, and to which everything returns."
3. "Here is described God, the Almighty, the Father of heaven, in his majesty, glory, and dominion."
