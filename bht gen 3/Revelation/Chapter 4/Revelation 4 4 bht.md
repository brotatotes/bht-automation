## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These twenty-four elders are... representatives of the Church, as generally understood."
2. "The key to the interpretation being the analogy with the sayings of our Lord to the Apostles."
3. "It might be said with equal justice that the number of the actual Apostles is not definitely twelve."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are not angels, for they have white robes and crowns of victory, implying a conflict and endurance, 'Thou hast redeemed us': they represent the Heads of the Old and New Testament churches respectively, the Twelve Patriarchs and Twelve Apostles." 
2. "The tabernacle was a 'pattern' of the heavenly antitype; the holy place, a figure of HEAVEN ITSELF. Thus Jehovah's throne is represented by the mercy seat in the holiest, the Shekinah-cloud over it."
3. "The 'four living creatures' answer to the cherubim over the mercy seat. So the twenty-four throned and crowned elders are typified by the twenty-four chiefs of the twenty-four courses of priests, 'Governors of the sanctuary, and governors of God.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They represent the church triumphant - the church victorious. Thus, they have crowns on their heads; they have harps in their hands; they say that they are 'kings and priests,' and that they will 'reign on the earth.'"
2. "The design, therefore, is to represent the church triumphant - redeemed - saved - as rendering praise and honor to God; as uniting with the hosts of heaven in adoring him for his perfections and for the wonders of his grace."
3. "The word 'elders' here seems to be used in the sense of aged and venerable men, rather than as denoting office. They were such as by their age were qualified to preside over the different divisions of the priesthood."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A royal throne."
2. "The twenty-four elders are usually taken to represent the one Church of Christ, as at once the Church of the old and of the new Covenant, figured by the twelve patriarchs and the twelve apostles."
3. "The crown in this passage is the crown, not of kinghood, but of glory and immortality."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is important to observe the word â€˜thronesâ€™ (not as in the Authorised Version, â€˜seatsâ€™) here used by St. John, for there can be no doubt that it is deliberately chosen in order to bring out the fact that the glorified Church of Christ is placed in no lower position than that of the Saviourâ€™s and the Fatherâ€™s throne."
2. "The twenty-four elders, thus embodying the conception of the Church of Christ in her perfected condition, have three characteristics. (1) They are sitting, the attitude of rest and honour. (2) They are clothed in white garments, the robes of perfect purity, the robes of priests. (3) They have on their heads golden crowns, those of chaps. Revelation 2:10, Revelation 3:11, and Revelation 14:14, in which last passage the same â€˜golden crownâ€™ is assigned to the Son of man. Like Him, they are not only priests but kings."
3. "The Church is before us in her triumphing condition."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Four and twenty elders... This further circle of thrones beyond the great throne." 
2. "Twenty-four as a symbolic number occurs only in this book and only for these elders." 
3. "John uses Î´Î¹Î±Î´Î·Î¼Î± (diadem) for the kingly crown... but it is not certain that the old distinction between Î´Î¹Î±Î´ÎµÎ¼ as the kingly crown and ÏƒÏ„ÎµÏ†Î±Î½Î¿Ï‚ as the victor's wreath is always observed in late Greek."

### John Gill:
1. "The thrones in the above form, came to both ends, or sides of it; just as when the sanhedrim, or great court of judicature among the Jews say m, the "Nasi", or prince, sat in the uppermost seat, at his right hand was "Ab beth din", or the father or the sanhedrim, and at his left hand a doctor or wise man, and all the rest of the members sat in a semicircular form upon seats before them, so that they could see them all."
2. "they having a greater degree of spiritual knowledge of the manifold wisdom of God than the Jewish church, which was in a state of infancy, and under tutors and governors, had; but the Gospel church is in a state of manhood, and no longer under a schoolmaster, and so fitly expressed by 'elders'"
3. "and they now reign as kings over sin, Satan, and the world, and have a kingdom of grace which shall never be removed; and they shall reign with Christ on earth a thousand years, and then reign with him to all eternity in heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "Clothed in white raiment â€” This and their golden crowns show, that they had already finished their course and taken their place among the citizens of heaven." 
2. "They are never termed souls, and hence it is probable that they had glorified bodies already."
3. "The most holy of all the former ages, representing the whole body of the saints."
