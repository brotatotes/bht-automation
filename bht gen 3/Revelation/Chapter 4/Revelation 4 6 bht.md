# Revelation 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sea of glass in Revelation, reminiscent of the molten sea in the temple, represents God's judgments and the purificatory baptism of water and the Spirit. As the king-priests of God stand firmly upon this solid sea, they can walk on it with the confidence of Christ walking on water. Crystal-like and full of eyes, this sea reflects God's unlimited intelligence and ceaseless vigilance. It symbolizes an everwatchful Providence, where all aspects of divine administration are distinctly contemplated, guiding believers to their ultimate rest in God's immediate presence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But see the analogue in the temple, the molten sea before the sanctuary...It stands solid, calm, and clear, God's judgments are called 'a great deep'." 
2. "Thus there is symbolized here the purificatory baptism of water and the Spirit of all who are made 'kings and priests unto God.'"
3. "Through both all the king-priests have to pass in coming to God: His judgments, which overwhelm the ungodly, they stand firmly upon, as on a solid sea of glass; able like Christ to walk on the sea, as though it were solid."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An expanse spread out like a sea composed of glass: that is, that was pellucid and transparent like glass."
2. "The comparison...turns on these points: (a) that the empire of God is vast - as if it were spread out like the sea; or (b) it may be emblematic of the calmness, the placidity of the divine administration - like an undisturbed and unruffled ocean of glass."
3. "The emblem here would denote an everwatchful and observing Providence; and, in accordance with the explanation proposed above, it means that, in the administration of the divine government, everything is distinctly contemplated; nothing escapes observation; nothing can be concealed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Originally, some kind of clear, transparent stone."
2. "Crystal, regarded as a mineral, was originally held to be only pure water congealed, by great length of time, into ice harder than common."
3. "Full of eyes before and behind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the 'glassy sea' of this verse we have an emblem of that course of Providence by which God conducts those who place themselves in His hands to their final rest in His immediate presence."
2. "The different manner in which the 'sea' is viewed in the words before us, and in chap. Revelation 15:2, seems to favour this conclusion. In the one it is simply 'before the throne,' and under the eye of Him by whom the throne is occupied. It is seen from the Divine point of view, and is therefore only 'clear as crystal.' Its darker parts are to Him as bright as its more transparent elements."
3. "They are full of eyes, we are further told, before and behind: they share the attribute of God, seeing in all directions with a penetrating glance (comp. chap. Revelation 1:14), that they may the better execute the Divine purposes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Possibly from œÖŒµ (it rains), like a raindrop. At any rate here it is the appearance, not the material." 
2. "Like crystal (ŒøŒºŒøŒπŒ± Œ∫œÅœÖœÉœÑŒ±ŒªŒªœâ). Associative-instrumental case after ŒøŒºŒøŒπŒ±. Old word, from Œ∫œÅœÖŒøœÇ (ice and sometimes used for ice), in N.T. only here and Revelation 22:1, not semi-opaque, but clear like rock-crystal." 
3. "Full of eyes (Œ≥ŒµŒºŒøŒΩœÑŒ± ŒøœÜŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒºœâŒΩ). Present active participle of Œ≥ŒµŒºœâ, to be full of, with the genitive, signifying here unlimited intelligence (Beckwith), the ceaseless vigilance of nature (Swete)."

### John Gill:
1. "The world, and men of it, used not to be compared to a still and quiet sea, as this is, but to one disturbed and troubled by winds and tempests, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."
2. "And this is said to be before the throne, where the rainbow of the covenant is, of which the Gospel is a transcript."
3. "By these four living creatures, I apprehend, we are to understand the ministers of the Gospel in general, in the successive ages of the church, to whom all the characters do well agree."

### John Wesley:
1. "Both the 'seven lamps of fire' and this sea are before the throne; and both may mean 'the seven spirits of God,' the Holy Ghost; whose powers and operations are frequently represented both under the emblem of fire and of water."
2. "Their number [four living creatures], also, is symbolical of universality, and agrees with the dispensation of the gospel, which extended to all nations under heaven."
3. "The first living creature was like a lion ‚Äî To signify undaunted courage. The second, like a calf ‚Äî Or ox, to signify unwearied patience. The third, with the face of a man ‚Äî To signify prudence and compassion. The fourth, like an eagle ‚Äî To signify activity and vigor."
