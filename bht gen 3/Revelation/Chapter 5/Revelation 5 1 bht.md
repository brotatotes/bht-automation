## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The only obstacle to unsealing it was as follows, ver. 3) of Him that sat upon the throne a book (i. e., 'a roll of a book,' as in Ezek. ii. 9 f. This explanation alone will suit the meaning of the word as applied to the contemporary practice regarding sacred writings."
2. "This completeness is here set forth to us again by the mystic number seven...but no portion of the roll is actually unfolded, nor is any thing read out of the book. Not its contents, but the gradual stops of access to it, are represented by these visions."
3. "Those calamities which were involved in the seals, were all to come, before the things which were written in the book appeared and were known."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His right hand was open and on it lay the book. On God's part there was no withholding of His future purposes as contained in the book." 
2. "The roll, or book, appears from the context to be 'the title-deed of man's inheritance' redeemed by Christ, and contains the successive steps by which He shall recover it from its usurper and obtain actual possession of the kingdom."
3. "The opening of the seals will mean the successive steps by which God in Christ clears the way for the final opening and reading of the book at the visible setting up of the kingdom of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The book or roll referred to here was what contained the revelation in the subsequent chapters, to the end of the description of the opening of the seventh seal."
2. "The form of the book was undoubtedly that of a scroll or roll; for that was the usual form of books among the ancients."
3. "May it not have been intended by this arrangement to suggest the idea that the whole future is unknown to us, and that the disclosure of any one portion, though necessary if the whole would be known, does not disclose all, but leaves seal after seal still unbroken, and that they are all to be broken one after another if we would know all?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The roll is wound round a staff and fastened down to it with the seven seals. The unrolling of the parchment is nowhere indicated in the vision."
2. "With an incomparably more beautiful and powerful representation, the contents of the roll are successively symbolized by the vision which follows upon the opening of each seal."
3. "The contents of the book leap forth in plastic symbols from the loosened seal. The completeness of the divine purposes is indicated by the perfect number seven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Although God‚Äôs ‚Äòjudgments are a great deep,‚Äô His ‚Äòsecret is with them that fear Him.‚Äô"
2. "The roll is close-sealed, a strong expression, to mark the mysterious and inscrutable nature of its contents."
3. "Judgment upon the Church‚Äôs foes is the prominent idea of what the roll contains."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A book (Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ). Diminutive of Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒøœÇ, but no longer so used, Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒ±œÅŒπŒ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ occurring instead (Revelation 10:2)." 
2. "Within and on the back (ŒµœÉœâŒ∏ŒµŒΩ Œ∫Œ± ŒøœÄŒπœÉŒ∏ŒµŒΩ). 'Within and behind.' Description of a roll like that in Luke 4:17, not a codex as some scholars think." 
3. "With seven seals (œÉœÜœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒπœÉŒπŒΩ ŒµœÄœÑŒ±). Instrumental case of œÉœÜœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒπœÇ, old word used in various senses, proof or authentication (1 Corinthians 9:2; Romans 4:11), signet-ring (Revelation 7:2), impression made by the seal."

### John Gill:
1. "This book seems to have consisted of seven rolls, to which was annexed seven seals; and there being not room enough within, contrary to the common way of writing, some things were written upon the backside of the outermost roll."
2. "By this book some understand the Scriptures of the Old Testament, which were written in rolls; see Hebrews 10:5; and which came out of the right hand of God, and were given forth by him."
3. "Rather therefore the book of God's decrees is here meant, which respects all creatures, and all occurrences and events in the whole world, from the beginning to the end of time; and so Ezekiel's roll, according to the Targum on Ezekiel 2:10; which was written before and behind, signified that which was ◊û◊ü ◊©◊®◊ï◊ô◊ê, 'from the beginning', and which"


### John Wesley:

2. "But as there is upon earth something which, in its kind, answers such a representation; so there are in heaven divine counsels and transactions answerable to these figurative expressions."
3. "The book and its seals represent all power in heaven and earth given to Christ."
