### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The saints who cast their crowns before the throne do not claim themselves as kings in the sight of the great King. Their priestly access holds such dignity that their reigning on earth cannot surpass it. Although they spiritually reign now, it does not compare to the future when the prince of this world will be bound. Currently, they are treated as the lowest of the low. However, their reigning is not a future event, but rather a present reality. The dominion on earth will be given to the saints, where true religion will prevail, and the redeemed will have control over human affairs. This is the direction in which things are heading, despite the disorder and sin that currently exist.
