# Revelation 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No being, whether man or of any other order, was capable of looking upon the contents of the book and read them. This limitation extended to angels and souls in Hades, leaving no one with the power to open the scroll or comprehend its prophecies. It is implied that the cry for understanding went unanswered by the universe -- from heaven, earth, to under the earth. The restricted faculties of both angels and humans prevent them from knowing what is to come.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Not a single being, whether man, angel, or even those in Hades, possessed the ability to open the scroll and comprehend its contents. The challenge was extended to all realms of existence, yet no one, regardless of their rank or moral character, could unlock the prophecies concealed within.
