# Revelation 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, the Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered. The elders in heaven know better than the Evangelist the victory and glory of Christ.

Trust in Him, for He has overcome all obstacles and obtained the honor to bring forth God's plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Weep not: behold, the Lion which is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, conquered (the A.V., "hath prevailed to open," loses sight of the victory of Christ, and of the uniform sense in which the verb to conquer is constantly used in this book."
2. "The elders, in their triumphant place round God's throne, know better than the Evangelist, yet clothed with the infirmities of this earthly state, the nature and extent of the victory and glory of Christ."
3. "the evident design here is to set forth Christ as sprung from the tribe of Judah and lineage of David, and His victory as his exaltation through suffering, ver. 6)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The elders in heaven round God's throne know better than John, still in the flesh, the far-reaching power of Christ."
2. "He is at once 'the branch' of David, and 'the root' of David, David's Son and David's Lord, the Lamb slain and therefore the Lion of Juda: about to reign over Israel, and thence over the whole earth."
3. "His past victory over all the powers of darkness entitles Him now to open the book."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Weep not - That is, there is no occasion for tears. The object which you so much desire can be obtained. There is one who can break those seals, and who can unroll that volume and read what is recorded there."
2. "As to the first: This appellation is not elsewhere given to the Messiah, but it is not difficult to see its propriety as used in this place. The lion is the king of beasts, the monarch of the forest, and thus becomes an emblem of one of kingly authority and of power (see the notes on Revelation 4:7), and as such the appellation is used in this place."
3. "As one thus ruling over the people of God, there was a propriety that to him should be entrusted the task of opening these seals."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of the elders [ŒµŒ∫ œÑœâŒΩ œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤œÖœÑŒµœÅœâŒΩ]. Strictly, from among the elders."
2. "The Lion. See Genesis 49:9."
3. "The Root of David. See on Nazarene, Matthew 2:23."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These Elders represent the triumphant Church, which knows by happy experience the blessedness of her victory."
2. "He is ‚Äòthe lion of the tribe of Judah.‚Äô The words are from the law (Genesis 49:9), where we have the promise of the Messiah as the culminating point of the history of the leading and famous tribe of Judah."
3. "He ‚Äòovercame.‚Äô He is the Archetype and Forerunner of all them that ‚Äòovercome.‚Äô He conquered sin, death, the devil all the foes of God and man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The metaphor belongs to Jesus also."
2. "Jesus as the greatest of the tribe of Judah, 'the Root of David' or the Branch from this root."
3. "The great historical fact of the victory of the Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "behold the lion of the tribe of Judah; by whom is meant Christ, who, according to the flesh, was to come of the tribe of Judah; and certain it is, that our Lord sprang from thence: and he is said to be the lion of that tribe, in allusion to the prophecy concerning Judah in Genesis 49:9, where he is said to be a lion"
2. "Christ may be compared to one, because of his great strength, he being the mighty God, the able Saviour, and strong Redeemer, and protector of his church and people, and the avenger of their enemies"
3. "the root of David; in like manner is Christ called the root of Jesse in Isaiah 11:10; and the meaning either is, that he is a branch that springs out of the roots of Jesse and David, is David's son and offspring, according to his human nature; see Revelation 22:16; or that he is David's Lord, according to his divine nature"

### John Wesley:
1. "The victorious prince who is, like a lion, able to tear all his enemies in pieces."
2. "As God, the root and source of David's family."
3. "Hath overcome all obstructions, and obtained the honour to disclose the divine counsels."
