### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the midst (ŒµŒΩ ŒºŒµœÉœâ). See Revelation 4:6 for this idiom. It is not quite clear where the Lamb was standing in the vision, whether close to the throne or in the space between the throne and the elders."
2. "A Lamb (Œ±œÅŒΩŒπŒøŒΩ). Elsewhere in the N.T. Œø Œ±ŒºŒΩŒøœÇ is used of Christ (John 1:29; John 1:36; Acts 8:32; 1 Peter 1:19 like Isaiah 53:7), but in the Apocalypse œÑŒø Œ±œÅŒΩŒπŒøŒΩ occurs for the Crucified Christ 29 times in twelve chapters."

HœâœÇ (as if) is used because the Lamb is now alive, but (in appearance) with the marks of the sacrifice."
