### John Gill:
1. "which shows that he [the Lamb] was not a mere creature, who assumed human nature... but is truly God, and is the proper object of worship." 
2. "the prayers of the saints are compared to 'odours', or 'incense'... as incense goes upwards, so do they go up to God, and are received, regarded, and had in remembrance by him; and partly because as incense is of a sweet smell, so the prayers of the saints, put up in the name and faith of Christ, are very grateful and acceptable to God."
3. "true prayer is that which is inwrought in the soul, and comes from the heart, even from a heart pure like gold, purified by faith in the blood of Christ, a true heart, that asks in faith, nothing wavering; such as are really saints, true believers in Christ, are praying souls; they are full of prayers for themselves and others; they pray always, and for all saints."
