## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The elect (not only on earth, but under Christ's covering, and in His presence in Paradise) cry day and night to God, who will assuredly, in His own time, avenge His and their cause."
2. "The glory even of those in Paradise will only be complete when Christ's and the Church's foes are cast out, and the earth will become Christ's kingdom at His coming to raise the sleeping saints."
3. "He has them and their foes and all His creatures as absolutely at His disposal, as a master has his slaves."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "O Lord [ο δεσποτης] . See on 2 Peter 2:1. Only here in Revelation. Addressed to God rather than to Christ, and breathing, as Professor Milligan remarks, 'the feeling of Old Testament rather than of New Testament relation.'" (100 words)
2. "Judge [κρινεις] . Originally the verb means to separate; thence the idea of selection: to pick out, and so to discriminate or judge." (25 words)
3. "Avenge [εκδικεις] . Compare Luke 18:3; Romans 12:19." (10 words)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The cry is addressed to Him who is spoken of as ‘Master,’ and by whom we are most probably to understand not Christ but God."
2. "Those who are thus to be judged are then described as ‘they that dwell upon the earth;’ and by the ‘earth’ here, as almost always in the Apocalypse, is to be understood the ungodly earth: those that dwell on it are the ungodly."
3. "It may be observed that all the ungodly are included. This is allowed by the best commentators, and it supplies a strong argument in favour of what was said with regard to the number of those underneath the altar, there all the godly belonging to the time spoken of; here all the ungodly."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "How long (εως ποτε). 'Until when.'"
2. "O Master (ο δεσποτης). Nominative articular form, but used as vocative (δεσποτα) as in Revelation 4:11 (John 20:28)."
3. "The holy and true (ο αγιος κα αληθινος). See Revelation 3:7 for these attributes of God."

### John Gill:
1. "With great ardour and fervency, being very pressing and importunate..."
2. "...the soul does not sleep with the body in the grave, or is after the death of that in a state of insensibility and inactivity..."
3. "...they desire not out of any sinful or malicious affection, but that the holiness and justice of God might appear..."

### John Wesley:
1. "O Lord — The Greek word properly signifies the master of a family: it is therefore beautifully used by these, who are peculiarly of the household of God."
2. "Thou Holy One and true — Both the holiness and truth of God require him to execute judgment and vengeance."
3. "How long dost thou not judge 'He hath judged the great whore, and avenge our blood? and hath avenged the blood of his servants.'"
