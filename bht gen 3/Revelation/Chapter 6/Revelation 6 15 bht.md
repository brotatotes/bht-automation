# Revelation 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Where was now the spirit of those whom the world has so greatly feared? The mighty and strong, the great men and chief captains, will be terror-stricken, alongside the self-satisfied and complacent rich. The two extremes of society, every bondman and freeman alike, will cower, beseeching the rocks of the mountains to fall upon them, desperate to escape the wrath brought upon them. It is a humbling reminder that even those who once held power and prominence will find themselves trembling before the judgment of the Lamb.
