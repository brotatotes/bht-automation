### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Their" (Œ±œÖœÑœâŒΩ) means the wrath of God and of the Lamb put here on an equality as in Revelation 1:17; Revelation 22:3; Revelation 22:13; 1 Thessalonians 3:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:16.
2. Beckwith holds that this language about the great day having come "is the mistaken cry of men in terror caused by the portents which are bursting upon them."
3. Swete observes that the only possible answer to that cry is the command of Jesus in Luke 21:36: "Keep awake on every occasion, praying that ye may get strength to stand (œÉœÑŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒ±, the very form) before the Son of Man."

### John Gill:
1. "For the great day of his wrath is come... against the Heathen gods and Heathen persecutors, in answer to the cry of the martyrs"
2. "And who shall be able to stand? against either of them, or in their presence... expresses guilt, shame, fear, and despair."
