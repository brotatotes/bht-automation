# Revelation 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After exhausting all His ordinary judgments, the Lord's great day of judgment arrives. The tribes of the earth tremble at the signs of His imminent approach. Yet, before inflicting His blow, the elect must be gathered out. This is the great day that has come, as the mistaken cry of men in terror is a response to the bursting portents. The only answer to this cry is to keep awake and pray for strength to stand before the Son of Man. Who shall be able to endure guilt, shame, fear, and despair in the face of such a day?

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: After exhausting all His ordinary judgments of sword, famine, pestilence, and wild beasts to no avail, the Lord's great day of judgment itself finally arrives. The tribes of the earth tremble at the signs of His imminent coming, yet before He personally inflicts His blow, the elect must be gathered out. This is truly the day, the great day, that has now come. The cry of the sinners in terror is mistaken, for their only hope is to keep awake and pray to gain the strength to stand before the Son of Man. This cry is in response to the terrifying signs bursting upon them, and the only possible answer is to heed Jesus' command to be vigilant and prayerful. Ultimately, this day of wrath is a response to the cry of the martyrs and signifies the judgment against the ungodly and persecutors. The question then arises, who shall be able to stand in the face of such guilt, shame, fear, and despair?
