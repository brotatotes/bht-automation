# Revelation 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first seal in Revelation reveals Christ, either personally or through His angel, preparing for His second coming. The victorious and triumphant nature is symbolized by the white horse, much like the white horse ridden by Roman conquerors in triumphal processions. The rider wields a bow, representing strength and pointing to ultimate triumph. While attempts have been made to equate this rider with the one in Revelation 19, they only share the white horse. This seal introduces judgments against earthly opposition to Christ's reign, ultimately leading to His triumphant kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Evidently Christ, whether in person, or by His angel, preparatory to His coming again."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And thus Ovid (lib. i. de Arte) addresses Augustus, auguring that he would return a victor: â€˜Ergo erit illa dies, qua tu, Pulcherrime rerum, Quatuor in niveis aureus ibis equis.â€™ The preference of â€˜whiteâ€™ to denote triumph or victory was early referred to among the Hebrews." 
2. "If it be supposed now that John designed to represent this period of the world, could he have chosen a more expressive and significant emblem of it than occurs in the horseman of the first seal?" 
3. "The engraving below, copied from one of the basreliefs on a triumphal arch erected to Claudius Drusus on occasion of his victories over the Germans, will furnish a good illustration of this, and, indeed, is so similar to the symbol described by John, that the one seems almost a copy of the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The horse in the Old Testament is the emblem of war."
2. "The fight went most against the Greeks where Mardonius, mounted on a white horse, and surrounded by the bravest of all the Persians, the thousand picked men, fought in person."
3. "The figure is that of a great bow which is drawn only by a great exertion of strength, and by placing the foot upon it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The horse and its whiteness...expresses the fact that the Conqueror sees and strikes down His enemies from afar."
2. "The last words of the verse to conquer so clearly point to complete and permanent victory that it is difficult to limit them to any lower object than the triumphant Savior."
3. "It is His kingdom, first in Himself and then in His people, who are one with Him and in Him, that passes before the Seerâ€™s eye, a kingdom which shall yet prevail over every adversary."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "White seems to be the colour of victory like the white horse ridden by the Roman conqueror in a triumphant procession." 
2. "The aorist tense here points to ultimate victory." 
3. "Commentators have been busy identifying the rider of the white horse according to their various theories. 'It is tempting to identify him with the Rider on the white horse in Revelation 19:11, whose name is 'the Word of God' ... but the two riders have nothing in common beyond the white horse.'"

### John Gill:
1. "the ministration of the Gospel in the times of the apostles [...] may denote the purity of Gospel truths, the peace it proclaims, the joy brings, and the triumph that attends it" (97 words)
2. "the bow is the word of the Gospel, and the arrows the doctrines of it; [...] reaching to the very hearts of men; laying open the secret thoughts and iniquity thereof; wounding, and causing them to fall, and submit themselves to the sceptre of Christ's kingdom" (81 words)
3. "he went forth, conquering and to conquer; in the ministration of the Gospel, which went forth [...] to the conversion of thousands of them, and to the planting of a multitude of churches among them, and to the setting up and advancing the kingdom of Christ" (55 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "This colour, and the bow shooting arrows afar off, betoken victory, triumph, prosperity, enlargement of empire, and dominion over many people."

3. "He aimed at nothing else; he lived only to conquer."
