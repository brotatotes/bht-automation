# Revelation 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the second seal is opened, the second living being proclaims, Come and see. The omission of and see in some manuscripts emphasizes the seal being opened. Revealing a white horse and its rider, this symbolizes a departure from the conquering horse and signifies important events in God's providential governance. While the ministers under this seal may lack the strength of their predecessors, they are diligent in their preaching and patient in their suffering. The voice of the ox, lower than the lion, suggests a decrease in Gospel ministry, yet the ministers invite John to witness this vision, turning towards the west, the primary focus of this seal.
