# Revelation 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Revelation 6:6 portrays the third seal as God's merciful judgment, tempering famine with compassion. The voice heard advises against making food so scarce that a day's provision of wheat, about two or three pints, cannot be obtained for a penny, the day's wages of a laborer. While scarcity affects necessities like bread, oil and wine remain unharmed. This proclamation demonstrates God's sympathy for the sufferers, ensuring that even in the face of famine, sustenance will not completely fail.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Take care that there be thus much food for thus much price."
2. "The tendency of the voice is then to check or limit the agency of the rider on the black horse, and to provide that, notwithstanding his errand of famine, sustenance shall not utterly fail."
3. "It is the mercy of God, tempering His judgments."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A measureâ€”'A choelignix.' While making food scarce, do not make it so much so that a choelignix (about a day's provision of wheat, variously estimated at two or three pints) shall not be obtainable 'for a penny' (denarius, eight and a half pence of our money, probably the day's wages of a laborer). Famine generally follows the sword."
2. "The 'Come,' in the case of this third seal, is said by the third of the four living creatures, whose likeness is a man indicative of sympathy and human compassion for the sufferers. God in it tempers judgment with mercy."
3. "three measures of barley for a pennyâ€”the cheaper and less nutritious grain, bought by the laborer who could not buy enough wheat for his family with his day's wages, a denarius, and, therefore, buys barley."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Measure [Ï‡Î¿Î¹Î½Î¹Î¾] . Choenix. Only here in the New Testament. A dry measure, according to some, a quart; to others a pint and a half."
2. "Herodotus, speaking of the provisions for Xerxes' army, assigns a choenix of corn for a man's daily supply, evidently meaning a minimum allowance."
3. "Jowett (" Thucydides ") says that the choenix was about two pints dry measure."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This use of Ï‰Ï‚, giving a certain vagueness or mysteriousness to a phrase..."
2. "The proclamation forbids famine prices for food (solid and liquid)."
3. "Wheat and barley, oil and the vine, were the staple foods in Palestine and Asia Minor."

### John Gill:
1. "This phrase expresses such a scarcity, as that a man's daily wages would be but just enough to buy himself bread, without anything to eat with it; and when he would have nothing left for clothes, and other things, nor anything for his wife and children."
2. "And [see] that thou hurt not the oil and wine; signifying that this scarcity should fall not upon the superfluities, such as oil and wine, which may be spared, and men can live without; but upon the necessities of life, particularly bread."
3. "These may much better be applied to the Gospel, than, as they are by the Jews, to the law; who frequently say that the law is called 'oil', and speak of the 'wine of the law'."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I heard a voice â€” It seems, from God himself."
2. "Let there be a measure of wheat for a penny - The word translated measure, was a Grecian measure, nearly equal to our quart."
3. "And hurt not the oil and the wine â€” Let there not be a scarcity of everything. Let there he some provision left to supply the want of the rest."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The third seal in Revelation 6:6 reveals a rider on a black horse with a voice that checks and limits the agency of the rider. God, in His mercy, tempers judgment with compassion for the sufferers. The proclamation ensures that while food becomes scarce, it does not become so scarce that a day's provision of wheat, about two or three pints, cannot be obtained for a penny, which was the day's wages of a laborer. This scarcity does not affect the superfluities like oil and wine, but it does impact the necessities of life, particularly bread. However, there should still be some provision left to supply the want of the rest. Thus, this passage speaks not only of physical famine but also has a deeper meaning when applied to the scarcity of the Gospel.
