# Revelation 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fourth living creature, like a flying eagle, introduces this seal with high-soaring intelligence and judgment descending from on high, likened to a king of birds on his prey. It is poetic and appropriate for each of the living creatures to make a proclamation in turn. This living creature represents decline in the Gospel ministry, lacking the courage of the lion, the patience of the ox, and the prudence of the man. However, they still retain some degree of light, knowledge, sagacity, penetration, and contempt of the world symbolized by the eagle.
