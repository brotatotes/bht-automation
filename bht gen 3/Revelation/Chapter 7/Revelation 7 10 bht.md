3.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This will undoubtedly be the song of the released forever, and all who reach the heavenly world will feel that they owe their deliverance from eternal death, and their admission to glory, wholly to him."

Will they unite a created being with the Anointed One in acts of solemn adoration and praise?"
