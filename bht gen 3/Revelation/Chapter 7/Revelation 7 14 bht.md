## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I know not, but thou dost."
2. "Out of the tribulation, the great one."
3. "They washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Comparatively ignorant ourselves of divine things, it is well for us to look upward for divinely communicated knowledge."
2. "Thus this seventh chapter is a recapitulation of the vision of the six seals to fill up the outline there given in that part of it which affects the faithful of that day."
3. "Faith applies to the heart the purifying blood; once for all for justification, continually throughout the life for sanctification."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The simple meaning of the phrase 'thou knowest' is, that he who had asked the question must be better informed than he to whom he had proposed it."
2. "The object seems to have been to set before the mind of the apostle a view of those who had suffered much, and who by their sufferings had been sanctified and prepared for heaven, in order to encourage those who might be yet called to suffer."
3. "The fact is, that if that were all, such language would be unmeaning.

3. "Made them white. Compare Isaiah 1:18; Psalms 51:7; Mark 9:3."

1. "At once a confession of ignorance, and an appeal for information" (Swete), not of full confidence like œÉœÖ ŒøŒπŒ¥Œ±œÇ in John 21:15.
2. "The martyrs are still arriving from the scene of the great tribulation" (Charles).
3. "There is power alone in the blood of Christ to cleanse from sin (1 John 1:7), not in the blood of the martyrs themselves. The result is 'white,' not 'red,' as one might imagine."

### John Gill:
1. "the great tribulation, out of which they came, is not to be restrained to any particular time of trouble, but includes all that has been, is, or shall be."
2. "the blood of Christ, which cleanseth from all sin."
3. "wholly trusted to, and depended on the blood and righteousness of Christ; which is the only way to come out of tribulation, and enter the kingdom."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou knowest ‚Äî That is, I know not; but thou dost."
