## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall tend them (as a shepherd his flock), and shall guide them to the fountains of the waters of life." 
2. "God shall wipe away every tear out of their eyes." 
3. "THE LAST SEAL IS NOW OPENED, which lets loose the roll."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "in the midst of the throneâ€”that is, in the middle point in front of the throne"
2. "feedâ€”Greek, 'tend as a shepherd.'"
3. "living fountains of waterâ€”A, B, Vulgate, and CYPRIAN read, (eternal) 'life's fountains of waters.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne - notes on Revelation 5:6. He is still the great agent in promoting the happiness of the redeemed in heaven."
2. "And shall lead them unto living fountains of waters - Living fountains refer to running streams, as contrasted with standing water and stagnant pools. The allusion is undoubtedly to the happiness of heaven, represented as fresh and everflowing, like streams in the desert. No image of happiness, perhaps, is more vivid, or would be more striking to an Oriental, than that of such fountains flowing in sandy and burning wastes."
3. "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes - This is a new image of happiness taken from another place in Isaiah Isaiah 25:8, 'The Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.' The expression is one of exquisite tenderness and beauty... Yet this is to be the condition of heaven. In that world there is to be no pain, no disappointment, no bereavement."
