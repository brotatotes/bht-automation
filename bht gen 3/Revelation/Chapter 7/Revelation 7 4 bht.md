## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The import for us is, that the Lord knoweth and sealeth His own: that the fulness of their number shall be accomplished and not one shall fail."
2. "The seal contains His own Name... And thus they are not only gathered out of the world, but declared to be ready to be gathered into the city of God."
3. "And it can hardly be denied, that this view receives strong support from Scripture analogy; e.g. that of Exod. xii. and Ezek. ix., especially the latter, where the exempted ones are marked, as here, on their foreheads."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Twelve by twelve implies fixity and completeness, which is taken a thousandfold in 144,000." 
2. "A thousand implies the world perfectly pervaded by the divine."
3. "Still the Church will be that 'built on the foundation of the (Twelve) apostles (Israelites), Jesus Christ (an Israelite) being the chief corner-stone.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair interpretation seems to require that it should be understood as symbolical."
2. "The representation seems to be rather that of a comparatively small number than a large one."
3. "Salvation would be confined to no one church or denomination, but among them all there would be found true servants of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An hundred and forty and four thousand. Not literally, but the number symbolical of fixedness and full completion (12 x 12)."
2. "The interpretation of the latter class seems entitled to the greater weight.

3. "The mark of Satan which is in the forehead, is set upon all his servants without distinction of race."

2. "The number connotes perfection."

### John Gill:
1. "And therefore could be sure of the exact number, which did not depend upon his sight, and telling them, in which some mistake might have been made, but he heard the number expressed."
2. "Which is a square number arising from twelve, the square root of it, being just twelve times twelve thousand; and may denote their being the true and genuine offspring of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, holding their doctrine, and being built on their foundation."
3. "And is a certain and determinate number for an uncertain and indeterminate one; and only intends a large number of persons known to God and Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is not the number of all the Israelites who are saved from Abraham or Moses to the end of all things; but only of those who were secured from the plagues which were then ready to fall on the earth."
2. "It may be observed... this book had, in many places, a special view to the people of Israel."
