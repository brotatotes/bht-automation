## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the half-hour is the beginning of eternal rest: the commencement of that blessed sabbatical state of rest, during which the people of God shall be in full possession of those things which ear hath not heard nor eye seen." 
2. "Each course of visions is complete in itself: each course of visions ends in the accomplishment of that series of divine actions which it sets forth." 
3. "the judgments of this series of visions occur during the time of waiting."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The half hour's silence contrasts with the previous jubilant songs of the great multitude, taken up by the angels. It is the solemn introduction to the employments and enjoyments of the eternal Sabbath-rest of the people of God."
2. "The half-hour silence is the brief pause GIVEN TO JOHN between the preceding vision and the following one, implying, on the one hand, the solemn introduction to the eternal sabbatism which is to follow the seventh seal; and, on the other, the silence which continued during the incense-accompanied prayers which usher in the first of the seven trumpets."
3. "The half-hour stillness implies, too, the earnest adoring expectation with which the blessed spirits and the angels await the succeeding unfolding of God's judgments."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that on the opening of this seal, instead of voices, thunderings, tempests, as perhaps was expected from the character of the sixth seal, there was an awful stillness, as if all heaven was reverently waiting for the development."
2. "Of course this is a symbolical representation, and is designed not to represent a pause in the events themselves, but only the impressive and fearful nature of the events which are now to be disclosed."
3. "The most simple and obvious interpretation is likely to be the true one; and that is, as above suggested, that it refers to silence in heaven as expressive of the fearful anticipation felt on opening the last seal that was to close the series, and to wind up the affairs of the church and the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "When [οτε] . Read otan, the indefinite particle with the indicative mood." 
2. "Alford observes that it occurs in the opening of this seal only, giving it an indefiniteness which does not belong to any of the rest."
3. "About [ως] . A usual form of expression with John. See John 1:39; John 6:19; John 11:18."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This silence is generally supposed to relate to the cessation either of the songs of praise spoken of in chap. 7, or of the trials of the Church, which is now to enjoy a blessed period of rest."
2. "We suggest that the 'silence' alluded to refers only to the cessation of the 'lightnings and voices and thunders' of chap. Revelation 4:5."
3. "The silence of half an hour may well be understood to mean that the hour of judgment is interrupted or broken."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There came silence." 
2. "Dramatic effect by this profound stillness with no elder or angel speaking, no chorus of praise nor cry of adoration, no thunder from the throne."
3. "A temporary cessation in the revelations."

### John Gill:
1. "This space of time some think refers to the time which elapsed, while the angel, who had incense given him to offer it with the prayers of saints, did so, and took fire off the altar with his censer, and cast it on the earth: and while the seven angels had their trumpets given them, and they were preparing to sound."
2. "Rather this is to be understood of that peace and rest which the church enjoyed upon Constantine's having defeated all his enemies, when he brought the church into a state of profound tranquillity and ease; and this lasted but for a little while..."
3. "The allusion is, as in the whole of the following vision of the angel at the altar, to the offering of incense; at which time the people were removed from the temple, from between the porch and altar, to some more distant place; and the priest was alone while he offered incense, and then prayed a short prayer, that the people might not be affrighted lest he should be dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "There was silence in heaven...It was uncommon, and highly observable: for praise is sounding in heaven day and night." 
2. "Hereby the seventh seal is very remarkably distinguished from the six preceding."
3. "Silence is only a preparation: the grand point is, the sounding the trumpets to the praise of God."
