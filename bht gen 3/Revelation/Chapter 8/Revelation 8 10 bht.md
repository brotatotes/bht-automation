# Revelation 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The third plague is portrayed as a lamp or torch, representing the destructive effect of alcoholic drinks transformed into poison. This plague has the potential to annihilate a significant number of the ungodly, especially in the latter days. The absence of an instrument in this vision teaches us not to overemphasize the means by which the previous plagues occurred. A falling star symbolizes someone who has descended from a higher position, akin to a shooting meteor. Falling stars are often associated with virtuous princes who positively impact humanity. Additionally, falling stars signify war and destruction. Pelagius serves as a cautionary tale, once shining brightly but later falling into grave errors, embittering the sweet teachings of God's grace. This falling star may also allude to the Arian calamity, which gave rise to numerous heresies and eventually laid the foundation for Islam.

2. "In all languages, probably, a star has been an emblem of a prince whose virtues have shone brightly, and who has exerted a beneficial influence on mankind."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Revelation 8:10, the third plague is described as a lamp or torch, which could represent the deadly effects of alcoholic drinks that have turned into poison. This plague could have the potential to destroy a significant portion of the ungodly in the latter days. The absence of an instrument in this vision reminds us not to place too much importance on the means by which the previous plagues are brought about. A star falling from heaven could symbolize someone who had fallen from a higher station, with a character and course like a shooting meteor. Stars have often been used as emblems of virtuous princes who have had a positive impact on humanity. This imagery is used because meteors are bright, sudden, and unpredictable, inspiring fear and alarm. However, this star falling from heaven could also bring about war and destruction. It is important to note the cautionary tale of Pelagius, who initially shone with great splendor but fell into great errors, embittering the sweet doctrines of God's grace. His false interpretations of Scripture made these doctrines bitter and poisonous. The falling star could also be associated with the Arian calamity, which opened the way to many heresies and ultimately paved the path for the rise of Islam.
