# Revelation 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fallen star, representing a chief minister, loses its heavenly light and becomes a torch of earthly fire and smoky darkness, bringing bitter afflictions and transforming the sweet teachings of Scripture into deadly poison. The bitterness of wormwood, a bitter herb, mirrors the heretical teachings that change the pure waters of truth into fatal poison. This bitterness is not only physical but also spiritual, causing sorrow, distress, and death. Wormwood serves as a metaphor for idolatry, calamity, false judgment, and sorrow in the Old Testament.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The symbolizers interpret the star fallen from heaven as a chief minister... falling from his high place in the Church, and instead of shining with heavenly light as a star, becoming a torch lit with earthly fire and smouldering with smoke."
2. "Wormwood, though medicinal in some cases, if used as ordinary water would not only be disagreeable to the taste, but also fatal to life: so 'heretical wormwood changes the sweet Siloas of Scripture into deadly Marahs.'"
3. "ALFORD gives as an illustration in a physical point of view, the conversion of water into firewater or ardent spirits, which may yet go on to destroy even as many as a third of the ungodly in the latter days."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Greek word - Œ±ÃìÃÅœàŒπŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ apsinthos - denotes 'wormwood,' a well-known bitter herb. That word becomes the proper emblem of bitterness."
2. "This effect would naturally follow if any considerable portion of the fountains and streams of a land were changed by an infusion of wormwood. It is not necessary to suppose that this is intended to be literally true; for as, by the use of a symbol, it is not to be supposed that literally a part of the waters would be turned into wormwood by the baleful influence of a falling meteor, so it is not necessary to suppose that there is intended to be represented a literal destruction of human life by the use of waters."
3. "After describing the progress and the effects of this invasion (pp. 320-331) he proceeds more particularly to detail the events in the invasion of Gaul and Italy, pp. 331-347. After the terrible battle of Chalons, in which, according to one account, one hundred and sixty-two thousand, and, according to other accounts, three hundred thousand persons were slain, and in which Attila was defeated, he recovered his vigor, collected his forces, and made a descent on Italy. Under pretence of claiming Honoria, the daughter of the Empress of Rome, as his bride, 'the indignant lover took the field, passed the Alps, invaded Italy, and besieged Aquileia with an innumerable host of barbarians.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Wormwood [Œ±œàŒπŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ] . Used metaphorically in the Old Testament of the idolatry of Israel (Deuteronomy 29:18); of calamity and sorrow (Jeremiah 9:15; Jeremiah 23:15; Lamentations 3:15, Lamentations 3:19); of false judgment (Amos 5:7).


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Absinthe. Usually feminine (Œ∑), but masculine here probably because Œ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÅ is masculine."
2. "This use of ŒµŒπœÇ in the predicate with Œ≥ŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒ± is common in the LXX and the N.T."
3. "First aorist passive indicative of œÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±ŒπŒΩœâ. Old verb (from œÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒøœÇ, bitter), as in Revelation 10:9."

### John Gill:
1. "And the name of the star is called Wormwood,... Because of the bitter afflictions, sorrows, and distresses which it was the instrument of." 
2. "The third part of the waters became wormwood; that is, the inhabitants of the provinces and cities belonging to the Roman empire were afflicted with grievous and bitter afflictions and calamities."
3. "Many men died of the waters, because they were bitter; through the barbarities and cruelties of these savage people, who afflicted the empire."

### John Wesley:
1. "The unparalleled bitterness both of Arius himself and of his followers show the exact propriety of his title."
2. "A very considerable part of Afric was infected with the same bitter doctrine and Spirit."
3. "By the cruelty of the Arians."
