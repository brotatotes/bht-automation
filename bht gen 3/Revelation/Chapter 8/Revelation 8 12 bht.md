# Revelation 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A partial obscuration of light occurs, as a third part of the light is withdrawn, resulting in the darkening of the night sky. This darkening is reminiscent of the ninth Egyptian plague and signifies a calamity for the world. The obscured sun, moon, and stars serve as an emblem of great disaster and spread darkness, leaving the world in gloom. This decline in evangelical light and knowledge contributes to the rise of antichrist's dominion and leads to the downfall of the empire.

### John Gill:
1. "When the doctrine concerning the person and offices of Christ, who is the sun and light of the world, was obscured by heresies; and the discipline of the church, which, like the moon, has all its light, beauty, and order from Christ, was sadly defaced by the introduction of Jewish and Paganish rites and ceremonies; and the ministers, the stars, were drawn by the tail of the dragon, and cast to the earth, became corrupt in their principles, and carnal and sensual in their lives; so that it was a time of great darkness and gloominess, night and day."
2. "From this time there was a visible decline, as of evangelical light and knowledge, so of all kind of useful knowledge, and nothing but ignorance, stupidity, and barbarity, took place everywhere; and which were very assisting to the man of sin, antichrist, to fix and settle his dominion over the kingdoms which rose up out of the empire at this time."
3. "Jerom, who lived about the time of the first inundation of these nations, in very mournful language expresses the inhumanity and impiety of them, and the ruin they threatened the empire with; and, says w, 'The [Roman] empire is falling'."

### John Wesley:
1. "The darkness which fell on the Roman, particularly the western empire; for the stroke began long before Odoacer, namely, when the barbarians first conquered the capital city."
2. "The men that live under them, who are so overwhelmed with calamities in those days of darkness, that they can no longer enjoy the light of heaven: unless it may be thought to imply their being killed; so that the sun, moon, and stars shine to them no longer."
3. "The three last trumpets have the time of their continuance fixed, and between each of them there is a remarkable pause: whereas between the four former there is no pause, nor is the time of their continuance mentioned; but all together these four seem to take up a little less than four hundred years."
