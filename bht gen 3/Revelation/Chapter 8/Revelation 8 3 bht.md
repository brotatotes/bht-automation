## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He, in Revelation, is always designated by one of His proper titles; though, doubtless, He is the only true High Priest, the Angel of the Covenant, standing before the golden altar of incense, and there, as Mediator, offering up His people's prayers, rendered acceptable before God through the incense of His merit."
2. "Christ alone is the Mediator through whom, and to whom, prayer is to be offered."
3. "The saints' praying on earth, and the angel's incensing in heaven, are simultaneous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design seems to be, to represent the prayers of the saints as ascending in the anticipation of the approaching series of wonders in the world - and there would be a beautiful propriety in representing them as offered by an angel, feeling deep interest in the church, and ministering in behalf of the saints."
2. "The firepan, made for the purpose of carrying fire, on which to burn incense in time of worship... There seems reason to suppose that the incense that was offered in the ancient worship was designed to be emblematic of the prayers of saints."
3. "The idea seems to be, that, at this time, all the saints would unite in calling on God, and in deprecating his wrath. As the events which were about to occur were a matter of common interest to the people of God, it was to be supposed that they would unite in common supplication."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best texts read qusiasthriou, which justifies the Rev., 'over the altar.'"
2. "There seems to be no reason for changing the reference from the brazen altar..."
3. "So that the prayers and the incense might ascend together."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is distinctly pointed to as the Mediator of the prayers of the saints, and to Him all judgment is committed."
2. "Beside this altar then the angel appears standing with a golden censer. Much incense is given him that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints, so that the prayers and the incense might ascend together, a memorial before God of the trials and sufferings of His people."
3. "These prayers are obviously those of the suffering Church; and they are offered, not that she may be prepared to meet the coming judgments, but that she may hasten them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Another angel (αλλος αγγελος). Not one of the seven... This preliminary incident of the offering of incense on the altar covers verses Revelation 8:3-6." 
2. "A golden censer (λιβανωτον χρυσουν). Old word for frankincense... but here alone in N.T. and for censer, as is plain by the use of χρυσουν (golden) with it."
3. "That he should add (ινα δωσε). Sub-final clause (subject of εδοθη, was given... Unto the prayers (ταις προσευχαις). Dative case. In Revelation 5:18 the θυμιαματα are the prayers."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ himself, the Angel of the covenant, and of God's presence, is here intended, who appeared in an angelic form."
2. "And it is perpetual, or will be for ever...the intercession of Christ proceeds upon his sufferings and death: his blood and sacrifice, from whence all his pleas and arguments are taken in favour of his people, and which always prevail."
3. "The prayers of the saints, rightly performed, are themselves compared to incense, being very grateful and acceptable to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The interposing of which shows, that the prayers of the saints and the trumpets of the angels go together."
2. "Incense generally signifies prayer: here it signifies the longing desires of the angels, that the holy counsel of God might be fulfilled."
3. "The angels are fellowservants with the saints, not mediators for them."
