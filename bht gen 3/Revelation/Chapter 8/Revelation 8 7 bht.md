This invasion is akin to a thunderstorm, bringing punishment to the abusers of the elements. The devastation leaves vast areas without inhabitants, reflecting the severity of the judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In blood is life: in the shedding, or in the appearing, of blood, is implied the destruction of life, with which, as a consequence, all these judgements must be accompanied."
2. "It is this mixture of the fractional third with other designations of extent of mischief, which will lead us I believe to the right interpretation."
3. "Here, for instance, I would take the pervading third part as signifying, that though the judgment is undoubtedly, as to extent, fearful and sweeping, yet that God in inflicting it, spares more than he smites: two-thirds escape in each case, while one is smitten."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The language is evidently drawn from the plagues of Egypt, five or six out of the ten exactly corresponding: the hail, the fire, the WATER turned to blood, the darkness, the locusts, and perhaps the death." 
2. "Judicial retribution in kind characterizes the inflictions of the first four, those elements which had been abused punishing their abusers."
3. "Here, vice versa, two-thirds escape, one-third is smitten. The fire was the predominant element."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His trees, his old contemporary trees, must blaze in the conflagration of the whole country."
2. "The power of Alaric could destroy this happiness which he was not able either to taste or to bestow."
3. "No one who reads the account of the invasion of Alaric can doubt that it would be an apt description of the ravages of his arms to say that a third part was laid waste."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The hailstones and fire - balls fell in a shower of blood."
2. "And the third part of the earth was burnt up."
3. "Green."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Pharaoh, who was visited by these plagues, was always to Israel the symbol of the cruel and oppressive treatment by the world of the children of God..."
2. "The judgments of the Almighty upon Egypt, vindicating His own glory and effecting the deliverance of His people, became types of the manner in which the same great ends shall be effected in every age of the Churchâ€™s history."
3. "It is more natural to think that these objects of terror simply denote judgment in general, and that they are to be interpreted neither of classes of judgments nor of individuals of a class."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first four trumpets are very much like the plagues in Egypt, this one like a semitropical thunderstorm (Swete) with blood like the first plague (Exodus 7:17; Psalms 106:35)."
2. "The old feminine word Ï‡Î±Î»Î±Î¶Î± (hail) is from the verb Ï‡Î±Î»Î±Ï‰, to let down (Mark 2:4), in N.T. only in Revelation 8:7; Revelation 11:19; Revelation 16:21."
3. "'The storm flung itself on the earth' (Swete)."

### John Gill:
1. "Some have thought the Arian heresy is here intended, which may well enough agree with the time; and which may be compared to 'hail,' for the mischief it did to the vines, the churches; and because of the violence with which it came, and the chillness of affection to Christ and his people, which it brought on professors of religion." 
2. "The tall cedars in Lebanon; who either seemed to be such, and were infected with this heresy, and destroyed by it, as many were; or were truly such, and were greatly oppressed, afflicted, and persecuted for not embracing it."
3. "And these irruptions and devastations may be fitly expressed by hail, fire, and blood, just as the coming of the Assyrian monarch into the land of Israel is signified by a tempest of hail, and a destroying storm."

### John Wesley:
1. "There are intervals between the three woes, but not between the four first trumpets."
2. "But here hail is to be taken figuratively, as also blood, for a vehement, sudden, powerful, hurtful invasion; and fire betokens the revenge of an enraged enemy, with the desolation therefrom."
3. "Vast tracts of land were likewise left desolate and without inhabitant."
