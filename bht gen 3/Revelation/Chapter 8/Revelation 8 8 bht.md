# Revelation 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the non-consequence of the result of the fiery mass falling into the sea, we understand that the instrument of this plague is merely described as it appeared, not as it really was. It is not to be stretched to mean the maritime coasts or islands. The judgments inflicted by these first two trumpets are released after the servants of God are sealed. The fiery mass, resembling blood, represents a powerful force that brings about divine judgment and transformation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By the non-consequence of the result of the fiery mass falling into the sea is again represented to us that in the infliction of this plague from above, the instrument of it is merely described as it appeared (as it were), not as it really was."
2. "Nor again must we stretch the words 'in the sea' to mean the maritime coasts, nor the islands, nor the transmarine provinces."
3. "We may remark, at the end of this second trumpet, that the judgments inflicted by these first two are distinctly those which in ch. vii. 3 were held back until the servants of God were sealed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "as it wereâ€”not literally a mountain: a mountain-like burning mass." 
2. "the SEVEN trumpets, which end in the overthrow of all Christ's foes, and the setting up of His kingdom."
3. "A mountain-like fiery mass would not naturally change water into blood; nor would the third part of ships be thereby destroyed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A mountain is a natural symbol of strength, and hence becomes a symbol of a strong and powerful kingdom."
2. "The symbol employed here would denote some fiery, impetuous, destructive power."
3. "Resembled blood; became as red as blood."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. As it were [Ï‰Ï‚] . Not a mountain, but a fiery mass so large as to resemble one. 
Blood. Reminding of the first plague in Egypt (Exodus 7:20, Exodus 7:21).


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As if," not a great mountain, but a blazing mass as large as a mountain.
2. Somewhat like Enoch 18:13, but perhaps with the picture of a great volcanic eruption like that of Vesuvius in A.D. 79.
3. Became blood (ÎµÎ³ÎµÎ½ÎµÏ„Î¿ Î±Î¹Î¼Î±). Like the Nile in the first plague (Exodus 7:20).

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant not the devil, as some think; called a 'mountain' from his height of pride, a great one from his might and power, and a 'burning' one from his great wrath and malice against Christ, his Gospel, and his people."
2. "But rather some heresy, and, as some have thought, the Macedonian heresy, which was levelled against the deity of the Holy Spirit."
3. "Rome is very fitly represented by a great mountain, as kingdoms and cities sometimes are; seeing it was built on seven mountains; and its being taken and burnt by Alaricus is aptly expressed by a burning mountain."

### John Wesley:
1. "By the sea, particularly as it is here opposed to the earth, we may understand the west, or Europe; and chiefly the middle parts of it, the vast Roman empire."
2. "A mountain here seems to signify a great force and multitude of people."
3. "The fire may mean the fire of war, and the rage of those savage nations."
