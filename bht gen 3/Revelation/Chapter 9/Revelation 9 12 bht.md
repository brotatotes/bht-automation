# Revelation 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The interpretations of the locusts from the pit in Revelation are numerous, but none are completely satisfactory. These locusts represent the imminent judgments before Christ's second coming, which will not affect the sealed of Israel. The phrase the one woe signifies the first of two significant events that will bring sorrow to mankind. As we progress through the judgments, the magnitude deepens, demanding a more solemn observance. One woe has already passed, and there are two more to come.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The book of Revelation contains various interpretations of the locusts from the pit, and the church of God eagerly awaits the fulfillment of these visions. Past interpretations fail to fully satisfy the meaning behind these locusts, which ultimately symbolize the impending judgments on the ungodly right before Christ's second coming. These judgments are not intended for the sealed of Israel, but are confined to Palestine. The phrase the one woe denotes the first of two momentous events that will bring sorrow to mankind. As we progress through the judgments, the gravity of the situation deepens, demanding a more solemn observation. One woe has already passed, but two more remain.
