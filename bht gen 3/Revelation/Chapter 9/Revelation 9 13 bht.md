### Henry Alford:
1. "That the four horns simultaneously uttered, not a diverse, but, one and the same voice."
2. "The voice is the result of those prayers, in accordance with which those judgments are inflicted."
3. "To suppose that the cry from the altar is indicative of an altar having been the scene of some special sin on the part of the men of Roman Christendom, and so to apply it to the perversions of Christian rites in the Romish Church, is surely to confuse the whole imagery of the vision."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's revelation ... still has but one and the same voice." 
2. "The martyrs' cry for the avenging of their blood ... I prefer understanding this cry from the four corners of the altar to refer to the saints' prayerful cry from the four quarters of the world, incensed by the angel."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "suggesting that Christ continually appears in the presence of God for all the saints"
