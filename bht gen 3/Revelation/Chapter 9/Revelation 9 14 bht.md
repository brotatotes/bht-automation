# Revelation 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the four angels are loosed, it is the angel who represents and announces all that will occur under his trumpet-blowing. Whether it refers to the literal Euphrates or spiritual Babylon (Rome), these angels serve as messengers and executioners of God's judgment. The Euphrates, known as the great River, formed a natural defense for Israel against Assyria, symbolizing the disastrous divine judgments. These angels, previously restrained, are now released to bring forth God's wrath upon the Roman empire and have a profound impact in Palestine.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When the four angels are loosed, it is not the winds that are released, but rather the angel who is the representative and herald of all that will happen under his trumpet-blowing. The mention of the great river Euphrates can refer either to its literal location or to the spiritual Babylon, particularly Rome. Regardless, the angels are the messengers and executioners of God's judgment, symbolizing all that is disastrous. The Euphrates, known as the great River, was once the boundary-line of Israel and represented defense against Assyria. This visitation of judgment will have its greatest impact in Palestine, and these forces were previously restrained until this appointed time. Ultimately, these angels are agents of God's wrath upon the Roman empire.
