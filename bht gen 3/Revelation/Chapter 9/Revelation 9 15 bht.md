# Revelation 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The appointed hour occurring in the appointed day, and that in the appointed month, and that in the appointed year. The angels are prepared unto the hour appointed by God. This hour shall fall in its appointed day and month and year. All preparation over, the angels are waiting for the signal to begin. This woe brings death, not merely to hurt as in the fifth trumpet. The angels were let loose, in a state of readiness prepared by God.
