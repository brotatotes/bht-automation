# Revelation 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The armies portrayed consist of an immense number of cavalry, including possibly infernal entities, executing God's will. The staggering magnitude of this force, comparable to mentions in Psalms and Daniel, seems almost infinite and unbelievable. Likely referring to the Turks, whose army primarily comprised horsemen, the emphasis on the cavalry highlights the exceptional size of this army. There are even reports of the great Turk boasting to bring an army as numerous as the grains of wheat in a camel's load.
