# Revelation 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The power of the horses in question lies in their mouths and tails. With serpent-like tails, they inflict pain through their bites, while their mouths bring destruction. This imagery is often associated with the Turkish cavalry, symbolizing their invincible courage with lion-headed horses and representing the introduction of artillery and gunpowder through the fire and brimstone that comes from their mouths. This description likely alludes to events preceding the Lord's coming, as Satan mobilizes all the forces of hell for a final conflict. The tails, resembling serpents, entangle their victims, while their mouths bring even deadlier consequences.
