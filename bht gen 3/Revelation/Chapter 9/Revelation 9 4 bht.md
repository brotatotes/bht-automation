## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It denotes a plague which falls on the unbelieving inhabitants of the earth after the servants of God have been marked out among them, and of which the saints are not partakers."
2. "Either then it denotes something purely spiritual, some misery from which those are exempt who have peace with God,‚Äîwhich can hardly be, consistently with vv. 5, 6‚Äîor it takes place in a state totally different from this present one, in which the wheat and tares are mingled together."
3. "The fact of Mahomet‚Äôs mission being avowedly against corrupt Christianity as idolatry, does not in the remotest degree answer the conditions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their natural instinct is supernaturally restrained to mark the judgment as altogether divine."
2. "None of the saints are hurt by these locusts, which is not true of the saints in Mohammed's attack."
3. "Mohammedan invasions of Christendom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their purpose would be to vex and trouble people; not to spread desolation over vineyards, olive-yards, and fields of grain."
2. "There would be some sense in which these invaders would be characterized in a manner that was not common among invaders, to wit, that they would show particular care not to carry their devastations into the vegetable world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In one respect, indeed, there is a remarkable distinction between the ravages of the locusts mentioned here and those of the common locusts of the earth." 
2. "It was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; and the prohibition may be so given in order to bring out, more strongly than would otherwise be done, the singleness with which their rage is directed against men."
3. "Not all men, however, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads, are to be smitten by the plague; and the inference, in its bearing on the interpretation of the sealing in chap, 7, ought not to pass unnoticed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Except the men who (the very ones who)."
2. "The seal of God upon their foreheads."
3. "As Israel in Egypt escaped the plagues which punished their neighbours, so the new Israel is exempted from the attack of the locusts of the Abyss" (Swete).

### John Gill:
1. "Christ takes care of these; these are as the apple of his eye, his jewels, his sheep, his sealed ones; none shall hurt them, they shall never perish; he knows them that are his, and he will preserve them amidst fire and smoke, amidst all the corruptions and calamities in the world."
2. "...the eastern and western locusts, the Mahometans and Papists, have been very desirous of rooting out and destroying; but Christ takes care of these..."
3. "...the western locusts, the clergy of the church of Rome, had only influence over the reprobate part of mankind, and only wrought with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, who were given up to believe a lie, that they might be damned, but not upon any of the chosen ones."

### John Wesley:
1. "And it was commanded them ‚Äî By the secret power of God."
2. "Not to hurt the grass, neither any green thing, nor any tree ‚Äî Neither those of low, middling, or high degree, but only such of them as were not sealed - Principally the unbelieving Israelites."
3. "But many who were called Christians suffered with them."
