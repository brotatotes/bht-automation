## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And it was given to them (allotted to them by God as the limit of their appointed work and office: here the statement expresses rather the limitation than the extension of the grant) that they should not kill them (the unsealed), but that they (the unsealed: the subject is changed) shall be tormented five months."
2. "The reason seems to be correct, which several Commentators have given for this number being chosen: viz. that five months is the ordinary time in the year during which locusts commit their ravages."
3. "Their torment (i. e. that of the sufferers) is as the torment of (arising from) a scorpion, when it has smitten (by its bite or sting) a man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The subject changes: the first 'they' is the locusts; the second is the unsealed."
2. "Five monthsâ€”the ordinary time in the year during which locusts continue their ravages."
3. "This fifth verse and :- cannot refer to an invading army. For an army would kill, and not merely torment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that they did not kill them, but tormented them - if such a fact should be found to exist - would be in every sense a fulfillment of what is here said."
2. "Perhaps all that would be necessarily meant by this would be, not that individual people would not be killed, but that they would be sent to inflict plagues and torments rather than to take life, and that the characteristic effects of their appearing would be distress and suffering rather than death."
3. "Their torment was as the torment of a scorpion... That is, it would be painful, severe, dangerous."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They should be tormented." 
2. "The scorpion cannot strike sideways." 
3. "All accounts agree as to the fearful pain from its sting."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The killing of men is reserved for a still higher stage of judgment, under the sixth trumpet. In the meantime torment alone is to be inflicted, but that of a kind most painful and acute, as the torment of a scorpion when it striketh a man."
2. "The time during which the torment is to be inflicted is â€˜five months,â€™ and the explanation most commonly accepted is, that five months are the period of the year during which locusts commit their ravages."
3. "Five is the half of ten: it denotes a broken, imperfect, limited, shortened time. The type of the period spoken of may perhaps be found in the Deluge, which lasted for five months."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The locusts are charged to injure men, but not to kill them."
2. "The actual locust is born in the spring and dies at the end of summer (about five months)."
3. "The wound of the scorpion was not usually fatal, though exceedingly painful."

### John Gill:
1. "And thus, though the Saracens killed great numbers in the eastern empire, by their frequent incursions and ravages, and made large conquests, yet they could never destroy the empire itself, or bring it in subjection to them."
2. "The western locusts have most dreadfully tormented men by their exorbitant dues demanded of them; and by obliging them to confessions, and to attend Mass; by enjoining them whippings, fastings, pilgrimages, and penances, and with the terrors of purgatory, and the like."
3. "It signifies how troublesome and afflictive those locusts were; to be among them was to live among scorpions."

### John Wesley:
1. Not to kill them â€” Very few of them were killed: in general, they were imprisoned and variously tormented.
