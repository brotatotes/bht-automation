## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The resemblance holds good when the horse is equipped for war; the plates of the horse‚Äôs armour being represented by the hard lamin√¶ of the outer shell of the locust."
2. "I should understand the words, of the head actually ending in a crown-shaped fillet which resembled gold in its material, just as the wings of some of the beetle tribe might be said to blaze with gold and gems."
3. "Their faces were like human faces: and then comes the limitation, not in the face, but in another particular."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The plates of a horse armed for battle are an image on a larger scale of the outer shell of the locust." 
2. "ALFORD understands it of the head of the locusts actually ending in a crown-shaped fillet which resembled gold in its material."
3. "The 'as' seems to imply the locusts here do not mean men. At the same time they are not natural locusts, for these do not sting men. They must be supernatural."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The resemblance between the locust and the horse, dissimilar as they are in most respects, has been often remarked."
2. "The writer does not say either that these were literally crowns, or that they were actually made of gold. They were 'as it were' crowns, and they were like gold."
3. "They had a human countenance. This would indicate that, after all, they were human beings that the symbol described, though they had come up from the bottomless pit."

1. "The likeness of a locust to a horse, especially to a horse equipped with armor, is so striking that the insect is named in German Heupferd hay - horse, and in Italian calvaletta little horse."
2. "Not actual crowns, but as crowns. Milligan remarks that any yellow brilliancy about the head of the insect is a sufficient foundation for the figure."
3. "There is a distant resemblance to the human countenance in the face of the locust. Men [Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄœâŒΩ] is to be taken not as distinguishing sex, but in the generic sense : human faces."

1. "The horse is a warlike creature, swift, strong, and courageous."
2. "This may design the several victories and conquests which the Saracens obtained in Arabia, Persia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, Spain, and many other places."
3. "Their show of humanity, and their pretended great concern for the welfare of the souls of men, their flatteries, good words, and fair speeches, with which they deceive the simple and unwary."

### John Wesley:
1. "The appearances‚Ä¶suit a people neither throughly civilized, nor entirely savage; and such were the Persians of that age."
2. "The Persians excelled in horsemanship."
3. "Their faces are as the faces of men ‚Äî friendly and agreeable."
