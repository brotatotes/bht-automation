## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Servant must not be rendered 'slave,' nor merely 'pious worshipper:' because the former excludes the element of freewill, while the latter does not express the entire dedication to Christ."
2. "Called, and that to the very highest office, of an apostle; and even more‚Äîamong the Apostles, not one by original selection, but one specially called."
3. "These two short words announce that the Gospel is of God,‚Äîin other words, that salvation is of grace only."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word here rendered 'servant' means 'bond-servant,' or one subject to the will and wholly at the disposal of another... the apostles call themselves, in the same official sense, 'the servants of Christ,' expressing such absolute subjection and devotion to the Lord Jesus as they would never have yielded to a mere creature."
2. "He was called at one and the same time to the faith and the apostleship of Christ."
3. "the Gospel of which God is the glorious Author."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ancient custom was to begin an epistle with the name of the writer, as Cicero to Varro, etc. We record the name at the end."
2. "The name Saul was Hebrew; the name Paul was Roman. In addressing a letter to the Romans, he would naturally make use of the name to which they were accustomed, and which would excite no prejudice among them."
3. "It was of consequence for him therefore, to affirm that he had not taken this high office to himself, but that he had been called to it by the authority of Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The heathen name rises to the surface at the moment when St. Paul visibly enters on his office as the apostle of the heathen. The Roman name is stereotyped at the moment when he converts the Roman governor."
2. "The word involves the ideas of belonging to a master, and of service as a slave. The former is emphasized in Paul's use of the term, since Christian service, in his view, has no element of servility, but is the expression of love and of free choice."
3. "The Greek indicates that the writer was actually in the apostolate - a called apostle. Godet, 'an apostle by way of call.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He then adds, that he was chosen, (selectum ‚Äî selected, (15)) by which he more fully confirms the fact, that he was not one of the people, but a particular Apostle of the Lord."
2. "For I cannot agree with those who refer this call of which he speaks to the eternal election of God; and who understand the separation, either that from his mother‚Äôs womb, which he mentions in Galatians 1:15, or that which Luke refers to, when Paul was appointed for the Gentiles: but I consider that he simply glories in having God as the author of his call, lest any one should think that he had through his own rashness taken this honor to himself."
3. "We must further observe, that the office of an Apostle is the preaching of the gospel. It hence appears what just objects of ridicule are those dumb dogs, who render themselves conspicuous only by their mitre and their crook, and boast themselves to be the successors of the Apostles!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‚Äòservant‚Äô here means ‚Äòbondman,‚Äô expressing the fact that Paul personally belonged to Jesus Christ, rather than the idea of service in His behalf. Another word conveys the latter sense. Any unpleasant thought connected with the former idea is removed by the character of the Master, Jesus Christ. This term of humility and dependence is the most honorable of all titles."
2. "Here he simply asserts the fact of his apostolic dignity and authority; in writing to the Galatians, he was forced to defend his apostleship. He received the call on the way to Damascus...His setting apart at Antioch was not the call, but a formal recognition of the call on the part of the Church there, and for a special mission."
3. "Paul was selected from the world, singled out, consecrated to, and destined for the gospel service. The gospel is ‚Äòof God,‚Äô having Him as its author; it is about Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To the Romans (œÄœÅŒøœÇ Œ°œâŒºŒ±ŒπŒøœÖœÇ). This is the title in Aleph A B C, our oldest Greek MSS. for the Epistle. We do not know whether Paul gave any title at all."
2. "Paul (Œ†Œ±œÖŒªŒøœÇ). Roman name (Œ†Œ±œÖŒªœÖœÇ)."
3. "Separated (Œ±œÜœâœÅŒπœÉŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ). Perfect passive participle of Œ±œÜŒøœÅŒπŒ∂œâ for which verb see on Galatians 1:15. Paul is a spiritual Pharisee (etymologically), separated not to the oral tradition, but to God's gospel."

### John Gill:
1. "A servant of Jesus Christ"; not a servant of sin, nor of Satan, nor of man, nor of Moses and his law, nor of the traditions of the elders, but of Jesus Christ...which chiefly regards him as a minister of the Gospel.
2. "...called to be an apostle: an apostle was one that was immediately sent by Christ, and had his authority and doctrine directly from him, and had a power of working miracles from him..."
3. "The phrase used is either in allusion to the priests and Levites, who were separated from their brethren the children of Israel, to their sacred employments; or rather to the apostle's...separated to the law, but now 'to the Gospel', to preach and defend it"

### John Wesley:
1. "Called to be an apostle ‚Äî And made an apostle by that calling. While God calls, he makes what he calls."
2. "As the Judaizing teachers disputed his claim to the apostolical office, it is with great propriety that he asserts it in the very entrance of an epistle wherein their principles are entirely overthrown."
3. "Separated ‚Äî By God, not only from the bulk of other men, from other Jews, from other disciples, but even from other Christian teachers, to be a peculiar instrument of God in spreading the gospel."
