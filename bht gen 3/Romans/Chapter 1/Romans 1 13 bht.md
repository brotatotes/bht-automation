## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason of the hindrance is given in ch. xv. 20â€“22: it was, his scrupulous care to preach the gospel where it had not been preached before, rather than on the foundation of others."
2. "The meaning is not here 'wages,' or 'result of my apostolic labour,' for such is not the ordinary meaning of the word in the New Test., but fruit borne by you who have been planted to bring forth fruit to God."
3. "This fruit I should then gather and present to God; compare the figure in ch. xv. 16: see also Phil. i. 22 and note."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "hithertoâ€”chiefly by his desire to go first to places where Christ was not known."
2. "that I might have some fruitâ€”of my ministry among you also, even as among other Gentiles."
3. "The GENTILE origin of the Church at Rome is here so explicitly stated, that those who conclude, merely from the Jewish strain of the argument, that they must have been mostly Israelites, decide in opposition to the apostle himself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact...showed his strong desire to see them, and to witness the displays of the grace of God in the capital of the Roman world." 
2. "A forger of these books would not have thought of such a contrivance as to feign such a purpose to go to Rome at that time, and to have mentioned it in that manner."
3. "It was not curiosity to see the splendid capital of the world that prompted this desire; it was not the love of travel, and of roaming from clime to clime; it was the specific purpose of doing good to the souls of human beings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I would not have you ignorant." An emphatic expression calling special attention to what follows.
2. "Have some fruit." A metaphorical statement of what is stated literally in ver. 11. Not equivalent to bear fruit, but to gather as a harvest.
3. "Fruit is a favorite metaphor with Paul." He uses it in both a good and a bad sense.

### John Calvin:
1. "We hence learn that the Lord frequently upsets the purposes of his saints, in order to humble them, and by such humiliation to teach them to regard his Providence, that they may rely on it."
2. "The hinderances of the godly and of the unbelieving differ: the latter perceive only that they are hindered when they are restrained by the strong hand of the Lord, so as not to be able to move; but the former are satisfied with an hinderance that arises from some approved reason."
3. "For the godly have nothing more as their own than the work of promoting the glory of the Lord, with which is connected all their happiness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I would not have you ignorant... The progress of thought is natural."
2. "Often I purposed... such a purpose would readily be formed."
3. "That I might have some fruit... the good works produced among the Roman Christians, as fruit unto God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Oftentimes I purposed...to place, to propose to oneself."
2. "And was hindered... 'But was hindered.'"
3. "That I might have some fruit... 'might get some fruit.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle calls them brethren, because many of them were Jews, his brethren and kinsmen according to the flesh, and all of them were his brethren in a spiritual relation."
2. "It was not a sudden start of mind, or a desire that lately arose up in him, but a settled resolution and determination, and which he had often made."
3. "By fruit he means, not any reward of his labour, either temporal or eternal; but the conversion of sinners, the edification of saints, and the fruitfulness of believers in grace and works."

### John Wesley:
1. "Brethren â€” A frequent, holy, simple, sweet, and yet grand, appellation."
2. "That I might have some fruit â€” Of my ministerial labours."
3. "Even as I have already had from the many churches I have planted and watered among the other gentiles."
