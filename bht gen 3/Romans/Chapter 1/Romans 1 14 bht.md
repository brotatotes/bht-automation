## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He wishes to have some fruit, some produce of expended labour, among the Romans as among the rest of the Gentiles."
2. "the obligation laid on him to preach the gospel to them"
3. "These words must not be pressed as applying to any particular churches, or as if any one of them designated the Romans themselves,â€”or even as if wise belonged to Greeks and unwise to Barbarians."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 14, 15. I am debtor both to the
	Greeksâ€”cultivated 
	
and to the Barbariansâ€”rude.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All men, without distinction of nation or culture, are Paul's creditors, 'He owes them his life, his person, in virtue of the grace bestowed upon him, and of the office which he has received.'" (Godet)
2. "Greeks - Barbarians. Gentiles without distinction. Paul takes the conventional Greek division of all mankind into Greeks and non-Greeks."
3. "The question whether he includes the Romans among the Greeks or the Barbarians is irrelevant."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then takes an argument from his own office, and intimates that it ought not to be ascribed to his arrogance, that he thought himself in a manner capable of teaching the Romans, however much they excelled in learning and wisdom and in the knowledge of things, inasmuch as it had pleased the Lord to make him a debtor even to the wise."
2. "Two things are to be here considered â€” that the gospel is by a heavenly mandate destined and offered to the wise, in order that the Lord may subject to himself all the wisdom of this world, and make all variety of talents, and every kind of science, and the loftiness of all arts, to give way to the simplicity of his doctrine."
3. "All teachers have also a rule here which they are to follow, and that is, modestly and kindly to accommodate themselves to the capacities of the ignorant and unlearned. Hence it will be, that they will be able, with more evenness of mind, to bear with many absurdities and almost innumerable things that may disgust them, by which they might otherwise be overcome."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I am debtor. 'Paul regards the divine obligation of office, received through Christ (Romans 1:5), as the undertaking of a debt, which he has to discharge by preaching the Gospel among all Gentile nations.'" (Meyer)
2. "To Greeks and to Barbarians. The Greeks called all other peoples 'Barbarians;' the word having reference to the strange, unintelligible language... The Romans, according to the usage of those days, were not counted among the 'Barbarians,' but the Apostle probably docs not class them here at all, for at Rome were representatives of all nations and all shades of culture and ignorance. He is a debtor to all, whatever may be the distinctions of language or race." 
3. "Both to wise and to unwise. This expresses the difference of natural intelligence and cultivation in every nation... The two pairs together 'are used, apparently, merely as comprehending all Gentiles, whether considered in regard of race or of intellect; and are placed here certainly not without a prospective reference to the universality of guilt, and need of the gospel, which he is presently about to prove existed in the Gentile world.'" (Alford)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Both to Greeks and to Barbarians. The whole human race from the Greek point of view, Jews coming under barbarians."
2. "On this word see Acts 18:2; Acts 18:4; 1 Corinthians 4:11; Colossians 3:11 (only N.T. instances)."
3. "Did Paul consider the Romans as Greeks? They had absorbed the Greek language and culture."

### John Gill:
1. "I am a debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians...." 
2. "The Gospel was to be preached 'to the wise'; such who thought themselves to be so, and were so with respect to human wisdom and knowledge...."
3. "It must be preached 'to the unwise'; for such God has chosen to confound the wise; these he calls by his grace, and reveals his Gospel to, whilst he hides it from the wise and prudent...."

### John Wesley:
1. "He includes the Romans under the Greeks; so that this division comprises all nations."
2. "For there were unwise even among the Greeks, and wise even among the barbarians."
3. "I am bound by my divine mission to preach the gospel to them."
