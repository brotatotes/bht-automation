# Romans 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I am ready to fulfill my all-subduing obligation to carry the gospel to all classes of mankind, including you in Rome who hold no mean place among the Gentiles. As far as it depends on me, I am anxious to come and preach to you, but my will is subject to the will of God, who may have decreed it otherwise. The very same power is required to make men missionaries as to make them martyrs. Thus, my readiness indicates that the event depends on God.
