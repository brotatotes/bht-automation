### Albert Barnes:
1. "People should be ashamed of crime and folly. They are ashamed of their own offences, and of the follies of their conduct, when they come to reflect on it.

3. "To everyone that believeth - This expresses the condition, or the terms, on which salvation is conferred through the gospel.
