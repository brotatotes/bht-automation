# Romans 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through faith, the righteousness of God is revealed as a righteousness of faith, a peculiar kind of righteousness. It is a righteousness that God declares as righteousness and ascribes to the believer, obtained through the gospel message. The just shall live by faith, for faith leads us to God and makes our life depend on Him. This righteousness, freely reckoned to the believer, not only leads to an acquittal from guilt but also results in a change of character in the one who believes.

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the righteousness of God', is not meant the essential righteousness of God, the rectitude of his nature, his righteousness in fulfilling his promises, and his punitive justice, which though revealed in the Gospel, yet not peculiar to it; nor the righteousness by which Christ himself is righteous, either as God, or as Mediator; but that righteousness which he wrought out by obeying the precepts, and bearing the penalty of the law in the room of his people, and by which they are justified in the sight of God."
2. "This righteousness is not known by the light of nature, nor by the law of Moses; it was hid under the shadows of the ceremonial law, and is brought to light only by the Gospel; it is hid from every natural man, even from the most wise and prudent, and from God's elect themselves before conversion, and is only made known to believers, to whom it is revealed."
3. "The just shall live by faith: 'a just', or righteous man is, not everyone who thinks himself, or is thought by others to be so; nor are any so by their obedience to the law of works; but he is one that is made righteous by the righteousness of Christ imputed to him, which is before said to be revealed in the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sometimes it means that righteousness by which a man, through the gift of God, is made and is righteous; and that, both by receiving Christ through faith, and by a conformity to the essential righteousness of God."
2. "In this verse the expression means, the whole benefit of God through Christ for the salvation of a sinner."
3. "By a gradual series of still clearer and clearer promises."
