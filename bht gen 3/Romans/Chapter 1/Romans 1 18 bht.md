## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The necessary condition of this revelation is, the DESTRUCTION of the righteousness of MAN by the revelation of God‚Äôs anger against sin."
2. "Unrighteousness is the state of the thoughts and feelings and habits, induced originally by forgetfulness of God, and in its turn inducing impieties of all kinds."
3. "Men had knowledge of God sufficient, if its legitimate work had been allowed, to have kept them from such excesses of enormity as they have committed, but that this truth they held down, or back, in unrighteousness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But before enumerating their actual iniquities, he goes back to the origin of them all, their stifling the light which still remained to them."
2. "As darkness overspreads the mind, so impotence takes possession of the heart, when the 'still small voice' of conscience is first disregarded, next thwarted, and then systematically deadened."
3. "Thus 'the truth' which God left with and in men, instead of having free scope and developing itself, as it otherwise would, was obstructed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'divine displeasure' or 'indignation,' therefore, expresses the meaning of this phrase; see Matthew 3:7; Luke 3:7; Luke 21:23; John 3:36; Romans 2:5, Romans 2:8; Romans 3:5; Romans 4:15; Romans 5:9; Romans 9:22; Romans 12:19; Romans 13:4-5; Ephesians 2:3; Ephesians 5:6; 1Th 1:10; 1 Thessalonians 2:16, etc."
2. "As they were determined to practice iniquity, they chose to exclude the knowledge of a pure God, and to worship impure idols, by which they might give a sanction to their lusts."
3. "There is nothing that prevents the universal spread and influence of truth but sin. And people of wickedness are answerable for all the ignorance and wo which are spread over the community, and which have extended themselves over the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The wrath of God [ŒøœÅŒ≥Œ∑ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ] . Not punishment, but the personal emotion."
2. "Ungodliness and unrighteousness [Œ±œÉŒµŒ≤ŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ±Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒπŒ±ŒΩ] . Irreligiousness and immorality."
3. "The truth. Divine truth generally, as apparent in all God 's self - revelations."

### John Calvin:
1. "And he brings, as the first proof of condemnation, the fact, ‚Äî that though the structure of the world, and the most beautiful arrangement of the elements, ought to have induced man to glorify God, yet no one discharged his proper duty: it hence appears that all were guilty of sacrilege, and of wicked and abominable ingratitude."
2. "But as the flesh will not willingly humble itself so far as to assign the praise of salvation to the grace of God alone, Paul shows that the whole world is deserving of eternal death. It hence follows, that life is to be recovered in some other way, since we are all lost in ourselves."
3. "They rushed headlong...into impiety against God and into injustice against one another, not through ignorance, but knowingly, not through weakness, but willfully and maliciously: and this the Apostle expresses by a striking metaphor, taken from tyrants, who, against right and justice, oppress the innocent, bind them in chains, and detain them in prison."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The wrath of God, the reality of which is indisputable as the very presupposition of the work of atonement, is the love of the holy God (who is neither neutral nor one-sided in His affection) for all that is good in its energy as antagonistic to all that is evil."
2. "Hence the revelation is an outward one, not that accomplished through the gospel."
3. "God‚Äôs wrath is against every form of irreligiousness and immorality; the two words distinguishing sin with respect to God and the law of right He has established."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For the wrath of God is revealed... It is the temper of God towards sin, not rage, but the wrath of reason and law (Shedd)." 
2. "The basis of ethical conduct rests on the nature of God and our attitude toward him, otherwise the law of the jungle (cf. Nietzsche, 'might makes right')." 
3. "Truth is out in the open, but wicked men... 'hold it down in unrighteousness.' Their evil deeds conceal the open truth of God from men."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the wrath of God' is meant the displicency and indignation of God at sin and sinners; his punitive justice, and awful vengeance; the judgments which he executes in this world; and that everlasting displeasure of his, and wrath to come in another world."
2. "This wrath of God is revealed in the law, it is known by the light of nature, and to be perceived in the law of Moses, and may be observed in the Scriptures, where are many instances and examples of divine wrath and displeasure."
3. "All ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men; that is, all ungodly and unrighteous men; or all men who are guilty of ungodliness, the breach of the first table of the law, which respects the worship of God, and of unrighteousness, the breach of the second table of the law, which regards our neighbours' good."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having laid down his proposition, the apostle now enters upon the proof of it."
2. "The wrath of God is revealed - Not only by frequent and signal interpositions of divine providence, but likewise in the sacred oracles, and by us, his messengers."
3. "Who detain the truth - For it struggles against their wickedness."
