## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This good tidings is no new invention, no after-thought‚Äîbut was long ago announced in what God‚Äôs prophets wrote concerning His Son." 
2. "‚Ä¶announced by way of promise, so that God stood pledged to its realization."
3. "Since the charge of bringing in novelties was brought against the Gospel, he shews that it was older than the Greeks, and long ago shadowed out in the prophets."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though the Roman Church was Gentile by nation, yet as it consisted mostly of proselytes to the Jewish faith, they are here reminded that in embracing Christ they had not cast off, but only the more profoundly yielded themselves to, Moses and the prophets." 
2. "They had not cast off, but only the more profoundly yielded themselves to, Moses and the prophets."
3. "In embracing Christ they had not cast off, but only the more profoundly yielded themselves to, Moses and the prophets."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He wished to show them, and the remainder of his countrymen, that the Christian religion was built on the foundation of their prophets, and their acknowledged writings."
2. "He had never been at Rome. He was therefore personally a stranger, and it was proper for him then especially to show his regard for the doctrines of the prophets."
3. "If these things were promised - predicted in the Old Testament, then Christianity is true. Every passage which he adduces is therefore proof that it is from God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul's Old Testament training is manifest."
2. "Naturally, in beginning the more precise description of the new revelation, he refers first to its connection with ancient prophecy."
3. "The scriptures would require the article. Here again the absence of the article denotes the qualitative character of the phrase - books which are holy as conveying God's revelations."

### John Calvin:
1. "He confirms the faith of the gospel by antiquity; as though he said, 'Christ came not on the earth unexpectedly, nor did he introduce a doctrine of a new kind and not heard of before, inasmuch as he, and his gospel too, had been promised and expected from the beginning of the world.'"
2. "We may learn from this passage what the gospel is: he teaches us, not that it was promulgated by the Prophets but only promised. If then the Prophets promised the gospel, it follows, that it was revealed, when our Lord was at length manifested in the flesh."
3. "They are then mistaken who confound the promises with the gospel, since the gospel is properly the appointed preaching of Christ as manifested, in whom the promises themselves are exhibited."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It must be God‚Äôs gospel, for He had already promised it, and this thought would have force with the Gentile Christians as well as the Jews."
2. "The 'prophets' are not here distinguished from the other Old Testament writers."
3. "The gospel, Paul implies, though new, is yet old."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He promised afore (œÄœÅŒøŒµœÄŒ∑Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒπŒªŒ±œÑŒø). First aorist middle of œÄœÅŒøŒµœÄŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒªœâ"
2. "By (Œ¥ŒπŒ±). Through, by means of, intermediate agency like Matthew 1:22 which see."
3. "Paul definitely finds God's gospel in the Holy Scriptures."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel is here further commended from the antiquity it: it was no novel doctrine, an upstart notion, but what God had conceived in his own breast from eternity."
2. "This mystery was hid in him from the beginning of the world, and was ordained before the world was; in time God was pleased to make it known to the sons of men."
3. "The apostle speaks in the language of his nation, for the Jews frequently call the Bible, writings, Holy Ones; 'for', say they, ◊õ◊ú ◊õ◊™◊ï◊ë◊ô◊ù ◊ß◊ì◊©, 'all the Scriptures are holy'."

### John Wesley:
1. Which he promised before ‚Äî Of old time, frequently, solemnly. And the promise and accomplishment confirm each other. Deuteronomy 18:18; Isaiah 9:6,7; 53:1; 61:1; Jeremiah 23:5.
