The revelation of God's power and divinity is given so that, if enlightened, individuals may be without defense if they choose to fall into sin. Recognizing and understanding God's divine nature through His visible creation is essential for all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression â€˜his invisible thingsâ€™ refers to those things which cannot be perceived by the senses. It does not imply that there are any things pertaining to the divine character which may be seen by the eye; but that there are things which may be known of him, though not discoverable by the eye."
2. "The affirmation extends only to that; and the argument implies that that was enough to leave them without any excuse for their sins."
3. "And especially how true and fearful is this, respecting that great multitude in Christian lands who have the Bible, and who never read it; who are within the reach of the sanctuary, and never enter it; who are admonished by friends, and by the providences of God, and who regard it not; and who look upon the heavens, and even yet see no proof of the eternal power and Godhead of him who made them all!"

### John Calvin:
1. "God is in himself invisible; but as his majesty shines forth in his works and in his creatures everywhere, men ought in these to acknowledge him, for they clearly set forth their Maker."
2. "We conceive that there is a Deity; and then we conclude, that whoever he may be, he ought to be worshipped: but our reason here fails, because it cannot ascertain who or what sort of being God is."
3. "This knowledge of God, which avails only to take away excuse, differs greatly from that which brings salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since the creation of the world... the mode of clearly seeing the invisible attributes of God is the perception of them through the visible things which He has made."
