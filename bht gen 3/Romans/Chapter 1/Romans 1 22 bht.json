These words are not only directed at the ancient Greek philosophers, but also speak to the vanity and pride of humanity throughout history. It is characteristic of moral and religious error that people take credit for it and exalt it as wisdom, even idolizing false gods along the way. This arrogance is a grotesque attempt to present a distorted image of the divine. The more societies advance in philosophy and refinement, the more their systems of religion often degrade into foolishness. Rather than recognizing and upholding the truth, they embraced self-wisdom, rendering themselves truly foolish. It is a tragic irony that pride comes not from recognizing their own shortcomings and seeking humility, but from their very shame.",
