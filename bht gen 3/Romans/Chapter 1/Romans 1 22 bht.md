## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "While they professed themselves wiseâ€”professing themselves to be wise." 
2. "The words relate perhaps not so much to the schools of philosophy, as to the assumption of wisdom by the Greeks in general."
3. "Their philosophers were indeed eminent, but not the only examples."

2. "Professing themselves wise, they became fools."
3. "The heathen."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Professing themselves to be wise - This was the common boast of the philosophers of antiquity. The very word by which they chose to be called, 'philosophers,' means literally 'lovers of wisdom.'" 
2. "They became fools - They became really foolish in their opinions and conduct. There is something particularly pungent and cutting in this remark, and as true as it is pungent." 
3. "Sinners of all kinds are frequently spoken of as fools in the Scriptures...as void of understanding or moral sense; as idolaters, and as wicked."

### John Calvin:

1. "Professing themselves to be wise...This has reference, not to heathen philosophers, but to the conceit of wisdom which lay back of heathenism itself."
2. "Their folly was manifested in their idolatry...the self-wisdom rendering them foolish, and idolatry in its train."
3. "Heathenism is not the primeval religion, from which man might gradually have risen to the knowledge of the true God, but is, on the contrary, the result of a falling away from the known original revelation of the true God in His works."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Empty reasonings as often today."
2. "An oxymoron or sharp saying, true and one that cuts to the bone."
3. "Paul shows indignant contempt for these grotesque efforts to present pictures of a deity that had been lost."

### John Gill:
1. "Professing themselves to be wise...they became fools."
2. "They appeared to be so; they showed themselves to be such in those very things they prided themselves with the knowledge of."
