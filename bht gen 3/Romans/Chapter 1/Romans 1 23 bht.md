# Romans 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this depiction, humanity exchanged the uncorruptible glory of God, seen in his power and majesty evident in creation, for corruptible images. By lowering their understanding and worshiping human beings and even reptiles, they descended into debasing and foolish conceptions of the Supreme Being. Throughout religious history, there has been a consistent struggle to rise from the lowest forms of nature worship to a more rational and spiritual understanding of God. However, it is a grave indignity to form such inadequate notions of God's majesty that we dare to create images of him.
