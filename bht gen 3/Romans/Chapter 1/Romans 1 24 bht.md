# Romans 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As sin begets sin, and darkness of mind deeper darkness, grace gives place to judgment, and the divine wrath hardens men, and hurries them on to more fearful degrees of depravity. This divine abandonment of men traced in three successive stages at each of which the same word is used. God, in turn, deserted them; not giving them divine laws, and allowing them to corrupt those which were human. He let them do what they pleased, even what was in the last degree vile, that those who had not honored God might dishonor themselves.
