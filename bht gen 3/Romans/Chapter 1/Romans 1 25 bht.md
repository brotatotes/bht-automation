# Romans 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The truth of God which was professed, was changed into a falsehood, robbing it of its power. This dishonorable act is condemned, as the worship of the creature surpassed the Creator. The guilt of the Church of Rome, who shamelessly commits these acts under the pretext of worship, exceeds that of the heathen. The doxology expressed by Paul reflects his horrified reaction. This sin should serve as a reminder to us to honor and worship only God, as recognizing creatures devalues His glory, resulting in a lamentable exchange.
