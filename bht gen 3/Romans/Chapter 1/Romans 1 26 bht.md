# Romans 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The degradation of sex is what Paul here notes as one of the results of heathenism, as they abandoned themselves to passions of dishonor and changed the natural use into that which is against nature. This vice consumed and exhausted them, leading to a state where they were even more degraded than beasts themselves. Such shameful and disgraceful acts were prevalent in their culture, as the evidence can be found in the writings of heathen authors. It is no wonder that the cry for salvation pierced the hearts of missionaries, who were not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.

2. "Either by prostituting themselves to, and complying with the 'sodomitical' embraces of men, in a way that is against nature."
3. "Or by making use of such ways and methods with themselves, or other women, to gratify their lusts, which were never designed by nature for such an use."
