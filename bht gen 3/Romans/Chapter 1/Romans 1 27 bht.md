1. "The Apostle treats this degradation into which they fell, as a consequence of, a retribution for, their departure from God into idolatry."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Turned (ÎµÎ¾ÎµÎºÎ±Ï…Î¸Î·ÏƒÎ±Î½). First aorist passive indicative, causative aorist, of ÎµÎºÎºÎ±Î¹Ï‰, old verb, to burn out, to set on fire, to inflame with anger or lust. Here only in N.T."
