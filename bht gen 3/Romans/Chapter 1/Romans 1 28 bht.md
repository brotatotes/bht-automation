## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "Because they reprobated the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, is indeed a very inadequate, but as far as the form of the two words is concerned, an accurate representation of it."
2. "God withdrew from them His preventing grace, and left them to the evil which they had chosen."
3. "The order of crimes enumerated would be broken, and one of a totally different kind inserted between slanderers and insolent, if this word is to signify â€˜haters of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not because they could not, but because they were displeased with God, and chose to forsake him, and follow their own passions and lusts."

### John Calvin:
1. "As they chose not to continue in the knowledge of God, which alone guides our minds to true wisdom, the Lord gave them a perverted mind, which can choose nothing that is right."
2. "He then intimates, that they, making a depraved choice, preferred their own vanities to the true God; and thus the error, by which they were deceived, was voluntary."
3. "Understand him as saying, that they were inconsistent with every decision of reason, and alien to the duties of men: for he mentions it as an evidence of a perverted mind, that men addicted themselves, without any reflection, to those vices, which common sense ought to have led them to renounce."
