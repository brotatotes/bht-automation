## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is scarcely necessary to show that this was common among the Gentiles."
2. "The fondness for this bloody spectacle continued until the reign of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, by whom they were abolished about six hundred years after the original institution."
3. "Whisperers - Those who secretly, and in a sly manner, by hints and inuendoes, detract from others, or excite suspicion of them."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word (nequitia) then means practiced wickedness, or licentiousness in doing mischief: but maliciousness (malitia) is that depravity and obliquity of mind which leads us to do harm to our neighbour."
2. "For the word œÄŒøœÅŒΩŒµ·Ω∑Œ±ŒΩ, which Paul uses, I have put lust (libidinem). I do not, however, object, if one prefers to render it fornication; but he means the inward passion as well as the outward act."
3. "We have rendered Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøŒ∑Œ∏Œµ·Ω∑Œ±ŒΩ, perversity (perversitatem ;) which is a notorious and uncommon wickedness; that is, when a man, covered over, as it were, with hardness, has become hardened in a corrupt course of life by custom and evil habit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Being filled with all unrighteousness."
2. "Covetousness; this sin is emphasized in the New Testament."
3. "Murder. The similarity in sound of the original words may have led to the mention of this sin first here; but ‚Äòenvy‚Äô and ‚Äòmurder‚Äô are related."

### John Gill:
1. "They were 'filled with all unrighteousness'. This word includes in it all manner of sin and wickedness in general; fitly expresses the condition of fallen men, destitute of a righteousness; designs every violation of the law respecting our neighbour; and is opposed to that vain conceit of righteousness which these men had."
2. "covetousness; this may intend every insatiable lust, and particularly the sin which goes by this name, and is the root of all evil"
3. "whisperers; who made mischief among friends, by privately suggesting, and secretly insinuating things into the mind of one to the prejudice of another."

### John Wesley:
1. "Filled with all injustice ‚Äî This stands in the first place; unmercifulness, in the last."
2. "Fornication ‚Äî Includes here every species of uncleanness."
3. "Maliciousness ‚Äî The Greek word properly implies a temper which delights in hurting another, even without any advantage to itself."
