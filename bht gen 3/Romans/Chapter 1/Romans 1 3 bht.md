## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is more natural than (as is done in the A.V.) to bind these words to 'the Gospel of God,' which went before."
2. "Christ, the Son of God, is the great subject of the good news."
3. "The words of the seed of David cast a hint back at the promise just spoken of."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lordâ€”the grand burden of this 'Gospel of God.'" 
2. "Made of the seed of Davidâ€”as, according to 'the holy scriptures,' He behooved to be." 
3. "According to the fleshâ€”that is, in His human nature... implying, of course, that He had another nature, of which the apostle immediately proceeds to speak."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The gospel of God concerning his Son. The design of the gospel was to make a communication relative to his Son Jesus Christ. This is the whole of it. There is no 'good news' to man respecting salvation except what comes by Jesus Christ."
2. "He was a descendant of David. David was perhaps the most illustrious of the kings of Israel. The promise to him was that there should not fail a man to sit on this throne...As the Jews universally believed that the Messiah would be descended from David...it was of great importance for the sacred writers to make it out clearly that Jesus of Nazareth was of that line and family."
3. "And when, therefore, it is applied to Jesus Christ, it implies, if language has any meaning, that there was a sense in which Jesus was not descended from David. What that was, appears in the next verse."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Concerning His son. Connect with promised afore. Christ is the great personal object to which the promise referred.


### John Calvin:
1. "This is a remarkable passage, by which we are taught that the whole gospel is included in Christ, so that if any removes one step from Christ, he withdraws himself from the gospel."
2. "We hence learn, that he who has made a due proficiency in the knowledge of Christ, has acquired everything which can be learned from the gospel."
3. "Paul does further by these words not only declare that Christ had real flesh, but he also clearly distinguishes his human from his divine nature."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Godâ€™s previous promise in the Old Testament was concerning His Son. That promise was fulfilled in the gospel." 
2. "Though He was the Son of God, it was necessary for the fulfilment of the Messianic promises that He should appear as man, hence He was born."
3. "Were He a mere man, it had been enough to say that He was of the seed of David; but as He is more than man, it was necessary to limit His descent from David to His human nature."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Just as Jesus found himself in the O.T. (Luke 24:27; Luke 24:46). The deity of Christ here stated."
2. "His real humanity alongside of his real deity."
3. "For the descent from David see Matthew 1:1; Matthew 1:6; Matthew 1:20; Luke 1:27; John 7:42; Acts 13:23, etc."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, as the Son of God, the Saviour of sinners, the only Mediator between God and men, who is Lord both of the dead and living, is the sum and substance of the Gospel." 
2. "He is here described by his relation to God, his Son, of the same nature with him, equal to him, and distinct from him."
3. "Christ in his human nature, who was made flesh, and of a woman; and shows his existence before his incarnation, and the immediate power and hand of God in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who was of the seed of David according to the flesh â€” That is, with regard to his human nature."
2. "Both the natures of our Saviour are here mentioned; but the human is mentioned first, because the divine was not manifested in its full evidence till after his resurrection."
3. "The divine was not manifested in its full evidence till after his resurrection."
