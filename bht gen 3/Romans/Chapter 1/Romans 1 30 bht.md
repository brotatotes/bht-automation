## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God-hated...expressing the detestableness of their character in His sight." 
2. "The active sense of the word, adopted in our version and by the majority of expositors, though rarer, agrees perhaps better with the context."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whisperers declare secretly, and with great reserve, the supposed faults of others. Backbiters proclaim them publicly and avowedly."
2. "To an awakened sinner there is often nothing more plain and painful than that he is a hater of God."
3. "It is an inordinate self-esteem; an unreasonable conceit of one’s superiority in talents, beauty, wealth, accomplishments, etc. (Webster). Of the existence of this everywhere, there is abundant proof."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those, then, are designated, who hate God, whose justice they seem to resist by doing wrong." 
2. "Whisperers and slanderers are to be thus distinguished; the former, by secret accusations, break off the friendships of good men, inflame their minds with anger, defame the innocent, and sow discords." 
3. "Haughty are they who swell with the empty wind of overweeningness. Unsociable are those who, by their iniquities, unloose the bands of society."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Leaving the word in its strict signification, hated of God, we recognize in it a summary judgment of moral indignation respecting all the preceding particulars; so that, looking back on these, it forms a resting-point in the disgraceful catalogue." 
2. "If any crime was known more than another, as 'hated by the gods,' it was that of informers, abandoned persons who circumvented and ruined others by a system of malignant espionage and false information."
3. "Apostasy from the piety and affection due to parents is a fountain of corruption."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Whisperers (ψιθυριστας). Old word from ψιθυριζω, to speak into the ear, to speak secretly, an onomatopoetic word like ψιθυρισμος (2 Corinthians 12:20) and only here in N.T."
2. "Insolent (υβριστας). Old word for agent from υβριζω, to give insult to, here alone in N.T. save 1 Timothy 1:13."
3. "Inventors of evil things (εφευρετας κακων). Inventors of new forms of vice as Nero was. Tacitus (Ann. IV. ii) describes Sejanus as facinorum omnium repertor and Virgil (Aen. ii. 163) scelerum inventor."

### John Gill:
1. "Backbiters,.... Who more publicly defamed the characters of their neighbours, and hurt their good name, credit and reputation, though behind their backs..."
2. "haters of God;... they were deniers of the being and providence of God, and showed themselves to be enemies to him by their evil works"
3. "disobedient to parents; which was acting contrary to the light of nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whisperers — Such as secretly defame others."
2. "Backbiters — Such as speak against others behind their back."
3. "Inventors of evil things — Of new pleasures, new ways of gain, new arts of hurting, particularly in war."
