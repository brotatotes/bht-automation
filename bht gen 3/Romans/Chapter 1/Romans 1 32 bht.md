## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle advances to the highest grade of moral abandonment,â€”the knowledge of Godâ€™s sentence against such crimes, united with the contented practice of them, and encouragement of them in others."
2. "The description here given by the Apostle of the moral state of the heathen world should by all means be compared with that in Thucydides, at the end of his third book, of the moral state of Greece at the end of the fourth year of the Peloponnesian war."
3. "'Life and Death,' remarks Umbreit, 'are ever set over against one another in the Old as well as in the New Testament, the one as including all good that can befall us, the other, all evil.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This settled and unblushing satisfaction at the practice of them, apart from all the blinding effects of present passion, must be regarded as the darkest feature of human depravity."
2. "We must not magnify the supernatural revelation which God has been pleased to make of Himself, through Abraham's family to the human race, at the expense of that older, and, in itself, lustrous revelation which He has made to the whole family of man through the medium of their own nature and the creation around them."
3. "To take pleasure in what is sinful and vicious for its own sake, and knowing it to be such, is the last and lowest stage of human recklessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A monstrous contest of abandoned wickedness is carried on. The lust of sin increases daily; and shame is daily more and more extinguished. Discarding respect for all that is good and sacred, lust rushes on wherever it will. Vice no longer hides itself. It stalks forth before all eyes." 
2. "After all that infidels and deists have said of the sufficiency of natural religion, yet here is the sad result. This shows what man can do, and these facts will demonstrate forever that there was need of some other religion than that furnished by the light of nature."
3. "If this be the state of the world, and if Christianity, as all Christians believe, contains the remedy for all these evils, then it is wisdom and benevolence to send it to them. And it is not wisdom or benevolence to withhold it from them. Believing as they do, Christians are bound to send the gospel to the pagan world."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it is the summit of all evils, when the sinner is so void of shame, that he is pleased with his own vices, and will not bear them to be reproved, and also cherishes them in others by his consent and approbation." 
2. "For he who is ashamed is as yet healable; but when such an impudence is contracted through a sinful habit, that vices, and not virtues, please us, and are approved, there is no more any hope of reformation." 
3. "The Apostle meant here to condemn something more grievous and more wicked than the very doing of vices: what that is I know not, except we refer to that which is the summit of all wickedness, â€” that is, when wretched men, having cast away all shame, undertake the patronage of vices in opposition to the righteousness of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their conscience gave such knowledge."
2. "The heathen recognized that sin must be punished, and Paul indicates that the punishment is â€˜death,â€™ by which he usually meant (whatever the heathen understood) eternal death."
3. "This is the sign of completed moral abandonment; they fail even to condemn it in others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The heathen knows that God condemns such evil practices."
2. "It is a tragedy of American city government that so many of the officials are proven to be hand in glove with the underworld of law-breakers."

### John Gill:
1. "They sinned against light and knowledge, with approbation and good liking of their own sins, and took pleasure in the sins of others."
2. "The insufficiency of the light of nature to guide persons in the way of salvation."
3. "How impossible it is that such men should ever be justified before God, by any works of seeming righteousness done by them."

### John Wesley:
1. "A man may be hurried by his passions to do the thing he hates; but he that has pleasure in those that do evil, loves wickedness for wickedness' sake."
2. "And hereby he encourages them in sin, and heaps the guilt of others upon his own head."
3. "This is the highest degree of wickedness."
