## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But the Apostle, dwelling here on patent facts,â€”the announcements of prophecy,â€”the history of the Lordâ€™s Humanity, does not deal with the essential subsistent Godhead of Christ, but with that manifestation of it which the great fact of the Resurrection had made to men."
2. "The rendering then is, which was with power declared to be the Son of God."
3. "The Spirit of holiness is not equivalent to 'the Holy Spirit:' this epithet would be inapplicable here, for it would point out the Third Person in the Blessed Trinity, whereas it is the Spirit of Christ Himself, in distinction from His Flesh, which is spoken of."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He 'was MADE of the seed of David, according to the flesh'; but He was not made, He was only 'declared [or proved] to BE the Son of God.'"
2. "By His birth in the flesh, that Sonship, which was essential and uncreated, merely effloresced into palpable manifestation."
3. "Declared to be the Son of God in possession of that 'power' which belonged to Him as the only-begotten of the Father, no longer shrouded as in the days of His flesh, but 'by His resurrection from the dead' gloriously displayed and henceforth to be forever exerted in this nature of ours."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The act of raising him from the dead designated him, or constituted him the Son of God. It was such an act as in the circumstances of the case showed that he was the Son of God in regard to a nature which was not 'according to the flesh.'"
2. "The natural idea of the phrase, 'Son of God,' therefore is, that he sustained a relation to God in his nature which implied more than was human or angelic; which implied equality with God."
3. "The phrase 'Son of God' stands in contrast with the title 'Son of man,' and as the natural and obvious import of that is that he was a man, so the natural and obvious import of the title 'Son of God' is that he was divine; or that he sustained relations to God designated by the name Son of God, corresponding to the relations which he sustained to man designated by the name Son of Man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The idea is that of Christ's instatement or establishment in the rank and dignity of His divine sonship with a view to the conviction of men."
2. "He was declared or instated mightily; in a striking, triumphant manner, through His resurrection."
3. "The reference is not to the Holy Spirit, who is nowhere designated by this phrase, but to the spirit of Christ as the seat of the divine nature belonging to His person."

### John Calvin:
1. "The power, by which he was raised from the dead, was something like a decree by which he was proclaimed the Son of God."
2. "Christ was declared the Son of God by openly exercising a real celestial power, that is, the power of the Spirit, when he rose from the dead."
3. "He gained victory over death, not by aid sought from another, but by the celestial operation of his own Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Who was installed, or, â€˜declared,â€™ the Son of God."
2. "The two allowable meanings are: (1) instated or installed; (2) declared, manifested, etc."
3. "This is evidently in contrast with â€˜according to the flesh,â€™ and must set forth that side of the person of Christ wherein He differs absolutely from those who are only human."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was the Son of God in his preincarnate state and still so after his Incarnation, but it was the Resurrection of the dead that definitely marked Jesus off as God's Son..."
2. "The Resurrection of Christ is the miracle of miracles. 'The resurrection only declared him to be what he truly was.'"
3. "The Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î± Î±Î³Î¹Ï‰ÏƒÏ…Î½Î·Ï‚, though not the Divine nature, is that in which the Divinity or Divine Personality Resided."

### John Gill:
1. "he, the Son of God, who existed as such, from everlasting, was manifested in the flesh, or human nature"
2. "the power of Christ in raising the dead...clearly made it appear that he was the Son of God, a divine person, truly and properly God"
3. "the Spirit of holiness may be meant the divine nature of Christ, which...must be a clear and strong proof of his being truly the Son of God"

### John Wesley:
1. "But powerfully declared to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit of Holiness." 
2. "According to his divine nature."
3. "The resurrection from the dead...is both the fountain and the object of our faith."
