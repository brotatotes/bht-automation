## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "beloved of God, called to be saints] Both these clauses refer to all the Christians addressed."
2. "No such distinction would be in place in an exordium which anticipates the result of the Epistle‚Äîthat Jew and Gentile are one in guilt, and one in Christ."
3. "from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ] God is the Giver of grace and peace,‚ÄîChrist the Imparter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nothing speaks more decisively for the divinity of Christ than these juxtapositions of Christ with the eternal God, which run through the whole language of Scripture..." 
2. "He only, in whom the Word of the Father who is Himself God became flesh, may be named beside Him for men are commanded to honor Him even as they honor the Father..." 
3. "The name of no man can be placed by the side of the Almighty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'saints,' Œ±ÃîÃÅŒ≥ŒπŒøŒπ hagioi, means those who are holy, or those who are devoted or consecrated to God...the Roman Christians had shown. For the use of the word, as stated above, see the following passages of scripture; Luke 2:23; Exodus 13:2, Romans 11:16; Matthew 7:6; 1 Peter 1:16; Acts 9:13; 1 Peter 2:5; Acts 3:21, Ephesians 3:5; 1 Peter 2:9; Philippians 2:15; 1 John 3:1-2." (Quote 1)
2. "Grace...is employed in the sense of benignity or benevolence; felicity, or a prosperous state of affairs; the Christian religion, as the highest expression of the benevolence or favor of God; the happiness which Christianity confers on its friends in this and the future life; the apostolic office; charity, or alms; thanksgiving; joy, or pleasure; and the benefits produced on the Christian‚Äôs heart and life by religion." (Quote 2)
3. "But the word 'peace' is also used in contrast with that state of agitation and conflict which a sinner has with his conscience and with God. The sinner is like the troubled sea, which cannot rest...A prayer for peace, therefore, in the epistles, is not a mere formal salutation, but has a special reference to those 'spiritual' blessings which result from reconciliation with God through the Lord Jesus Christ." (Quote 3)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term agioi saints is applied to Christians in three senses in the New Testament."
2. "It is asserted that they are what they are called."
3. "As individually holy."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul does by no means ascribe the praise of our salvation to ourselves, but derives it altogether from the fountain of God‚Äôs free and paternal love towards us; for he makes this the first thing ‚Äî God loves us: and what is the cause of his love, except his own goodness alone?" 
2. "None rightly connect themselves with the number of the faithful, except they feel assured that the Lord is gracious, however unworthy and wretched sinners they may be, and except they be stimulated by his goodness and aspire to holiness."
3. "The very foundation then of our felicity is the favor of God, by which we enjoy true and solid prosperity, and by which also our salvation is promoted even when we are in adversities."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Beloved of God. Because reconciled to God through Christ."
2. "Called to be saints. Just as Paul Vas called to be an Apostle (Romans 1:1), implying that they actually were what they were called to be."
3. "This joining of Christ with God our Father as the personal source of ‚Äògrace and peace‚Äô to us, is a strong incidental proof of the divinity of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "St. Paul, if not formally enunciating a doctrine of the Divinity of Christ, held a view which cannot really be distinguished from it" (Sanday and Headlam).
2. "Paul's theology is clearly seen in the terms used in verses Romans 1:1-7."
3. "Ablative case of Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ after the verbal adjective like Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑŒø Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ (taught of God) in John 6:45."

### John Gill:
1. "Men are first beloved of the Lord, and then called to be his saints."
2. "By 'grace' is not meant ministerial gifts, which are not common to all the saints; nor the Gospel, which was at Rome already; nor the love and favour of God, which these persons were sharers in, as appears from their above characters; nor the principle of grace, which was now formed there in their effectual calling; but an increase of grace, as to its degrees, acts, and exercise."
3. "By 'peace' is meant, peace with God through Christ; peace in their own consciences, and with one another; all manner of prosperity inward and outward here, and eternal happiness hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "Beloved of God ‚Äî And from his free love, not from any merit of yours, called by his word and his Spirit to believe in him, and now through faith holy as he is holy."
2. "Grace ‚Äî The peculiar favour of God."
3. "And peace ‚Äî All manner of blessings, temporal, spiritual, and eternal. This is both a Christian salutation and an apostolic benediction."
