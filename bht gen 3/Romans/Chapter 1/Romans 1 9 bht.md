# Romans 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's serving of God in his spirit was a sincere profession, demonstrated by his earnest appeal to God. His service was not only a religious duty, but also his whole religious life and official activity, consecrated to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Paul's prayers were unceasing and he never omitted the Romans from his prayer lists. This deep interest in the well-being of the Romans prepared them to receive his message. If all Christians and Christian ministers showed the same intensity of prayer for the church, its impact would be truly transformative.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The serving God in his spirit was a guarantee that his profession was sincere, and that the oath just taken was no mere form, but a solemn and earnest appeal of his spirit." 
2. "His peculiar method of service was concerned with the gospel of the Son of God."
3. "My prayers must be understood of his ordinary stated prayers, just in our sense of the expression: 'as often as he professedly and statedly prayed to God, he remembered them among others.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For God...whom I serve‚Äîthe word denotes religious service." 
2. "With my spirit‚Äîfrom my inmost soul." 
3. "In the gospel of his Son‚Äîto which Paul's whole religious life and official activity were consecrated."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A deep interest shown in this way was well suited to prepare them to receive what he had to say to them."
2. "He was really and sincerely devoted to the service of God."
3. "If with the same intensity of prayer all Christians, and Christian ministers, would remember the churches, what a different aspect would the Christian church soon assume!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I serve [ŒªŒ±œÑœÅŒµœÖœâ]. The word was used in a special sense to denote the service rendered to Jehovah by the Israelites as His peculiar people." 
2. "As in his Philippians letter, Paul here appropriates the Jewish word for the spiritual Christian service."
3. "The word was used in a special sense to denote the service rendered to Jehovah by the Israelites as His peculiar people."

### John Calvin:
1. "He proves his love by its effects; for had he not greatly loved them, he would not have so anxiously commended them to the Lord, and especially he would not have so ardently desired to promote their welfare by his own labors."
2. "Had Paul not been sincere in his devotion to God, he would not have dared to appeal to God as a witness in his declaration."
3. "It ought to add no little encouragement to the ministers of the gospel, when they hear that, in preaching the gospel, they render an acceptable and a valuable service to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God is my witness. Such appeals to God are not uncommon in Paul‚Äôs writings." (25 words)
2. "He renders true service, not in the temple, but in his ‚Äòspirit.‚Äô" (12 words)
3. "Paul served God by telling the good tidings of the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord." (14 words)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I serve ... to serve in general gods or men, whether sacred services or spiritual service as here." 
2. "Unceasingly. Late adverb for which see 1 Thessalonians 1:2; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:17, only other N.T. examples." 
3. "Always. One might think that Paul prayed for no others, but he uses both adverbs in 1 Thessalonians 1:2. He seems to have had prayer lists. He never omitted the Romans."

### John Gill:
1. "The object of his oath or appeal, or by which he speaks, is not himself, or anything that belonged to him, nor any creature in heaven or on earth, but God; who in a solemn oath is only to be appealed to and sworn by." 
2. "He served him in it, by preaching, spreading, and defending it. This is a service, and a very laborious one, and makes for the honour and glory of God." 
3. "Whence may be observed, that prayer to God ought to be constant; and that we should be concerned for others as well as for ourselves; all the saints should share therein."

### John Wesley:
1. God, whom I serve ‚Äî As an apostle.
In my spirit ‚Äî Not only with my body, but with my inmost soul.
In the gospel ‚Äî By preaching it.
