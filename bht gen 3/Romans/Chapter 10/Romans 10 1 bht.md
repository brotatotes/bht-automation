2. "The inclination (or, desire) of my heart and my supplication to God on their behalf."
3. "The Apostle‚Äôs intention seems to be, to destroy any impression which his readers may have received un-favourable to his love of his own people, from the stern argument of the former chapter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My heart's desire - The word 'desire' ŒµœÖÃìŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒπÃÅŒ± eudokia means benevolence, and the expression, 'my heart's desire,' means my earnest and sincere wish."

### John Calvin:
1. "We here see with what solicitude the holy man obviated offenses... their salvation was an object of concern to him before the Lord, and such a feeling arises only from genuine love." (Commentary)
2. "It may be at the same time that he was also induced by another reason to testify his love towards the nation from which he had sprung... his doctrine would have never been received by the Jews had they thought that he was avowedly inimical to them." (Commentary)
3. "At the beginning of the last chapter, the Apostle expressed his great grief for his brethren the Jews, he now expresses his great love towards them, and his strong desire for their highest good ‚Äî their salvation." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The desire, lit., ‚Äògood pleasure,‚Äô not, ‚Äògood will;‚Äô the latter sense does not suit the context. ‚ÄòDesire‚Äô is not exact, yet probably suggests the true sense: the salvation of Israel was the ideal of his heart (Godet)." 
2. "And my petition to God. ‚ÄòPrayer‚Äô is not so exact as ‚Äòpetition;‚Äô ‚Äòto God‚Äô is to be joined with ‚Äòpetition‚Äô (as an incorrect reading indicates), and not with ‚Äòis,‚Äô which must be supplied in English (see below)."
3. "Their salvation‚Äô (lit., ‚Äòunto salvation‚Äô) expresses the sense which the E. V. expands into: ‚Äòthat they might be saved.‚Äô Their salvation is the end (ideal) of his ‚Äògood pleasure,‚Äô and this he asks God to grant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Clearly Paul did not feel that the case was hopeless for them in spite of their conduct."

3. "Non orasset Paul si absolute reprobati essent (Paul would not have prayed if they had been absolutely reprobate)."

### John Gill:
1. "the 'desire [of his] heart' was towards Israel, he bore a good will to them, his mind was well disposed and affected towards them"
2. "he continually bore them upon his mind at the throne of grace"
3. "he desired...that they might be spiritually converted, turned from their evil ways, and brought to believe in Christ, whom they had despised and rejected, and so be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation"

### John Wesley:
1. My prayer to God is, that they may be saved ‚Äî He would not have prayed for this, had they been absolutely reprobated.
