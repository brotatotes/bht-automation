# Romans 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True faith is not intuitive; it is a particular mode of thinking guided to its object by the testimony of another. With the heart, man believes unto justifying righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Confession is the voice of faith, announcing itself and proclaiming the glory and grace of the Lord. Faith leads one to believe with the heart, obtaining justification, while confession with the mouth is necessary for final salvation. Both faith and confession are instrumental in the believer's journey.
