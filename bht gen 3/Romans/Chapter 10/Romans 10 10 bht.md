# Romans 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Genuine faith goes beyond mere intellectual assent; it involves a deep conviction and unwavering trust in God's grace. Believing in our hearts leads to justification and reconciliation with God. However, true faith is incomplete without confession, both in words and deeds. Openly professing our faith in Christ is an essential test of discipleship, especially when facing persecution or opposition. This confession must be sincere and authentic, aligning our words with the reality of our transformed hearts.

2. "It is a going out of the soul to Christ, in various acts, such as venturing into his presence, prostrating itself at his feet, resolving if it perishes it will perish there; a giving up itself unto him, determining it will have no other Saviour, leaning and relying on him, and living upon him."
3. "This confession must be made both by words and facts, must be open, visible, and before men; and also real, hearty, and sincere, the words of the mouth agreeing with the experience of the heart."

1. "For with the heart ‚Äî Not the understanding only." 
2. "Man believeth to righteousness ‚Äî So as to obtain justification."
