# Romans 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How can people call on God if they don't believe in Him? And how can they believe in Him if they have never heard about Him? And how can they hear about Him without someone preaching to them? Calling on God implies belief, belief requires hearing, and hearing necessitates preaching. This is why we share the gospel with others, to proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ to both Jews and Gentiles. Through preaching, people are given the opportunity to hear, believe, and ultimately call upon the name of God for salvation.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "Both Jews and Gentiles, by calling on the name of God, do thereby declare that they believe on him; for a true calling on Godâ€™s name cannot be except a right knowledge of him were first had." 
2. "For he who calls on God betakes himself, as it were, to the only true haven of salvation, and to a most secure refuge; he acts like the son, who commits himself into the bosom of the best and the most loving of fathers, that he may be protected by his care, cherished by his kindness and love, relieved by his bounty, and supported by his power." 
3. "But were any on this account to contend that God cannot transfer to men the knowledge of himself, except by the instrumentality of preaching, we deny that to teach this was the Apostleâ€™s intention; for he had only in view the ordinary dispensation of God, and did not intend to prescribe a law for the distribution of his grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle argues from the cited prophecy the necessity of preachers sent forth in accordance with another prophecy, in order by thus enforcing the universality of the gospel to show more plainly the responsibility of the Jews."
2. "On him, etc. Here and throughout the reference is to Christ."
3. "Without a preacher; apart from, independently of, one preaching, i.e., proclaiming a message as a herald."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "How shall they believe?"
3. "How shall they hear?"

### John Gill:
1. "There can be no true calling upon God without faith, no faith without hearing, no hearing without preaching, and no preaching without a divine mission."
2. "There is no faith in Christ without hearing of him; as it is in human, so in divine faith, there may be believing without seeing, but not without hearing."
3. "There is no hearing the word explained without preaching; explaining the word is preaching."
