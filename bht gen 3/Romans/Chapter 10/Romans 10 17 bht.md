## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 17. So then faith cometh by hearing,
	and hearing by the word of God‚Äî"This is another
	confirmation of the truth that faith supposes the hearing of the
	Word, and this a commission to preach it."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Even by this passage, therefore, it seems that a message was necessary, that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the divine message."
2. "When it is said that faith cometh by hearing, it is not meant that all who hear actually believe, for that is not true; but that faith does not exist unless there is a message, or report, to be heard or believed."
3. "And this shows us at once the importance of the message, and the fact that people are converted by the instrumentality of truth, and of truth only."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By hearing [ŒµŒæ Œ±Œ∫ŒøŒ∑œÇ] . The same word as report, above, and in the same sense, that which is heard."
2. "Word of God [œÅŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ] . The best texts read of Christ. Probably not the Gospel, but Christ's word of command or commission to its preachers."
3. "Belief comes through the message, and the message through the command of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "Wherever faith is, God has there already given an evidence of his election."
2. "And this is a remarkable passage with regard to the efficacy of preaching; for he testifies, that by it faith is produced."
3. "Faith is grounded on nothing else but the truth of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The heard preaching of the gospel brings about in men‚Äôs minds faith in Christ." 
2. "Word' is literally 'saying,' and probably means command or order."
3. "Thus the authority of the message is emphasized over against the unbelief of some, preparing the way for the application to the responsibility of the Jews."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  By the word of Christ (Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÅŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÖ). "By the word about Christ" (objective genitive). 


### John Gill:
1. "The word hearing is used in the same sense as in the preceding verse; and designs the report of the Gospel, or the preaching of the word, which is the means God makes use of, to convey faith into the hearts of his people." 
2. "Men preach the Gospel in obedience to the commandment of the everlasting God, and according to the orders, mission, and commission, warrant and authority, of the Lord Jesus Christ." 
3. "It is the original will of God, to send forth his apostles and ministers, to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; that they hearing might believe, and believing call upon the Lord, and so be saved by him."

### John Wesley:
