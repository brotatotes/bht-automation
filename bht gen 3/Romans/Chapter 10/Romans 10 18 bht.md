## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Into all the earth went forth their voice, and to the ends of the world their words."
2. "The Apostle has not, as alleged in nearly all the Commentators, merely accommodated the text allegorically, but taken it in its context, and followed up the comparison of the Psalm."
3. "It is not the extent, so much as the universality in character, of this preaching, which the Apostle is here asserting: that word of God, hitherto confined within the limits of Jud√¶a, had now broken those bounds, and was preached in all parts of the earth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Can Israel, through any region of his dispersion, plead ignorance of these glad tidings?"
2. "Yes, verily, their sound went... into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world."
3. "We cannot doubt that the irradiation of the world with the beams of a better Sun by the universal diffusion of the Gospel of Christ, must have a mode of speaking quite natural, and to him scarcely figurative."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The objection had been carried through the previous verses. The apostle comes now to reply to it... This is the substance of his answer."
2. "The apostle means to affirm strongly that they had heard."
3. "The message of the gospel had sounded forth; and he referred doubtless to the labors of the apostles in proclaiming it to the pagan nations."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Surely it is not true that they did not hear."
2. "The voice of the gospel message is like that of the starry sky proclaiming God's glory to all the earth."
3. "The Septuagint sound seems to be a free rendering in order to secure parallelism with words."

### John Calvin:
1. "God has already from the beginning manifested his divinity to the Gentiles, though not by the preaching of men, yet by the testimony of his creatures; for though the gospel was then silent among them, yet the whole workmanship of heaven and earth did speak and make known its author by its preaching."
2. "He indeed manifested himself then more particularly to his chosen people, so that the Jews might be justly compared to domestic hearers, whom he familiarly taught as it were by his own mouth; yet as he spoke to the Gentiles at a distance by the voice of the heavens, he showed by this prelude that he designed to make himself known at length to them also."
3. "The ‚Äòsound,‚Äô or voice, as applied in this passage, means the report, the news, respecting the gospel; and the ‚Äòwords,‚Äô the actual preaching of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nay, verily. Comp. chap. Romans 9:20, where the same word is rendered ‚Äònay but.‚Äô We substitute ‚Äònay,‚Äô for ‚Äòyes,‚Äô to indicate the relation to the question: so far from its being the case that they did not hear, the very opposite is true."
2. "Their sound, etc. The rest of the verse is taken from Psalms 19:4 (E. V.), in the exact words of the LXX. But it is not cited as in itself a proof from Scripture; for there is no formula of quotation, and the Psalmist is speaking of the universal revelation of God in nature, not in the gospel."
3. "The verse applies even more strikingly to those in gospel lands. ‚ÄòSound‚Äô is the LXX. rendering of the Hebrew ‚Äòline,‚Äô which in the Psalm means ‚Äòa musical chord.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did they fail to hear?"
2. "Yea, verily."
3. "Sound. The vibration of a musical string."

### John Gill:
1. "The question refers to each, and the answer is, yes, verily: which the Arabic renders just the reverse, 'no', or 'not at all, notwithstanding their sound went into all the earth'; and so makes this an aggravation of their stupidity, and obstinate rejection of the Gospel, that they would not hear it, though its sound reached every place; but the answer is in the affirmative, they did hear."
2. "There is some little difference between the passage in the Psalms, and as cited or referred to by the apostle, who instead of 'their line', reads 'their sound'; which have made some suspect a corruption of the present Hebrew text, or a various reading; and that the Septuagint, followed by the apostle, used a copy which had not, ◊ß◊ï◊ù, 'their line', but ◊ß◊ï◊ú◊ù, 'their voice', and which was the true reading."
3. "This the apostle seems to allude to, in 2 Corinthians 10:13, where he speaks of the measure, line, and rule of their ministry, which reached to Corinth and further, without going into another man's line: moreover, that great Oriental critic, and our countryman, Mr. Pocock has shown from the use of the word ◊ß◊ï◊î, in the Arabic language, that the word in the Psalms may signify a loud cry, or noise, as well as a line, or rule; so that the psalmist and the apostle may be easily reconciled."

### John Wesley:
1. "But their unbelief was not owing to the want of hearing... For they have heard." 
2. "So many nations have already heard the preachers of the gospel, that I may in some sense say of them as David did of the lights of heaven." 
3. "Yes verily - So many nations have already heard... Psalm 29:4"
