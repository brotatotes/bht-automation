# Romans 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul asks if Israel failed to realize that the Gospel would be proclaimed to all nations, as foretold in their own Scriptures. In doing so, God would provoke Israel to jealousy by favoring the Gentiles and anger them by adopting a foolish nation. This prophecy indicates that Israel would be conquered by what seemed like an inferior people. The Jews, who had worshipped false gods, now saw God bestowing favor upon a no-people.

### Henry Alford:

1. "What nation is so renowned, that it has gods coming nigh to it, as thy God at this day descends to thee?"

3. "Now the Lord threatened by these people to provoke the Jews to jealousy, and to anger them; and this was but just, and by way of retaliation."

### John Wesley:
1. "They might have known, even from Moses and Isaiah, that many of the gentiles would be received, and many of the Jews rejected."
2. "I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not a nation ‚Äî As they followed gods that were not gods, so he accepted in their stead a nation that was not a nation; that is, a nation that was not in covenant with God."
3. "A foolish nation ‚Äî Such are all which know not God."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Romans 10:19, Paul asks if Israel did not know that the Gentiles would be brought into equality with them through the proclamation of the Gospel. He draws from Moses, who prophesied that God would provoke Israel to jealousy by accepting a no-nation and anger them by adopting a foolish nation. By worshipping idols and provoking God with their vanities, Israel had already moved God to anger, and now He would move them to jealousy by favoring the Gentiles. This prediction also reveals that Israel would be conquered by what seemed like an inferior people. The passage emphasizes that Israel should have known, as the Scriptures made it clear that God intended to bring the Gentiles into His plan of salvation.
