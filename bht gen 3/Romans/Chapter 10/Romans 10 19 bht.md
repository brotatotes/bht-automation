# Romans 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Israel, did you not know that the Gospel would be proclaimed to the Gentiles? Your own Scriptures declared, I will provoke you to jealousy against those who are no nation, against a nation that has no understanding will I provoke you. God intended to bring the Gentiles into His favor and make you jealous, adopting a foolish nation in your place. The Gentiles, whom you regarded as no people, have received God's favor and salvation. Israel, you should have known of God's plan to include the Gentiles but failed to understand and accept this truth.

2. "First - First in order; as we say, in the first place."
3. "That are no people - That is, those whom you regard as unworthy the name of a people. Those who have no government, laws, or regular organization; who wander in tribes and clans, and who are under no settled form of society."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Did Israel not know? As in ver. 18, a negative answer is implied. 'It is surely not true that Israel did not know.' Did not know what? That the Gospel should go forth into all the earth." 
2. "First Moses. First in order; the first who wrote."
3. "No-people as related to God's heritage, not that the Gentiles were inferior or insignificant in themselves."

### John Calvin:

2. "For this distinction must be ever borne in mind, 'What nation is so renowned, that it has gods coming nigh to it, as thy God at this day descends to thee?'"

2. "If they had not known this, there might have been some excuse for them, as surprised by the event. But there was not even this palliation."
3. "'Moses prophetically assumes the departure of Israel from God, and His rejection of them, and denounces from God that, as they had moved Him to jealousy with their 'no-gods' (idols) and provoked Him to anger by their vanities, so He would, by receiving into His favor a 'no-nation' make them jealous, and provoke them to anger by adopting instead of them a foolish nation' (Alford)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did Israel fail to know?"
2. "The Jews had worshipped "no-gods" and now God shows favours to a 'no-nation' (people)."
3. "Future active (Attic future) of œÄŒ±œÅŒøœÅŒ≥ŒπŒ∂œâ, rare word, to rouse to wrath."

### John Gill:
1. "did not Israel know, that the Gentiles were to be called by the grace of God, and that they themselves were to be cast off?"
2. "The Gentiles are here designed by 'them that are no people': who before God, and in his sight, as all nations are ... were as a drop of the bucket, as the small dust of the balance: nay, even as nothing, yea, less than nothing and vanity."
3. "Now from these words of Moses, the Israelites must needs know, they could not but know that it was the will of God to call the Gentiles, and reject them."

3. "A foolish nation - Such are all which know not God."
