# Romans 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Did Israel not know? They surely knew of God's intention, from their own Scriptures, to bring in the Gentiles and raise them up into equality and rivalry. God warned His ancient people that, by receiving a 'no-nation' into His favor and adopting a foolish nation, He would provoke them to jealousy and anger. It was no secret that the Gospel would go forth into all the earth, yet Israel failed to recognize it, obstinately rejecting it out of pride and idolatry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Did Israel not know... the fact that such a general proclamation of the Gospel would be made as has been mentioned in the last verse, raising up the Gentiles into equality and rivalry with themselves." 
2. "First, Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy against (those who are) no nation, against a nation that hath no understanding." 
3. "He would, by receiving into his favour a 'no-nation,' make them jealous, and provoke them to anger by adopting instead of them a foolish nation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did not Israel know?â€”know, from their own Scriptures, of God's intention to bring in the Gentiles?".
2. "God warns His ancient people that because they had moved Him to jealousy with their 'no-gods'... He in requital would move them to jealousy by receiving into His favor a 'no-people,' and provoke them to anger by adopting a nation void of understanding."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "From that it appears that he referred to the fact that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles, and that the Jews were to be cast off."
2. "God says that they had provoked him, or excited his indignation, by worshipping what was not God, that is, by idols; and he, in turn, would excite their envy and indignation by showing favors to those who were not regarded as a people; that is, to the Gentiles."
3. "We may remark here, (2)That when people abuse his mercies, become proud, or cold, or dead in his service, he often takes away their privileges, and bestows them on others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Did Israel not know? As in ver. 18, a negative answer is implied. 'It is surely not true that Israel did not know.' Did not know what? That the Gospel should go forth into all the earth." 
2. "The prediction is that Israel shall be conquered by an apparently inferior people. No-people as related to God's heritage, not that the Gentiles were inferior or insignificant in themselves." 
3. "The force of the compounded preposition para in this verb and in parazhlwsw provoke to jealousy, seems to be driving to the side of something which by contact or comparison excites jealousy or anger."

### John Calvin:
1. "What then is to be said of Israel, who had been illuminated by a far different light of truth? for how comes it that aliens and the profane should run to the light manifested to them afar off, and that the holy race of Abraham should reject it when familiarly seen by them?" 
2. "Now this could not have been without repudiating the Jewish nation: for the emulation, which Moses mentions, arose from this, â€” that God formed for himself a nation from that which was not a nation, and raised up from nothing a new people, who were to occupy the place from which the Jews had been driven away, inasmuch as they had forsaken the true God and prostituted themselves to idols."
3. "Observe, that a foolish nation, and no nation, are the same; for without the hope of eternal life men have properly no existence. Besides, the beginning or origin of life is from the light of faith: hence spiritual existence flows from the new creation; and in this sense Paul calls the faithful the work of God, as they are regenerated by his Spirit, and renewed after his image."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But â€˜knewâ€™ what? The connection with Romans 10:18 favors the explanation: â€˜knew that the gospel would go forth into all the earth.â€™"
2. "If they had not known this, there might have been some excuse for them, as surprised by the event. But there was not even this palliation."
3. "'Moses prophetically assumes the departure of Israel from God, and His rejection of them, and denounces from God that, as they had moved Him to jealousy with their 'no-gods' (idols) and provoked Him to anger by their vanities, so He would, by receiving into His favor a 'no-nation' make them jealous, and provoke them to anger by adopting instead of them a foolish nation'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did Israel fail to know?"
2. "The Jews had worshipped 'no-gods' and now God shows favours to a 'no-nation' (people)."
3. "Will I anger you?"

### John Gill:
1. "Did not Israel know, that the Gentiles were to be called by the grace of God, and that they themselves were to be cast off?"
2. "They not only heard it, but knew it; not spiritually and experimentally, but nationally and speculatively, and, against the light and conviction of their own minds, obstinately rejected it with contempt."
3. "The Lord threatened by these people to provoke the Jews to jealousy, and to anger them; and this was but just, and by way of retaliation."

### John Wesley:
1. "But hath not Israel known â€” They might have known...that many of the gentiles would be received, and many of the Jews rejected."
2. "I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not a nation â€” As they followed gods that were not gods, so he accepted in their stead a nation that was not a nation; that is, a nation that was not in covenant with God."
3. "A foolish nation â€” Such are all which know not God."
