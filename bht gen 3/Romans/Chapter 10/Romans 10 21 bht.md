## BHT:
But in regard of Israel he saith, All the day I stretched forth my hands to a people disobedient and gainsaying. The true cause of such rejection of saving truth is the prepossession of the mind by some false notions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But in regard of Israel he saith, All the day I stretched forth my hands to a people disobedient and gainsaying."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mere sincerity, and even earnestness in religionâ€”though it may be some ground of hope for a merciful recovery from errorâ€”is no excuse, and will not compensate, for the deliberate rejection of saving truth, when in the providence of God presented for acceptance."
2. "The true cause of such rejection of saving truth, by the otherwise sincere, is the prepossession of the mind by some false notions of its own."
3. "God's dealings even with reprobate sinners are full of tenderness and compassion; all the day long extending the arms of His mercy even to the disobedient and gainsaying."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "While the Gentiles would be obedient, the character of the Jews was, that they were a disobedient and rebellious people." 
2. "The provisions of the gospel are ample for them - for all. Its power has been tried on many nations; and its mild and happy influence is seen in meliorated laws, customs, habits; in purer institutions; in intelligence and order." 
3. "The command of Jesus Christ remains still the same, to preach the gospel to every creature. That command has never been repealed or changed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Disobedient - gainsaying [Î±Ï€ÎµÎ¹Î¸Î¿Ï…Î½Ï„Î± - Î±Î½Ï„Î¹Î»ÎµÎ³Î¿Î½Ï„Î±] . See on John 3:36; Jude 1:11. Disobedience is the manifestation of the refractoriness expressed in gainsaying. Some explain gainsaying as contradicting. Compare Luke 13:34, Luke 13:35. 


### John Calvin:
1. "He says to Israel, whom he continually by his word invited to himself, and ceased not to allure by every sort of kindness; for these are the two ways which he adopts to call men, as he thus proves his goodwill towards them." 
2. "And very emphatical is the expression, that he stretches out his hands; for by seeking our salvation through the ministers of his word, he stretches forth to us his hands no otherwise than as a father who stretches forth his arms, ready to receive his son kindly into his bosom." 
3. "But since the Prophet accuses the people of perverseness, and then adds that they wandered through ways which were not good, I doubt not but that the Greek Translator meant to express the Hebrew word ×¡×•×¨×¨, surer, by two words, calling them first disobedient or rebellious, and then gainsaying; for their contumacy showed itself in this, because the people, with untamable pride and bitterness, obstinately rejected the holy admonitions of the Prophets."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast is between â€˜Israelâ€™ and the Gentiles referred to in the prophecy."
2. "Spread out,â€™ as one who invites to his embrace, or, even supplicates; this God is represented as doing without intermission, â€˜the whole day.â€™"
3. "God offered them the gospel, but they would not accept. The universality of the gospel implied the one way of faith; want of faith was the rejection of the universal gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All the day long... Did I spread out... Unto a disobedient and a gainsaying people." 
2. "He quotes Isaiah 65:2."
3. "Contrary and contradictory (Luke 13:34)."

### John Gill:
1. "All day long I have stretched forth my hands, unto a disobedient and gainsaying people."
2. "The Lord's 'stretching out [his] hands all the day long' to them, designs the ministry of the prophets one after another."
3. "But they were a stiffnecked and rebellious people, uncircumcised in heart and ears; would have none of his counsel, and despised his reproof."

### John Wesley:
1. An unbelieving and gainsaying people â€” Just opposite to those who believed with their hearts, and made confession with their mouths.
