# Romans 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the end and goal of the law, containing within Himself all that the law demands for the justification of those who embrace Him. Through faith in Christ, the same end is achieved in regard to our justification that would be through perfect obedience to the moral law. He put a stop to the law as a means of salvation and becomes the fulfillment and aim of the law, providing the righteousness that the law points to but cannot give.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For Christ is the endâ€”the object or aim."
2. "Contains within Himself all that the law demands for the justification of such as embrace Him, whether Jew or Gentile."
3. "The law demands for the justification of such as embrace Him, whether Jew or Gentile."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This expression implies faith in Christ."
2. "The main design or object which the perfect obedience of the Law would accomplish, is accomplished by faith in Christ."
3. "By faith in Christ the same end is accomplished in regard to our justification, that would be by perfect obedience to the moral law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The aim. Either that the intent of the law was to make men righteous, which was accomplished in Christ, or that the law led to Him as a pedagogue (Galatians 3:24)."
2. "The fulfillment, as Matthew 5:17. Matthew 5:3. The termination."
3. "To believers in Christ the law has no longer legislative authority to say, 'Do this and live; do this or die' (Morison)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law had been given for this end, â€” to lead us as by the hand to another righteousness: nay, whatever the law teaches, whatever it commands, whatever it promises, has always a reference to Christ as its main object; and hence all its parts ought to be applied to him."
2. "Thus the righteousness of faith receives a testimony from the law. We have then here a remarkable passage, which proves that the law in all its parts had a reference to Christ; and hence no one can rightly understand it, who does not continually level at this mark."
3. "The end of the law is its fulfillment, the performance of what it requires to attain life: and Christ in this respect is its end, having rendered to it perfect obedience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ is the object, or aim, of the law."
2. "Christ is the fulfilment of the law. This, which is true enough, does not meet the requirements of this passage."
3. "Christ is the termination, conclusion, of the law. So many commentators...have much to recommend it...especially the fact that there is such a sharp contrast made in Romans 10:5-6, between the law and Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ put a stop to the law as a means of salvation." (19 words)
2. "Christ is the goal or aim of the law." (10 words)
3. "Christ ended the law as a method of salvation for 'everyone that believeth'." (14 words)

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's obedience to it is no part of justifying righteousness, especially not to everyone that believes, not to the Gentiles who never were under any obligation to observe it."
2. "Christ is either the consuming or consummating, the destroying or fulfilling end of the law."
3. "He becomes the end of it, for a justifying righteousness before God, to everyone that believes."

### John Wesley:
1. "For Christ is the end of the law â€” The scope and aim of it. It is the very design of the law, to bring men to believe in Christ for justification and salvation."
2. "And he alone gives that pardon and life which the law shows the want of, but cannot give."
3. "To every one â€” Whether Jew or gentile, treated of, Romans 10:11, etc."
