# Romans 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The righteousness that comes from obeying the law is the one way of justification and life. The man who does all that the law commands shall live in them. This righteousness of the law requires perfect compliance with all the statutes, promoting order, health, purity, and benevolence. However, no one had ever truly fulfilled the law. It is in this context that Paul harmonizes the law with faith. The righteousness of the law lies in both external and internal obedience, requiring love, fear, and faith in God, as well as a conformity of heart and nature to His law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He who shall render perfect and continued compliance with all the statutes made known, shall receive the reward which the Law promises." 
2. "The effect would be to produce happiness in this life and in the life to come. The tendency and result of obedience would be to promote order, health, purity, benevolence; to advance the welfare of man, and the honor of God, and thus must confer happiness."
3. "If perfect obedience were rendered, it would, from the nature of the case, confer happiness and life as long as the obedience was rendered. God would not punish the innocent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Moses writeth that the man, etc." 
2. "The righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then removes this, and in the best manner, when by the teaching of the law itself he confirms the righteousness of faith."
2. "But we ought to understand the reason why Paul harmonizes the law with faith, and yet sets the righteousness of one in opposition to that of the other."
3. "The more detestable on this account is the stupidity of the Papists, who think it enough to prove merits by adducing bare promises."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "It is implied, but not directly asserted, that no one had thus fulfilled it." 
3. "Even the doing and living, so far as they became a reality, pointed to Christ, who by His vicarious doing and living makes us live and do."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The righteousness of the law lies in 'doing' and keeping those statutes, not merely externally, but internally, with all the heart and soul, and strength."
2. "The law requires love to God, fear of him, and faith in him, and an inward disposition of the mind towards him, and a conformity of heart and nature to his law, as well as outward obedience."
3. "As the righteousness of the law is a righteousness of works done by men, it cannot be the righteousness God imputes, for that is without works, and by which a man can be justified before God."

3. "Leviticus 18:5"
