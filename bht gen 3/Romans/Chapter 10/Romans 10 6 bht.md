# Romans 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not despair, thinking that someone must bring down Christ from heaven for you to attain justification. The righteousness that comes by faith speaks a different language and does not require profound inquiries or difficult journeys. It has already been revealed through the Incarnation of Christ. So, do not say in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? or Who shall descend into the grave? These actions are not needed for salvation and should not lead to doubt or despair.

2. "Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down, c."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They did not require deep research, long journeys, or painful toil. There was no need of crossing seas, and going to other lands, of looking into the profound mysteries of the high heavens, or the deep abyss; but they were near them, had been plainly set before them, and were easily understood."
2. "To say that it was high as heaven, or that it was necessary to ascend to heaven to understand it, was to express the highest difficulty."

3. "Christ's ascension into heaven ought indeed fully to confirm our faith as to eternal life; for he in a manner removes Christ himself from the possession of heaven, who doubts whether the inheritance of heaven is prepared for the faithful, in whose name, and on whose account he has entered thither." (Commentary)

2. "Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, as if it were to bring Christ down: or, Who shall descend into the grave, as if it were to bring him again from the dead - Do not imagine that these things are to be done now, in order to procure thy pardon and salvation." 
3. "Do not imagine that these things are to be done now, in order to procure thy pardon and salvation."
