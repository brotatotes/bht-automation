# Romans 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who shall descend into the abyss of waters on which the earth rested? It is impossible, just as it is impossible to bring Christ up from the realm of the dead. The deity and resurrection of Christ are the chief points of attack today on the part of skeptics. But the work of religion is easy, for the word is near him, therefore accessible; plain and simple and therefore apprehensible. The righteousness of faith commands us to believe in that work by applying it to himself in order to be saved.
