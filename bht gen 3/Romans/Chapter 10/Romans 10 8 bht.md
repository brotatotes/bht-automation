# Romans 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word of faith is easily accessible and requires no laborious search. It does not involve establishing righteousness through the law but accepting, by faith, the message of the gospel. Through faith in Christ and the confession of that faith, salvation is obtained. The contrast between the law and the gospel is that while the law demands works, the gospel simply requires faith to receive God's grace. It is within reach, already in their mouths and hearts, having been preached by the apostles.
