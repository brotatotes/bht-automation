## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the duty of confessing the Lord Jesus can hardly be called part of the contents of the preaching of faith, but the prominence given to that duty shews a reference to the words of Moses"
2. "the making the word render a reason for the fact above stated, suits much better the context and form of the passage"
3. "the fact of the confession with the mouth standing first, also shews a reference to what has gone before"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If thou shalt confess Jesus [to be] the Lord," which is the proper manifestation or evidence of faith. This is put first merely to correspond with the foregoing quotation‚Äî"in thy mouth and in thine heart."
2. "Calling of believers" is put before their "election," as that which is first "made sure," although in point of time it comes after it.
3. "Believe in thine heart that God hath raised God raised [Jesus] from the dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A profession of religion then denotes a public declaration of our agreement with what God has declared, and extends to all his declarations about our lost estate, our sin, and need of a Saviour; to his doctrines about his own nature, holiness, and law; about the Saviour and the Holy Spirit; about the necessity of a change of heart and holiness of life; and about the grave and the judgment; about heaven and hell."
2. "To profess this doctrine was, therefore, virtually to profess all the truths of the Christian religion. No man could believe this who did not also believe all the truths dependent on it."
3. "Thou shalt be saved - From sin and hell. This is the doctrine of the gospel throughout; and all this shows that salvation by the gospel was easy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Confess and believe, correspond to mouth and heart."
2. "The Lord Jesus."
3. "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the word that Jesus is Lord."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since the Lord sets his word before our face, no doubt he calls upon us to confess it."
2. "For we must remember the purpose for which Christ rose again; ‚Äî it was the Father‚Äôs design in raising him, to restore us all to life."
3. "This is one of the many instances both in the New and Old Testament, in which the most apparent act is mentioned first, and then the most hidden, or in which the deed is stated first, and then the principle from which it proceeds."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This confession implies that He has become Incarnate... for 'Lord' is the term applied to Jehovah in the LXX. 'In this appellation is the sum of faith and salvation' (Bengel)."
2. "Believe in thy heart. Comp. 'in thy heart;' Romans 10:8. 'Heart' is to be taken in the wide Biblical sense, and not limited to the affections."
3. "The requisites for salvation, as here stated, are: belief with the heart in the Resurrection of Jesus, not as an isolated historical event, but as involving the previous Advent of the Son of God, who is now the ascended Lord and hence confession of Him as Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒøœÇ was and is the touchstone of faith."
2. "Faith precedes confession, of course."
3. "No Jew would do this who had not really trusted Christ, for ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒøœÇ in the LXX is used of God."

### John Gill:
1. "If a man shall make a good, sincere, and hearty confession to God...before the world, that Christ is his Lord and Saviour,...thou shalt be saved."
2. "This article of Christ's resurrection includes the several other articles of faith...this is the rather mentioned, which is here ascribed to God the Father...."
3. "Such a faith is intended, not which lies in a mere assent to the truth of this, or any other article of the Christian religion; but which is concerned with Christ for righteousness, life, and glory; and with such a faith salvation is certainly and inseparably connected."

### John Wesley:
1. If thou confess with thy mouth ‚Äî Even in time of persecution, when such a confession may send thee to the lions.
