# Romans 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the stumble of the Jews, God's gracious purpose was to bring salvation to the Gentiles and stir up the Jews to regain their preeminence. The stumble of the Jews did not mean their final fall or exclusion from mercy, but rather it opened the way for the Gentiles to receive salvation. This turn of events was intended to provoke the Jews to jealousy and lead them to repentance, just as a wife's emulation can motivate her to seek reconciliation after being rejected by her husband.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He here calls it by this mild name, to set forth that it is not final."
2. "God has a gracious purpose towards the Gentiles even in this 'stumbling' of theirs."
3. "By this stumble of the Jews out of their national place in Godâ€™s favour, and the admission of the Gentiles into it, the very people thus excluded are to be stirred up to set themselves in the end effectually to regain, as a nation, that preeminence from which they are now degraded."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did they stumble that they should fall? God forbid."
2. "Through their fall...salvation is come to the Gentiles."
3. "Emulation is a legitimate stimulus to what is good."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Is it the design of God that the Jews should totally and irrecoverably be cast off? Even admitting that they are now unbelieving, that they have rejected the Messiah, that they have stumbled, is it the purpose of God finally to exclude them from mercy?" 
2. "Their rejection of the Messiah; the destruction of their city and temple; the ceasing of their ceremonial rites; and the rejection and dispersion of their nation by the Romans, all enter into the meaning of the word 'fall' here, and were all the occasion of introducing salvation to the Gentiles."
3. "The rejection and fall of the Jews contributed to the introduction of the Gentiles in the following manner: (1) It broke down the barrier which had long subsisted between them. (2) It made it consistent and proper, as they had rejected the Messiah, to send the knowledge of him to others. (3) It was connected with the destruction of the temple, and the rites of the Mosaic Law; and taught them, and all others, that the worship of God was not to be confined to any single place."

### John Calvin:
1. "He justly denies that the salvation of the Jews was to be despaired of, or that they were so rejected by God, that there was to be no future restoration, or that the covenant of grace, which he had once made with them, was entirely abolished, since there had ever remained in that nation the seed of blessing."
2. "The fall of the Jews had turned out for salvation to the Gentiles; but to this end â€” that they might be kindled by a sort of jealousy, and be thus led to repentance."
3. "For as emulation stimulates a wife, who for her fault has been rejected by her husband, so that she strives to be reconciled again; so it may be now, he says, that the Jews, seeing the Gentiles introduced into their place, will be touched with grief for their divorce, and seek reconciliation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact of stumbling is not, however, denied, since that has been affirmed in chap. Romans 11:32-33, nor yet the existence of a divine purpose (â€˜thatâ€™ = in order that) in connection with that fact, but as the context shows, the Apostle denies that this purpose was the final fall ( i.e., eternal destruction) of the nation." 
2. "This view alone accords with the close of the chapter."
3. "The salvation of the Gentiles was therefore the immediate purpose, but there was a further design, namely, bringing about the final salvation of the Jews by stirring them up to emulation, or, zeal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did they stumble that they might fall?" 
2. "By their fall" 
3. "For to provoke them to jealousy"

### John Gill:
1. "The end which God had in view, in suffering the Jews to stumble and fall, was not their destruction, but rather the salvation of the Gentiles."
2. "The Gospel...came to the Gentiles by the ministry of the apostles, according to the orders and command of Christ; and that through the fall of the Jews, their unbelief and rejection of the Messiah."
3. "The fall of the Jews makes way for the Gospel among the Gentiles; and this having had its effects with them, will be a means of putting the Jews upon serious thoughts about, and a studious inquiry after, the true Messiah, and salvation by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have they stumbled so as to fall â€” Totally and finally? No But by their fall - Or slip: it is a very soft word in the original."
2. "Salvation is come to the gentiles â€” See an instance of this, Acts 13:46."
3. "To provoke them â€” The Jews themselves, to jealousy."
