## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "if the rejection of them (not â€˜their loss,â€™ as Luther and others, by which the antithesis to what follows is weakened) be (the occasion of) the reconciliation of the world (of the Gentiles, viz. to God), what ( â€˜of what, kind,â€™ in its effect) (will be) the receiving of them, but (the occasion of) life from the dead?"
2. "Life from the dead may be variously taken... It may mean that â€˜life from the deadâ€™ literally should follow on the restoration of the Jewish people; i.e. that the Resurrection, the great consummation, is bound up with it."
3. "This might well be designated â€˜life from the dead,â€™ and in it may be implied the glories of the first resurrection, and deliverance from the bondage of corruption, without supposing the words life from the dead to be equivalent to the resurrection of the dead."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But both are true; they were cast away, though neither totally nor finally, and it is of this partial and temporary rejection that the apostle here speaks."
2. "The reception of the whole family of Israel, scattered as they are among all nations under heaven, and the most inveterate enemies of the Lord Jesus, will be such a stupendous manifestation of the power of God upon the spirits of men."
3. "So change the dominant mode of thinking and feeling on all spiritual things as to seem like a resurrection from the dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By their unbelief, the way had been opened to preach the gospel to the Gentiles; it was the occasion by which God sent it to the nations of the earth."
2. "One would have supposed that their rejection of the Messiah would have been an important obstacle in the way of the gospel. It was overruled, however, to promote its increase."
3. "The resurrection of the dead was an image of the most vast and wonderful event that could take place. This image, therefore, in the apostleâ€™s mind, was a striking illustration of the great change and reformation which should take place when the Jews should be restored, and the effect should be felt in the conversion also of the Gentile world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The casting away [Î· Î±Ï€Î¿Î²Î¿Î»Î·] ... exclusion from God's people." 
2. "Reconciling of the world [ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î»Î»Î±Î³Î· ÎºÎ¿ÏƒÎ¼Î¿Ï…] ... defining the phrase riches of the world."
3. "Life from the dead. The exact meaning cannot be determined... some refer it to the resurrection... others, a new spiritual life."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since the rejection of the Jews has availed so much as to occasion the reconciling of the Gentiles, how much more effectual will be their resumption? Will it not be to raise them even from the dead?"
2. "Since then God has wonderfully drawn forth life from death and light from darkness, how much more ought we to hope, he reasons, that the resurrection of a people, as it were, wholly dead, will bring life to the Gentiles."
3. "The restoration of the Jews unto God's favor will occasion the revival and spread of true religion through the whole Gentile world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their unbelief occasioned the preaching of â€˜reconciliationâ€™ to the Gentiles; many Gentiles were actually reconciled to God, and this was the token of the design and adaptation of the Gospel for the whole world."
2. "That they would be thus received, is the leading thought of the entire chapter."
3. "The Apostle has in mind something beyond 'the reconciliation of the world,' some greater blessing than the gradual conversion of the Gentiles through the gospel, and this he terms â€˜life from the dead.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The casting away of them." 
2. "The reconciling of the world."
3. "Life from the dead."

### John Gill:
1. "As the Gentiles received present advantage through the rejection of the Jews, they would receive far greater at their future recovery, and which proves that their rejection is not final..."
2. "If this was the case then, as it was, he asks what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead?"
3. "Their restoration will be as 'life from the dead'; which regards not so much the quickening of the Jews themselves, though their conversion will be, as the conversion of every sinner is, a resurrection from the death of sin to a life of grace..."

### John Wesley:
1. Life from the dead â€” Overflowing life to the world, which was dead.
