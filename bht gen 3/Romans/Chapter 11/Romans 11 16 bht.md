# Romans 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The metaphor of the first-fruit and the lump of dough illustrates that the consecration of the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, extended holiness to the entire nation of Israel. Just as the first-fruit offering sanctified the whole lump, the call and destination of the patriarchs implied their future restoration. This comparison emphasizes that God chose the Hebrew patriarchs to be a specially devoted people, set apart for Himself. The holiness of the patriarchs signified the holiness of the nation, conveying the idea that their descendants would also be made holy by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For if the first-fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root . . . so the branches." 
2. "The argument of the apostle is, that as the separation unto God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the rest of mankind, as the parent stem of their race, was as real an offering of first-fruits as that which hallowed the produce of the earth."
3. "The figure of the 'root' and its 'branches' is of like import‚Äîthe consecration of the one of them extending to the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The offering of this was regarded as rendering the mass holy, that is, it was lawful then to partake of it."
2. "The expression here...has reference to the small portion of dough or kneaded meal that was offered to God; and then the mass or lump œÜœÖÃÅœÅŒ±ŒºŒ± phurama was left for the use of him who made the offering."
3. "By this illustration Paul doubtless means to say that the Jewish nation, as a people, were set apart to the service of God, and were so regarded by him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The first - fruit - holy. See on James 1:18, Acts 26:10. Referring to the patriarchs."
2. "The reference here is to Numbers 14:18-21; according to which the Israelites were to set apart a portion of the dough of each baking of bread for a cake for the priests. This was called ajparch, first - fruits."
3. "The thought of both figures centres in holy. Both the first - fruits and the root represent the patriarchs (or Abraham singly, compare ver. 28). The holiness by call and destination of the nation as represented by its fathers (first - fruits, root) implies their future restoration, the holiness of the lump and branches."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us remember that in this comparison man is not compared with man, but nation with nation."

3. "The holiness here mentioned is external and relative, and not personal and inward, is evident from the whole context."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The firstfruit is holy. This is assumed, the reference being to the portion of dough taken as a peace-offering, so that the whole lump (of kneaded dough) from which it was taken was thereby consecrated."
2. "The ‚Äòfirstfruit,‚Äô it is generally agreed, refers to the patriarchs (some limit the application to Abraham), with whom the covenant was made by which Israel became the theocratic people."
3. "'God, in selecting the Hebrew patriarchs, and setting them apart for His service, had reference to their descendants, as well as to themselves; and designed that the Jews, as a people, should, to the latest generations, be specially devoted to Himself.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The metaphor is from Numbers 15:19. The LXX has Œ±œÄŒ±œÅœáŒ∑ŒΩ œÜœÖœÅŒ±ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ, first of the dough as a heave offering."
2. "The lump (œÑŒø œÜœÖœÅŒ±ŒºŒ±). From which the first fruit came."
3. "The root (Œ∑ œÅŒπŒ∂Œ±). Perhaps Abraham singly here. The metaphor is changed, but the idea is the same."

### John Gill:
1. "But by them are intended the first converts among the Jews, under the Gospel dispensation; it being usual with the apostle to call those persons, that were first converted in any place, the firstfruits of it."

2. "The consecration of them was esteemed the consecration of all."
