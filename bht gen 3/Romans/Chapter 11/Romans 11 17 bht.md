## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word 'some' depreciates the number, in order to check the Gentile pride."
2. "I believe that he does not here regard what is the fact in nature: but makes a supposition perfectly legitimate."
3. "With 'and,' it will mean, of the source of life, and also of the development of that life itself in all richness of blessing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If notwithstanding this consecration of Abraham's race to God."
2. "The mass of the unbelieving and rejected Israelites are here called 'some,' not, as before, to meet Jewish prejudice ... but with the opposite view of checking Gentile pride."
3. "Though it is more usual to graft the superior cutting upon the inferior stem, the opposite method, which is intended here, is not without example."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If some of the natural descendants of Abraham, the holy root, are cast off because they are unfruitful, that is, because of unbelief and sin."
2. "The Gentiles had been like the wild olive, unfruitful in holiness; that they had been uncultivated by the institutions of the true religion, and consequently had grown up in the wildness and sin of nature."
3. "The Gentiles had been grafted into this stock, and had restored the decayed vigor of the ancient people of God; and a fruitless church had become vigorous and flourishing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The ingrafting of the Gentiles took place at first only partially and in single instances; while the thou addressed cannot represent heathendom as a whole, and is also not appropriate to the figure itself."
2. "The life-force and the blessing are received by the Gentile through the Jew, and not by the Jew through the Gentile. The spiritual plan moves from the Abrahamic covenant downward, and from the Israelitish nation outward."
3. "It is only in the kingdom of grace that a process thus contrary to nature can be successful; and it is this circumstance which the apostle has seized upon to magnify the mercy shown to the Gentiles by grafting them, a wild race, contrary to the nature of such operations, into the good olive tree of the church, and causing them to flourish there and bring forth fruit unto eternal life."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whatever glory then they had was from their new insition, not from their old stock."
2. "There was then no reason for the Gentiles to glory in their own dignity in comparison with the Jews."
3. "The Apostle makes the stock good and the graft bad, and makes the stock to communicate its goodness to the graft and to improve the quality of its fruit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Some does not of itself indicate whether there were many or few; it was, however, probably chosen 'in order not to promote Gentile-Christian self-exaltation.'" 
2. "The Gentile scion was to receive, not to impart, fertility. Moreover Romans 11:24 shows that the Apostle conceives of the matter as taking place through grace and contrary to nature."
3. "The unity of the church in both dispensations is plainly asserted, and this overthrows all the assumptions of an antagonism between Paul and the Twelve, in regard to the relative position of the Jewish and Gentile Christians."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Some of the individual Jews (natural Israel) were broken off the stock of the tree (spiritual Israel)." 
2. "The ancients used the wild-olive graft upon an old olive tree to reinvigorate the tree precisely as Paul uses the figure here and that both the olive tree and the graft were influenced by each other."
3. "Paul expressly states that the grafting of Gentiles on to the stock of the spiritual Israel was 'contrary to nature'."

### John Gill:
1. "And if some of the branches be broken,.... This is to be understood, not of the exclusion of the Jews from their national church... but of their being left out of the Gospel church, gathered among them, they not believing in the Messiah..."
2. "and thou being a wild olive tree: speaking to the Gentiles, to some, not to all of them; for not a whole tree, but a part of one, what is cut out of it, a scion from it is grafted into another; and so they were a certain number which God took out from among the Gentiles, to be a people for his name and glory..."
3. "the Gentiles being grafted into a Gospel church state with the believing Jews, partook of the same root and fatness as they did, being built upon the same 'foundation of the apostles prophets', rooted, grounded, and built up in the same church state..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Had the graft been nobler than the stock, yet its dependance on it for life and nourishment would leave it no room to boast against it."
2. "How much less, when, contrary to what is practised among men, the wild olive tree is engrafted on the good!"
