# Romans 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some may boast and say that the branches were broken off so they could be grafted in, disregarding and showing contempt for the cast-off Jews. However, this presumption is misplaced, as their rejection was due to their unbelief, not to make way for the Gentiles. It is important to remember that faith should generate humility and fear, not pride and arrogance. The purpose of the Jews being rejected was to allow for the inclusion of the Gentiles, but this does not make the Jews more vile or the Gentiles more deserving.
