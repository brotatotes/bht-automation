# Romans 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you, a Gentile, were grafted into the good olive tree, contrary to nature, then it is even more expected and probable that the natural branches, the Jews, can be grafted back into their own olive tree. This ability of God to do what is contrary to natural processes is the essence of the argument. The olive tree is not just theirs, but ultimately it belongs to God, who remembers His covenant and has the power to bring about this restoration.
