2. "That hardening is come upon Israel in part, until the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in."
3. "In order to understand the fulness of the Gentiles, we must bear in mind the character of the Apostle‚Äôs present argument. He is dealing with nations: with the Gentile nations, and the Jewish nation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mystery does not mean something incomprehensible, but something before kept secret, either wholly or for the most part, and now only fully disclosed." 
2. "Lest you should be wise in your own conceits - as if ye alone were in all time coming to be the family of God."
3. "Until the Gentiles have had their full time of the visible Church all to themselves while the Jews are out, which the Jews had till the Gentiles were brought in."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine, that the division between the Jews and the Gentiles was to be broken down, is called a mystery, because it had been, to the times of the apostles, concealed, and was then revealed fully for the first time."
2. "Paul communicated the truth in regard to this, lest they should attempt to inquire into it; should speculate about the reason why God had rejected the Jews; and should he elated with the belief that they had, by their own skill and genius, ascertained the cause."
3. "Probably the meaning is, that this blindness is to continue until great numbers of the Gentiles shall be converted; until the gospel shall be extensively spread; and then the conversion of the Jews will be a part of the rapid spread of the gospel, and will be among the most efficient and important aids in completing the work."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mystery [ŒºœÖœÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ] ... secret purposes or counsels which God intends to carry into effect in His kingdom." 
2. "The word [œÜœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒºŒøŒπ] means practical wisdom, prudence; thus distinguished from sofia which is mental excellence in its highest and fullest sense."
3. "Not partial hardening, but hardening extending over a part."

### John Calvin:
1. "And whenever a long delay tempts us to despair, let us remember this word mystery; by which Paul clearly reminds us, that the mode of their conversion will neither be common nor usual; and hence they act absurdly who attempt to measure it by their own judgment; for what can be more unreasonable than to regard that as incredible which is far removed from our view?" 
2. "That God had in a manner so blinded Israel, that while they refused the light of the gospel, it might be transferred to the Gentiles, and that these might occupy, as it were, the vacated possession. And so this blindness served the providence of God in furthering the salvation of the Gentiles, which he had designed."
3. "The meaning then is, ‚Äî That God had in a manner so blinded Israel, that while they refused the light of the gospel, it might be transferred to the Gentiles, and that these might occupy, as it were, the vacated possession. And so this blindness served the providence of God in furthering the salvation of the Gentiles, which he had designed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‚ÄòThus it frequently denotes with Paul the divine counsel of redemption through Christ, as a whole, or in particular parts of it, because it was veiled from men before God revealed it."
2. "They were in danger of cherishing their own incorrect views in regard to the future of Israel; the Apostle would prevent this by telling them the truth revealed to him."
3. "No other explanation is grammatical; comp. Luke 21:24. Most modern commentators, though differing as to the exact sense of the word ‚Äòfulness,‚Äô agree in referring the phrase, ‚Äòthe fulness of the Gentiles,‚Äô to the totality of the Gentiles, not including every individual, but the nations as a whole."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not in the pagan sense of an esoteric doctrine for the initiated, unknown secrets, or like the mystery religions of the time, but the revealed will of God now made known to all."
2. "Paul refuses to believe that no more Jews will be saved."
3. "Until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in."

### John Gill:
1. "I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery."
2. "Blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in."
3. "Since the blindness of the Jews is not yet removed, it seems plain that the full number of God's chosen ones among the Gentiles is not yet completed in regeneration."

### John Wesley:
1. "Such had been the calling of the gentiles: such was now the conversion of the Jews."
2. "Lest ye should be wise in your own conceits ‚Äî Puffed up with your present advantages; dreaming that ye are the only church; or that the church of Rome cannot fail."
3. "Hardness in part is happened to Israel, till ‚Äî Israel therefore is neither totally nor finally rejected."

- Attempt 3 BHT: The mystery that the apostle Paul refers to in this verse is not something incomprehensible, but rather something that was once kept secret or hidden until now. The mystery is the plan of God to bring salvation to all nations, both Gentiles and Jews. Paul warns against being conceited and thinking that they alone are the chosen people of God, for there is a hardening that has come upon Israel in part, until the fullness of the Gentiles is brought in. This doesn't mean that no more Jews will be saved, but rather that the full number of God's chosen ones among the Gentiles is not yet completed. God has a plan to bring salvation to both Jew and Gentile, and we must humbly acknowledge His mysterious ways and trust in His providence.

This does not mean that no more Jews will be saved, rather it highlights God's providential plan to bring salvation to all nations, teaching us the importance of humility and trust in His mysterious ways.
