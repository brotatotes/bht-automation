Chrysostom... speaks of Elias himself, and of the conversion of the Jews... Theodoret and Gregory of Nyssa; so also Augustine... shall believe in Christ... Grotius and Wetstein believe it to have been fulfilled after the destruction of Jerusalem.",

Luther... spoke most characteristically and strongly of what he conceived to be the impossibility of such national conversion.",
            "Calvin says... the Jews also from their defection shall betake themselves to the obedience of the faith, and thus will be completed the salvation of all the Israel of God, which must be compounded of both... Beza, Tholuck, and many others, hold that the words refer, as I have explained them above, to a national restoration of Israel to God\u2019s favour."
