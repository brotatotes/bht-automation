## BHT:
According to various interpretations, this prophecy can be understood in different ways, such as the final purification of all men, the conversion of the Jews, or a national restoration of Israel to God's favor. As the deliverer comes to turn the rebellious ones to the law, Paul sees the fulfillment of this in Jesus as the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This prophecy has been very variously regarded... Origen... finds in the passage his notion of the final purification of all men... Chrysostom... speaks of Elias himself, and of the conversion of the Jews... Theodoret and Gregory of Nyssa; so also Augustine... shall believe in Christ... Grotius and Wetstein believe it to have been fulfilled after the destruction of Jerusalem."
2. "Tholuck has shewn that neither could the number of Gentiles received into the Church before that time have answered to the fulness of the Gentiles, nor those Jews to all Israel... he supposes the Apostle to have used in a spiritual sense, meaning the Israel of God... Luther... spoke most characteristically and strongly of what he conceived to be the impossibility of such national conversion."
3. "Calvin says... the Jews also from their defection shall betake themselves to the obedience of the faith, and thus will be completed the salvation of all the Israel of God, which must be compounded of both... Beza, Tholuck, and many others, hold that the words refer, as I have explained them above, to a national restoration of Israel to God‚Äôs favour."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It can only mean the ultimate ingathering of Israel as a nation, in contrast with the present 'remnant.'" 
2. "And whereas the prophet announces that He 'shall come to (or, 'for') them that turn from transgression in Jacob,' while the apostle makes Him say that He shall come 'to turn away ungodliness from Jacob,' this is taken from the Septuagint version, and seems to indicate a different reading of the original text."
3. "The sense, however, is substantially the same in both."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And so - That is, in this manner; or when the great abundance of the Gentiles shall be converted, then all Israel shall be saved."
2. "All Israel - All the Jews... He does not mean to say that every Jew of every age would be saved... Nor is it said when this would be."
3. "Shall be saved - Shall be recovered from their rejection; be restored to the divine favor; become followers of the Messiah, and thus be saved as all other Christians are."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The deliverer [Œø œÅœÖŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ] . The Hebrew is goel redeemer, avenger."
2. "The nearest relative of a murdered person, on whom devolved the duty of avenger, was called goel haddam avenger of blood."
3. "So the goel was the nearest kinsman of a childless widow, and was required to marry her (Deuteronomy 25:5-10)."

### John Calvin:
1. "When the Gentiles shall come in, the Jews also shall return from their defection to the obedience of faith; and thus shall be completed the salvation of the whole Israel of God." 
2. "The Israel of God is what he calls the Church, gathered alike from Jews and Gentiles; and he sets the people, thus collected from their dispersion, in opposition to the carnal children of Abraham, who had departed from his faith." 
3. "But though in this prophecy deliverance to the spiritual people of God is promised, among whom even Gentiles are included; yet as the Jews are the first-born, what the Prophet declares must be fulfilled, especially in them: for that Scripture calls all the people of God Israelites, is to be ascribed to the pre-eminence of that nation, whom God had preferred to all other nations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ancient people of God (so marvellously preserved in their distinctive life, as if in earnest of this) shall be restored, as a nation, to God‚Äôs favor."
2. "The attempt to fill it out has always produced a reaction, which has opposed even the obvious literal sense of the clause."
3. "But that prediction is made by the Apostle himself, who here presents a warrant for it, not its ground (so Tholuck and others)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But the spiritual Israel (both Jews and Gentiles) may be his idea in accord with Romans 9:6 (Galatians 6:16) as the climax of the argument."
2. "At any rate we should strive for and pray for the conversion of Jews as a whole."
3. "Paul interprets it of Jesus as Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "Meaning not the mystical spiritual Israel of God, consisting both of Jews and Gentiles, who shall appear to be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation, when all God's elect among the latter are gathered in."
2. "when, their number being as the sand of the sea, they shall come up out of the lands where they are dispersed, and appoint them one head, Christ, and great shall be the day of Jezreel; when they as a body, even the far greater part of them that shall be in being, shall return and seek the Lord their God, and David their King; shall acknowledge Jesus to be the true Messiah, and shall look to him, believe on him, and be saved by him from wrath to come."
3. "The apostle follows the translation of the Septuagint, and which is favoured by the Chaldee paraphrase, which runs thus; 'the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to turn the rebellious ones of the house of Jacob to the law'; so that the Jew f has no reason to charge the apostle with a perversion of the prophet's words, when they are cited so agreeably to their own Targumist."

### John Wesley:
1. "And so all Israel shall be saved ‚Äî Being convinced by the coming of the gentiles. But there will be a still larger harvest among the gentiles, when all Israel is come in."
2. "The deliverer shall come ‚Äî Yea, the deliverer is come; but not the full fruit of his coming."
3. "Isaiah 59:20"
