### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 3. and I am left alone‚Äî"I
	only am left."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact was true that they had killed the prophets, etc.; 1 Kings 18:4, 1 Kings 18:13; but the inference which Elijah seems to have drawn from it, that there were no pious people in the nation, was not well founded."
2. "And digged down - Altars, by the Law of Moses, were required to be made of earth or unhewn stones; Exodus 20:24-25. Hence, the expression to dig them down means completely to demolish or destroy them."
3. "There could scarcely be conceived a time of greater distress and declension in religion than this. It has not often happened that so many things that were disheartening have occurred to the church at the same period of time."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Life [œàœÖœáŒ∑ŒΩ] . From yucw to breathe or blow. In classical usage it signifies life in the distinctness of individual existence, especially of man, occasionally of brutes. Hence, generally, the life of the individual."
2. "Soul [œàœÖœáŒ∑] , of itself, does not constitute personality, but only when it is the soul of a human being. Human personality is derived from spirit [œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±] , and finds expression in soul or life [œàœÖœáŒ∑]."
3. "Yuch soul is thus: 1. The individual life, the seat of the personality. 2. The subject of the life, the person in which it dwells. 3. The mind as the sentient principle, the seat of sensation and desire."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The plural points to the altars as the high places in the kingdom of Israel where Elijah lived. Although it was originally forbidden to erect such altars, they became the only places in Israel where Jehovah was publicly worshipped."
2. "The language of Elijah meant that he was the only prophet left; while the transposition of the clauses suggests here the further notion: I am the only true worshipper of Jehovah."
3. "It is not necessary to suppose that the Apostle has departed from the original sense."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They have digged down (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœÉŒ∫Œ±œàŒ±ŒΩ). First aorist active indicative of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉŒ∫Œ±œÄœÑœâ, to dig under or down."
2. "Altars (Œ∏œÖœÉŒπŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒ±). Late word (LXX, Philo, Josephus, N.T. eccl. writers) from Œ∏œÖœÉŒπŒ±Œ∂œâ, to sacrifice."
3. "It is not possible to draw a clear distinction between œàœÖœáŒ∑ (soul) and œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ± (spirit)."

### John Gill:
1. "Lord, they have killed thy prophets... This sin of slaying the prophets of the Lord is charged upon the Jews by Christ"
2. "And digged down thine altars... the pulling of them down was done in contempt of them, and of the worship of God"
3. "I am left alone... imagining that he was the only person in Israel, that had a true zeal for the Lord of hosts"

### John Wesley:
1. 1Kings 19:10.
