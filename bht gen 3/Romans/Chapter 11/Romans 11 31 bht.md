# Romans 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the mercy shown to the Gentiles, Israel as a nation is intended to recover. The unbelief of the Jews has allowed the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, who will, in turn, play a role in bringing salvation to the Jews. Although both parties have been disobedient at different times, the present blindness and unbelief of the Jews should not hinder them from obtaining mercy through the mercy shown to the Gentiles. Even in their unbelief, God's purpose is for the Jews to receive a blessing and be called into His kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here is an entirely new idea."
2. "The mercy shown to the Gentiles as a means of Israel's recovery."
3. "By the instrumentality of believing Gentiles, Israel as a nation is at length to 'look on Him whom they have pierced and mourn for Him,' and so to 'obtain mercy.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The immediate effect of the unbelief of the Jews was to confer salvation on the Gentiles, or to open the way for the preaching of the gospel to them."
2. "Each party should thus cause salvation to come to the other - the Jews to the Gentiles by their unbelief; but the Gentiles, in their turn, to the Jews by their belief."
3. "The time is coming when the promises of God in regard to them shall be fulfilled. Christians shall be moved with deep compassion for the degraded and forsaken Jews, and they shall be called into the kingdom of God, and made efficient agents in extending the gospel through the whole world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "So also; the cases are parallel."
2. "Have these (Jews) now, since the gospel of Christ was preached, been disobedient; lit., â€˜were disobedient,â€™ as in Romans 11:30, but â€˜nowâ€™ compels us to render â€˜have been disobedient.â€™"
3. "That, in order that, by the mercy shown to you (lit. â€˜your mercy;â€™ in emphatic position in the original) they also may now obtain mercy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By the mercy shown to you."
2. "God's purpose is for the Jews to receive a blessing yet."

### John Gill:
1. "Now is the time of the Jews' unbelief, blindness has happened to them, the vail is over their hearts..."
2. "They do not believe God in Christ; nor that he is the Father of Christ; or that Christ is the Son of God, the true Messiah, and Saviour of the world."
3. "The apostle's argument in favor of the call and conversion of the Jews, upon the whole is this, that since the unbelief of the Gentiles was no bar to their obtaining mercy, and that through the infidelity of the Jews; then it cannot be thought, that the present blindness, hardness of heart, enmity, and unbelief, which now attend the Jews, can be any obstacle to their obtaining mercy in the same way the Gentiles have; but as the one has been, the other also will be."
