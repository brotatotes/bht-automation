## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No mere permissive act of God must here be understood. The Apostle is speaking of the divine arrangement, by which the guilt of sin and the mercy of God were to be made manifest."
2. "But the ultimate difference between the all men who are shut up under disobedience, and the all men upon whom mercy is shown is, that by all men this mercy is not accepted, and so men become self-excluded from the salvation of God."
3. "GODâ€™s ACT remains the same, equally gracious, equally universal, whether men accept His mercy or not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For God hath concluded them all in unbelief"
2. "he might have mercy upon all"
3. "Certainly it is not 'all mankind individually'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Scripture is declared to have shut them up under sin, that is, declared them to be sinners; gave no hope of rescue by any works of their own."
2. "All are represented, therefore, as in prison, enclosed or confined by God, and to be liberated only in his own way and time."
3. "The emphasis in this verse is on the word 'mercy.' It signifies that God is under obligation to no one, and therefore that all are saved by grace, because all are equally ruined."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The person of Christ was only touching bodily substance concluded within the grave."
2. "All [the all]. The totality, Jews and Gentiles, jointly and severally."
3. "Some explain in the later Greek sense, to hand over to a power which holds in ward."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is nothing in any man why he should be preferred to others, apart from the mere favor of God."
2. "God in the dispensation of his grace, is under no restraint that he should not grant it to whom he pleases."
3. "Paul simply means that both Jews and Gentiles do not otherwise obtain salvation than through the mercy of God, and thus he leaves to none any reason for complaint."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God shut up all; not, â€˜hath concluded them all.â€™ The verb means â€˜to shut upâ€™ as in a prison (not necessarily â€˜shut up togetherâ€™); â€˜hathâ€™ is unnecessary, and â€˜themâ€™ is improperly supplied, as if the Jews only were meant. â€˜Allâ€™ refers, however, to persons."
2. "He orders all things so that this result occurs with the further purpose, that he might have mercy upon all. This gracious design has already been indicated in Romans 11:30-31."
3. "The universality of sin is overborne by the universality of Divine grace; comp. chap. Romans 5:12 ff.; 1 Corinthians 15:21-22. Here this universality is presented mainly with reference to the proffering of mercy, not its efficiency."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is a resultant (effective) aorist because of the disbelief and disobedience of both Gentile and Jew."
2. "All (both Gentiles and Jews)."
3. "No merit in anyone, but all of grace."

### John Gill:
1. "Rather it seems to be taken from a prison, and Jews and Gentiles are represented as prisoners, and unbelief the prison, in which they are shut up by God."
2. "Not that God is the author of unbelief, or of any other sin in men; he does not put it into them, or them into that, but finding them in unbelief, concludes them in it."
3. "To be 'concluded in unbelief', is the same as to be 'concluded under sin',... to be held and bound down by such a sense of it in the conscience, as to see no way to escape deserved punishment, or to obtain salvation, but by fleeing to the mercy of God in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "For God hath shut up all together in disobedience â€” Suffering each in their turn to revolt from him."
2. "First, God suffered the gentiles in the early age to revolt, and took the family of Abraham as a peculiar seed to himself."
3. "This was truly a mystery in the divine conduct, which the apostle adores with such holy astonishment."
