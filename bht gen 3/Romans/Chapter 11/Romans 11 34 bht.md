# Romans 11:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who can fully know the mind of the Lord? No one has counseled Him or measured His Spirit. The wisdom and knowledge of God surpass human understanding, and His decisions are not shaped by human advice. Earthly rulers may seek counsel, but God stands alone in His wisdom. His plans are flawless and His ways are beyond our comprehension. Our attempts to reason about the mysteries of God without the guidance of the Holy Spirit are futile. We can only have a partial understanding, for predestination is based on God's secret and unchangeable will.

2. "...even by these they are not known perfectly, only in part, and are seen through a glass darkly."
3. "From the whole it appears, that predestination is not according to men's works, or the foresight of them; for then these things would be plain and easy, they would not be unsearchable and past finding out; there would not be an unfathomable depth in them; the mind and counsels of God, and the springs of them, would be obvious; but it is according to his secret, sovereign, and unchangeable will."

### John Wesley:
1. Who hath known the mind of the Lord â€” Before or any farther than he has revealed it. Isaiah 40:13.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Who can truly comprehend the mind of the Lord? No one can claim to have counseled with Him or have measured His Spirit. God's wisdom and knowledge are beyond our reach, and His decisions are not influenced by the opinions of man. Earthly rulers may seek the advice of counselors, but God stands alone in His wisdom. His plans are perfect and His ways are unsearchable. It is futile for us to try to reason about the mysteries of God without the help of the Holy Spirit. We can only have a partial understanding of His vastness, as His ways are revealed to us. Indeed, predestination is not based on human works or foresight, but on God's secret, sovereign, and unchangeable will.
