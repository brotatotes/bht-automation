# Romans 11:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who has anticipated God and given Him a gift, that He should repay them? This question refers to the freeness and richness of God's mercy and love. Paul is showing that no one can plead their own merits or claim entitlement to God's favors. All the favors of salvation must be bestowed by God's mercy and grace, and He has the right to bestow them as He pleases. It is not in our power to constrain God by our good works, but rather He anticipates the undeserving by His gratuitous goodness. We cannot take away God's right to determine freely regarding His own creatures; there is no mutual debt or credit between us and Him. God cannot be charged with unrighteousness, for He owes nothing to anyone. In the end, men's good works do not give anything to God or lay Him under obligation. God is indebted to none and may do what He will with His own.
