# Romans 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation must be distinguished between grace and works, for they are opposite and distinct. If salvation is by grace, it cannot be based on works, since grace loses its specific character. Salvation is solely ascribed to the grace of God, and any attempt to merge works with grace is futile. Let us hold firmly to the truth that salvation is solely by grace, or else grace would lose its nature and cease to be grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let. these two terms be regarded as, and kept, distinct from one another, and do not let us attempt to mix them, and so destroy the meaning of each."
2. "The object being precision, it is much more probable that the Apostle should have written both clauses in their present formal parallelism, and that the second should have been early omitted from its seeming superfluity, than that it should have been inserted from the margin."
3. "These cautions of the Apostle are decisive against all attempts at compromise between the two great antagonist hypotheses, of salvation by Godâ€™s free grace, and salvation by manâ€™s meritorious works."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That there are but two possible sources of salvationâ€”men's works, and God's grace and that these are so essentially distinct and opposite, that salvation cannot be of any combination or mixture of both, but must be wholly either of the one or of the other."
2. "If it (the election) be by grace, it is no more of works for [then] grace becomes no more grace."
3. "The general position here laid down is of vital importance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the fact that any are reserved be by grace, or favor, then it cannot be as a reward of merit."
2. "The idea of being saved by merit contradicts the very idea of grace."
3. "And from this it follows that salvation cannot be partly by grace and partly by works."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grace is no more, etc. [Î³Î¹Î½ÎµÏ„Î±Î¹] . Lit., becomes. No longer comes into manifestation as what it really is."
2. "It gives up its specific character" (Meyer).
3. "But if of works, etc. The best texts omit to the end of the verse."

### John Calvin:
1. "For whether you introduce works future or past, this declaration of Paul opposes you; for he says, that grace leaves nothing to works."
2. "It hence follows, that it is absurd to blend foreknowledge of works with election."
3. "Whenever it is declared that there are no merits of works, our salvation is ascribed to the grace of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'No longerâ€™ is logical, not temporal; â€˜worksâ€™ are entirely excluded in this matter of the remnant existing according to the election of grace."
2. "'Becomethâ€™ is not only more literal than â€˜is,â€™ but suggests as the more exact sense that in such a case grace would fail to show itself as what it is; â€˜positively expressed: it becomes what according to its essence it is not; it gives up its specific characterâ€™ (Meyer)."
3. "The emphasis placed at this point on the doctrine of free grace is doubtless to prepare for what follows: the reference to the many rejected (Romans 11:7-10), as well as the statement of the final solution (Romans 11:11-32), are based on the sovereignty of God in His dealings."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No longer becomes grace, loses its character as grace."
2. "Gratia nisi gratis sit gratia non est."
3. "(since), 'since, in that case.'"

### John Gill:
1. "If election is 'by grace', as it certainly is; for no other reason can be given why God has chose one, and not another, but his own sovereign pleasure, or that free favour and unmerited love, with which he loves one and not another."
2. "Grace is not grace, unless it is altogether freed; it will lose its nature, and ought to change its name, and be no more called or reckoned grace, but a due debt."
3. "These things are contrary to one another; and so unalienable and unalterable in their natures, that the one cannot pass into the other, or the one be joined with the other, in this or any other part of man's salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "And if by grace, then it is no more of works â€” Whether ceremonial or moral."
2. "Else grace is no longer grace â€” The very nature of grace is lost."
3. "And if it be of works, then it is no more grace: else work is no longer work â€” But the very nature of it is destroyed."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Salvation is a matter of precision, and it is vital to distinguish between grace and works, for they are essentially distinct and opposite. Salvation cannot be a combination or mixture of both, but must be wholly of one or the other. If salvation is by God's free grace, it cannot be based on man's meritorious works, for then grace loses its specific character and becomes something other than itself. The very essence of grace is that it is undeserved favor, and to introduce works into the equation is to contradict the concept of grace. Salvation is ascribed solely to the grace of God, and any attempt to blend works with grace is absurd. Therefore, let us firmly hold to the truth that salvation is by grace alone, or else grace would lose its nature and cease to be grace.
