# Romans 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Israel, in its search for righteousness, has not obtained what it seeks. However, the elect among them have found it. The rest, who were hardened in their hearts, became blinded to the truth. The election refers to those chosen by God, the remnant who have obtained His favor. The hardened ones, or the non-elect, have been forsaken by God and are incapable of obtaining anything but a curse. The salvation and favor of God do not depend on human efforts, but solely on His grace.

3. "Were blinded [ŒµœÄœâœÅœâŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ] . Rev., correctly, hardened, though the word is used of blindness when applied to the eyes, as Job 17:7, Sept. See on hardness, Mark 3:5. Compare sklhrunei hardeneth, Romans 9:18."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
