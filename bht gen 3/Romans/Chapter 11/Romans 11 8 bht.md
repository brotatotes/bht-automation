# Romans 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this context, God is portrayed as the agent behind the hardening of hearts, giving some a spirit of stupor that renders them unable to perceive the truth. This spiritual insensibility acts as a consequence for their rejection of the gospel. The notion of stupor refers to a state of numbness, comparable to being stupefied by wine or overwhelmed by astonishment. This state of spiritual slumber persists until the present day, just as it did during the time of Isaiah and Moses. Ultimately, those who refuse the truth are handed over to their own spiritual apathy, where they are incapable of recognizing the true beauty of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Were hardened is passive, and implies God as the agent." 
2. "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear." 
3. "The words in Deuteronomy...are adduced by St. Paul as applying to the day then present, as they did to the when Moses spoke them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 8. as it is writtenâ€” (Isaiah 29:10;
	Deuteronomy 29:4). 
	
God hath givenâ€”"gave"
	
them the spirit of
	slumberâ€”"stupor" 
	
unto this dayâ€”"this
	present day."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are blinded in accordance with what is written. The fact and the manner accord with the ancient declaration."
2. "God is represented as having an agency in producing the wickedness and stupidity of sinners."
3. "Though they had all the proper faculties for understanding and receiving the gospel, yet they rejected it. They were stupid and insensible to its claims and its truths."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Slumber. Only here in the New Testament. Lit., pricking or piercing, compunction." 
2. "Rev. renders stupor, the secondary meaning; properly the stupefaction following a wound or blow." 
3. "Hath given [Î¿Î´Ï‰ÎºÎµÎ½]. Heb., poured out. Sept., given to drink."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he does not call it the spirit of giddiness, but of compunction, when the bitterness of gall shows itself; yea, when there is also a fury in rejecting the truth." (Commentary)
2. "And he declares, that by the secret judgment of God the reprobate are so demented, that being stupified, they are incapable of forming a judgment; for when it is said, that by seeing they see nothing, the dullness of their senses is thereby intimated." (Commentary)
3. "Then Paul himself adds, to this very day, lest any one should object and say, that this prophecy had been formerly fulfilled, and that it was therefore absurd to apply it to the time of the gospel." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The rest were hardened, what had occurred in Old Testament times was not only analogous, but pointed to this punishment of the Jews, the agreement being 'that of prophecy and fulfilment according to the divine theology.'" 
2. "He gave them a spirit of stupor. 'Stupor' (a word found only here) meant first the numbness produced by stupefying wine, the corresponding verb being applied to the paralyzing from astonishment or grief."
3. "Unto this present day is a strengthening of the words of Deuteronomy 29:24, and should be joined with what immediately precedes. The fact that Isaiah repeats substantially what Moses previously said, justifies the application of this principle to the attitude of the mass of the Jews in the Apostleâ€™s day. Clearly then God punishes men by giving them over to spiritual insensibility."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A spirit of stupor. The torpor seems the result of too much sensation, dulled by incitement into apathy."
2. "That they should not see. Genitive articular infinitive of negative purpose."
3. "That they should not hear. See Stephen's speech."

### John Gill:
1. "God hath given them the spirit of slumber; or of stupidity and insensibility, so that they were as persons in a deep sleep; their senses locked up, without any knowledge of, or concern about, the danger they were in."
2. "eyes that they should not see; which being closed by the deep sleep and stupidity of mind they were judicially given up to, could see no beauty in Christ."
3. "and ears that they should not hear; for persons in a sleep, as their eyes are closed that they cannot see, so their ears are stopped that they cannot hear."

### John Wesley:
1. God hath at length withdrawn his Spirit, and so given them up to a spirit of slumber; which is fulfilled unto this day. Isaiah 29:10

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Romans 11:8, the Apostle Paul writes that God has hardened the hearts of some, giving them a spirit of stupor, causing them to be unable to see or hear the truth. This hardening is a result of their rejection of the gospel, as Isaiah and Deuteronomy foretold. The use of stupor in this context means a numbing or paralyzing effect, akin to being stupefied by wine or overcome by astonishment. This spiritual insensibility is a punishment from God, as He withdraws His Spirit and allows them to dwell in a state of slumber. This spiritual blindness and deafness continues even to the present day, as it did in the time of Isaiah and Moses. Ultimately, God punishes those who reject the truth by giving them over to their own spiritual apathy and incapacity to discern the beauty of Christ.
