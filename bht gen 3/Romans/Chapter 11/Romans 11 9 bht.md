# Romans 11:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let their table, their very blessings, become a snare, a trap, and a stumbling block to them. As the Psalmist warns, may their enjoyments only sting and take vengeance on them. This imprecation remains for the adversaries of Christ, for those who reject Him. Just as the rejecters of Christ become ensnared by their presumptuous security, let their very blessings prove to be their recompense for their wickedness. May we embrace God's grace and avoid the curse that befalls those who reject Christ.
