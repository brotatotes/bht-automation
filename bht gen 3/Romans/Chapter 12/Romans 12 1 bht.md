# Romans 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In offering ourselves as living sacrifices to God, we respond to His mercies by dedicating our entire being to Him. This act of worship is not confined to external rituals but encompasses the sanctification of our whole person. It is a rational and reasonable service, prompted by the compassion of God. As we refrain from evil, sinful works and honor God with our thoughts, words, and actions, we become a pleasing and acceptable offering, made possible by the saving work of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for our sins.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What the eye is in the body, that faith is to the soul, and the knowledge of divine things. Yet it has need of practical virtue, as the eye has need of hands and feet and the other parts of the body." 
2. "How can the body become a sacrifice? Let the eye look upon nothing evil, and it has become a sacrifice: let the tongue speak nothing shameful, and it has become an offering: let the hand do nothing unlawful, and it has become a burnt-offering."
3. "Our great sacrifice, the Lord Jesus, having been slain for us, and by the shedding of His Blood perfect remission having been obtained by the mercies of God, we are now enabled to be offered to God no longer by the shedding of blood, but as living sacrifices."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sanctification extends to the whole man."
2. "The death of the one 'Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world,' has swept all dead victims from off the altar of God, to make room for the redeemed themselves as 'living sacrifices' to Him."
3. "The presentation of ourselves, as living monuments of redeeming mercy, is here called 'our rational service'; and surely it is the most rational and exalted occupation of God's reasonable creatures."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "None of the doctrines of the gospel are designed to be cold and barren speculations. They bear on the hearts and lives of people; and the apostle therefore calls on those to whom he wrote to dedicate themselves without reserve unto God." 
2. "The sacrifice is to be free from sin. It is not to be a divided, and broken, and polluted service. It is to be with the best affections of our hearts and lives."
3. "To please him should be our highest aim; the fact that we do please him is our highest reward."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I use the compassion of God to move you to present, etc."
2. "How can the body become a sacrifice? Let the eye look on no evil, and it is a sacrifice. Let the tongue utter nothing base, and it is an offering. Let the hand work no sin, and it is a holocaust."
3. "Reasonable, not in the popular sense of the term, but rational, as distinguished from merely external or material."

### John Calvin:
1. "But this exhortation teaches us, that until men really apprehend how much they owe to the mercy of God, they will never with a right feeling worship him, nor be effectually stimulated to fear and obey him."
2. "It is enough for the Papists, if they can extort by terror some sort of forced obedience, I know not what. But Paul, that he might bind us to God, not by servile fear, but by the voluntary and cheerful love of righteousness, allures us by the sweetness of that favor, by which our salvation is effected; and at the same time he reproaches us with ingratitude, except we, after having found a Father so kind and bountiful, do strive in our turn to dedicate ourselves wholly to him."
3. "Without faith and repentance, and a reformed life, they were not accepted, but regarded as abominations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'He who is rightly moved by the mercy of God, enters into the entire will of God'." 
2. "A living sacrifice; over against the Levitical offerings, which were to be slain. We indeed die to sin, but live unto God."
3. "That of the new covenant, just described, is characterized as â€˜rational,â€™ which seems to be nearly equivalent to â€˜spiritual', over against the external, fleshly service."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By means of the mercies of God" as shown in his argument and in our lives. (Commentary)
2. "A living sacrifice...Not a propitiatory sacrifice, but one of praise." (Commentary)
3. "Your rational (spiritual) service (worship)." (Commentary)

### John Gill:
1. "that since all things are of God, and by him and to him, then the saints ought to present their bodies to him, and to know, approve, and do his will"
2. "presenting of themselves in the performance of religious duties, as springs from a principle of life under the quickening influences of the Spirit of God, with faith and fervency"
3. "such service is also agreeably to the Scriptures of truth, the standard of filth and practice, and contain and enforce nothing but what is highly reasonable to be complied with"

### John Wesley:
1. "By the tender mercies of God...delivering us from 'the wrath of God,' and exciting us to all duty."
2. "To present...yourselves; a part is put for the whole...in opposition to that vile abuse of their bodies mentioned."
3. "A sacrifice...dead to sin and living...holy...acceptable...which is your reasonable service."
