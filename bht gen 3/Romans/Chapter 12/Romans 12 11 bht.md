## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in diligence (or, zeal: not ‚Äòbusiness,‚Äô as A.V., which seems to refer it to the affairs of this life, whereas it relates, as all these in verses 11, 12, 13, to Christian duties as such: as ‚Äòfervency of spirit,‚Äô ‚Äòacting as God‚Äôs servants,‚Äô ‚Äòrejoicing in hope,‚Äô&c.) not slothful; in spirit, fervent"
2. "There is a remarkable variety in reading here. Some of our ancient MSS. here have kairo, 'time,' instead of kurio, 'Lord,' 'serving the time,' or, 'the opportunity.' But the weight of external authority is strongly in favour of the ordinary reading. The balance of internal probability, though not easy at once to settle, is I am persuaded on the same side."
3. "The present subject is, the character of our zeal for God. In it we are not to be slothful, but fervent in spirit,‚Äîand that, as servants of God. A very similar reminiscence of this relation to God occurs Col. iii. 22‚Äì24."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not slothful in business‚ÄîThe word rendered 'business' means 'zeal,' 'diligence,' 'purpose'; denoting the energy of action." 
2. "Serving the Lord‚Äîthat is, the Lord Jesus."
3. "Another reading‚Äî'serving the time,' or 'the occasion'‚Äîwhich differs in form but very slightly from the received reading, has been adopted by good critics. But as manuscript authority is decidedly against it, so is internal evidence; and comparatively few favor it. Nor is the sense which it yields a very Christian one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The tendency of the Christian religion is to promote industry... An idle man and a Christian are names which do not harmonize."
2. "All that would be needful to transform the idle, and vicious, and wretched, into sober and useful people, would be to give to them the spirit of the Christian religion."
3. "The right discharge of our duties in the various employments of life is to be regarded as serving God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In regard to zeal, be not lazy." 
2. "In diligence." 
3. "Fervent."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought in many things to forget ourselves; for except we be in earnest, and diligently strive to shake off all sloth, we shall never be rightly prepared for the service of Christ."
2. "Diligence in doing good requires that zeal which the Spirit of God kindles in our hearts."
3. "It hence becomes us to show more alacrity in the performance of our duty... to know how to accommodate ourselves to the time, which is a matter of great importance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In whatever Christian duty requires your diligence, do not be slothful."
2. "The figure is that of seething, boiling like a hot spring; hence the human spirit is meant, but the regenerated human spirit, since Christians are addressed."
3. "In whatever we find to do we are not only to be active, but to have a spiritual enthusiasm, which is prompted by the knowledge that all our doing, however humble, is in the service of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Slothful (ŒøŒ∫ŒΩŒ∑œÅŒø). Old adjective from ŒøŒ∫ŒΩŒµœâ, to hesitate, to be slow. Slow and "poky" as in Matthew 25:26. 


### John Gill:
1. "Not slothful in business... men should diligently pursue their lawful callings for the support of themselves and families... but spiritual business, the affairs of piety and religion, the service of God, private and public, to which we should not be backward, nor slothful in the performance of."
2. "Fervent in spirit; in their own spirits, for the glory of God, the honour of Christ, and the cause of religion... or else in the Spirit of God... this will make a man's spirit fervent in the service of God."
3. "Serving the Lord... redeeming the time, improving every season to do good, and taking every opportunity of serving God."

### John Wesley:
1. Whatsoever ye do, do it with your might. In every business diligently and fervently serving the Lord - Doing all to God, not to man.
