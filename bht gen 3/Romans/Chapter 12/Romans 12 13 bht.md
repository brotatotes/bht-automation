# Romans 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to pursue hospitality, actively seeking opportunities to show kindness and provide for those in need. This means going beyond practicing hospitality, but rather running after and tracking down those who are in need. In times of persecution or limited resources, this duty takes on even greater importance. By sharing in the necessities of fellow believers and extending kindness to strangers, we demonstrate genuine love and trust in God. Let us actively pursue hospitality, relieving the needs of our brothers and sisters in Christ.
