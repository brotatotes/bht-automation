We are called to embody a beautiful spirit of sympathy, rejoicing with those who rejoice and weeping with those who weep. This unselfish character belongs to all living Christianity, and when it becomes the reigning spirit of the world, it will be a glorious place.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What a beautiful spirit of sympathy with the joys and sorrows of others is here inculcated!"
2. "But it is only one charming phase of the unselfish character which belongs to all living Christianity."
3. "What a world will ours be when this shall become its reigning spirit! Of the two, however, it is more easy to sympathize with another's sorrows than his joys, because in the one case he needs us; in the other not. But just for this reason, the latter is the more disinterested, and so the nobler."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this way happiness diffuses and multiplies itself. It becomes expanded over the face of the whole society; and the union of the Christian body tends to enlarge the sphere of happiness and to prolong the joy conferred by religion."
2. "Nothing is so well suited to [diminish sorrow] as the sympathy of those we love. All who are afflicted know how much it diminishes their sorrow to see others sympathizing with them, and especially those who evince in their sympathies the Christian spirit."
3. "It may be added that it is the special duty of Christians to sympathize in each otherâ€™s griefs."

### John Calvin:
1. "For such is the nature of true love, that one prefers to weep with his brother, rather than to look at a distance on his grief." 
2. "What is meant then is, â€” that we, as much as possible, ought to sympathize with one another, and that, whatever our lot may be, each should transfer to himself the feeling of another, whether of grief in adversity, or of joy in prosperity." 
3. "Let there be such a sympathy among us as may at the same time adapt us to all kinds of feelings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Romans 12:14 defines the proper conduct in relation to personal antipathy; Romans 12:15, the proper conduct in relation to personal sympathy."
2. "Sympathy is not less difficult than forgiveness. The latter is less active than the former, and may exist when the range of Christian feeling is too limited for wide and quick sympathy."
3. "Forgetfulness of self is the basis of both virtues."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Rejoicing with rejoicing people, weeping with weeping people."
2. "Rejoicing with rejoicing people."
3. "Weeping with weeping people."

### John Gill:
1. "Rejoice with them that do rejoice...in things good and laudable...in hope of the glory of God; when such souls make their boast in the Lord, the humble hearing thereof will be glad."
2. "unless persons have a near concern in the prosperity of others, they are very apt to envy it, or to murmur and repine."
3. "The design of these rules is to excite and encourage sympathy in the saints with each other, in all conditions inward and outward, and with respect to things temporal and spiritual."

### John Wesley:
1. Rejoice â€” The direct opposite to weeping is laughter; but this does not so well suit a Christian.
