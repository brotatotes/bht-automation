## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The more difficult this duty, the more affectionately does the Apostle address his readers, with this word."
2. "Give wrath room: 'proceed not to execute it hastily, but leave it for its legitimate time, when He whose it is to avenge, will execute it: make not the wrath your own, but leave it for God.'"
3. "Some Fathers interpret it, 'yield to the anger (of your adversary);' but this meaning for the words is hardly borne out."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But give room or space for wrath to spend itself."
2. "But as the context shows that the injunction is to leave vengeance to God, 'wrath' here seems to mean, not the offense, which we are tempted to avenge, but the avenging wrath of God."
3. "This is usually taken to mean, 'but give room or space for wrath to spend itself.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The command here 'not to avenge ourselves' means, that we are not to take it out of the hands of God, or the hands of the law, and to inflict it ourselves."
2. "To 'give place' is to leave it for God to come in and execute wrath or vengeance on the enemy. Do not execute wrath; leave it to God; commit all to him; leave yourself and your enemy in his hands, assured that he will vindicate you and punish him."
3. "This assurance will sustain us, not in the 'desire' that our enemy shall be punished, but in the belief that 'God' will take the matter into his own hands; that he can administer it better than we can; and that if our enemy 'ought' to be punished, he will be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Give place unto wrath. Give room for it to work. Do not get in its way."
2. "Vengeance belongeth unto Me."
3. "The idea of personal vindictiveness must be eliminated from the word here. It is rather full meting out of justice to all parties."

### John Calvin:
1. "The evil which he corrects here, as we have reminded you, is more grievous than the preceding, which he has just stated; and yet both of them arise from the same fountain, even from an inordinate love of self and innate pride, which makes us very indulgent to our own faults and inexorable to those of others."
2. "But he prohibits here, not only that we are not to execute revenge with our own hands, but that our hearts also are not to be influenced by a desire of this kind: it is therefore superfluous to make a distinction here between public and private revenge..."
3. "The subject is, that a Christian is not to retaliate, or to return wrath for wrath, but to endure the wrath of his enemy, and to leave the matter in the hand of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Avenge not yourselves, beloved. We restore the Greek order; the address becomes more affectionate, in order to press lovingly the snore difficult duty."
2. "But rather (or, on the contrary) give place unto the wrath of God. This seems to be the only sense consistent with what follows. Let Godâ€™s wrath take its course, do not attempt to execute it yourself."
3. "For it is written (Deuteronomy 32:35), Vengeance is mine, I will recompense again, saith the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Give room for the wrath of God instead of taking vengeance in your own hands."
2. "Socrates and Epictetus condemned personal vindictiveness as Paul does here."
3. "I will recompense."

### John Gill:
1. "This only forbids and condemns private revenge in private persons, for private injuries done, and affronts given."
2. "Let him sit down and breathe upon it; let him 'give' space unto it, as the Syriac, which may signify time as well as place; and by taking time his wrath will subside, he will cool and come to himself, and think better on it."
3. "Commit yourselves to him that judgeth righteously, and never think of avenging your own wrongs."

### John Wesley:
1. "Dearly beloved â€” So he softens the rugged spirit."
2. "Revenge not yourselves, but leave that to God."
3. "Leave room for wrath; that is, the wrath of God, to whom vengeance properly belongs."
