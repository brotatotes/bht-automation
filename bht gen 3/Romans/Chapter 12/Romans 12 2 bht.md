# Romans 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The renewing of our mind is the instrument by which the metamorphosis takes place, as we discern and prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. This transformation requires an inward spiritual transfiguration that makes our whole life new, unattainable without the constraining power of Christ's love. We are called to dedicate our whole being to Him, not conforming to the ways of this world but being fashioned by the renewing of our mind, living a life that is good, acceptable, and perfect in God's eyes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The renewing of your mind is not the instrument by which, but the manner in which the metamorphosis takes place: that wherein it consists." 
2. "That ye may discern, viz. in this process and the active Christian life accompanying it: not ‚Äòthat ye may be able to prove,‚Äô ‚Äòacquire the faculty of proving,‚Äô as some Commentators: the Apostle is not speaking of acquiring wisdom here, but of practical proof by experience." 
3. "Good and wellpleasing, and perfect are not epithets of the will of God, as in A.V., for in that case they would be superfluous, and in part inapplicable (seeing that that which is perfect does not require further specification): but abstract neuters, see verse 9, that ye may prove what is the will of God (viz. that which is) good and wellpleasing (to Him) and perfect."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But be ye transformed‚Äîor, 'transfigured'... by such an inward spiritual transformation as makes the whole life new‚Äînew in its motives and ends, even where the actions differ in nothing from those of the world‚Äînew, considered as a whole, and in such a sense as to be wholly unattainable save through the constraining power of the love of Christ." 
2. "That ye may prove... what is that 'the' good and acceptable... and perfect, will of God." 
3. "Such then is the great general duty of the redeemed‚ÄîSELF-CONSECRATION, in our whole spirit and soul and body to Him who hath called us into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians should not conform to the maxims, habits, feelings, etc., of a wicked, luxurious, and idolatrous age, but should be conformed solely to the precepts and laws of the gospel."
2. "Do not cherish a spirit devoted to the world, following its vain fashions and pleasures, but cultivate a spirit attached to God, and his kingdom and cause."
3. "A renewed heart is the best preparation for studying Christianity; as a man who is temperate is the best suited to understand the arguments for temperance; the man who is chaste, has most clearly and forcibly the arguments for chastity, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Conformed - transformed. See on was transfigured, Matthew 17:2. For conformed to, Rev., correctly, fashioned according to."
2. "Mind. See on ch. Romans 7:23. Agreeing with reasonable service."
3. "That good and acceptable and perfect will. Better to render the three adjectives as appositional. 'May prove what is the will of God, what is good,' etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "For since the whole world lies in wickedness, it behooves us to put off whatever we have of the old man, if we would really put on Christ."
2. "But if the renovation of our mind is necessary, in order that we may prove what is the will of God, it is hence evident how opposed it is to God."
3. "The world persuades itself that those works which it has devised are good; Paul exclaims, that what is good and right must be ascertained from God‚Äôs commandments."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But to be transformed, or, 'transfigured,' as in Matthew 17:2; Mark 9:2... Here also a continuous process is indicated."
2. "By the renewing of your mind. This is the instrument of the transformation... Through this renewed mind there results the transformation in the whole man."
3. "That ye may prove, or, 'in order to prove,' to put to the practical test, what is the will of God... The practical portion of this Epistle is designed to help this judgment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Do not take this age as your fashion plate."
2. "There must be a radical change in the inner man for one to live rightly in this evil age, 'by the renewing of your mind.'"
3. "To test what is God's will, 'the good and acceptable and perfect.'"

### John Gill:
1. "By this world is meant, either the Mosaic dispensation, and Jewish church state, so called in opposition to ◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù ◊î◊ë◊ê, 'the world to come', the Gospel dispensation... or else the men of the world are designed, carnal and unregenerate men."
2. "But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind; which regards not the first work of conversion and renovation; but the after progress and carrying on the work of renovation, the renewing of them day by day in the spirit of their minds."
3. "And the end to be attained hereby is, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God; by which is meant not the secret will of God, but the revealed will of God, both in the law... and also that which is contained in the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "And be not conformed ‚Äî Neither in judgment, spirit, nor behaviour."
2. "That ye may prove ‚Äî Know by sure trial; which is easily done by him who has thus presented himself to God."
3. "What is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God ‚Äî The will of God is here to be understood of all the preceptive part of Christianity."

This requires a continual process of renewal in our mind and a relentless commitment to seek and understand God's commandments. By doing so, we can live in a way that is good, acceptable, and perfect in the eyes of God, devoting our lives to His kingdom and His cause.
