# Romans 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not succumb to the temptation of revenge, for that is yielding to the enemy. Instead, overcome evil with good. By responding to evil with acts of kindness and forgiveness, we conquer evil in the noblest sense. This principle stands in contrast to the belief of offering sacrifices for the forgiveness of sins. We should not be defeated by the injuries inflicted upon us, but maintain our Christian principles and demonstrate the power of the gospel. Return good for evil, conquer our enemies with patience and kindness, and persevere in doing good.

- Attempt 1 BHT: If we allow ourselves to be consumed by revenge, we are yielding to the enemy. Instead, we are called to overcome the evil in others with our acts of kindness and goodness. By doing so, we do not allow the evil to conquer us, but rather, we become victorious over it. This stands in contrast to the belief of offering sacrifice as a means of atonement for sins. We must not be vanquished by injuries inflicted upon us, but maintain our Christian principles, showing the power of the gospel. Our response should be to return good for evil, to win by yielding, to avenge by forgiving, and to conquer by forgetting ourselves and showing steadfastness of mind. Ultimately, our goal is to overcome the evil man and the evil done to us by doing good, which has the power to win over our enemies and transform them into friends.
