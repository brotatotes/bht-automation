# Romans 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To overcome evil, we must resist revenge and yield to the enemy, conquering evil with good. This victory is possible through the precious blood of Christ, as we offer living sacrifices to God in self-consecration. By showing kindness and forgiveness, we demonstrate the power of the gospel and increase our ability to do good. Through acts of kindness and perseverance, we become conquerors, more than conquerors, through God's grace and strength.
