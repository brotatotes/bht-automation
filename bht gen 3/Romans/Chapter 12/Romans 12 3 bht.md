# Romans 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are cautioned against an inflated self-view, as our faith is a divine gift for receiving the grace of the Spirit. Our measure of faith determines our capacity to receive God's gifts, emphasizing the diversity within the body of Christ. Rather than boasting, we should approach our self-evaluation with sobriety and humility, recognizing that our faith is not something to be proud of in itself. Each believer has a unique measure of faith, and by acknowledging our limitations and embracing wise judgment, we foster unity and balanced perspectives within the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "â€˜He says it not to this person or that person only, but to ruler and ruled, to bond and free, to simple and wise, to woman and man.â€™" 
2. "His measure of faith is his receptivity of graces of the Spirit, itself no inherent congruity, but the gift and apportionment of God."
3. "But we must not say, with Ewbank, that 'faith, in this passage, means those gifts or graces which the Christian can only receive through faith:â€™ this is to confound the receptive faculty with the thing received by it, and to pass by the great lesson of our verse, that this faculty is nothing to be proud of, but Godâ€™s gift."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "not to be high-minded above what he ought to be minded, but so to be minded as to be sober-minded" [CALVIN, ALFORD].
2. "Faith is here viewed as the inlet to all the other graces, and so, as the receptive faculty of the renewed soulâ€”that is, 'as God hath given to each his particular capacity to take in the gifts and graces which He designs for the general good.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not to think ... - Not to over-estimate himself, or to think more of himself than he ought to."
2. "The only true standard of character pertains to the principles of action, or to that which constitutes the moral nature of the man; and to that the apostle calls the Roman people."
3. "The meaning is, judge yourselves, or estimate yourselves, by your piety."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not to be high-minded (hyperphronein) above what he ought to be minded (phronein), but to be minded (phronein) unto the being sober-minded (sophronein)."
2. "The point of the passage is a warning against an undue self-estimate, and a corresponding exhortation to estimate one's self with discrimination and sober judgment."
3. "Faith, in introducing him into God's kingdom, introduces him to new standards of measurement, according to which he accurately determines the nature and extent of his powers, and so does not think of himself too highly."

### John Calvin:
1. "By 'grace' (as before) he means the Apostleship, with respect to which he exalts Godâ€™s kindness, and at the same time intimates, that he had not crept in through his own presumption, but, that he was chosen by the calling of God."
2. "To every one as God has distributed...every one preserves himself within the due boundaries of wisdom, who keeps within the limits of that grace of faith bestowed on him by the Lord."
3. "The meaning is, that it is a part of our reasonable sacrifice to surrender ourselves, in a meek and teachable spirit, to be ruled and guided by God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not to think of himself, etc. There is a play upon words in the original which it is difficult to reproduce in English: Alford renders â€˜not to be highminded, above that which he ought to be minded, but to be so minded as to be sober-minded.â€™"
2. "The aim of oneâ€™s self-knowledge should be wise discretion. Practically self-esteem leads to indiscretion."
3. "To each one the measure of faith. The entire phrase points to the individual Christianâ€™s â€˜receptivity of grace of the Spirit, itself no inherent congruity, but the gift and apportionment of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Self-conceit is here treated as a species of insanity."

3. "To each man...emphasizes the diversity."

3. "They have not all faith, and all knowledge, or do not know the whole of the faith of the Gospel only a measure of it, which is dealt out, divided, and parted to every man."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through the grace which is given to me â€” He modestly adds this, lest he should seem to forget his own direction."
2. "To every one that is among you â€” Believers at Rome. Happy, had they always remembered this!"
3. "The measure of faith - Treated of in the first and following chapters, from which all other gifts and graces flow."
