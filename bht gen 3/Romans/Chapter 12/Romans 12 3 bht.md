## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "â€˜He says it not to this person or that person only, but to ruler and ruled, to bond and free, to simple and wise, to woman and man.â€™" 
2. "His measure of faith is his receptivity of graces of the Spirit, itself no inherent congruity, but the gift and apportionment of God."
3. "But we must not say, with Ewbank, that 'faith, in this passage, means those gifts or graces which the Christian can only receive through faith:â€™ this is to confound the receptive faculty with the thing received by it, and to pass by the great lesson of our verse, that this faculty is nothing to be proud of, but Godâ€™s gift."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "not to be high-minded above what he ought to be minded, but so to be minded as to be sober-minded" 
2. "Faith is here viewed as the inlet to all the other graces" 
3. "as God hath given to each his particular capacity to take in the gifts and graces which He designs for the general good"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The only true standard of character pertains to the principles of action, or to that which constitutes the moral nature of the man; and to that the apostle calls the Roman people."
2. "There is no way to maintain a wise and proper conduct so certain, as to form a humble and modest estimate of our own character."
3. "The fact that God has given all that we have; the fact that the poor and obscure may have as true an elevation of character as ourselves; the consciousness of our own imperfections and short-comings in the Christian faith; and the certainty that we are soon to be arraigned to try this great question, whether we have evidence that we are the friends of God; will all tend to promote humbleness of mind and to bring down our usual inordinate self-estimation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The point of the passage is a warning against an undue self-estimate, and a corresponding exhortation to estimate one's self with discrimination and sober judgment."
2. "The character of this measure or standard is determined by faith."
3. "Faith, in introducing him into God's kingdom, introduces him to new standards of measurement, according to which he accurately determines the nature and extent of his powers, and so does not think of himself too highly."

### John Calvin:
1. "By â€˜graceâ€™ (as before) he means the Apostleship, with respect to which he exalts Godâ€™s kindness, and at the same time intimates, that he had not crept in through his own presumption, but, that he was chosen by the calling of God."
2. "It is a part of our reasonable sacrifice to surrender ourselves, in a meek and teachable spirit, to be ruled and guided by God."
3. "He restrains us from our own opinions, and at the same time specifies the due measure of it, that is, when the faithful humbly keep themselves within the limits allotted to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The special requirement which he is now to make serves in fact by way of confirmation to the general exhortation of Romans 12:2."
2. "The aim of oneâ€™s self-knowledge should be wise discretion. Practically self-esteem leads to indiscretion."
3. "Since this standard is 'as God hath dealt to each one,' there is no room for thinking too highly of ourselves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Self-conceit is here treated as a species of insanity."
2. "There is no occasion for undue pride."
3. "To each man...and emphasizes the diversity."

### John Gill:
1. "Not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think."
2. "Not to search into things too high for him that are out of his reach, and beyond his capacity."
3. "But to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I say â€” He now proceeds to show what that will of God is."
2. "Through the grace which is given to me â€” He modestly adds this, lest he should seem to forget his own direction."
3. "The measure of faith - Treated of in the first and following chapters, from which all other gifts and graces flow."
