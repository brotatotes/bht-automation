## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These gifts are called, 1 Cor. xii. 7, 'the manifestation of the Spirit.'"
2. "To understand the words objectively, as 'the rule of faith,' as many R.-Cath. expositors, and some Protestant, e.g. Calvin, seems to do violence to the context."
3. "The measure of faith, itself the gift of God, is the receptive faculty for all spiritual gifts, which are therefore not to be boasted of, nor pushed beyond their provinces, but humbly exercised within their own limits."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All the gifts of believers alike are viewed as communications of mere grace."
2. "Anyone speaking with divine authority‚Äîwhether with reference to the past, the present, or the future‚Äîwas termed a prophet."
3. "As all the gifts of believers are according to their respective capacity for them, they are not to be puffed up on account of them, but to use them purely for their proper ends."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "True honor consists not in splendid endowments, or great wealth and function. It consists in rightly discharging the duties which God requires of us in our appropriate sphere." 
2. "If all people held their talents as the gift of God; if all would find and occupy in society the place for which God designed them, it would prevent no small part of the uneasiness, the restlessness, the ambition, and misery of the world."
3. "They were an order of teachers distinct from the apostles, and next to them in authority and rank... They were subject to the apostles... The office or the endowment was temporary, designed for the settlement and establishment of the church; and then, like the apostolic office, having accomplished its purpose, to be disused, and to cease."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Analogia proportion, occurs only here in the New Testament."
3. "The meaning is not the technical meaning expressed by the theological phrase analogy of faith, sometimes called analogy of scripture, i.e., the correspondence of the several parts of divine revelation in one consistent whole."

### John Calvin:
1. "Every one desires to have so much himself, so as not to need any help from others; but the bond of mutual communication is this, that no one has sufficient for himself, but is constrained to borrow from others."
2. "Here then we have the main design which the Apostle had in view, that all things do not meet in all, but that the gifts of God are so distributed that each has a limited portion, and that each ought to be so attentive in imparting his own gifts to the edification of the Church, that no one, by leaving his own function, may trespass on that of another."
3. "But it is enough if we preserve that distinction which we find to be in God‚Äôs gifts, and which we know to be adapted to produce order in the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‚Äòcharisms‚Äô are different, but all having one origin, according to the grace that was given to us." 
2. "In the Bible ‚Äòprophecy‚Äô on the one hand, includes more than the prediction of future events, it is a speaking for God not merely beforehand; on the other hand, it is not identical with preaching."
3. "The entire phrase, with which ‚Äòlet us prophesy‚Äô is properly supplied, is equivalent to ‚Äòthe measure of faith.‚Äô This view is favored by the context, ‚Äòwhich aims at showing that the measure of faith, itself the gift of God, is the receptive faculty for all spiritual gifts, which are therefore not to be boasted of, nor pushed beyond their provinces, but humbly exercised within their own limits‚Äô."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Differing (Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒøœÅŒ±). Old adjective from Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒµœÅœâ, to differ, to vary."
2. "According to the proportion of our faith (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±ŒΩŒ±ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒ∑œÇ œÄŒπœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ)."
3. "The context calls for the subjective meaning of 'faith' rather than the objective and outward standard though œÄŒπœÉœÑŒπœÇ does occur in that sense."

### John Gill:
1. "As in a natural body, the various members of it have not the same office, and do not perform the same actions, thus they have not the same, but different faculties." 
2. "All these gifts are not the effects of nature, the fruits of human power, diligence, and industry, but flow from the grace of God."
3. "A Gospel minister ought not to be a sceptic, or in doubt about the main principles of religion; such as concern the three divine persons, the office, grace, and righteousness of Christ, and the way of salvation by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having then gifts differing according to the grace which is given us ‚Äî Gifts are various: grace is one."
2. "Whether it be prophecy ‚Äî This, considered as an extraordinary gift, is that whereby heavenly mysteries are declared to men, or things to come foretold. But it seems here to mean the ordinary gift of expounding scripture."
3. "Let us prophesy according to the analogy of faith ‚Äî St. Peter expresses it, 'as the oracles of God;' according to the general tenor of them; according to that grand scheme of doctrine which is delivered therein, touching original sin, justification by faith, and present, inward salvation."
