3. "A word is better than a gift." (8 words)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Or he that exhorteth‚ÄîSince all preaching, whether by apostles, prophets, or teachers, was followed up by exhortation...many think that no specific class is here in view." 
2. "He that giveth‚Äîin the exercise of private benevolence probably, rather than in the discharge of diaconal duty."
3. "He that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness‚Äînot only without grudging either trouble or pecuniary relief, but feeling it to be 'more blessed to give than to receive,' and to help than be helped."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "It is plain that when property was intrusted to them, there would be danger that they might be tempted to employ it for selfish and sinister ends, to promote their influence and prosperity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that giveth [Œø ŒºŒµœÑŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ¥ŒøœÖœÇ] . Earthly possessions. The preposition meta indicates sharing with. He that imparteth."
2. "Simplicity [Œ±œÄŒªŒøœÑŒ∑œÑŒπ] . See on single, Matthew 6:22, and compare James 1:5, where it is said that God gives aJplwv simply."
3. "With cheerfulness [ŒµŒΩ ŒπŒªŒ±œÅŒøœÑŒ∑œÑŒπ] . Only here in the New Testament. It reappears in the Latin hilaritas; English, hilarity, exhilarate. 'The joyful eagerness, the amiable grace, the affability going the length of gayety, which make the visitor a sunbeam penetrating into the sick - chamber, and to the heart of the afflicted.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "By the ŒºŒµœÑŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œø·ΩªŒΩœÑŒøŒπœÇ, the givers, of whom he speaks here, he did not understand those who gave of their own property, but the deacons, who presided in dispensing the public charities of the Church." 
2. "He required the services of the other party to be rendered with cheerfulness, lest by their peevishness (which often happens) they marred the favor conferred by them."
3. "Though he rightly calls those œÄœÅŒøŒπÃàœÉœÑ·Ω±ŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÖœÇ presidents, to whom was committed the government of the Church, yet what he says of these may be extended universally to all kinds of governors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is impossible to find here any permanent office in the church, though these four were probably the basis of a subsequent development into more permanent official positions."
2. "Many explain 'with liberality,' because the other qualifications referred to outward character, rather than to the frame of mind. But this sense of the Greek word is very unusual, and the exhortation to simplicity seems both appropriate and needful. Liberal giving is far easier than simple giving."
3. "The three 'gifts' which private Christians also have might far more frequently be exercised. Too many who could do great service by giving, presiding (or, performing other executive duty), and showing mercy, waste their energies by attempting to exhort and teach, or even to prophesy."

### John Gill:
1. "Though all the ministers of the Gospel are to speak comfortably to the saints, by preaching the doctrines of free justification by Christ's righteousness, and remission of sins by his blood, by bringing the good news of salvation by him, and by opening the exceeding great and precious promises of the Gospel; yet some have a greater talent this way than others." 
2. "He that giveth, [let him do it] with simplicity... with all faithfulness and integrity, without fraud or embezzling the church's stock, with impartiality, and without respect of persons, and liberally and bountifully."
3. "He that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness;... all which should be done, not in a morose and frowning manner, but with a pleasant look and cheerful countenance, which makes the visit and the gift more welcome, acceptable, and useful."

### John Wesley:
1. He that presideth ‚Äî That hath the care of a flock.
He that showeth mercy ‚Äî In any instance.
With cheerfulness ‚Äî Rejoicing that he hath such an opportunity.
