# Romans 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Submission to the higher powers is not just an obligation, but a voluntary act of obedience to authorities ordained by God. While we are called to obey, we must prioritize God's law over man's if they conflict. Paul's focus is on government and order, rather than advocating for the divine right of kings or a specific form of government. The authority of magistrates is not self-derived, but appointed by God for the preservation of legitimate order. Civil government, as ordained by God, is necessary for the wellbeing of society.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Submission to higher authorities is not only a commandment, but a willing and voluntary act of obedience to the authorities that have been ordained by God. This does not mean blindly obeying every law, for if a civil power commands us to violate the law of God, we must obey God before man.

The existence of government and order is a reflection of God's design and authority, and while Paul does not argue for any particular form of government, he opposes lawlessness and disorder.
