# Romans 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we are called to obey and honor the authorities that have been established by God. We must submit ourselves to the governing powers willingly and cheerfully, respecting and honoring their right and authority. The Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of government and order, as these powers have been ordained by God. While our obedience is general, it does not extend to things unlawful, as we must prioritize our obedience to God above man.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For there is no authority (in heaven or earth no power at all) except from God...those that are (the existing powers which we see about us), have been ordained by God." 
2. "His precepts regard an established power, be it what it may. It, in all matters lawful, we are bound to obey."
3. "But even the parental power does not extend to things unlawful. If the civil power commands us to violate the law of God, we must obey God before man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let every soul‚Äîevery man of you be subject unto the higher powers... For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God." 
2. "Submit himself to the authorities that are above him."
3. "The powers that be have been ordained of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word used here does not designate the 'extent' of the submission, but merely enjoins it in general. The general principle will be seen to be, that we are to obey in all things which are not contrary to the Law of God."
2. "As Christians, therefore, are to be subject to God, so they are to honor 'God' by honoring the arrangement which he has instituted for the government of mankind."
3. "The powers that exist, exist by the permission and providence of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Higher powers [ŒµŒæŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ±ŒπœÇ œÖœÄŒµœÅŒµœáŒøœÖœÉŒ±ŒπœÇ] . Lit., authorities which have themselves over."
2. "The powers that be [Œ±Œπ Œ¥Œµ ŒøœÖœÉŒ±Œπ] . Lit., the existing."
3. "Are ordained [œÑŒµœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒµŒΩŒ±Œπ ŒµŒπœÉŒπŒΩ] . Perfect tense : Have been ordained, and the ordinance remains in force."

### John Calvin:
1. "And it seems indeed to me, that the Apostle intended by this word to take away the frivolous curiosity of men, who are wont often to inquire by what right they who rule have obtained their authority; but it ought to be enough for us, that they do rule; for they have not ascended by their own power into this high station, but have been placed there by the Lord‚Äôs hand."
2. "For there is no power, etc. The reason why we ought to be subject to magistrates is, because they are constituted by God‚Äôs ordination. For since it pleases God thus to govern the world, he who attempts to invert the order of God, and thus to resist God himself, despises his power; since to despise the providence of him who is the founder of civil power, is to carry on war with him."
3. "As it is lawful to repel wars and to seek remedies for other evils, hence the Apostle commands us willingly and cheerfully to respect and honor the right and authority of magistrates, as useful to men: for the punishment which God inflicts on men for their sins, we cannot properly call ordinations, but they are the means which he designedly appoints for the preservation of legitimate order."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Submit himself. This rendering suggests that the obedience is of a voluntary and rational character, not a servile and blind subjection."
2. "Political rulers are undoubtedly meant, and most probably all such, of every rank; the exclusive reference to the higher class of rulers being very doubtful."
3. "The simple, pellucid meaning of the Apostle, is that civil government is necessary, and of divine appointment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Every soul... A Hebraism for every man." 
2. "God is the author of order, not anarchy."
3. "Paul is not arguing for the divine right of kings or for any special form of government, but for government and order."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the higher powers', he means not angels, sometimes called principalities and powers; for unto these God hath not put in subjection his people under the Gospel dispensation; nor ecclesiastical officers, or those who are in church power and authority; for they do not bear the temporal sword, nor have any power to inflict corporeal punishment: but civil magistrates are intended..."
2. "The powers that be are ordained of God. The order of magistracy is of God; it is of his ordination and appointment, and of his ordering, disposing, and fixing in its proper bounds and limits."
3. "This is the apostle's first argument for subjection to the civil magistrate."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let every soul be subject to the supreme powers."
2. "The powers that be are appointed by God."
3. "implying, that they are God's deputies or vicegerents."

- Attempt 1 BHT: God is the author of order, not anarchy. As Christians, we are called to obey and honor the authorities that have been established by God. This obedience is not blind subjection, but a voluntary and rational submission to the governing powers. We are to be subject in all matters lawful, but if the civil power commands us to go against the law of God, we must obey God before man. The Apostle Paul is not arguing for any specific form of government, but rather emphasizing the importance of government and order in general. It is enough for us to acknowledge that those in authority have been placed there by the Lord's hand. The powers that exist, exist by the permission and providence of God, and it is our duty to willingly and cheerfully respect and honor their right and authority.
