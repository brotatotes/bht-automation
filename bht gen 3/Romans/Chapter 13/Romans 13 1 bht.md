# Romans 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, our duty is to willingly submit to the authority of earthly rulers, recognizing that all authority comes from God. However, this obedience is not absolute; if the civil power commands us to go against God's law, we must prioritize obedience to God. We should endeavor to change unjust laws by lawful means, recognizing that government and order are important in society. It is crucial to oppose lawlessness and disorder, understanding that civil government is necessary and of divine appointment. As Christian citizens, we have a responsibility to obey while also exercising political knowledge and prudence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "submit himself, i.e. ‚Äòbe subject of his own free will and accord.‚Äô‚ÄîFor there is no authority (in heaven or earth‚Äîno power at all) except from God: those that be (the existing powers which we see about us), have been ordained by God."
2. "If the civil power commands us to violate the law of God, we must obey God before man."
3. "To obtain, by lawful means, the removal or alteration of an unjust or unreasonable law, is another part of this duty: for all authorities among men must be in accord with the highest authority, the moral sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let every soul‚Äîevery man of you be subject unto the higher powers..." 
2. "For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It became, therefore, a question of great importance and difficulty, 'what kind' of allegiance they were to render to earthly magistrates."
2. "The general principle will be seen to be, that we are to obey in all things which are not contrary to the Law of God."
3. "The object of the apostle was to prevent Christians from entering into those disputes, and from taking an active part in a political controversy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Higher powers [ŒµŒæŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ±ŒπœÇ œÖœÄŒµœÅŒµœáŒøœÖœÉŒ±ŒπœÇ] . Lit., authorities which have themselves over."
2. "The powers that be [Œ±Œπ Œ¥Œµ ŒøœÖœÉŒ±Œπ] . Lit., the existing."
3. "Are ordained [œÑŒµœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒµŒΩŒ±Œπ ŒµŒπœÉŒπŒΩ] . Perfect tense : Have been ordained, and the ordinance remains in force."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls them the higher powers, not the supreme, who possess the chief authority, but such as excel other men."
2. "And it seems indeed to me, that the Apostle intended by this word to take away the frivolous curiosity of men, who are wont often to inquire by what right they who rule have obtained their authority; but it ought to be enough for us, that they do rule; for they have not ascended by their own power into this high station, but have been placed there by the Lord‚Äôs hand."
3. "Let every soul, that is 'every one,' says [Grotius ], 'even apostles, prophets, and bishops.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Submit himself. This rendering suggests that the obedience is of a voluntary and rational character, not a servile and blind subjection."
2. "Civil government is necessary, and of divine appointment. We infer that anarchy is as godless as it is inhuman; magistrates derive their authority from God, even when chosen by the people."
3. "When the civil power is most directly under the control of the popular will, the personal responsibility of Christian citizens is greatest: to the duty of obedience are added those of political knowledge and prudence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God is the author of order, not anarchy."
2. "Paul is not arguing for the divine right of kings or for any special form of government, but for government and order."
3. "He does oppose all lawlessness and disorder."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle judged it advisable especially to exhort the church of Rome, and the members who dwelt there, where was the seat of power and civil government, so to behave towards their superiors, that they might set a good example to the Christians in the several parts of the empire, and wipe off the aspersion that was cast upon them, as if they were enemies to magistracy and civil power."
2. "The several forms of government are of human will and pleasure; but government itself is an order of God."
3. "This is the apostle's first argument for subjection to the civil magistrate."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let every soul be subject to the supreme powers...That is more readily acknowledged to be from God...They are all from God, who constituted all in general, and permits each in particular by his providence." 
2. "The powers that be are appointed by God...implying, that they are God's deputies or vicegerents and consequently, their authority being, in effect, his, demands our conscientious obedience."
