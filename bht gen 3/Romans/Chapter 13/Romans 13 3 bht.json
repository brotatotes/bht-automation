It is important to note, however, that this principle holds true only when rulers do not become a terror to the good work. While it is clear that Paul does not approve all that rulers do, he is speaking generally of the ideal before rulers. In fact, when rulers become a terror to the good work, the maxim of the Apostles can be applied: We must obey God rather than man. Therefore, it is crucial to resist the fury of the wicked and protect the innocent from their violence, as this prevents chaos. It is also worth noting that if someone wishes to shake off or remove the yoke of the magistrate, it is an implication of an evil conscience, and an indication that they are planning mischief. Ultimately, rulers should not inject terror into those who behave well and abide by the laws, but rather their role is to be a terror to evil works. By doing good, one can receive praise and commendation, establishing themselves as a good neighbor, citizen, and part of the community at large.",
