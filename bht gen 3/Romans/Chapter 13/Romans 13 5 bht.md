# Romans 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Submission to civil authorities is not just driven by the fear of punishment, but also by a moral obligation and reverence for God's authority. Obedience to the governing powers is not only a practical necessity but also a matter of conscience. While individuals may desire to alter or improve the government, it is essential to recognize that the responsibility for such changes lies beyond their control. Thus, willingly obeying the authorities, both for practical reasons and as an expression of obedience to God, enables us to maintain a clear conscience.

### John Calvin:
1. "We must not only obey, because we cannot with impunity resist the powerful and those armed with authority, as injuries are wont to be borne with which cannot be repelled; but we ought to obey willingly, as conscience through Godâ€™s word thus binds us."
2. "Though then the magistrate were disarmed, so that we could with impunity provoke and despise him, yet such a thing ought to be no more attempted than if we were to see punishment suspended over us; for it belongs not to a private individual to take away authority from him whom the Lord has in power set over us."
3. "This whole discourse is concerning civil government; it is therefore to no purpose that they who would exercise dominion over consciences do hence attempt to establish their sacrilegious tyranny."

1. Not only for fear of wrath â€” That is, punishment from man.
But for conscience' sake â€” Out of obedience to God.
