# Romans 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pay all other debts and be indebted in the matter of love alone, for this debt increases as it is paid, deepening and activating the principle of love. Fulfilling the duty of love fulfills the law, for love is the essence of the law itself. Love is a debt that can never be discharged, but we should keep paying the interest. Love is the solution to our social relations and national problems, and by loving one another as we ought, we fulfill the whole law toward our neighbor.
