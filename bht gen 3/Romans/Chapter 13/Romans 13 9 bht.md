# Romans 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is the unifying principle behind the entire law, encompassing commandments such as not killing, committing adultery, stealing, and coveting. While the commandment of not bearing false witness is omitted in ancient manuscripts, it does not diminish the significance of love in fulfilling the law. This love for our neighbor is referred to as the royal law, summarizing and epitomizing all other commandments. Upholding this commandment prevents fraud, injustice, oppression, falsehood, adultery, murder, theft, and covetousness, while nurturing peace, preserving brotherly love, and displaying obedience to God's law.
