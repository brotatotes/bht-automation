- Attempt 4 BHT: In Romans 14:10, the apostle Paul addresses the duty of abstaining from judgment and despising one another. He emphasizes that all believers, regardless of their strength or weakness in faith, will stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Those who judge their brothers or sisters arrogantly undermine Christ's role as the ultimate ruler and anticipate God's judgment. Paul reminds them that they are all part of the same family, equal in their standing before God. Therefore, it is unreasonable and absurd for any believer to take it upon themselves to assume the role of a judge and despise their fellow believers. We should all humbly recognize that we will each stand before Christ, who will ultimately render judgment and reward according to our works.
