# Romans 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why do you, the weaker believer, judge your brother? And you, the stronger believer, why do you despise your brother? We are all servants and will all stand before the judgment-seat of God. What right do we have to sit in judgment on others when God has recognized them as his friends and brothers in the same family? Let us remember that we are all brethren, with one master, and that both a particular and general judgment await us.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Why do you judge your brother? And why do you despise your brother? We all, the weak and the strong alike, will stand before the judgment-seat of Christ. It is not our place to pass judgment on one another, for we are all servants of God and brothers in Christ. Just as it would be absurd for a criminal to ascend the judge's tribunal, it is absurd for a Christian to take it upon themselves to judge the conscience of their brother. Christ alone has the power and authority to judge, and we should not rob him of that privilege. Let us remember that we will all face judgment and focus instead on loving and serving one another in unity.
