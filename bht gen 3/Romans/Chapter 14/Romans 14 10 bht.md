# Romans 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why do you judge and despise your brother? We will all stand before the judgment seat of God, so who are we to sit in judgment on others? Remember, we are all part of the same family, all servants of God. Let us not assume the role of judge, for that belongs to Christ alone. Instead, let us focus on our own conduct and answer to Christ, not to our fellow believers. Let us not encroach upon Christ's office as ruler by judging our brothers and sisters in the faith.
