## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Seeing that our account to God will be of each manâ€™s own self, let us take heed lest by judging one another we incur the guilt of destroying one another."
2. "The stress is on concerning himself: and the next verse refers back to it, laying the emphasis on one another."
3. "Judging here in the general sense of â€˜pass judgment on,â€™ including both the despising of the strong and the judging of the weak."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Now, if it be remembered that all this is adduced quite incidentally, to show that CHRIST is the absolute Master of all Christians, to rule their judgments and feelings towards each other while 'living,' and to dispose of them 'dying,' the testimony which it bears to the absolute Divinity of Christ will appear remarkable."
2. "On any other view, the quotation to show that we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God would be a strange proof that Christians are all amenable to Christ."
3. "The testimony which it bears to the absolute Divinity of Christ will appear remarkable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the fearful arraignment of that day every work and purpose shall be brought forth, and tried by the unerring standard of justice."
2. "As we shall be called to so fearful an account with God, we should not be engaged in condemning our brethren, but should examine whether we are prepared to give up our account with joy, and not with grief."
3. "No being that is not 'omniscient' can be qualified to judge the secrets of all people. None who has not 'seen' human purposes at all times, and in all places; who has not been a witness of the conduct by day and by night; who has not been present with all the race at all times, and who in the great day cannot discern the true character of the soul, can be qualified to conduct the general judgment. Yet none can possess these qualifications but God."

### John Calvin:
1. "This conclusion invites us to humility and lowliness of mind: and hence he immediately draws this inference, â€” that we are not to judge one another"
2. "He indeed indirectly reproves those malignant censors, who employ all their acuteness in finding out something faulty in the life of their brethren"
3. "Thus we see that forbearance is enjoined on both parties"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis rests on â€˜each one of us,â€™ not on â€˜of himself,â€™ or, â€˜to God.â€™ There is no exception." 
2. "Let each remember this, and each will be guarded against judging his brother."
3. "â€˜That which precedes means: 'Do not judge thy brother, since God will judge him;' this verse means: 'Judge thou thyself, since God will judge thee.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Shall give account (Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Î½ Î´Ï‰ÏƒÎµ). So Aleph A C rather than Î±Ï€Î¿Î´Ï‰ÏƒÎµ of Textus Receptus. Common use of Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Ï‚ for account (bookkeeping, ledger) as in Luke 16:2. 


### John Gill:
1. "from whence it necessarily follows, that every man, and so every Christian, strong or weak, whatever may be his gifts, talents, and abilities, shall give an account of himself to God"
2. "which is another proof of his deity, for he will be the Judge"
3. "however, this is certain, that the saints will have upon this reckoning, in what sort soever it may be, a full and open discharge, through the blood and righteousness of Christ"
