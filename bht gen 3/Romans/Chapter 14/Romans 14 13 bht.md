# Romans 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us not judge one another, but rather be mindful of the impact our actions may have on our brothers and sisters in Christ. We should not be a stumblingblock, causing them to stumble in their faith or leading them into temptation. Instead, let us resolve to act in a way that does not provoke or injure our fellow believers. It is not our place to pass judgment on others; that is for Christ alone. Instead, let us live in harmony and be cautious of the influence we have on one another.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The former word, the stumblingblock, seems rather to refer to an occasion of sin in act: the latter, to offence in thought, scruple." (13.)
2. "The general principle laid down, that nothing is by its own means,â€”i. e. for any thing in itself,â€”unclean, but only in reference to him who reckons it to be so." (14.)
3. "These words give to the persuasion the weight, not merely of Paulâ€™s own opinion, but of apostolic authority. He is persuaded, in his capacity as connected with Christ Jesus,â€”as having the mind of Christ." (14.)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let us not therefore judge one another; but judge this rather... not to put a stumbling-block."
2. "Assume the office of judge over one another."
3. "A beautiful sort of play upon the word 'judge,' meaning... not to put a stumbling-block."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since we are to give account of ourselves at the same tribunal; since we must be there on the same 'level,' let us not suppose that we have a right here to sit in judgment on our fellow-Christians."
2. "If disposed to 'judge,' let us be employed in a better kind of judging; let us come 'to a determination' not to injure the cause of Christ."
3. "We should resolve to act so as not 'by any means' to be the occasion of leading our brethren into sin, either by our example, or by a severe and harsh judgment, provoking them to anger, or exciting jealousies, and envyings, and suspicions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Stumbling - block. Compare ch. Romans 9:32, Romans 9:33; 45 20. Skandalon occasion of falling is also rendered stumbling - block in other passages." 
2. "Some regard the two as synonymous, others as related to different results in the case of the injured brother."
3. "So Godet, who refers stumbling - block to that which results in a wound, and cause of stumbling to that which causes a fall or sin."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "Rather than be a means of anything of this nature, it was much better... to forego the use of their liberty."

### John Wesley:
