## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mere grieving your brother, is an offence against love: how much greater an offence then, if this grieving end in destroyingâ€”in ruining (causing to act against his conscience, and so to commit sin and be in danger of quenching Godâ€™s Spirit within him) by a MEAL of thine, a brother, for whom Christ died!"
2. "Value not thy meat more than Christ valued His life."
3. "See an exact parallel in 1 Cor. viii. 10."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The worth of even the poorest and weakest brother cannot be more emphatically expressed than by the words, 'for whom Christ died'" [OLSHAUSEN]. (54 words)
2. "Whatever tends to make anyone violate his conscience tends to the destruction of his soul; and he who helps, whether wittingly or no, to bring about the one is guilty of aiding to accomplish the other." (36 words)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle here shows the Gentile that 'he' ought not so to act as unnecessarily to wound his feelings, or to grieve him."
2. "The 'pain' would be real, though the 'opinion' from which it arose might not be well founded."
3. "For these weak brethren, Christ laid down his precious life. He loved them; and shall we, to gratify our appetites, pursue a course which will tend to defeat the work of Christ, and ruin the souls redeemed by his blood?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be grieved The close connection with destroy indicates that the meaning falls short of be destroyed, but is stronger than made to feel pain." 
2. "It is a hurt to conscience, which, while not necessarily fatal, may lead to violation or hardening of conscience, and finally to fall."
3. "Charitably. Lit., according to love."

### John Calvin:
1. "Love is violated when our brother is made to grieve by what is so trifling."
2. "The price of Christâ€™s blood is wasted; for the most abject brother has been redeemed by the blood of Christ: it is then a heinous crime to destroy him by gratifying the stomach."
3. "Since the liberty attained for us by Christ is a blessing, we ought to take care, lest it should be evil spoken of by men and justly blamed, which is the case, when we unseasonably use Godâ€™s gifts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Love limits liberty, and substitutes for it self-denial, even when the scruple is an incorrect one."
2. "Destroy not by thy meat, etc. To this the grieving may lead; the weak brother may be so influenced as to act against his conscience, and so sin as to fall into eternal destruction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because of food."
2. "According to love" as the regulating principle of life.
3. "It is too great a price to pay for personal liberty as to food."

### John Gill:
1. "Because if a brother should be grieved by it...he himself is not only despised as a weak brother, but as if he was a 'judaizing' Christian, and walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the Gospel." 
2. "This is a breach of the rule of charity or brotherly love; such an one is a brother, and though a weak one, yet he is to be loved as a brother, and to be charitably walked with: true charity, or love, vaunts not itself over, nor is it puffed up against a weak brother."
3. "This is to be understood, not of eternal destruction, that can never be thought to be either in the will or power of any man...but it is the destruction of such a man's peace and comfort, which is signified by grieving, stumbling, offending, and making him weak."

### John Wesley:
1. "If thy brother is grieved... do not value thy meat more than Christ valued his life."
2. "He for whom Christ died may be destroyed."
3. "Do not destroy him for whom Christ died."
