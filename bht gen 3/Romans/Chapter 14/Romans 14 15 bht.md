# Romans 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To grieve a brother by our actions, especially over something as trivial as food, is an offense against love. By valuing our own desires above Christ's sacrifice, we risk destroying the souls of those for whom Christ died. Instead, let us live according to love, sacrificing our own comfort to promote the happiness of others. We should not cause our weak brethren to act against their conscience, leading them to eternal destruction. Love limits liberty and requires self-denial for the sake of others' spiritual well-being.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mere grieving your brother, is an offence against love: how much greater an offence then, if this grieving end in destroying - in ruining (causing to act against his conscience, and so to commit sin and be in danger of quenching Godâ€™s Spirit within him) by a MEAL of thine, a brother, for whom Christ died!" 
2. "Value not thy meat more than Christ valued His life." 
3. "See an exact parallel in 1 Cor. viii. 10."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But if thy brother be grievedâ€”has his weak conscience hurt with thy meatâ€”rather, 'because of meat.' The word 'meat' is purposely selected as something contemptible in contrast with the tremendous risk run for its sake." 
2. "Destroy not him withâ€”'by' thy meat for whom Christ diedâ€”'The worth of even the poorest and weakest brother cannot be more emphatically expressed than by the words, 'for whom Christ died'."
3. "Whatever tends to make anyone violate his conscience tends to the destruction of his soul; and he who helps, whether wittingly or no, to bring about the one is guilty of aiding to accomplish the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle here shows the Gentile that 'he' ought not so to act as unnecessarily to wound his feelings, or to grieve him."
2. "He would violate that law which required him to sacrifice his own comfort to promote the happiness of his brother."
3. "For these weak brethren, Christ laid down his precious life. He loved them; and shall we, to gratify our appetites, pursue a course which will tend to defeat the work of Christ, and ruin the souls redeemed by his blood?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be grieved... It is a hurt to conscience, which... may lead to violation or hardening of conscience, and finally to fall." (Romans 14:15)
2. "Meat... A general term for food." (Romans 14:15)
3. "Charitably... Lit., according to love." (Romans 14:15)

### John Calvin:
1. "Love is violated, when our brother is made to grieve by what is so trifling; for it is contrary to love to occasion grief to anyone."
2. "When the weak conscience is wounded, the price of Christâ€™s blood is wasted; for the most abject brother has been redeemed by the blood of Christ: it is then a heinous crime to destroy him by gratifying the stomach."
3. "Since the liberty attained for us by Christ is a blessing, we ought to take care, lest it should be evil spoken of by men and justly blamed, which is the case when we unseasonably use Godâ€™s gifts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Love limits liberty, and substitutes for it self-denial, even when the scruple is an incorrect one."
2. "The weak brother may be so influenced as to act against his conscience, and so sin as to fall into eternal destruction."
3. "'Believers (the elect) are constantly spoken of as in danger of perdition. They are saved only if they continue steadfast unto the end' (Hodge). This principle holds good in this warning also."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because of food."
2. "According to love" as the regulating principle of life.
3. "Destroy not ... with thy food."

### John Gill:
1. "Because if a brother should be grieved by it, that is...judging there is nothing in it, no regard being had to the law of God." 
2. "True charity, or love, vaunts not itself over...and forbears the use of things grieving to him." 
3. "[D]estroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died...and love him."

### John Wesley:
1. "If thy brother is grieved...Destroy not him for whom Christ died." 
2. "So we see, he for whom Christ died may be destroyed."
3. "Do not value thy meat more than Christ valued his life."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The act of causing grief to a fellow believer is an offense against love itself; how much greater offense it is to destroy a brother, for whom Christ died, by insisting on one's own freedom. The value we place on our own preferences should never surpass the value that Christ placed on his own life. We should not let something as trivial as food become a stumbling block for our brothers and sisters. By causing them to violate their conscience, we risk the destruction of their souls, for even the weakest believer is precious to Christ. Instead, let us live according to love, sacrificing our own comfort for the sake of others, so that we may not be a hindrance to their spiritual growth.
