## BHT:
The kingdom of God is not found in externals like food and drink, but in spiritual qualities and graces.

Joy in the Holy Spirit represents the Christians' joy that arises from the workings of the Holy Spirit within them.

It is through righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit that believers experience the essence of the kingdom of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For it is not worth while to let it be disgraced and become useless for such a trifle."
2. "No part of the advance of Christâ€™s gospel can be bound up in, or consist in, meat and drink."
3. "But in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost:â€”in connexion with, under the indwelling and influence of the Holy Ghost."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the kingdom of God...is not meat and drink but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." 
2. "The firstâ€”"righteousness"â€”has respect to God, denoting here "rectitude," in its widest sense." 
3. "The thirdâ€”"joy in the Holy Ghost"â€”has respect to ourselves. This phrase, 'joy in the Holy Ghost,' represents Christians as so thinking and feeling under the workings of the Holy Ghost, that their joy may be viewed rather as that of the blessed Agent who inspires it than their own."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the kingdom of God... does not consist in observing the distinctions between meats and drinks... the Christian church was to be distinguished in a different manner." 
2. "But righteousness... means that the Christian must so live as to be appropriately denominated a righteous man, and not a man whose whole attention is absorbed by the mere ceremonies and outward forms of religion."
3. "And joy... This refers, doubtless, to the 'personal' happiness produced in the mind by the influence of the gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "If for loveâ€™s sake it be lawful to abstain from meat, while Godâ€™s honor is uninjured, while Christâ€™s kingdom suffers no harm, while religion is not hindered, then they are not to be borne with, who for meatâ€™s sake disturb the Church."
2. "He who is become partaker of true righteousness, enjoys a great and an invaluable good, even a calm joy of conscience; and he who has peace with God, what can he desire more?"
3. "The things which belong to the kingdom of God continue complete to us without the use of meats."

2. "But righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit."
3. "Others understand 'righteousness' as moral rectitude toward men, 'peace' as concord in the Church, and 'joy in the Holy Spirit' as above, but with a wider reference to the common joy of Christians."

1. "The kingdom of God... [is] the present spiritual kingdom, the reign of God in the heart." 
2. "Paul scores heavily here, for it is not found in externals like food and drink, but in spiritual qualities and graces."
3. "The kingdom of God... is not found in externals like food and drink, but in spiritual qualities and graces."

### John Gill:
1. "Neither the kingdom of glory, nor the ultimate glory and happiness of the saints in the other world, is attained to by any such things; for neither eating and drinking, nor not eating and drinking, can recommend to the divine favour, or give a meetness for heaven."
2. "The kingdom of grace, or the governing principle of grace in the soul, and which is of God's implanting there, lies in righteousness and true holiness, in which the new man is created; in truth and uprightness in the inward parts, where the laws of God are put and written; and in peace of conscience, arising from the blood and righteousness of Christ."
3. "The Gospel, which gives an account both of the kingdom of grace and of glory, reveals the righteousness of Christ, and teaches men to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present evil world: it is a publication of peace by the blood of Christ; it calls men to peace, to cultivate peace one among another, and to seek those things which make for it; and when it comes in power, is attended with joy in the Holy Ghost."

### John Wesley:
1. "The kingdom of God does not consist in external observances but in righteousness."
2. "True religion is the love of God and man, accompanied with peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."
3. "The love of God and man, with peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, is the essence of the kingdom of God."
