# Romans 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There are believers who have faith to eat all things, considering them lawful, while others, who are weak, confine themselves to a vegetable diet out of fear of eating anything offered to idols. This discrepancy in beliefs can lead to disagreements among believers, as those with more robust faith may not understand or respect the dietary restrictions of their weaker counterparts.
