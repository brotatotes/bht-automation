# Romans 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Acceptance with God is the only criterion for Christian fellowship. Christians should prioritize Christ as the object of their lives, remembering that zealous pursuit of minor truths is inadequate compared to the substantial realities of the Christian life. Faith plays a vital role in guiding actions according to Christian principles, and going against this combination is undoubtedly sinful. Therefore, true Christian morality is rooted in faith, since whatever is not of faith is considered sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Acceptance with God is the only proper criterion of right to Christian fellowship. Whom God receives, men cannot lawfully reject."
2. "As there is much self-pleasing in setting up narrow standards of Christian fellowship, so one of the best preservatives against the temptation to do this will be found in the continual remembrance that CHRIST is the one Object for whom all Christians live, and to whom all Christians die."
3. "Zeal for comparatively small points of truth is a poor substitute for the substantial and catholic and abiding realities of the Christian life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that doubteth - He that is not fully satisfied in his mind; who does not do it with a clear conscience."
2. "Whatever is not done with a full conviction that it is right, is sinful; whatever is done when a man doubts whether it is right, is sin."
3. "In all cases, if a man does a thing which he does not 'believe' to be right, it is a sin, and his conscience will condemn him for it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith. In Christ. 'So far as it brings with it the moral confidence as to what in general and under given circumstances is the right christian mode of action' (Meyer)."
2. "The question seems to be almost wholly due to the mention of Aquila and Priscilla in ch. 16, and to the fact that there is no account of their migration from Ephesus to Rome, and of an after - migration again to Ephesus (2 Timothy 4:19). But see on ch. Romans 16:14."
3. "Against these theories is the stubborn fact that of the known extant MSS. of Paul (about three hundred) all the MSS. hitherto collated, including all the most important, give these chapters in the received connection and order, with the exception of the doxology."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if our way of living is to be confined to this moderation, that no one is to touch a morsel of meat with a doubting conscience, how much greater caution is to be exercised in the greatest things?"
2. "The reason for this condemnation is, that every work, however splendid and excellent in appearance, is counted as sin, except it be founded on a right conscience."
3. "It is at the same time by no means sufficient that what we do is approved by the word of God, except the mind, relying on this persuasion, prepares itself cheerfully to do its work."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The act of eating itself condemns him, of course, according to the Divine ordering, so that the justice of this verdict appears not only before God, but before men, and himself also."
2. "That which one cannot do as his redemption and in the enjoyment of His salvation, he should not do at all, otherwise that act, of which faith is not the soul, becomes sin, and can conduct to the result indicated in Romans 14:20: the total destruction of the work of God in us."
3. "The more important matter is, however, to remember that for Christians, at least, Christian ethics should have full validity, and that here the principle admits of no exception: whatsoever is not of faith is sin; genuine Christian morality is all of faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He that doubteth (Œø Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ)...to hesitate." 
2. "Is condemned (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ∫œÅŒπœÑŒ±). Perfect passive indicative of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩœâ (note Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±-), 'stands condemned.'"
3. "Faith (œÄŒπœÉœÑŒπœÇ) here is subjective, one's strong conviction in the light of his relation to Christ and his enlightened conscience. To go against this combination is sin beyond a doubt."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Acceptance with God is the only criterion of right to Christian fellowship; whom God receives, men cannot reject. It is essential to remember that Christ is the one Object for whom all Christians live and die, rather than focusing on narrow standards of Christian fellowship. Zeal for small points of truth is a poor substitute for the substantial and catholic realities of the Christian life. One's faith should bring moral confidence regarding the right Christian mode of action, based on their relationship with Christ and their enlightened conscience. To go against this combination is undoubtedly sin. If someone doubts whether an action is right and still proceeds, they stand condemned and their conscience will condemn them. Therefore, it is crucial that genuine Christian morality is founded on faith, as whatsoever is not of faith is considered sin.
