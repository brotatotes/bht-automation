# Romans 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let each person be fully persuaded in their own mind regarding the observance of certain days. The apostle Paul acknowledges that there is no obligation to keep any specific day, as all times and days are esteemed alike by those who are strong in faith. Therefore, the recognition of a sabbatical obligation to observe a certain day was not present in apostolic times. Each individual should be guided by their conscientious convictions and assured in their own minds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind."
2. "The obvious inference from his strain of arguing is, that he knew of no such obligation [of one day in seven], but believed all times and days to be, to the Christian strong in faith, ALIKE."
3. "I therefore infer, that sabbatical obligation to keep any day, whether seventh or first, was not recognized in apostolic times."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day."
2. "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."
3. "Be guided in such matters by conscientious conviction."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word is here properly translated 'esteemeth;' the expression means that one would set a higher value on one day than on another, or would regard it as more sacred than others."
2. "The discussion had reference only to the special customs of the 'Jews,' to the rites and practices which 'they' would attempt to impose on the Gentiles, and not to any questions which might arise among Christians as 'Christians.'"
3. "This direction pertains to the subject under discussion, and not to any other. It does not refer to subjects that were 'morally' wrong, but to ceremonial observances."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Esteemeth every day alike (krinei pasan hJmeran). Alike is inserted. Lit., judgeth every day; subjects every day to moral scrutiny." 
2. "Be fully persuaded [œÄŒªŒ∑œÅŒøœÜŒøœÅŒµŒπœÉŒ∏œâ] . Better, Rev., assured. See on most surely believed, Luke 1:1." 
3. "In his own mind. 'As a boat may pursue its course uninjured either in a narrow canal or in a spacious lake' (Bengel)."

### John Calvin:
1. "There ought to be in Christians such a care for obedience, that they do nothing, except what they think, or rather feel assured, is pleasing to God."
2. "It is the first principle of a right conduct, that men should be dependent on the will of God, and never allow themselves to move even a finger, while the mind is doubtful and vacillating."
3. "Paul requires this to be adopted, ‚Äî that the will of God is to preside over all our actions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One man esteemeth one day above another; distinguishes one day from another, the reference probably being to the Jewish feasts and fasts."
2. "Another esteemeth every day alike; judges every day."
3. "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind; the full conviction of an educated conscience should be sought for, not fancied spiritual intuitions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One man, another. Regular idiom of contrasted demonstratives (this one, that one)." 
2. "One day above another. 'Day beyond day.' For this use of œÄŒ±œÅŒ± (beside) in comparison see Romans 1:25; Luke 13:2." 
3. "Be fully assured. Present passive imperative of œÄŒªŒ∑œÅŒøœÜŒøœÅŒµœâ, late compound verb for which see on Luke 1:1; Romans 4:21."

### John Gill:
1. "The weaker brother, though he also observed a day for divine worship, which is the Lord's day, since there must be some time for it as well as place, yet he observed the day for the sake of worship, and not worship for the sake of the day."
2. "His counsel is, that they would sit down and carefully examine the word of God, and act according to the best light they should receive from thence."
