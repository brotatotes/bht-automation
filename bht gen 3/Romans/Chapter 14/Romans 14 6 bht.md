## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words in brackets do not occur in most of our early authorities. They were probably omitted from the similar ending of both clauses in the original having misled some early copyists, and the eye having passed from one to the other (a very usual mistake); but perhaps." 
2. "It may have been intentionally done, after the observation of the Lord‚Äôs Day came to be regarded as binding."
3. "The 'saying grace' of the abstainer, was over his 'dinner of herbs.' The Lord throughout the verse is CHRIST."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord‚Äîthe Lord CHRIST, as before." 
2. "The one gave thanks to God for the flesh which the other scrupled to use; the other did the same for the herbs to which, for conscience' sake, he restricted himself." 
3. "Certainly it could not, if the sabbath were merely one of the Jewish festival days; but it will not do to take this for granted merely because it was observed under the Mosaic economy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that regardeth it as 'holy,' or as set apart to the service of God. He believes that he is 'required' by God to keep it, that is, that the laws of Moses in regard to such days are binding on him."
2. "He eats to the Lord because he believes that God does not forbid it; and because he desires, in doing it, to glorify God."

2. "He eats unto the Lord, he eats not unto the Lord. Paul's principle of freedom in non-essentials is most important."
3. "Paul pleads for liberty."

### John Gill:
1. "Whether he is right or wrong, it is to the Lord he does it, and to his own master he stands or falls."

3. "The man that is strong in faith, and is fully persuaded by the Lord Jesus that all distinction of meats, as of days, is ceased, eats any thing, and every sort of food, that comes in his way, without making any difference."
