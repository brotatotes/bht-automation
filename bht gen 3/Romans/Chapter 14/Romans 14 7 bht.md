liveth to himselfâ€”(See
	2 Corinthians 5:14; 2 Corinthians 5:15),
	to dispose of himself or shape his conduct after his own ideas and
	inclinations.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is no matter of wonder that particular acts of our life should be referred to the Lordâ€™s will, since life itself ought to be wholly spent to his glory."
2. "For then only is the life of a Christian rightly formed, when it has for its object the will of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  To himself (ÎµÎ±Ï…Ï„Ï‰). Dative of advantage again. But to the Lord as he shows in verse Romans 14:8. Life and death focus in the Lord. 


### John Gill:
1. "None of us believers; others may, but these do not, at least they ought not, nor do they when under the influence of the grace of God: they do not live, neither to righteous, nor to sinful self."
2. "Believers die as well as others, not eternally, or the second death, but corporeally, or a temporal death, but not to themselves."
3. "Moreover, no man has the power over life or death; as his life is not from himself, he has no power to lengthen or shorten it, nor to hinder or hasten death; this belongs to another Lord and master, whom life and death are both to subserve."

### John Wesley:
1. None of us â€” Christians, in the things we do.
Liveth to himself â€” Is at his own disposal; doeth his own will.
