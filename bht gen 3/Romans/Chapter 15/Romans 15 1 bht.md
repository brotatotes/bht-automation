As believers, it is our responsibility to consider the weaknesses and scruples of others rather than seeking to please ourselves. We, who are morally strong, must bear the burden of patiently enduring with those who are weak. This involves not only tolerating their weaknesses, but assisting and helping them. We should refrain from using our Christian liberty in things indifferent if it offends or causes stumbling to others. Our focus should be on the welfare and edification of our fellow believers, rather than satisfying our own desires and judgments.
