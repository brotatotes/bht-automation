# Romans 15:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I will only boast of what Christ has done through me, both in preaching the Gospel and through my actions. The signs and wonders I performed were not just spiritual, but external, miraculous acts. I have fully fulfilled my ministry of spreading the Good News of Christ. I won't dare to claim credit for anything that Christ did not work through me. By both my words and my deeds, I have witnessed the power of God at work in me, bringing others to obedience and faith.
