## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By that Savior whose name is alike dear to all of us and whose unsearchable riches I live only to proclaim, and by that love one to another which the blessed Spirit diffuses through all the brotherhood, making the labors of Christ's servants a matter of common interest to all‚ÄîI beseech you."
2. "That love which He kindles in the hearts of believers towards each other."
3. "Imlying that he had his grounds for anxious fear in this matter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the Lord Jesus Christ's sake - Greek, By or through Œ¥ŒπŒ±ÃÅ dia our Lord Jesus Christ; It means probably out of love and regard to him; in order to promote his honor and glory, and to extend his kingdom among people."
2. "And for the love of the Spirit - Œ¥ŒπŒ±ÃÅ dia. By the mutual love and sympathy which the Spirit of God produces in the minds of all who are the friends of God. I beseech you now to manifest that love by praying earnestly for me."
3. "That ye strive together with me - That you unite with me in earnest prayer. The word 'strive' denotes intense 'agony' or effort, such as was used by the wrestlers in the Greek games; and then the 'agony,' or strong effort, which a man makes in prayer, who is earnestly desirous to be heard."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Strive together [œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒΩŒπœÉŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ] . The simple verb is used of contending in the games, and implies strenuous effort. Here earnest prayer.


### John Calvin:
1. "He then shows how grieved his godly mind was, by the earnest protestation he makes, in which he adds to the name of the Lord, the love of the Spirit, by which the saints ought to embrace one another."
2. "Since then it is so great a favor from God to be helped by the prayers of the faithful, that even Paul, a most choice instrument of God, did not think it right to neglect this privilege, how great must be our stupidity, if we, who are abject and worthless creatures, disregard it?"
3. "And indeed if our strength is derived from prayer to God, we can in no better way confirm our brethren, than by praying to God for them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This fervent exhortation is the natural expression of his confidence in them and of the anticipation he has respecting what awaits him at Jerusalem."
2. "'Love of the Spirit' is that affection wrought by the Holy Spirit. Between Paul and the mass of his readers personally unknown to him, only such a love could be urged as a motive."
3. "The figure is that of a contest in the games: ‚ÄòStrive together with me in your prayers, etc.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The intermediate agents of the exhortation (the Lord Jesus and the love of the Spirit)..."
2. "That ye strive together with me..."
3. "For Christ's agony in prayer..."

### John Gill:
1. "for Christ's sake; whose servant he was, and in whose cause he was engaged, whose Gospel he preached, and whose glory he sought; and therefore, if they had any regard for Christ, and the good of his interest, he beseeches them that they would pray for the continuance of his life and usefulness."
2. "for the love of the Spirit; [...] love with which the Spirit of God equally loved them, as the Father, and the Son; and which he had shown in their conversion and sanctification, in applying all grace unto them, and indwelling in them as the Spirit of adoption, and as the earnest and pledge of the heavenly inheritance."
3. "The apostle prayed for himself, as he had been wont to do ever since he was a converted man; but knowing well the force of united social prayer, he desires the assistance of others. He represents prayer as an agony, an holy conflict, and striving with God, a wrestling with him, as Jacob did, who held him, and would not let him go without the blessing, and had power with him, and prevailed."

### John Wesley:
1. "I beseech you by the love of the Spirit ‚Äî That is, by the love which is the genuine fruit of the Spirit."
2. "To strive together with me in your prayers ‚Äî He must pray himself, who would have others strive together with him in prayer."
3. "Of all the apostles, St. Paul alone is recorded to desire the prayers of the faithful for himself."
