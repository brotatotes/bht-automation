## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The peace here sought is to be taken in its widest sense: the peace of reconciliation to God, first, 'through the blood of the everlasting covenant'... then the peace which that reconciliation diffuses among all the partakers of it."
2. "How close the bond which the one spirit draws between ministers and peopleâ€”how wide the separation produced by the other!"
3. "Christian fellowship is so precious that the most eminent servants of Christ, amid the toils and trials of their work, find it refreshing and invigorating."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the verses concluding this chapter, Paul expressed his earnest desire to visit Rome. He besought his brethren to pray that he might be delivered from the unbelievers among the Jews. His main desire was granted."
2. "God thus often grants our 'main desire;' he hears our prayer; but he may make use of that from which we pray to be delivered as the 'means' of fulfilling our own requests."
3. "The Christian prays that he may be sanctified; yet at the same time he may pray to be delivered from affliction. God will hear his main desire, to be made holy; will convert what he fears into a blessing, and make it the means of accomplishing the great end."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Romans 15:33. Now the God of peace, etc. A benediction was natural, and the anticipated conflicts might well lead him to speak of God as â€˜the God of peace.â€™
