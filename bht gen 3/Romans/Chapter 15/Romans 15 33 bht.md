## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The peace here sought is to be taken in its widest sense: the peace of reconciliation to God, first, 'through the blood of the everlasting covenant' (Hebrews 13:20; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 3:16; Philippians 4:9); then the peace which that reconciliation diffuses among all the partakers of it."
2. "What a contrast is thus presented to hierarchical pride, and in particular to the affected humility of the bishop of this very Rome! How close the bond which the one spirit draws between ministers and peopleâ€”how wide the separation produced by the other!"
3. "Christian fellowship is so precious that the most eminent servants of Christ, amid the toils and trials of their work, find it refreshing and invigorating."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now the God of peace - God, the author or promoter of peace and union."
2. "The Christian prays that he may be sanctified; yet at the same time he may pray to be delivered from affliction."
3. "It is right to express our 'desires - all' our desires - to God; but it should be with a willingness that he should choose his own means to accomplish the object of our wishes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Romans 15:33. Now the God of peace, etc. A benediction was natural, and the anticipated conflicts might well lead him to speak of God as â€˜the God of peace.â€™
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The God of peace...one of the characteristics of God that Paul often mentions in benedictions." 
2. "There is nothing strange at all in Paul's having so many friends in Rome though he had not yet been there himself." 
3. "Rome was the centre of the world's life as Paul realized."

### John Gill:
1. "God is the giver of all true solid conscience peace, the peace of God, which passeth all understanding of natural men; and which when he gives, none can give trouble."
2. "He is also the author of happiness and prosperity, temporal, spiritual, and eternal, and likewise of all the peace and concord which is in his churches, and among his saints."
3. "That they might have fresh views of their interest in peace, made by the blood of Christ; that they might enjoy peace in their own consciences, arising from thence; that they might be possessed of felicity of every kind, and that unity and harmony might subsist among them."
