## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such beautiful names of God are taken from the graces which He inspires: as 'the God of hope' (Romans 15:13), 'the God of peace' (Romans 16:20)."
2. "It is not mere unanimity which the apostle seeks for them; for unanimity in evil is to be deprecated."
3. "But it is 'according to Christ Jesus'â€”after the sublimest model of Him whose all-absorbing desire was to do, 'not His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him' (John 6:38)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The example of God here, who bears long with his children, and is not angry soon at their offences, is a strong argument why Christians should bear with each other."
2. "If God bears long and patiently with 'our' infirmities, 'we' ought to bear with each other."

### John Calvin:

2. "Miserable indeed is the union which is unconnected with God, and that is unconnected with him, which alienates us from his truth."
3. "There is then no reason for any to boast that he will give glory to God after his own manner; for the unity of his servants is so much esteemed by God, that he will not have his glory sounded forth amidst discords and contentions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He well knows that the Scripture itself is inefficacious without help of the God of the Scriptures."
2. "To be of the same mind points to harmony of feeling in their intercourse rather than to unanimity of opinion on the disputed points of practice."

1. "The object addressed is described as 'the God of patience', because he is the author and giver of that grace: it is a fruit of his Spirit, produced by the means of his word, called the word of his patience."
2. "God is the great pattern and exemplar of patience; he is patient himself, and bears much and long with the children of men; with wicked men, whose patient forbearance and longsuffering being despised by them, will be an aggravation of their damnation; but his longsuffering towards his elect issues in their salvation."
3. "It is God alone that can give and continue such a Spirit: this the apostle knew, and therefore prays that he would 'grant' it: and for which request there is a foundation for faith and hope concerning it; since God has promised he will give his people one heart, and one way, as to fear him, so to love one another."

### John Wesley:
