# Romans 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this context, Paul greets the household of Narcissus, recognizing that not all of them were followers of Christ. He also sends his regards to Herodion, a potential relative from the Herod family. Narcissus, a prominent freedman who served Claudius, may not have embraced Christianity personally, but it is extraordinary that the grace of Christ reached his morally corrupted dwelling. This serves as a reminder that God's grace operates in diverse and unexpected ways, as not all members of Narcissus' household had experienced this transformative grace.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "It is further to be noticed, that we hear nothing here of splendid and magnificent titles, by which we might conclude that men high in rank were Christians; for all those whom Paul mentions were the obscure and the ignoble at Rome."
2. "The more wonderful was the goodness of God, which penetrated into that impure house, abounding in all kinds of wickedness; not that Narcissus himself had been converted to Christ, but it was a great thing that a house, which was like hell, should be visited by the grace of Christ."
3. "And as they, who lived under a foul pander, the most voracious robber, and the most corrupt of men, worshipped Christ in purity, there is no reason that servants should wait for their masters, but every one ought to follow Christ for himself."

3. "Nor are all of his household saluted, not being all converted persons; it being frequently the method of divine grace to take some of a family, and not all, and bring them to Zion."

### John Wesley:
1. "Faith does not create moroseness, but courtesy." 
2. "Courtesy, which even the gravity of an apostle did not hinder."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Romans 16:11, the apostle Paul sends greetings to the household of Narcissus, indicating that not all members of his household were Christians. Additionally, Paul greets Herodion, who is likely a relative and from the same Herod family mentioned earlier. The commentators explain that Narcissus was a distinguished freedman who served Claudius, and although he himself may not have been a believer, it was remarkable that Christ's grace extended to his impure household. It is not mentioned if Narcissus was at home or if he was deceased, but it is noted that not all members of his household were greeted, as not all of them were converted. This reminds us that divine grace often reaches some members of a family while not touching others. Overall, while Paul's greetings demonstrate courtesy and respect, they also highlight the diverse and sometimes unexpected ways in which God's grace reaches people.
