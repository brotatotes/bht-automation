3. "The apostle calls her 'his own mother,' not so much as our Lord calls every elderly woman believer His mother (Matthew 12:49; Matthew 12:50), but in grateful acknowledgment of her motherly attentions to himself, bestowed no doubt for his Master's sake, and the love she bore to his honored servants." (100 words)
