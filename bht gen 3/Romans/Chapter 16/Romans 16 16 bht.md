### Henry Alford:
1. "The mean-ing of this injunction seems to be, that the Roman Christians should take occasion, on the receipt of the Apostle‚Äôs greetings to them, to testify their mutual love..." 
2. "It became soon a custom in the churches at the celebration of the Lord‚Äôs Supper."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Salute one another with a holy kiss‚ÄîSo 1 Corinthians 16:20; 1 Thessalonians 5:26; 1 Peter 5:14. The custom prevailed among the Jews, and doubtless came from the East, where it still obtains. Its adoption into the Christian churches, as the symbol of a higher fellowship than it had ever expressed before, was probably as immediate as it was natural." 
2. "In this case the apostle's desire seems to be that on receipt of his epistle, with its salutations, they should in this manner expressly testify their Christian affection."
3. "The true reading is, 'All the churches'; the word 'all' gradually falling out, as seeming probably to express more than the apostle would venture to affirm. But no more seems meant than to assure the Romans in what affectionate esteem they were held by the churches generally; all that knew he was writing to Rome having expressly asked their own salutations to be sent to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "all this appears evident from one of the homilies of [Chrysostom ] (478) Hence has arisen that practice among the Papists at this day, of kissing the paten, and of bestowing an offering: the former of which is nothing but superstition without any benefit, the other serves no other purpose but to satisfy the avariciousness of the priests, if indeed it can be satisfied."
2. "Paul however seems not here positively to have enjoined a ceremony, but only exhorts them to cherish brotherly love; and he distinguishes it from the profane friendships of the world... never tend to any good."
3. "By sending salutations from the Churches, (479) he was endeavoring, as much as he could, to bind all the members of Christ by the mutual bond of love."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "This shows the communion of churches, and how they ought to wish and sincerely desire each other's welfare."

### John Wesley:
