### John Calvin:
1. "The ministers of Satan are ever ready to take occasion to disturb the kingdom of Christ: and they attempt to make disturbances in two ways; for they either sow discord, by which the minds of men are drawn away from the unity of truth, or they occasion offenses, by which men are alienated from the love of the gospel."
2. "It is indeed an impious and sacrilegious attempt to divide those who agree in the truth of Christ: but yet it is a shameful sophistry to defend, under the pretext of peace and unity, a union in lies and impious doctrines."
3. "Paul clearly shows, that he did not condemn all kinds of discords, but those which destroyed consent in the orthodox faith; for the force of the passage is in the words, which ye have learnt; for it was the duty of the Romans, before they were rightly taught, to depart from the habits of their fathers and the institutions of their ancestors."

3. "This articular participle clause has within it not only the objects of the participle but the relative clause Î·Î½ Ï…Î¼ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ ÎµÎ¼Î±Î¸ÎµÏ„Îµ (which you learned), a thoroughly Greek idiom."

### John Gill:
1. "The doctrine of faith is but one, the Gospel is one uniform thing, all of a piece."
2. "Thus by these men they were divided in sentiments, affection, and worship; and which must needs cause offence to the church and the godly members of it."
3. "Both ministers of the Gospel and members of churches should not be asleep, but should watch, and be upon their guard, and look diligently."

### John Wesley:
