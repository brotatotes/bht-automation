# Romans 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this section, we encounter Lucius, Jason, Sosipater, and Timothy, all significant figures in Paul's ministry. Lucius, possibly the Lucius of Cyrene mentioned in Acts 13:1, was among the prophets and teachers in Antioch. Jason, who hosted Paul and Silas in Thessalonica as noted in Acts 17:5, is also named. Sosipater could be the longer form of Sopater from Acts 20:4. Timothy, who accompanied Paul in Macedonia, also sends his regards. These individuals were instrumental in spreading the Gospel and supporting Paul in his mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Lucius must not be mistaken for Lucas (or Lucanus),â€”but was probably Lucius of Cyrene, Acts xiii. 1, see note thereâ€”Jason may be the same who is mentioned Acts xvii. 5, as the host of Paul and Silas at Thessalonica." 
2. "There is nothing strange (as Olshausen supposes) in this salutation being inserted in the first person. It would be natural enough that Tertius the amanuensis, inserting the words, should change the form into the first person, and afterwards proceed from the dictation of the Apostle as before."
3. "Tholuck notices this irregularity as a corroboration of the genuineness of the chapter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle mentions him here rather than in the opening address to this church, as he had not been at Rome."
2. "The person meant seems to be 'Lucius of Cyrene,' who was among the 'prophets and teachers' at Antioch with our apostle, before he was summoned into the missionary field."
3. "He had probably accompanied or followed the apostle from Thessalonica to Corinth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Timotheus - Timothy; to whom the Epistles which bear his name were written."
2. "And Lucius - He is mentioned in Acts 13:1, as a prophet and teacher, a native of Cyrene. Nothing more is known of him."
3. "My kinsmen - Romans 16:7."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Lucius and Jason - Sosipater. For Lucius, see on Acts 13:1. Jason, possibly the Jason of Acts 17:5. Sosipater, possibly the Sopater of Acts 20:4. Both names were common.


### John Calvin:
1. "He ascribes first all the glory to God alone; and then, in order to show that it is rightly due to him, he by the way mentions some of his attributes; whence it appears that he alone is worthy of all praise." (Commentary on Romans 16:21)
2. "The gospel not only promises to us present grace, but also brings to us an assurance of that grace which is to endure for ever." (Commentary on Romans 16:21)
3. "The gospel...unfolds the ineffable treasures of celestial wisdom, much higher than all human learning; and since the very angels regard them with wonder, surely none of us can sufficiently admire them." (Commentary on Romans 16:21)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Timothy, my fellow-worker, satuteth you. That Timothy was with Paul at this time appears from Acts 20:4."
2. "This may refer to the person named in Acts 17:5, as a resident of Thessalonica."
3. "My kinsmen. Comp. Romans 16:7; Romans 16:11. Here also the term probably means more than â€˜countrymen.â€™ That Paulâ€™s relatives should become Christians, and be associated with him, is probable enough."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Timothy was with Paul in Macedonia (2 Corinthians 1:1) before he came to Corinth."
2. "Lucius may be the one mentioned in Acts 13:1."
3. "Jason was once Paul's host (Acts 17:5-9) in Thessalonica, Sosipater may be the longer form of Sopater of Acts 20:4."

### John Gill:
1. "Timotheus my work fellow... his dear and well beloved son, having a great affection for him, because as a son with a father he served with him in the Gospel of Christ."
2. "Jason... received Paul and Silas into his house, and when an uproar was made concerning them, was brought before the rulers of the city, and gave security for them."
3. "Sosipater was Sopater of Berea, who, with others, accompanied the apostle into Asia... his Jewish name, as Grotius conjectures, might be Abisha, or rather Abishua, the name of the son of Phinehas the high priest."

### John Wesley:
1. "Timotheus my fellowlabourer â€” Here he is named even before St. Paul's kinsmen."
2. "But as he had never been at Rome, he is not named in the beginning of the epistle."
