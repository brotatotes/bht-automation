# Romans 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
EpÃ¦nÃ«tus, as the first believer in Proconsular Asia, held a dear place in the Apostle's heart. The early Christians gathered in the homes of prominent believers, and it is likely that EpÃ¦nÃ«tus and his wife created a welcoming space for these meetings. As the firstfruits of the area, EpÃ¦nÃ«tus demonstrated his unwavering commitment to Christ in a region where converts were still emerging. The mention of the church in Aquila and Priscilla's house suggests that gatherings took place in multiple homes, forming a household parish within the larger Roman congregation.
