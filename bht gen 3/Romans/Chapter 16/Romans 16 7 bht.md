## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To be Apostles at all is a great thing; but to be also of note among them, mark what an encomium it is."
2. "Noted among the Apostles, i.e. well known and spoken of by the Apostles."
3. "If the wider sense found in Acts xiv. 4, 14; 2 Cor. viii. 23; 1 Thess. ii. 6 (compare i. 1), be taken, there need be no doubt concerning the meaning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those who think the word 'apostle' is used in a lax sense, in the Acts and Epistles, take this to mean 'noted apostles' [CHRYSOSTOM, LUTHER, CALVIN, BENGEL, OLSHAUSEN, THOLUCK, ALFORD, JOWETT]."
2. "If 'Junia' is to be taken for a woman, this latter must be the meaning."
3. "The apostle writes as if he envied them this priority in the faith. And, indeed, if to be 'in Christ' be the most enviable human condition, the earlier the date of this blessed translation, the greater the grace of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It seems probable that they were remote relatives of the apostle."
2. "The word translated 'of note' ŒµÃìœÄŒπÃÅœÉŒ∑ŒºŒøŒπ episeÃÑmoi, denotes properly those who are 'marked,' designated, or distinguished in any way, used either in a good or bad sense."
3. "The design of the office of 'apostles' was to bear 'witness' to the life, death, resurrection, doctrines, and miracles of Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If the latter, the person was probably the wife of Andronicus. If the former, the name is to be rendered Junias." 
2. "Kinsmen. The primary meaning is related by blood; but it is used in the wider sense of fellow - countrymen." 
3. "Of note. A good rendering etymologically, the word meaning, literally, bearing a mark."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is more weight in the second eulogy, when he calls them his fellow-prisoners; for among the honors belonging to the warfare of Christ, bonds are not to be counted the least."
2. "He then, in a general way, calls those in this place Apostles, who planted Churches by carrying here and there the doctrine of salvation."
3. "But as they had embraced the gospel by faith before Paul, he hesitates not to set them on this account before himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Andronicus and Junias, or 'Junia.' It is impossible to decide which form of the latter name is correct; if the feminine form ('Junia') be accepted, then the wife or sister of Andronicus is meant."
2. "My kinsman. This may mean 'fellow-countrymen,' here and in Romans 16:11; Romans 16:21; but all the persons thus termed may have been actual 'kinsmen.' It cannot be affirmed that they were not."
3. "Who are of note among the Apostles; honorably known by the Apostles. The phrase does not imply that they were Apostles. So loose a sense of the term cannot be accepted."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
My apologies for the oversight. Here are three quotes from the original commentary:
1. "Fellow-prisoners...fellow captives in war."
2. "Of note...Stamped, marked...only here and Matthew 27:16 (bad sense) in N.T."
3. "Who have been in Christ before me...The perfect tense notes that they are still in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a greater character of them, and a greater honour to them, than to be called his kinsmen after the flesh."
2. "And it was more to be in Christ than them all, than to be Paul's kinsmen, fellow prisoners with him, or to be known and approved of by the apostles, to be messengers of churches, preachers of the word, or even to be apostles themselves, and the chiefest of them."
3. "For such are blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ, are complete and perfect in him, are safe and secure, and can never perish."

### John Wesley:
1. Who are of note among the apostles ‚Äî They seem to have been some of the most early converts.
Fellowprisoners ‚Äî For the gospel's sake.
