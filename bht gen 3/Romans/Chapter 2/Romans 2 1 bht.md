## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The address passes gradually to the Jews. They were the people who judged‚Äîwho pronounced all Gentiles to be born in sin and under condemnation."
2. "This is evident by comparing the charge, 'thou that judgest does the same things,' with verses 21‚Äì23, where the same charge is implied in a direct address to the Jew."
3. "Therefore thy setting thyself up as a judge is unjustifiable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since you Jews condemn the Gentiles for their sins, on the ground that they have the means of knowing their duty, therefore, you who are far more favored than they, are entirely without an excuse for the same things."
2. "It often happens, too, that people are remarkably zealous in opposing those offences which they themselves secretly practice."
3. "Remarkable zeal against sin may be no proof of innocence; the zeal of persecutors, and often of pretended reformers, may be far from proof that they are free from the very offences which they are condemning in others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. O man. General, but still with a general and slightly reproachful reference to the Jew. 
Judgest [Œ∫œÅŒπŒΩœâŒΩ] . With the sense of condemning.


### John Calvin:
1. "Though thou consented not to the vices of others, and seemest to be avowedly even an enemy and a reprover of vices; yet as thou art not free from them, if thou really examinest thyself, thou canst not bring forward any defense."
2. "Thou art doubly deserving of condemnation; for thou art guilty of the same vices which thou blamest and reprovest in others."
3. "Though thou judgest, thou yet doest the same things."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Without excuse; as in chap. Romans 1:20"
2. "The judgment pronounced upon others applies to the man's own conduct."
3. "The censorious spirit is of the same sinful character as vice."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Without excuse."
2. "Whosoever thou art that judgest."
3. "Thou condemnest thyself."

### John Gill:
1. "Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man...such could never be justified before God by their works, but might be justly condemned by him."
2. "they...thought themselves to be righteous persons, and justified in the sight of God; and who, though they were secretly guilty of many abominable iniquities, yet were very severe upon the sins of others, and therefore inexcusable."
3. "the words respect every man, of whatsoever nation, office, or place; and may be particularly applied to hypocrites, and seem designed to correct censoriousness, and hasty judging, and to throw confusion on such who value themselves on being the censurers and reprovers of others."

### John Wesley:
1. "Therefore ‚Äî The apostle now makes a transition from the gentiles to the Jews, till, at Romans 2:6, he comprises both."
2. "Thou art inexcusable ‚Äî Seeing knowledge without practice only increases guilt."
3. "For in that thou judgest the other ‚Äî The heathen. Thou condemnest thyself; for thou doest the same things ‚Äî In effect; in many instances."
