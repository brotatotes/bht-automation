### Philip Schaff:
1. "For there is no respect, etc. This is not a mere repetition of Romans 2:6; but shows the reason why ‘the Jew first, and also of the Greek.’ Since God has no respect of persons, He must judge the Jew first."
2. "The verse, therefore, constitutes a proper transition to the next paragraph (Romans 2:12-16), which sets forth that God’s judgment is according to light."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Respect of persons (προσωπολημψια). Milligan (Vocabulary) considers this word (in N.T. only here, Colossians 3:25; Ephesians 6:9) and προσωπολημπτης (Acts 10:34) and προσωπολημπτεω (James 2:9) the earliest definitely known Christian words, not in LXX or non-Christian writings."

1. "It will not come into consideration, at the day of judgment, of what nation men are; or from what parents they are descended; nor of what age and sex persons be; nor in what state and condition they have lived in this world; nor will it be asked to what sect they have belonged, and by what denomination they have been called; or whether they have conformed to such and such externals and rituals in religion; but only whether they are righteous men or sinners; and accordingly as they appear under these characters, judgment will proceed." 
2. "This passage respects matters of strict justice, and is a forensic expression relating to courts of judicature, where persons presiding are to have no regard to the faces of men, but do that which is strictly just between man and man."
3. "Though God, as a Judge, respects no man's person; yet in matters of grace he distinguishes one person from another, as it is plain he does by the bounties of his Providence."

### John Wesley:
1. "For there is no respect of persons with God."
2. "He will reward every one according to his works."
3. "But this is well consistent with his distributing advantages and opportunities of improvement, according to his own good pleasure."
