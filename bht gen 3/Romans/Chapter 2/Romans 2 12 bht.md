# Romans 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Everyone will be judged by God, whether or not they have a revealed law. Those without a revealed law will be convicted based on their sinning against nature, while those with a revealed law will be judged according to the specific law they have. Both groups will face condemnation and perish, as the judgment is not based on the historical form of the law, but on the underlying principle of law itself. God's impartiality in judgment is evident, regardless of one's knowledge or adherence to a specific law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Whether that will ameliorate their case, is not even hinted,â€”but only the fact, as consonant with Godâ€™s justice, stated."
2. "This is the meaning of without law, that he is convicted without its condemnation, by the arguments of nature only."
3. "These verses are no general assertions concerning men who have, and men who have not, a law revealed (for all have one), but a statement of the case as concerning Jews and Gentiles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For as many as have sinnedâ€”not 'as many as have sinned at all,' but, 'as many as are found in sin' at the judgment of the great day."
2. "Without lawâ€”that is, without the advantage of a positive Revelation."
3. "And as many as have sinned in the lawâ€”within the pale of a positive, written Revelation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This includes all who have done it, and evidently has respect to the Gentile world. It is of the more importance to remark this, because he does not say that it is applicable to a few only, or to great and incorrigible instances of pagan wickedness, but it is a universal, sweeping declaration, obviously including all."
2. "The strain of the argument, as well as this express declaration, shows that they who had sinned - and in the first chapter he had proved that all the pagan were sinners - would be punished. If any of the pagan are saved, it will be, therefore, an exception to the general rule in regard to them."
3. "It will be observed here, that the apostle uses a different expression in regard to the Jews from what he does of the Gentiles. He says of the former, that they 'shall be judged;' of the latter, that they 'shall perish.' It is not certainly known why he varied this expression. But if conjecture may be allowed, it may have been for the following reasons."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The article is usually wanting when the stress is laid, not upon the historical impress and outward form of the law, but upon the conception itself."
2. "Law considered as a principle, exemplified no doubt chiefly and signally in the Mosaic law, but very much wider than this in its application."
3. "Both classes of men shall be condemned; in both the result will be perishing, but the judgment by the law is confined to those who have the law."

### John Calvin:
1. "See then what kind of advocacy they undertake, who through misplaced mercy, attempt, on the ground of ignorance, to exempt the nations who have not the light of the gospel from the judgment of God." 
2. "A worse condition then awaits the Jewish sinners, since their condemnation is already pronounced in their own law."
3. "The word 'condemned' would be better in the text than 'judged;' it would then more plainly correspond with the former part, where the word 'perished' is used: and that it means 'condemned' is evident, for those who have 'sinned' are the persons referred to."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since God is no respecter of persons it follows that He will judge according to light."
2. "The immoral heathen will not be punished...with the rigor of the written law, as in the case of disobedient Jews and unfaithful Christians, but according to their light."
3. "The unfaithful Christians will be judged more severely than the disobedient Jews, and the disobedient Jews than the immoral Gentiles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The heathen who sin are lost, because they do not keep the law which they have, not because they do not have the Mosaic law or Christianity."
2. "The Jew has to stand or fall by the Mosaic law."
3. "The heathen who sin are lost, because they do not keep the law which they have, not because they do not have the Mosaic law or Christianity."

### John Gill:
1. "This is an instance of the strict justice of God, and proves him to be no respecter of persons."
2. "Their not having the written law of Moses will be no plea in their favour, or be a reason why they should not be condemned."
3. "Their having this law will be no bar against their condemnation, but rather an aggravation of it; their hearing of it will be no plea in their favour."

### John Wesley:
1. "For as many as have sinned â€” He speaks as of the time past, for all time will be past at the day of judgment."
2. "Without the law â€” Without having any written law."
3. "The word also shows the agreement of the manner of sinning, with the manner of suffering."

- Attempt 1 BHT: It is clear from this passage that both Jews and Gentiles will face condemnation on the day of judgment. The distinction lies in the fact that the Gentiles, who do not have the Mosaic law or Christianity, will perish because they have not kept the law that they do have. On the other hand, the Jews will be judged by the very law they boast about and claim to follow. This is a sobering reminder that God's judgment is impartial and based on the light and knowledge that each individual has been given. Ultimately, all who have sinned will be held accountable, whether under the written law or not. This highlights the importance of living according to the light we have been given, as that will be the basis of our judgment.

- Attempt 2 BHT: Both Jews and Gentiles will face judgment, but there is a distinction between them. The Gentiles, without the Mosaic law or Christianity, will perish because they have not kept the law they do have. In contrast, the Jews will be judged by the very law they boast about. God's judgment is impartial and based on the light and knowledge each person has received. We are accountable for our actions, regardless of whether we have the written law or not.
