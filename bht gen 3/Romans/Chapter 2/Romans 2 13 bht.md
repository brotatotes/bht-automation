# Romans 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who merely hear the law but do not practice it cannot be justified before God. It is not enough to be a hearer of the law; one must be a doer. The condemnation for those who continue in sin will echo within themselves as their own conscience bears witness against their iniquity. This emphasizes the significance of obedience and action rather than merely hearing. Justification comes from fulfilling the righteous requirements of the law.
