# Romans 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Although the Gentiles do not have the Mosaic law, they are not without some knowledge of God in conscience. In fact, a conscientious Gentile, who knows not the law, can still set up the law to himself and act in accordance with its requirements. However, the Apostle emphasizes that these virtues and the Gentiles' own sense of righteousness are insufficient for salvation. Nonetheless, the Gentiles, when they do what is right, are a law to themselves, for their moral nature serves as a substitute for the revealed law. Thus, they are judged based on the doing of this internal law. Ultimately, the Gentiles have within themselves a law, ratified by their own reason and conscience, which acts as a guide in the absence of the written law.
