# Romans 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews prided themselves on their knowledge of God's will, distinguishing and approving things that are excellent through their instruction in the law. However, their discernment often didn't translate into righteous living, as they were quick to judge others but failed to regulate their own conduct accordingly. True discernment and approval come from sincerely attending to God's will as revealed in the law and faithfully putting it into practice.

	latter action. (See on :-).


### Albert Barnes:

2. "...excellent things are then only rightly approved (provided our judgment proceeds from sincerity) when God is attended to; for his will, as it is revealed in the law, is here appointed as the guide and teacher of what is to be justly approved."
3. "Thou provest, or, distinguishest things which differ..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And knowest his will; lit, â€˜the will,â€™ evidently Godâ€™s will, as revealed in the law."
2. "Approvest the things that are excellent; or, â€˜dost distinguish the things that differ.â€™ Both translations are verbally exact, the latter being more in accordance with usage. But it gives so tame a sense here, in this glowing rebuke, that the other is to be preferred."
3. "Being instructed, etc. This was the means by which the will of God was known, and the excellent things approved. There is a reference to the public reading and exposition of the law in the synagogue."

### John Gill:
1. "Persons may know their Lord's will, as the Jews did, and not do it, and so be worthy to be beaten with many stripes."
2. "Having tried and discerned them, they approved of them in their judgment as the things more excellent; but then they did not put these excellent things in practice which they approved of."
3. "The knowledge and approbation they had of these things, arose from their being instructed out of the law, and not the Gospel; for the excellent things of the Gospel, they had no discerning, knowledge and approbation of."
