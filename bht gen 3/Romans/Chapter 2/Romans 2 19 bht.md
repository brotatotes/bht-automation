# Romans 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, proud of their titles as a guide of the blind and leaders of the blind, held themselves as instructors and mentors for the unenlightened Gentiles. However, their conceit led to arrogance, causing them to become inflated in their own minds. While they saw themselves as lights for those in darkness, they were actually lacking luminosity, akin to dim lights and dark lanterns. It was common for the Jews to label the Gentiles as blind, in darkness, ignorant, and babes. Sadly, their self-proclaimed positions as guides and leaders yielded no fruitful results.
