# Romans 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews were meant to be guides for the Gentiles, a light for those in darkness. This intention resulted in conceited arrogance, as they saw themselves as instructors and teachers of the ignorant, deeming the Gentiles blind and in darkness. These designations were not uncommon among the Jews, who believed themselves superior and condescendingly sought to make proselytes. However, their pride blinded them to the true purpose of their calling, leaving them as miserable and dim lights, blind guides leading the blind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "a guide of the blind" - We can hardly say with Olshausen, that the Apostle undoubtedly refers to the saying of our Lord, Matt. xv. 14,‚Äîbut rather that both that saying and this were allusive to a title ‚Äúleaders of the blind‚Äù given to themselves by the Pharisees. 
2. "similarly, the following titles may have been well-known and formal expressions" - Similarly, the following titles may have been well-known and formal expressions.
