# Romans 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Having the advantage of definite and precise information from heaven, those who possessed the law saw themselves as instructors and custodians of knowledge and truth, claiming superiority over the Gentiles. However, Paul's portrayal of the Jews reveals their hypocrisy, as their outward appearance of knowledge and truth was not matched by a corresponding obedience to the law. Despite their form of knowledge and their pride in their religious instruction, they could not be justified by the law alone.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who had the law had the advantage of concrete knowledge and precise information about divine things, being favored with clear instruction and guidance. The law, although only a partial reflection of God's holiness and character, contained a foreshadowing of Christ. However, possessing this knowledge and truth in the law was not enough. It required a corresponding course of holy conduct. The Jews, who saw themselves as teachers of the ignorant Gentiles, prided themselves on their form of knowledge and truth, but they failed to live up to their own standards. This is Paul's skillfully drawn and subtly ironic picture of the Jews, highlighting their proud attitude while exposing their inability to be justified by the law alone.
