# Romans 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How ironic it is to see the one who preaches against stealing caught in the act of stealing. The preacher may have eloquent words, yet fails to practice what they teach. This reminds us of the condemnation of the Rabbins for the sin of adultery. It is truly shocking to have teachers who lack in knowledge themselves. Let this be a warning against boasting in our gospel knowledge while living in uncleanness. May we not be mere babblers, but instead, let us embody the truth that we proclaim.
