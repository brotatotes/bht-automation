# Romans 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Circumcision, the outward sign of being within the covenant, is now of no value. The Jewish transgressor is no better off than the Gentile sinner. Mere possession of the sign or reliance on external advantages cannot secure favor with God. True circumcision is not a matter of outward observances but of the heart. Claiming righteousness through rituals is futile; a transformed heart is what matters. The worth of circumcision lies in its connection to a genuine relationship with God.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Circumcision, once seen as a mark of being within the covenant with God, now holds no significance. It is no more advantageous than being uncircumcised. The outward sign of circumcision is meaningless unless it is accompanied by a life that aligns with the law. Merely possessing the sign or relying on external advantages does not grant favor with God. True circumcision and true relationship with God are matters of the heart. Whether Jew or Gentile, one's claim to righteousness cannot rest on outward observances but on genuine goodness. The outward sign of circumcision is only valuable if it points to the inward reality of a transformed heart.
