# Romans 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The possession of external advantages, like circumcision, without obedience and genuine faith, does not entitle one to the favor of God. True circumcision and true Judaism are matters of the heart, not mere external rituals. The focus should be on inner transformation and obedience, rather than relying solely on external acts for salvation. The true essence of circumcision lies in the heart, not in outward rituals. The same principle applies to baptism as well.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:

2. "None of [these external advantages] entitle to the favor of God; and unless they are improved as they should be, they may be only the means of increasing our condemnation."
3. "No external advantages, no name, or rite, or ceremony will save you. God requires the obedience of the heart and of the life. Where there is a disposition to render that, there is an advantage in possessing the external means of grace. Where that is missing, no rite or profession can save."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "But if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionable wrong, either in relation to the gods, or his parents, or the state, let the judge deem him to be incurable, remembering what an education and training he has had from youth upward, and yet has not abstained from the greatest of crimes."
2. "Thy circumcision is made uncircumcision."
3. "Breaker of the law [œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÑŒ∑œÇ]. Rev., transgressor."

### John Calvin:
1. "The true character of circumcision was a spiritual promise, which required faith: the Jews neglected both, the promise as well as faith. Then foolish was their confidence."
2. "Circumcision then requires perfection. The same may be also said of our baptism: when any one confidently relies on the water of baptism alone, and thinks that he is justified, as though he had obtained holiness by that ordinance itself, the end of baptism must be adduced as an objection; which is, that the Lord thereby calls us to holiness of life."
3. "Now many, seeing that Paul brings forward circumcision rather than any other part of the law, suppose that he takes away justification only from ceremonies: but the matter is far otherwise; for it always happens, that those who dare to set up their own merits against the righteousness of God, glory more in outward observances than in real goodness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "True circumcision and true Judaism are not outward matters but of the heart."
2. "My circumcision profits me, even if I am guilty as you charge."
3. "The unholy Jew virtually becomes a Gentile."

3. "Circumcision was simply the seal of the covenant relation of Israel with God."


### John Gill:
1. "Circumcision was profitable; which must be understood whilst it was in force, before the abrogation of it, for since, it is not profitable but pernicious." 
2. "For circumcision obliged persons to keep the whole law. Now the circumcised Jews did not keep it in such sense; wherefore circumcision was of no use to them."
3. "Such a man was all one as an uncircumcised Gentile, and appeared to be uncircumcised in a spiritual sense."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who merely possess external advantages, such as circumcision, but do not live in obedience to the law and the inward reality it represents are no better off than those without these advantages. The true essence of circumcision lies in the heart, not in outward rituals. It is not enough to rely on outward signs and professions; God requires genuine obedience and faith. The possession of these external means of grace can be an advantage when coupled with a heart disposed towards righteousness. However, without true obedience, no ceremony or profession can save. The same principle applies to baptism as well. The focus is on inner transformation rather than external observances, for these external acts are only beneficial when accompanied by true faith and obedience.
