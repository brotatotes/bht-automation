## BHT:
The Apostle Paul asserts that circumcision, the symbol of the Mosaic Law, is secondary to actually obeying the Law. He presents a scenario where an uncircumcised Gentile, faithfully keeping the Law, is regarded as if he were circumcised. This reveals that receiving God's approval does not depend on external privileges, but on the state of one's heart and the adherence to His commands. It implies that a Gentile who obeys the Law may surpass a circumcised Jew who neglects it. Ultimately, God judges individuals based on the sincerity of their faith and obedience.
