- Attempt 3 BHT: If an uncircumcised man could fully act according to the moral requirements of the law, then being within the covenant of circumcision would truly be profitable if one kept the law. However, if one fails to fulfill the law and lives no differently than the uncircumcised, they are no better off than the heathen. The emphasis here is not on judging others, but on recognizing that an uncircumcised pagan who keeps the law may actually condemn those who possess the external privileges of being Jewish. It is in this sense that the men of Nineveh and the queen of the south will condemn the generation of Christ, for they fulfilled the law through their actions while those with the letter and circumcision transgressed it.
