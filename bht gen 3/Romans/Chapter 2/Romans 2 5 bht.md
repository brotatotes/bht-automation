# Romans 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The day of judgment, referred to as the day of wrath, is when sinners will face the manifestation of God's righteous judgment. This wrath is not reserved for the reckless, but for those who arrogantly boast of their purity of faith and life. Instead of repenting, they amass a growing stockpile of divine wrath, oblivious to the forbearance of God. The sinner's unreconstructed heart and hardness become the basis for God's judgment, which will be revealed on the day of the Lord.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hardness' is used to denote insensibility of mind... a state of mind where the goodness and forbearance of God have no effect."
2. "Wrath, like wealth treasured up, is not exhausted at present, and hence, the sinner becomes bolder in sin... Most people have an immense treasure of this kind in store, which eternal ages of pain will not exhaust or diminish!"
3. "The punishment of the wicked is future. It is not exhausted in this life. It is treasured up for a future day, and that day is a day of wrath."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Wrath against the day of wrath. A very striking image - treasuring up wrath for one's self."
3. "The sinner stores it away. Its forthcoming is withheld by the forbearance of God. It will break out in the day when God's righteous judgment shall be revealed."

### John Calvin:
1. "We may hence learn [...] that the ungodly not only accumulate for themselves daily a heavier weight of God‚Äôs judgments, as long as they live here, but that the gifts of God also, which they continually enjoy, shall increase their condemnation."
2. "The ungodly gather now the indignation of God against themselves, the stream of which shall then be poured on their heads: they accumulate hidden destruction, which then shall be drawn out from the treasures of God."
3. "And thus all other visitations of God are ever described as dreadful and full of terror to the ungodly; and on the contrary, as pleasant and joyful to the godly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Instead of being thereby led to repentance, men allow themselves to fancy that God‚Äôs goodness is a proof that He will not punish sin."
2. "The despising of the riches of God‚Äôs goodness in forbearance and long suffering is the heaping up of a treasure of wrath."
3. "God‚Äôs ‚Äòrighteous judgment‚Äô will not be fully revealed until the great day of final judgment."

2. "Thy unreconstructed heart," "with no change in the attitude of thy heart."
3. "Paul looks to the judgment day as certain (cf. 2 Corinthians 5:10-12), the day of the Lord."

- Attempt 1 BHT: On the day of judgment, sinners who have not admitted their need for repentance will experience the wrath of God, as their accumulation of divine wrath reaches its breaking point. This concept is particularly significant because it applies not to the reckless, but to those who boast of their righteousness. By storing away wrath for themselves, they fail to recognize the forbearance extended to them by their Creator. Their hardened hearts reject the transformation that God seeks to bring about, leading them to amass a stockpile of divine wrath. Such wrath will eventually be unleashed in the day when God's righteous judgment is fully revealed. This certainty of judgment is a recurring theme for Paul, who recognizes the undeniable reality of the coming day of the Lord.
