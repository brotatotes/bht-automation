## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle is here speaking generally, of the general system of God in governing the world,â€”the judging according to each manâ€™s worksâ€”punishing the evil, and rewarding the righteous."
2. "No question at present arises, how this righteousness in Godâ€™s sight is to be obtainedâ€”but the truth is only stated broadly at present, to be further specified by and by."
3. "However true it be, so much is certainly not meant here, but merely the fact, that every where, and in all, God punishes evil, and rewards good."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God will be just, and will treat every man as he ought to be treated, or according to his character."
2. "It is not true that God will treat people according to their external conduct: but the whole language of the Bible implies that he will judge people according to the whole of their conduct, including their thoughts, and principles, and motives; that is, as they deserve."
3. "Christians will be saved on account of the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ, but still the rewards of heaven will be according to their works; that is, they who have labored most, and been most faithful, shall receive the highest reward."

### John Calvin:
1. "He pointed out the true character of the righteousness of works, even that which is of account before God; and he did this, lest they should feel confident that it was enough to pacify him, if they brought words and trifles, or leaves only."
2. "For the Lord, by visiting the wickedness of the reprobate with just vengeance, will recompense them with what they have deserved."
3. "He will also crown their good works, but not on account of any merit: nor can this be proved from this verse; for though it declares what reward good works are to have, it does yet by no means show what they are worth, or what price is due to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The wicked will be punished on account of their works, and according to their works; the righteous will be rewarded, not on account of, but according to their works."
2. "Good works are to them the evidence of their belonging to that class to whom, for Christâ€™s sake, eternal life is graciously awarded; and they are in some sense, and to some extent, the measure of that reward."
3. "The fact that the Apostle, in this connection, speaks of the judgment as â€˜according to my gospel, through Jesus Christâ€™ shows that he was not aware of any inconsistency between the two principles."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Who will render (Î¿Ï‚ Î±Ï€Î¿Î´Ï‰ÏƒÎµ). Paul quotes Proverbs 24:12 as in 2 Timothy 4:14. See also Matthew 16:27; Revelation 22:12. The rendering will be in accord with the facts. 


### John Gill:
1. "God will render to wicked men according to the demerit of their sins, the just recompense of reward, eternal damnation..."
2. "...and to good men eternal life, not according to the merit of their good works, which have none in them, but according to the nature of them..."
3. "...God will render to evil men according to the true desert of their evil deeds; and of his own free grace will render to good men, whom he has made so by his grace, what is suitable and agreeable to those good works..."

### John Wesley:
1.  Proverbs 24:12
