# Romans 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who live a life of moral goodness and seek recognition and honor will receive glory and immortality. On the contrary, those who are factious and do not obey the truth but choose to live in unrighteousness will face the wrath and indignation of God. They engage in stubborn resistance to the Gospel and their deeds emanate from a self-seeking spirit. They even contend with God and oppose His claims. Therefore, God will render tribulation and anguish upon them, as they have chosen to serve sin rather than submit to the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The term rendered well-doing is singular, good work: indicating moral habitude in the whole, the general course of life and action."
2. "Glory, absolute imparted glory like His own...honour, recognition, relative precedence...immortality, literally, incorruptibility."
3. "(literally) to those who are of self-seeking; those who live in, act from, are situated in, and do their deeds from a spirit of ambitious secking of their own interests."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, c."
2. "referring to such keen and determined resistance to the Gospel"
3. "indignation and wrath‚Äîin the bosom of a sin-avenging God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "One striking characteristic of the sinner is, that he contends with God, that is, that he opposes and resists his claims."
2. "The truth here means all the correct representations which had been made of God, and his perfections, and law, and claims, whether by the light of nature or by revelation."
3. "Iniquity thus may be said to reign over people, as they follow the dictates of evil, make no resistance to it, and implicitly obey all its hard requirements."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Contentious [ŒµŒæ ŒµœÅŒπŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±œÇ] . Rev., better, factious. Lit., of faction. See on James 3:14. Intriguers; partisan agitators. 
Indignation and wrath [ŒøœÅŒ≥Œ∑ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∏œÖŒºŒøœÇ] . See on be patient, James 5:7.


### John Calvin:
1. "Contention is mentioned here for rebellion and stubbornness; for Paul was contending with hypocrites who, by their gross and supine self-indulgence, trifled with God."
2. "For it is what belongs to all the ungodly, that they ever prefer to be in bondage to iniquity, rather than to receive the yoke of God."
3. "We never fear God‚Äôs judgment as we ought, except it be set as it were by a lively description before our eyes; nor do we really burn with desire for future life, except when roused by strong incentives."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‚ÄòContentious‚Äô is not exact, since the word is derived from serve, meaning to work for hire. In the New Testament the derivative always means factiousness, venal partisanship; here it refers to those who are intriguing, selfishly serving a party, and not the truth."
2. "Notice how ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô and ‚Äòunrighteousness‚Äô are directly opposed to each other by the Apostle."
3. "‚ÄòWrath‚Äô points to the permanent attitude of a holy God toward sin; ‚Äòindignation,‚Äô to its particular manifestation, at the judgment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The construction changes and the substantives that follow are not the object of Œ±œÄŒøŒ¥œâœÉŒµ like Œ∂œâŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±ŒπŒΩœâŒΩŒπŒøŒΩ above, but are in the nominative as if with ŒµœÉŒøŒΩœÑŒ± (shall be) understood."

### John Gill:
1. "who contend for victory, and not truth; strive about words to no profit; are quarrelsome, and sow discord among men, and in churches;"
2. "and do not obey the truth; neither attend to the light of nature, and to that which may be known of God by it; nor regard and submit to the Gospel revelation"
3. "but obey unrighteousness; are servants of sin: to these God renders indignation and wrath; wrathful or fiery indignation, the hottest of his fury."
