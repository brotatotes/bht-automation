# Romans 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What advantage does the Jew have? If true Judaism and circumcision are merely spiritual, what is the profit of external Judaism and ceremonial circumcision? Paul warns that many Jews may rest in the form of knowledge and truth in the law while being in the bond of iniquity. Though bare circumcision brought nothing to the Jews, God would not have appointed it without some intended benefit. Let us take warning and not justify ourselves, lest we condemn ourselves before God.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If the final judgment will turn solely on the state of the heart, and this may be as good in the Gentile without, as in the Jew within, the sacred enclosure of God's covenant, what better are we Jews for all our advantages?"
2. "But, alas! how many among ourselves, with all our superior light, rest in ‘the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law,’ while we are ‘in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity!’"

### John Calvin:
1. "Though Paul has clearly proved that bare circumcision brought nothing to the Jews, yet since he could not deny but that there was some difference between the Gentiles and the Jews, which by that symbol was sealed to them by the Lord, and since it was inconsistent to make a distinction, of which God was the author, void and of no moment, it remained for him to remove also this objection."
2. "It was indeed evident, that it was a foolish glorying in which the Jews on this account indulged; yet still a doubt remained as to the design of circumcision; for the Lord would not have appointed it had not some benefit been intended."
3. "For this separated the Jews from the common class of men; it was a partition-wall, as Paul calls ceremonies, which kept parties asunder."

### John Gill:
