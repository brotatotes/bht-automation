## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These statements of the Psalmist were indeed suggested by particular manifestations of human depravity occurring under his own eye." 
2. "But as this only showed what man, when unrestrained, is in his present condition." 
3. "They were quite pertinent to the apostle's purpose."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The point to be proved was, that the Jews, in the matter of justification, had no advantage or preference over the Gentiles; that the Jew had failed to keep the Law which had been given him, as the Gentile had failed to keep the Law which had been given him; and that both, therefore, were equally dependent on the mercy of God, incapable of being justified and saved by their works."
2. "That the apostle applies the passages to the case of the Jews is admitted, yet it is evident more is contained in them than the single proof of Jewish depravity. They go all the length of proving the depravity of mankind, and are cited expressly with this view."
3. "The design of the apostle, however, is not to prove that there were few or none pious. He is treating of the impossibility of justification by works, and alleges in proof that, according to the judgment of God in the Psalms 14:1 Psalm, there were none righteous, etc., in regard to their natural estate, or the condition in which man is, previous to his being justified."

### John Calvin:
1. "And hence let ecclesiastical teachers learn what their office is; for since Paul asserts here no truth but what he confirms by the sure testimony of Scripture, much less ought such a thing to be attempted by those, who have no other commission but to preach the gospel, which they have received through Paul and others."
2. "The Apostle, who gives the meaning rather than the entire words, seems, in the first place, before he comes to particulars, to state generally the substance of what the Prophet declares to be in man, and that is â€” that none is righteous; he afterwards particularly enumerates the effects or fruits of this unrighteousness."
3. "The eleventh verse (Romans 3:11) is from the same Psalm; the Hebrew, with which the Septuagint agree, except that there is the disjunctiveá¼¢ between the participles, is the following, â€” 'Whether there is any one who understands, who seeks after God.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As it is written, Paul here uses a catena or chain of quotations to prove his point in verse Romans 3:9 that Jews are in no better fix than the Greeks for all are under sin."
2. "Paul may have used one of them or he may have put these passages together himself."
3. "This sentence is like a motto for all the rest, a summary for what follows."

### John Gill:
1. "There is none righteous, no, not one."
2. "If there is none on earth that does good and does not sin, there is none righteous upon earth, 'no, not one' single person."
3. "None are righteous by their obedience to the law of works; nor are there any righteous in the sight of God, upon the foot of their own righteousness, however they may appear in their own eyes, and in the sight of others."

### John Wesley:
1. "That all men are under sin appears from the vices which have raged in all ages."
2. "The particulars follow: their dispositions and designs, their discourse, their actions."
3. "Not what he makes them by his grace."
