# Romans 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
According to Scripture, God examines mankind from heaven, hoping to find someone who understands and seeks Him, but finds none. This sobering reality exposes the fallen nature of humanity and our inclination to neglect God. True righteousness lies in knowing and pursuing God, viewing it as the highest privilege. Failing to seek after God reveals our ignorance and foolishness. Without the knowledge of God, all other pursuits of wisdom are empty. We cannot attain spiritual understanding through human reasoning alone; we rely on the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
