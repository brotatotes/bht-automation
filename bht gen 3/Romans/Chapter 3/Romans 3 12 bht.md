# Romans 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The radical idea of this verse is the profitableness or lack thereof in our actions towards others. The distinction between ajgaqwsunh and crhstothv is that the former represents a stern virtue that rebukes and corrects, while the latter is a kind and gracious disposition towards our neighbors. Humanity has declined from the path of piety and virtue, becoming equally unprofitable and worthless. There is not even one who can do good spiritually without the grace of God. Ultimately, our actions are unable to profit ourselves or others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "They have all gone out of the way - They have 'declined' from the true path of piety and virtue."
2. "They are together - They have at the same time; or they have equally become unprofitable. They are as one; they are joined, or united in this declension. The expression denotes union, or similarity."
3. "There is none ... - This is taken literally from the Hebrew."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The radical idea of the word is profitableness."
2. "The distinction as drawn out by Jerome is that ajgaqwsunh represents a sterner virtue, showing itself in a zeal for truth which rebukes, corrects, and chastises, as Christ when He purged the temple."
3. "Crhstothv is more gentle, gracious, and kindly Bishop Lightfoot defines it as a kindly disposition to one's neighbor, not necessarily taking a practical form, while ajgaqwsunh energizes the crhstothv."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this we are to understand, that they had put off every feeling of humanity."
2. "For as the best bond of mutual concord among us is the knowledge of God, so inhumanity commonly follows where there is ignorance of God."
3. "Idolatry was evidently this putrescence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Unprofitable. More literally, â€˜useless,â€™ â€˜worthless."
2. "Not even one. â€˜ There is not even unto one.â€™ The same form occurs in Romans 3:1 of the Psalm, from which Romans 3:10 here varies."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They are together become unprofitable."
2. "No, not so much as one."

### John Gill:
1. "Man had a considerable stock of righteousness, holiness, knowledge, c. but he has run through all, has contracted large and numerous debts..."
2. "Christ indeed has undertook to pay, and he has paid all the debts of his people and has put them into a better state than ever Adam was in."
3. "There is none that can do good in a spiritual manner, without the grace of God, strength from Christ, and the assistance of the Spirit; and there is not even a spiritual man, that can do good perfectly, and without sin."

### John Wesley:
1. They have all turned aside â€” From the good way.
They are become unprofitable â€” Helpless impotent, unable to profit either themselves or others.
