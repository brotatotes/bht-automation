# Romans 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of the law is to bring the entire world under God's judgment and to stop every mouth from self-justification. The law serves as overwhelming evidence in the court of God, convicting all of their guilt. This applies not only to the Jews but to everyone, as the law reveals the universal guilt of humanity. Through the law, the inadequacy of human works and the need for God's grace are made evident. Consequently, all are guilty and liable to God's just condemnation.
