# Romans 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of the law is not to render individuals righteous, but to bring to light the sinfulness of mankind. Whether it is the deeds prescribed by the law or the moral law written in the hearts of Gentiles and Jews, they cannot justify anyone before God. It is only through the acknowledgement of human guilt and the impossibility of earning righteousness through obedience to the violated law that one can truly appreciate and accept the grace of the Gospel. The law exposes the knowledge of sin, but it does not provide deliverance from its guilt or power.

2. "Note, How broad and deep does the apostle in this section lay the foundations of his great doctrine of Justification by free grace‚Äîin the disorder of man's whole nature, the consequent universality of human guilt, the condemnation, by reason of the breach of divine law, of the whole world, and the impossibility of justification before God by obedience to that violated law!"
3. "Only when these humiliating conclusions are accepted and felt, are we in a condition to appreciate and embrace the grace of the Gospel, next to be opened up."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Works of the law. Not the Mosaic law in its ritual or ceremonial aspect; but the law in a deeper and more general sense, as written both in the decalogue and in the hearts of the Gentiles, and embracing the moral deeds of both Gentiles and Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "Hence it most clearly appears, that there can be no justification before God by the law, since it stops the mouths of men, and pronounces them guilty."
2. "no one person: 'flesh' designs men, and men as corrupt and carnal, in opposition to God..."
3. "but it is a forensic word, or legal term, and stands opposed to a being condemned; and signifies to be acquitted, discharged, and made righteous in a legal sense, which can never be done by an imperfect obedience to the law..."

### John Wesley:
1. "No flesh shall be justified ‚Äî None shall be forgiven and accepted of God."
2. "And it is not without reason, that he so often mentions the works of the law, whether ceremonial or moral; for it was on these only the Jews relied."
3. "For by the law is only the knowledge of sin - But no deliverance either from the guilt or power of it."
