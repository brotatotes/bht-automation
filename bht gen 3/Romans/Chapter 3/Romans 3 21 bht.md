# Romans 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This speaks of a righteousness that transcends the law and our own works. It is a righteousness that has been manifested in history and still endures. It is not a new discovery, but has been predicted and foreshadowed in the Old Testament. Both the law and the prophets bear testament to this righteousness, which is given by God and received through faith alone. We are justified by God's mercy and His promises, not by our works. This righteousness is made known in the Gospel, apart from the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "independently of the law; not 'without the works of the law': for here it is not the way to the righteousness of God which is spoken of (which is faith), but that righteousness itself." 
2. "The perfect tense sets forth the manifestation of this righteousness in history as an accomplished and still enduring fact." 
3. "the law and the prophets remain on record as a revelation of God's will."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A righteousness to which our obedience to the law contributes nothing whatever."
2. "This justifying righteousness, though new, as only now fully disclosed, is an old righteousness, predicted and foreshadowed in the Old Testament."
3. "Thus this justifying righteousness, though new, as only now fully disclosed, is an old righteousness, predicted and foreshadowed in the Old Testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To do this, was the main design of the Epistle, Romans 1:17."
2. "It does not mean that God abandoned his Law; or that Jesus Christ did not regard the Law, for he came to 'magnify' it Isaiah 42:21"
3. "The general tenor of the Old Testament - the appointment of sacrifices, etc. taught that man was a sinner, and that he could not be justified by obedience to the moral law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Expressing the contrast between two relations - dependence on the law and non - dependence on the law."
2. "Without the law. In a sphere different from that in which the law says 'Do this and live.'"
3. "The present participle indicates that this testimony is now being borne by the Old Testament to the new dispensation."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought then to know, that the merits of works are excluded. We also see that he blends not works with the mercy of God; but having taken away and wholly removed all confidence in works, he sets up mercy alone."
2. "But we are in Christ because we are out of ourselves; and justified by faith, because we must recumb on the mercy of God alone, and on his gratuitous promises; and freely, because God reconciles us to himself by burying our sins."
3. "Still more, the conscience, by which we are disturbed on the score of works, performs its office, not for one day only, but continues to do so through life. It hence follows that we cannot remain, even to death, in a justified state, except we look to Christ only, in whom God has adopted us, and regards us now as accepted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But now. Either, 'at this time,' i.e., in the gospel dispensation, or, 'in this state of things,' i.e., as further defined. The latter is preferable."
2. "The righteousness of God, or, 'God's righteousness.' As in chap. Romans 1:17, the article is wanting. The meaning here is precisely as there, a righteousness which proceeds from God; it is given to the believer for Christ's sake in the act of justification."
3. "Being witnessed. Continuously witnessed in the whole Old Testament Scriptures. This is not a contradiction to 'apart from the law.' The revelation having been made in the gospel, it turns out that the Old Testament attests what its legal requirements did not and could not make known, while the law could not justify (Romans 3:20), there is no contradiction between the parts of God's revelation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This God kind of righteousness is 'apart from law' of any kind and all of grace."
2. "But it is not a new discovery on the part of Paul, but 'witnessed by the law and the prophets,' made plain continuously by God himself."
3. "The necessity of which he has shown in Romans 1:18-3."

### John Gill:
1. "The manifestation of [God's righteousness] is without the law... the law shows what righteousness is, but does not direct the sinner where there is one to be had, that will make him righteous in the sight of God." 
2. "A testimony is borne to the justifying righteousness of Christ both 'by the law', particularly in the five books of Moses... and the prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, and others." 
3. "The righteousness of God is... made known without the law, and only in the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "But now the righteousness of God â€” That is, the manner of becoming righteous which God hath appointed."
2. "Without the law â€” Without that previous obedience which the law requires; without reference to the law, or dependence on it."
3. "Is manifested â€” In the gospel. Being attested by the Law itself, and by the Prophets - By all the promises in the Old Testament."

- Attempt 1 BHT: This verse speaks of a righteousness that is independent of the law and not reliant on our own works. It is a righteousness that has been manifested in history and still endures. This righteousness is not a new discovery, but it has been predicted and foreshadowed in the Old Testament. Although it is apart from the law, the law and the prophets bear witness to this righteousness. It is a righteousness that is given by God and received by the believer through faith, apart from any merit of works. We are justified by faith in Christ, relying solely on God's mercy and His gratuitous promises. It is through looking to Christ alone that we can remain in a justified state until the end, as our own works cannot accomplish this righteousness.

This righteousness of God, which is made known without the law, is testified to by the Old Testament Scriptures.
