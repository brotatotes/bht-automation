# Romans 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By faith in Jesus Christ, all believers are put in possession of this gratuitous justification, purely by faith in Christ Jesus. The objective nature of faith is shown through the repetition of prepositions, signifying that there is no distinction in privilege, only in performance. The righteousness of God is broad enough to cover every sinner and every sin. All must be saved through faith, regardless of their background. Faith is the means by which we receive Christ and His righteousness, renouncing our own and giving Him the glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "unto ( 'towards,' 'so as to penetrate to') all and upon ( 'over,' 'so as to be shed down on,' but. in the theological meaning, no real difference of sense from 'unto;')"
2. "this repetition of prepositions to give force is peculiar to St. Paul"
3. "there is no distinction"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By faith ofâ€”that is, 'in' Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe." 
2. "Brought nigh 'unto all' men the Gospel, and actually 'upon all' believing men, as theirs in possession."
3. "All believers, without distinction or exception, are put in possession of this gratuitous justification, purely by faith in Christ Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase so often used by him, 'righteousness of God,' does not refer to an attribute of God, but to his plan of making people righteous."
2. "This righteousness is broad enough to cover every sinner and every sin. It is pure enough to meet the eye of God himself. It is therefore the sinnerâ€™s only shield."
3. "All must be saved, if saved at all, in the same mode, whether Jews or Gentiles, bond or free, rich or poor, learned or ignorant. None can be saved by works; and all are therefore dependent on the mercy of God in Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Faith of Jesus Christ. A common form for "faith in Christ." 
Difference [Î´Î¹Î±ÏƒÏ„Î¿Î»Î·] . Only by Paul here, Romans 10:12; 1 Corinthians 14:7. Better, as Rev., distinction.


### John Calvin:
1. "When therefore we are justified, the efficient cause is the mercy of God, the meritorious is Christ, the instrumental is the word in connection with faith. Hence faith is said to justify, because it is the instrument by which we receive Christ, in whom righteousness is conveyed to us."
2. "Having been made partakers of Christ, we ourselves are not only just, but our works also are counted just before God, and for this reason, because whatever imperfections there may be in them, are obliterated by the blood of Christ."
3. "For the sake of amplifying, he repeats the same thing in different forms; it was, that he might more fully express what we have already heard, that faith alone is required, that the faithful are not distinguished by external marks, and that hence it matters not whether they be Gentiles or Jews."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even the righteousness of God through faith, or, â€˜a righteousness, however (mediated), through faithâ€™ (Meyer); the article being omitted, as in Romans 3:21, before 'righteousness.' There is a contrast implied between 'the righteousness of God' in general, and this specific form."
2. "In Jesus Christ. Lit., 'of Jesus Christ,' but as He is the object of faith, the proper English expression is 'in.' To explain the whole phrase of Christâ€™s faithfulness to us, or of faith produced by Him, is opposed by Paulâ€™s usage."
3. "For there is no distinction. This assigns the reason for what precedes. There is no other way for any; all must believe, in order to obtain this righteousness. There may be other points of difference among men, but as respects this point, there is no 'distinction' made in Godâ€™s dealing with them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The objective nature of faith in Christ is shown... as well as here by the added words 'unto all them that believe' in Jesus, Paul means." (100 words)
2. "The Jew was first in privilege as in penalty, but justification or setting right with God is offered to both on the same terms." (23 words)
3. "The distinction is not in privilege, but in performance." (12 words)

### John Gill:
1. "Here it is said to be 'by faith of Jesus Christ'; not by that faith which Christ himself had as man, but by that faith, of which he the author and object."
2. "But faith is a means of apprehending and receiving righteousness; it views the excellency of Christ's righteousness; it owns the sufficiency of it; the soul by it renounces its own righteousness, submits to Christ's, rejoices in it, and gives him the glory of it."
3. "Though this character does not design any cause or condition of justification, but is only descriptive of the persons, who are declaratively interested in a justifying righteousness, which is said to be 'unto,' and 'upon them'; that is, it is appointed, provided, and wrought out for them, and directed and applied unto them, and put upon them as a garment, and that upon all of them."

### John Wesley:
1. To all â€” The Jews.
And upon all â€” The gentiles That believe: for there is no difference - Either as to the need of justification, or the manner of it.
