# Romans 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All people, both the best and worst, have failed to earn God's approval and are lacking in righteousness. Sin has caused us to fall short of the praise and glory that God bestows. It doesn't matter how different our sins may be, the truth is that we have all sinned. However, there is hope in Christ who can remove the curse and provide us with His grace and righteousness. Through faith in Him, we can be justified and find approval before God's tribunal.
