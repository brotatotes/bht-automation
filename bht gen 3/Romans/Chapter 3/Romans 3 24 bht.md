# Romans 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God freely justifies us by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. This justification is a gift, without anything done on our part to deserve it. It is based on a payment of a ransom in Christ's death, showing that even though it is gratuitous, it is not a mere fiat of the divine will. Our justification is not merited by our obedience to the law, but is solely a result of God's unmerited favor towards us. This undeserved gift of grace excludes any consideration of our own works or obedience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "redemption] A buying off by means of a price paid, a propitiation, &c., as necessarily implied, redemption from some state of danger or misery"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "justified freely‚Äîwithout anything done on our part to deserve."
2. "by his grace‚ÄîHis free love."
3. "through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus‚Äîa most important clause; teaching us that though justification is quite gratuitous, it is not a mere fiat of the divine will, but based on a 'Redemption,' that is, 'the payment of a Ransom,' in Christ's death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being justified - Being treated as if righteous; that is, being regarded and treated as if they had kept the Law."
2. "It is a free, undeserved gift, not merited by our obedience to the Law, and not that to which we have any claim."
3. "The word used here denotes that deliverance from sin, and from the evil consequences of sin, which has been effected by the offering of Jesus Christ as a propitiation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being justified. The fact that they are justified in this extraordinary way shows that they must have sinned."
2. "Freely [Œ¥œâœÅŒµŒ±ŒΩ]. Gratuitously. Compare Matthew 10:8; John 14:25; 2 Corinthians 11:7; Revelation 21:6."
3. "Grace [œáŒ±œÅŒπœÑŒπ]. See on Luke 1:30."

### John Calvin:
1. "That since there remains nothing for men, as to themselves, but to perish, being smitten by the just judgment of God, they are to be justified freely through his mercy." 
2. "It shows that God‚Äôs mercy is the efficient cause, that Christ with his blood is the meritorious cause, that the formal or instrumental cause is faith in the word..."
3. "But it is necessary for us to examine the words."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Being justified. The present tense points...if they are justified it is in this way, namely, freely; as a gift, not by their own merit."
2. "God‚Äôs grace, i.e., His unmerited favor. His love to the sinner, is the efficient cause of justification..."
3. "The word ‚Äòredemption,‚Äô meant first of all, release or deliverance of captives from a state of misery or danger by the payment of a ransom as an equivalent. This idea of a ransom price paid is the essential one in the figurative expression..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being justified (Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩŒø). Present passive participle of Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœâ, to set right, repeated action in each case, each being set right."
2. "Freely (Œ¥œâœÅŒµŒ±ŒΩ). As in Galatians 2:21."
3. "God did not set men right out of hand with nothing done about men's sins. We have the words of Jesus that he came to give his life a ransom (ŒªœÖœÑœÅŒøŒΩ) for many (Mark 10:45; Matthew 20:28)."

### John Gill:
1. "The matter of justification is before expressed, and the persons that share in this blessing are described; here the several causes of it are mentioned."
2. "The moving cause of it is the free grace of God; for by 'the grace of God' here, is not meant the Gospel, or what some men call the terms of the Gospel, and the constitution of it; nor the grace of God infused into the heart; but the free love and favour of God, as it is in his heart; which is wonderfully displayed in the business of a sinner's justification before him."
3. "The meritorious cause of justification is the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: redemption supposes a former state of captivity to sin, Satan, and the law, in which God's elect were by nature, and is a deliverance from it; it is of a spiritual nature, chiefly respects the soul, and is plenteous, complete, and eternal."

### John Wesley:
1. "And are justified ‚Äî Pardoned and accepted."
2. "Freely by his grace ‚Äî One of these expressions might have served to convey the apostle's meaning; but he doubles his assertion, in order to give us the fullest conviction of the truth, and to impress us with a sense of its peculiar importance."
3. "It is not possible to find words that should more absolutely exclude all consideration of our own works and obedience, or more emphatically ascribe the whole of our justification to free, unmerited goodness."
