## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As 'through faith' is the subjective means of appropriation, so 'by his blood' is the objective means of manifestation, of Christ as a propitiatory sacrifice."
2. "A sin-offering betokens on the one side the expiation of guilt, and on the other ensures pardon and reconciliation: and thus the Death of Christ is not only a proof of Godâ€™s grace and love, but also of His judicial righteousness which requires punishment and expiation."
3. "To vindicate that character for justice, which might seem, owing to the suspension of Godâ€™s righteous sentence on sin in former ages in His forbearance, to be placed in question: to show, that though He did not then fully punish for sin, and though He did then set forth inadequate means of (subjective) justification, yet He did both, not because His justice was slumbering, nor because the nature of His righteousness was altered, but because He had provided a way whereby sin might be forgiven, and He might be just."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, in His blood, through faith." 
2. "Faith in Christ is used in Ephesians 1:15; and 'faith in His blood' is the natural and appropriate meaning here." 
3. "Now that God can 'set forth' Christ as a 'propitiation for sin through faith in His blood,' the righteousness of His procedure in passing by the sins of believers before, and in now remitting them, is 'manifested,' declared, brought fully out to the view of the whole world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God has publicly exhibited Jesus Christ as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of people."
2. "Christ is thus represented, not as a mercy-seat, which would be unintelligible; but as the medium, the offering, the expiation, by which reconciliation is produced between God and man."
3. "The plan of pardon is such as completely to remove all the former sins of the life, not of all former generations."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He brought Him forth and put Him before the public."
2. "It is the key to the conception of Christ's atoning work."
3. "The true meaning of the offering of Christ concentrates... upon bringing estranged man into harmony with God."

### John Calvin:
1. "If we embrace this meaning, it will remain still true, that God hath set him forth in due time, whom he had appointed as a Mediator."
2. "Thus, by taking a part for the whole, he points out the whole work of expiation."
3. "Paul teaches us, that it was an evidence of forbearance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It will be noticed that all explanations rest on the thought that Christâ€™s death was sacrificial and expiatory; that it was a real atonement, required by something in the character of God, and not merely designed to effect moral results in man."
2. "The atoning death of Christ is the ground of the â€˜reconciliationâ€™ (wrongly translated â€˜atonementâ€™ in chap. Romans 5:11), since it satisfies the demands of Divine justice on the one hand, and on the other draws men to God."
3. "His retributive justice is meant; the death of Christ shows how He hates sin, while He saves sinners."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The crucified Christ is the votive gift of the Divine Love for the salvation of men." 
2. "God demanded the atonement and provided it."
3. "In this sense Christ tasted death for every man."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the propitiation to God for sin; which must be understood of his making satisfaction to divine justice, for the sins of his people; these were imputed to him, and being found on him, the law and justice of God made demands on him for them; which he answered to satisfaction, by his obedience and sacrifice."
2. "Christ has not, by his sacrifice and death, procured the love and favour of God, but has removed the obstructions which lay in the way of love's appearing and breaking forth; there was, a law broken, and justice provoked, which were to be attended to, and Christ by his sacrifice has satisfied both; so that neither the wrath of God, nor any of the effects of it, can fall upon the persons Christ is the propitiation for, even according to justice itself; so that it is not love, but justice that is made propitious."
3. "The 'blood' of Christ is that, by which Christ is the propitiation; for without the shedding of that blood, there is no redemption, no peace, no reconciliation, or remission of sin; and 'faith' in his blood is the means by which persons become partakers of the benefits of his propitiation; such as peace, pardon, atonement, justification, and adoption."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whom God hath set forth â€” Before angels and men."
2. "A propitiation â€” To appease an offended God."
3. "To declare his righteousness â€” To demonstrate not only his clemency, but his justice..."
