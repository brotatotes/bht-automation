## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The shewing forth that He was righteous throughout His dealings with the whole world [...] was towards, formed a subsidiary manifestation to, His great manifestation of His righteousness under the Gospel." 
2. "The whole present concern is with the exhibitions to men of the righteousness of God." 
3. "He may be (shewn to be) just and (yet, on the other side) the justifier of him who is of (the) faith in Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Just in punishing," and "merciful in pardoning," men can understand; but "just in justifying the guilty," startles them.
2. "God hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin," justice has full satisfaction; and in that "we are made the righteousness of God in Him," mercy has her heart's delight!
3. The strictly accurate view of believers under the Old Testament is not that of a company of pardoned men, but of men whose sins, put up with and passed by in the meantime, awaited a future expiation in the fulness of time.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This verse contains the substance of the gospel."
2. "He [God] shows no less regard to his law in pardoning than in punishing. This is the grand, glorious, special feature of the gospel plan of salvation."
3. "Him which believeth in Jesus - Greek, 'Him who is of the faith of Jesus;'"

### John Calvin:
1. "What was formerly known in an obscure manner under shadows, God openly manifested in his Son."
2. "God is just, not indeed as one among many, but as one who contains within himself all fullness of righteousness."
3. "The righteousness of God shines in us, whenever he justifies us by faith in Christ; for in vain were Christ given us for righteousness, unless there was the fruition of him by faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By setting forth Christ, in His blood, as a propitiation, to be appropriated by faith, God not only demonstrated His judicial righteousness which had been obscured in past ages, but also and mainly, He accomplished this purpose and result, that His own character was displayed, as just and justifier, as righteous and accounting righteous him that hath faith in Christ."
2. "God could not show Himself righteous in any simpler way than by making men righteous; the gospel paradox is that He is righteous and accounting righteous believing sinners."
3. "In the death of Christ, God punished sin and saved the sinner; Divine justice was vindicated in the culminating act of redeeming love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "At this present season (ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ ŒΩœÖŒΩ Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅœâ). 'In the now crisis,' in contrast with 'done aforetime.'"
2. "That he might himself be (ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø ŒµŒπŒΩŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ). Purpose with ŒµŒπœÇ to and the infinitive ŒµŒπŒΩŒ± and the accusative of general reference."
3. "The only possible way to save some was the propitiatory offering of Christ and the call for faith on man's part."

### John Gill:
1. "To declare the righteousness of God 'at this time', under the Gospel dispensation; in which there was such a display of the grace, mercy, and goodness of God."
2. "God is naturally and essentially just in himself; and he is evidentially so in all his works, particularly in redemption by Christ."
3. "God is the justifier of such in a declarative way, and God only, though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit; and which sentence of justification is pronounced by him on the foot of a perfect righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "For a demonstration of his righteousness ‚Äî Both of his justice and mercy."
2. "That he might be just ‚Äî Showing his justice on his own Son. And yet the merciful justifier of every one that believeth in Jesus."
3. "The attribute of justice must be preserved inviolate; and inviolate it is preserved, if there was a real infliction of punishment on our Saviour."
