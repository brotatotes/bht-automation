# Romans 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Boasting is altogether removed by this truth, as the law of works cannot justify or give any ground for boasting. The law of faith, however, establishes a different principle where justification comes through faith, not works. As such, boasting is completely shut out by the principle of faith in harmony with God's love and grace. This divine arrangement prevents any glorying, both for Jews and Gentiles, and instead directs all boasting to Christ, who is the source of righteousness and justification.
