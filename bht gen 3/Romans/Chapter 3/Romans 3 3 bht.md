# Romans 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though some Jews were without faith, God's faithfulness cannot be invalidated by their unfaithfulness. The word used implies a breach of their covenant with God. Although the majority of the nation may have lacked faith, God's promises remained firm. There were still those within the nation who remained faithful to the covenant. Despite the privilege of knowledge and evidence, it was an aggravation of their sin that some remained incredulous. However, their unbelief could not diminish God's faithfulness, for it was from the Jews that the Messiah arose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word does not import â€˜did not believe,â€™ which certainly would be out of place here, where the Apostle is not speaking of faith or want of faith as yet, but of unrighteousness (ver. 5), and moral guilt." 
2. "The word seems to be used in the sense of were unfaithful to the covenant, the very condition of which was to walk in the ways of the Lord and observe his statutes." 
3. "Because they have broken faith on their part, shall God break faith also on His?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the unbelief of the great body of the nation which the apostle points at; but as it sufficed for his argument to put the supposition thus gently, he uses this word 'some' to soften prejudice."
2. "Shall their unbelief make the faith of Godâ€”or, 'faithfulness of God'â€”of none effect?"
3. "Nullify," "invalidate" it.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What then? or what follows? if it be admitted that some of the nation did not believe, does it not follow that the faithfulness of God in his promises will fail?"
2. "Had it not become vain and nugatory?"
3. "The fact supposed, that the Jews would become unfaithful and be lost, would imply that God had failed to keep his promises to the nation; or that he had made promises which the result showed he was not able to perform."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not, as some, were unfaithful, which is contrary to New Testament usage."
2. "The Rev. rendering is preferable, as bringing out the paronomasia between the Greek words : were without faith; their want of faith; the faithfulness of God."
3. "The radical meaning is to make inert or idle. Dr. Morison acutely observes that it negatives the idea of agency or operation, rather than of result or effect. It is rather to make inefficient than to make without effect."

### John Calvin:
1. "The meaning then is, 'Since most of the Jews are covenant-breakers, is Godâ€™s covenant so abrogated by their perfidiousness that it brings forth no fruit among them? To this he answers, that it cannot be that the truth of God should lose its stability through manâ€™s wickedness.'"
2. "Though then the greater part had nullified and trodden under foot Godâ€™s covenant, it yet retained its efficacy and manifested its power, not indeed as to all, but with regard to a few of that nation."
3. "He then means that some ever remained in that nation, who by continuing to believe in the promise, had not fallen away from the privileges of the covenant."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The unbelievers always remain in the minority in real significance, let their number be ever so great."
2. "Shall their want of faith, etc. The original shows that a negative answer is expected."
3. "The word used is 'faith,' but that it has here the sense of faithfulness is plain, from the Old Testament usage, and from the fact that no other sense is appropriately applied to God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Some were without faith...these 'depositaries and guardians of revelation' (Denney). But the word also means to be unfaithful to one's trust and Lightfoot argues for that idea here and in 2 Timothy 2:13."
2. "The faithfulness of God...God has been faithful (2 Timothy 2:13) whether the Jews (some of them) were simply disbelievers or untrue to their trust."
3. "Paul can use the words in two senses in verse Romans 3:3, but there is no real objection to taking Î·Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î·ÏƒÎ±Î½, Î±Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¹Î±Î½, Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½, all to refer to faithfulness rather than just faith."

### John Gill:
1. "Though the Jews enjoyed such a privilege, some of them did not believe; which is an aggravation of their sin, that they should have such means of light, knowledge, and faith, such clear and full evidences of things, and yet be incredulous."
2. "Their unbelief could not, and did not make void the veracity and faithfulness of God in his promises concerning the Messiah, recorded in the oracles of God, which they had committed to them."
3. "God raised up the Messiah from among them, which is another advantage the Jews had of the Gentiles; inasmuch as 'of' them, 'as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is God over all, blessed for evermore'."

### John Wesley:
1. Shall their unbelief disannul the faithfulness of God â€” Will he not still make good his promises to them that do believe?
