# Romans 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, who is one, shall justify the circumcision (the Jews) by faith and the uncircumcision (the Gentiles) through their faith. The Jews are justified because they are born as heirs of grace, while the Gentiles are justified through faith as an adventitious covenant. The unity of God emphasizes that He is the God of both Jews and Gentiles, and there can be no contradictory revelations from Him. Therefore, through faith, both Jews and Gentiles receive justification from the one God who shows mercy to all.
