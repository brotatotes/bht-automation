# Romans 3:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law itself belonged to a covenant embracing Jews and Gentiles, showing that the law contained the very doctrine of faith. The glory of God's law is fully apprehended by the sinner when believing in Christ's sacrifice and seeing themselves made righteous in Him. By establishing the law, we confirm its authority, spirituality, and perfect righteousness. This doctrine does not make the law void, but rather upholds it by pointing out Christ as its end and showing how it can be fulfilled in its purity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The law itself belonged to a covenant whose original recipient was justified by faith, and whose main promise was, the reception and blessing of the Gentiles."
2. "We may safely say that the Apostle never argues of law, abstract, in the sense of a system of precepts,â€”its attributes or its effects,â€”but always of THE LAW, concrete."
3. "The design being to show that the law itself contained this very doctrine, and was founded in the promise to Abraham on a covenant embracing Jews and Gentiles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is a fundamental requisite of all true religion that it tend to humble the sinner and exalt God; and every system which breeds self-righteousness, or cherishes boasting, bears falsehood on its face."
2. "The fitness of the Gospel to be a universal religion, beneath which the guilty of every name and degree are invited and warranted to take shelter and repose, is a glorious evidence of its truth."
3. "The glory of God's law, in its eternal and immutable obligations, is then only fully apprehended by the sinner, and then only is it enthroned in the depths of his soul, when, believing that 'He was made sin for him who knew no sin,' he sees himself 'made the righteousness of God in Him'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do we then make void the law - Do we render it vain and useless; do we destroy its moral obligation; and do we prevent obedience to it, by the doctrine of justification by faith? This was an objection which would naturally be made; and which has thousands of times been since made, that the doctrine of justification by faith tends to licentiousness."
2. "God forbid - By no means. This is an explicit denial of any such tendency."
3. "Yea, we establish the law - That is, by the doctrine of justification by faith; by this scheme of treating people as righteous, the moral law is confirmed, its obligation is enforced, obedience to it is secured."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the moral law is in reality confirmed and established through faith in Christ, inasmuch as it was given for this end â€” to lead man to Christ by showing him his iniquity."
2. "Let us then also bear in mind, so to dispense the gospel that by our mode of teaching the law may be confirmed; but let it be sustained by no other strength than that of faith in Christ."
3. "Though it does what the law does not, and cannot do, inasmuch as it saves the sinner whom the law condemns; it yet effects this without relaxing or dishonoring the law, but in a way that renders it, if possible, more binding, and more honorable, and more illustrious."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let it never be. See Romans 3:4. The Apostle indignantly denies that faith abrogates the law, as might be objected."
2. "Nay; or, 'but on the contrary,' we establish the law, cause the law to stand. Not as a ground of justification, but as itself teaching justification by faith, the next chapter giving the historical proof."
3. "The law was never intended as a means of justification; it could not therefore be abrogated as such a means."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Nay, we establish the law."
2. "How he will show in chapter 4 how Abraham himself is an example of faith and in his life illustrates the very point just made."
3. "The Mosaic law is only workable by faith in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The law is not made void, neither by the grace nor doctrine of faith: not by the grace of faith; for that faith is not right which is not attended with works of righteousness; and those works are not right which do not flow from faith." 
2. "Moreover, none but believers are capable of performing good works aright, and they do them, and they ought to do them."
3. "The law is so far from being made void, that it is established by this doctrine; for by it the perpetuity of it is asserted, the spirituality of it is acknowledged, the perfect righteousness of it is secured."

### John Wesley:
1. "We establish the law â€” Both the authority, purity, and the end of it." 
2. "By defending that which the law attests; by pointing out Christ, the end of it."
3. "By showing how it may be fulfilled in its purity."
