# Romans 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we reflect on God's righteousness, we may question the fairness of Him inflicting His wrath on those whose impiety actually showcases His righteousness. However, we must understand that God remains faithful to His promises despite human sin. Though it may seem improper to ask if God is unjust in this context, it is done to accommodate human weakness. The unrighteousness of humanity can even serve to commend God's righteousness. We should trust that God's truth and justice will prevail over any objections.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It would almost seem as if God would be unjust in inflicting His wrath (the consequences of His wrath) on men whose very impiety has been the means whereby His own righteousness has been shewn forth, and established." 
2. "our unrighteousness...the righteousness of God...I speak as a man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It would appear, then, that the more faithless we are, so much the more illustrious will the fidelity of God appear and in that case, for Him to take vengeance on us for our unfaithfulness would be unrighteousness in God."
2. "If He hath so ordered the state of things, that in this way alone He can best evince the depth, with, and reality of His grace and righteousness, nobody hath a right to arraign Him for this arrangement."
3. "Godâ€™s truth and justice should rise superior to all objections, and bear down all resistance, and break through all opposition."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But God was true to his promises. Notwithstanding their sin, Godâ€™s character was the same. Nay, Commend - Recommend; show forth; render illustrious." 
2. "What shall we say? - What follows? or, what is the inference? This is a mode of speech as if the objector hesitated about expressing an inference which would seem to follow, but which was horrible in its character."
3. "I speak as a man - I speak after the manner of human beings. I speak as appears to be the case to human view; or as would strike the human mind. It does not mean that the language was such as wicked people were accustomed to use; but that the objector expressed a sentiment which to human view would seem to follow from what had been said."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The force of the article it is difficult to render. It may be the wrath, definitely conceived as judicial, or, more probably, as in Matthew 3:7, referring to something recognized - the wrath to come, the well - understood need of unrighteousness."
2. "When I ask the question, 'Is God unjust who inflicteth wrath?' I am deeply conscious that I am using language which is intrinsically improper when applied to God. But in condescension to human weakness I transfer to Him language which it is customary for men to employ when referring to human relationships."
3. "The phrase is thrown in apologetically, under a sense that the mode of speech is unworthy of the subject. Morison aptly paraphrases: 'When I ask the question, "Is God unjust who inflicteth wrath?" I am deeply conscious that I am using language which is intrinsically improper when applied to God. But in condescension to human weakness I transfer to Him language which it is customary for men to employ when referring to human relationships.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "And thus indeed it is, for all the mysteries of God are paradoxes to the flesh: and at the same time it possesses so much audacity, that it fears not to oppose them and insolently to assail what it cannot comprehend."
2. "We are hence reminded, that if we desire to become capable of understanding them, we must especially labor to become freed from our own reason, and to give up ourselves, and unreservedly to submit to his word."
3. "Is God unjust, who punishes those sins which set forth his righteousness?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our unrighteousness. The opposite of â€˜righteousness;â€™ here used quite generally."
2. "The righteousness of God. Here His character or attribute."
3. "I speak after the manner of men. This parenthetical clause is a third protest against the wrong conclusion, which is directly denied in Romans 3:6."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either to introduce, to commend or to prove, to establish... Either makes good sense here."
2. "Who brings on the wrath, the inflicter of the anger."
3. "As if to say, 'pardon me for this line of argument.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Hence it appears, that the unrighteousness of men commends the righteousness, or faithfulness of God."
2. "Just as the love of God is illustrated and commended, by the consideration of the sins of men, for whom Christ died, and his grace and mercy in the conversion of them."
3. "The apostle did not speak the sentiments of his own mind, he represented another man, and spoke in the language of an adversary."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our unrighteousness be subservient to God's glory."
2. "Is it not unjust in him to punish us for it?"
3. "I speak as a man - As human weakness would be apt to speak."

- Attempt 1 BHT: If we consider the nature of God's righteousness, it may seem unjust for Him to inflict His wrath on those whose impiety actually serves to manifest and establish His righteousness. However, we must recognize that God's fidelity to His promises remains unchanged, regardless of human sin. The language used to raise this question about God's justice is inherently improper when applied to Him, but it is offered in condescension to human weakness. The unrighteousness of humanity can even serve to commend and illuminate the righteousness of God. Therefore, we should not question the arrangement by which God uses our unfaithfulness to demonstrate the depth and reality of His grace and righteousness. Ultimately, God's truth and justice will triumph over all objections and opposition.
