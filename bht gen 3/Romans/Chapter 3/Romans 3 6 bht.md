# Romans 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Denying the idea of God's injustice, it is emphasized that He is the Judge of all the earth and His judgment cannot be anything but righteous. It is universally acknowledged that God will judge the world, and for Him to do so, He must be righteous. The argument is founded on the truth that God cannot be the author of sin which He judges, thus rendering any accusation of unrighteousness against Him absurd.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Far from the thought that God could be unjust, the idea of Him judging the world is essential to His righteousness. It is unthinkable that God, as the Judge of all the earth, would do anything other than what is right. The objection that God's judgment could be unjust is immediately rejected. It is universally accepted that God will judge the world, and to do so, He must be righteous. The argument rests on the truth that God cannot be the author of sin which He judges. Therefore, it is absurd to accuse God of unrighteousness in His judgment.
