# Romans 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we question how God will judge the world or justify sinfulness by claiming it brings glory to Him, we embrace a damnable principle. The Scriptures, the jewel of the ancient Church, teach that evil cannot be done for good. Paul uses this supposable case for argument's sake, but the fault lies in assuming such conduct promotes God's glory when it does the opposite. Fulfilling promises and predictions attests to God's truth, while overruling sins for His glory doesn't exempt them from punishment. Justifying sin for God's glory is reproached.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "how shall God judge the world?" (ver. 7) 
2. "why any longer am I also judged as a sinner?" (ver. 7) 
3. "Let us do evil that good may come?" (ver. 8)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Such reasoning amounts to this‚Äîwhich indeed we who preach salvation by free grace are slanderously accused of teaching‚Äîthat the more evil we do, the more glory will redound to God‚Äîa damnable principle."
2. "Mark the place here assigned to the Scriptures...in the apostle's esteem, 'the oracles of God' were the jewel of the ancient Church."
3. "Amidst all the clouds and darkness which in this present state envelop the divine administration and many of the truths of the Bible, such broad and deep principles as are here laid down, and which shine in their own luster, will be found the sheet-anchor of our faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His 'truth' will be shown by the fulfillment of all his promises to his people, and of all his predictions. But it will also be shown by fulfilling his threatenings on the guilty. It will, therefore, more abound by their condemnation; that is, their condemnation will furnish new and striking instances or his truth. Every lost sinner will be, therefore, an eternal monument of the truth of God."
2. "If by the unfaithfulness of the Jewish people to the covenant, occasion should be given to God to glorify himself, how could they be condemned for it?"
3. "The fault in the reasoning of the objector is this, that he takes for granted that the direct tendency of his conduct is to promote God‚Äôs glory, whereas it is just the reverse; and it is by God‚Äôs reversing that tendency, or overruling it, that he obtains his glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lie, only here in the New Testament." 
2. "The expression carries us back to ver. 4 and is general for moral falsehood."
3. "Unfaithfulness to the claims of conscience and of God, especially with reference to the proffer of salvation through Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "If by our unfaithfulness the truth of God becomes more conspicuous, and in a manner confirmed, and hence more glory redounds to him, it is by no means just, that he, who serves to display God‚Äôs glory, should be punished as a sinner."
2. "The particle Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ here gives no reason, but is to be viewed as meaning then, or indeed, verily."
3. "Fidelity, uprightness, integrity, are designated byœÄ·Ω∑œÉœÑŒπŒΩ, Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÉ·ΩªŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ, and ·ºÄŒª·ΩµŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±; while ·ºÄŒª·ΩµŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±, and ·ºÄœÄŒπœÉœÑ·Ω∑Œ± ·ºÄŒ¥ŒπŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±, designate unfaithfulness, want of uprightness and false dealing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The truth of God. Comp. Romans 3:4. His moral truth, in this connection, almost equivalent to His righteousness."
2. "Through my lie. The emphasis rests on this phrase (notice the emended order), which here refers to moral falsehood."
3. "Why (if this is a sufficient justification, does He judge the world, and thus) am I also (I who thus glorify him) as a sinner still judged."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul 'uses the first person from motives of delicacy' (Sanday and Headlam) in this supposable case for argument's sake." 
2. "So here he 'transfers by a fiction' (Field) to himself the objection." 
3. "Paul returns to the imaginary objection in verse Romans 3:5."

### John Gill:
1. "Nothing is more opposite to truth than a lie; a lie of itself can never be of any advantage to truth, or to the God of truth."
2. "...the truth of God is commended, illustrated, and made to abound, when it is asserted, that he is true and faithful, and every man is a liar, fallacious, and deceitful."
3. "...though God may overrule, in a providential way, the sins of others for his glory, this is no excuse for their sins, nor will it be an exemption of them from punishment."

### John Wesley:
1. "If my lie, that is, practice contrary to truth, conduces to the glory of God, by making his truth shine with superior advantage."
2. "Can this be said to be any sin at all? Ought I not to do what would otherwise be evil, that so much 'good may come?'"
3. "To this the apostle does not deign to give a direct answer, but cuts the objector short with a severe reproof."

- Attempt 1 BHT: If we were to question how God will judge the world, or if we were to justify our sinfulness by reasoning that it brings glory to God, we would be embracing a damnable principle. The Scriptures, the jewel of the ancient Church, clearly teach that evil cannot be done for the purpose of bringing about good. While moral falsehood and unfaithfulness to God's claims may exist, Paul uses this supposable case for the sake of argument. The fault in this reasoning lies in assuming that one's conduct promotes God's glory when it actually does the opposite. The truth of God is affirmed by fulfilling his promises and predictions, and through moral truth, it is synonymous with his righteousness. Though God may overrule the sins of others for his glory, this does not excuse their sins or exempt them from punishment. Therefore, the objection of justifying sin for the sake of God's glory is met with a severe reproof.
