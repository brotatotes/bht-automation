# Romans 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the first century, Paul faced accusations of Antinomianism for preaching justification by faith and not by works. The objection raised was that if God's righteousness shines through human unrighteousness, what accountability do we have? To counter this, Paul rejects the idea that the end justifies the means, emphasizing that doing evil is never justified, regardless of any perceived good it may bring. Those who maliciously slandered Paul's doctrine were condemned for their perversity, highlighting the need for believers to defend the genuine truth and trust in God's ability to transform our wickedness for His glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was the fair consequence of the objection. And yet this was a result so shocking and monstrous, that all that was necessary in order to answer the objection was merely to state this consequence."
2. "He is answerable only for what he avows."
3. "Whatever is evil is not to be done under any pretence. Any imaginable good which we may think will result from it; any advantage to ourselves or to our cause; or any glory which we may think may result to God, will not sanction or justify the deed."

### John Calvin:
1. "That evil cannot of itself produce anything but evil; and that Godâ€™s glory is through our sin illustrated, is not the work of man, but the work of God; who, as a wonderful worker, knows how to overcome our wickedness, and to convert it to another end, so as to turn it contrary to what we intend, to the promotion of his own glory."
2. "Let us then bear this evil, when the ungodly abuse the truth which we preach by their calumnies: nor let us cease, on this account, constantly to defend the genuine confession of it, inasmuch as it has sufficient power to crush and to dissipate their falsehoods."
3. "And their perverseness was, on two accounts, to be condemned, â€” first, because this impiety had gained the assent of their minds; and secondly, because, in traducing the gospel, they dared to draw from it their calumny."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Slanderously reported; lit, 'blasphemed.' Such slander was in the last instance blasphemy, since thus God's character was outraged."
2. "Men might do this without being so hardened as to adopt it as a doctrinal principle. The foundation of this slander was doubtless the doctrine of free grace, and the Christian non-observance of the Mosaic law."
3. "The absurdity of the principle, that the end justifies the means, is not proven; the Apostle makes short work of an objection which has this logical issue. A doctrine directly leading to immoral results cannot belong to the gospel Paul is setting forth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The volitive aorist subjunctive (Ï€Î¿Î¹Î·ÏƒÏ‰Î¼ÎµÎ½) and the clause of purpose (Î¹Î½Î± and the aorist subjunctive ÎµÎ»Î¸Î·)."
2. "It sounds almost uncanny to find this maxim of the Jesuits attributed to Paul in the first century by Jews."
3. "It was undoubtedly the accusation of Antinomianism because Paul preached justification by faith and not by works."

### John Gill:
1. "and not rather" say, as we are evil spoken of, and our doctrine is blasphemed.
2. a slander cast upon the apostle's doctrine of unconditional election, free justification, and of God's overruling the sins of men for good.
3. their condemnation is just, for aspersing our principles and practices in so vile a manner.

### John Wesley:
1. "The condemnation of all who either speak or act in this manner."
2. "The apostle absolutely denies the lawfulness of 'doing evil,' any evil."
3. "That good may come."
