# Romans 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are we, the Jews, in better case than the Gentiles? No, not at all. The Jews may have had the advantage of the oracles of God to teach them better; however, they are no better than the Gentiles. Both Jews and Gentiles are under the power and guilt of sin. The privileges the Jews had were dependent on God's goodness, not their own merit. Thus, there is no reason for them to boast before God. In fact, as we previously proved, both Jews and Gentiles are under sin.
