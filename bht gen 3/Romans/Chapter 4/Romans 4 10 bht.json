The interval between the recognition of his faith and his circumcision was likely around twenty-five years, emphasizing the fact that his faith was acknowledged before he underwent the physical act. This serves as a pertinent point for the average Jew who may not have noticed that circumcision and adherence to the Law were not necessary for justification. The reckoning of faith occurred at least fourteen years before Abraham's circumcision, signifying that his circumcision was not the cause or condition of the grace he had already received. Thus, if Abraham was justified while still uncircumcised, it opens the possibility for uncircumcised Gentiles to also be justified by faith.",
