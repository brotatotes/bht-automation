# Romans 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle Paul makes it clear that righteousness and the promise to Abraham were not based on his circumcision but on his faith during uncircumcision. Circumcision acted as an outward confirmation, while the sign and seal testify to the covenant between God and Abraham. Just as circumcision pointed to Christ, the Christian church may expect a similar sign and seal of righteousness through faith. It is through faith, not works or circumcision, that we are justified and treated as righteous, as affirmed in Galatians 3:0. The sacraments serve as God's seal, confirming His grace and righteousness in our lives.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The Apostle Paul emphasizes that righteousness and the promise made to Abraham were reckoned not in his circumcision, but during his uncircumcision. It is important to recognize that circumcision did not convey righteousness but served as an outward confirmation. The sign of circumcision acted as a seal, testifying to the covenant between God and Abraham. In the same way, the Christian church may expect an outward sign and seal to confirm the righteousness reckoned through faith. This understanding deepens our appreciation for the significance of circumcision as a typological sign, pointing to Christ and his redemptive work. It is through faith, not the act of circumcision or any works, that we are justified and treated as righteous. This truth is further affirmed in Galatians 3:0, where the spiritual sonship of Abraham is expounded upon. Thus, we can grasp that the sacraments serve as God's seal, imprinted on our hearts, confirming the certainty of His grace and righteousness in our lives.
