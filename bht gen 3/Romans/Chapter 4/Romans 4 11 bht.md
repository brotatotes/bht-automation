# Romans 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's righteousness and the promise were based on faith, not circumcision. The sign of circumcision was a confirmation of the righteousness he had already received. Similarly, baptism is a testimony and ratification of God's covenant and blessings, but it is faith that precedes it. The focus is on faith before the outward sign, as it was with Abraham who was justified by faith even before he was circumcised.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostleâ€™s point is, that the righteousness was reckoned, and the promise made, to Abraham, not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
2. "Abraham is the father of the faithful. But the triumph and recognition of that faith whereby he was constituted so, was not during his circumcision, but during his uncircumcision: therefore the faithful, his descendants, must not be confined to the circumcised, but must take in the uncircumcised also."
3. "In order that the righteousness (which Abrahamâ€™s faith was reckoned as being, the righteousness of God, then hidden though imputed, but now revealed in Jesus Christ) might be imputed to them also."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Circumcision thus showed that there was a covenant between Abraham and God"
2. "That is, he appointed this as a public attestation to the fact that he had previously approved of Abraham, and had made important promises to him."
3. "This was stated in opposition to the opinion of the Jews that all ought to be circumcised."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sign - a seal. Sign refers to the material token; seal to its religious import." 
2. "That he might be. Not so that he became, but expressing the divinely appointed aim of his receiving the sign."
3. "See on to seal, Revelation 22:10."

### John Calvin:
1. "According to the testimony of Paul, they are seals by which the promises of God are in a manner imprinted on our hearts, and the certainty of grace confirmed."
2. "Hence it remains a fixed principle, that sacred symbols are testimonies, by which God seals his grace on our hearts."
3. "But as a doubt might arise, whether it behoves us, after the example of Abraham, to confirm also the same righteousness by the sign of circumcision, how came the Apostle to make this omission? Even because he thought that the question was sufficiently settled by the drift of his argument: for as this truth had been admitted, that circumcision availed only to seal the grace of God, it follows, that it is now of no benefit to us, who have a sign instituted in its place by our Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The true idea of a sacrament is here suggested; it is a sign, seal, and means of grace, but not the grace itself."
2. "The sign and seal is not itself the ground of confidence, but it testifies and openly ratifies a Divine covenant or blessing."
3. "The former came into view first, because this was the main position to be proved, and the more striking inference from the historical facts."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The circumcision did not convey the righteousness, but only gave outward confirmation."
2. "Whatever parallel exists between baptism and circumcision as here stated by Paul argues for faith before baptism and for baptism as the sign and seal of the faith already had before baptism."
3. "This idiom may be God's purpose (contemplated result) as in ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ Ï„Î¿ Î»Î¿Î³Î¹ÏƒÎ¸Î·Î½Î± below, or even actual result (so that he was) as in Romans 1:20."

### John Gill:
1. "Circumcision bears no likeness to, nor any resemblance with baptism, whereas there is always some likeness and agreement between the type and the antitype."
2. "But, alas! not ordinances, but other things more valuable than they, are the seals of the covenant, and of believers; the blood of Christ is the seal, and the only seal of the covenant of grace, by which its promises and blessings are ratified and confirmed."
3. "Now when the apostle styles Abraham the father of 'all' believers, even of uncircumcised ones, he says no other than what the Jews frequently own."

### John Wesley:
1. "After he was justified."
2. "Circumcision, which was a sign or token of his being in covenant with God."
3. "An assurance on God's part, that he accounted him righteous, upon his believing, before he was circumcised."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Abraham's righteousness and the promise made to him were not based on circumcision, but on his faith during his uncircumcision. This emphasizes that the descendants of Abraham, the people of faith, include both the circumcised and the uncircumcised. The circumcision served as a sign and seal of the righteousness that Abraham had already received through faith, not as the means by which he obtained it. Similarly, baptism is not the source of our confidence, but rather a testimony and ratification of the covenant and blessings of God, which are ultimately confirmed by the blood of Christ. Therefore, the focus is on faith before the outward sign, as it was with Abraham who was justified by faith even before he was circumcised.
