## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If these believers are Abrahamâ€™s seed, then his promised inheritance is theirs."
2. "The inheritance of the world then is not the possession of Canaan merely, either literally, or as a type of a better possession, but that ultimate lordship over the whole world which Abraham, as the father of the faithful in all peoples, and Christ, as the of Promise, shall possess."
3. "Another difficulty, that this promise was made chronologically before the reckoning of his faith for righteousness, is easily removed by remembering that the (indefinite) making of the promise is here treated of as the whole process of its assertion, during which Abrahamâ€™s faith was shown, and the promise continually confirmed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "that he should be the heir of the worldâ€”or, that 'all the families of the earth should be blessed in him.'" 
2. "was not to Abraham or to his seed through the lawâ€”in virtue of obedience to the law." 
3. "but through the righteousness of faithâ€”in virtue of his simple faith in the divine promises."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If this was so, then it was an additional important consideration in opposition to the Jew, showing that acceptance with God depended on faith, and not on works."
2. "The promise is that the posterity of Abraham should succeed to that, or should possess it as their inheritance."
3. "When the apostle calls him 'the heir of the world,' he sums up in this comprehensive expression all the promises made to Abraham, intimating that his spiritual descendants, that is, those who possess his faith, shall yet be so numerous as to possess all lands."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul here takes the Jewish conception of the universal dominion of the Messianic theocracy prefigured by the inheritance of Canaan, divests it of its Judaistic element, and raises it to a christological truth."
2. "The idea underlies the phrases kingdom of God, kingdom of Heaven."
3. "Heir of the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "And doubtless (as Paul will presently show) consciences can then only enjoy solid peace, when they know that what is not justly due is freely given them."
2. "Hence also it follows, that this benefit, the reason for which applies equally to both, belongs to the Gentiles no less than to the Jews; for if the salvation of men is based on the goodness of God alone, they check and hinder its course, as much as they can, who exclude from it the Gentiles."
3. "The godly have in the present life... enjoy through his mercy and good-will his earthly benefits no otherwise than as pledges and earnests of eternal life, their poverty does in no degree prevent them from acknowledging heaven, and the earth, and the sea, as their own possessions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Mosaic law was in no sense the ground or cause of the promise, for the law was not then in existence; and this fact is the ground of the position of Abraham as father of all believers, whether Gentiles or Jews."
2. "The promise is to both, as one. Here 'his seed' is not directly referred to Christ, as in Galatians 3:16, but to all believers, as the spiritual descendants of Abraham."
3. "The promise will be literally fulfilled when the kingdoms of the world are given to the people of the Most High, and Christ returns to rule."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But where is that promise? Not just Genesis 12:7, but the whole chain of promises about his son, his descendants like the stars in heaven, the Messiah and the blessing to the world through him." 
2. "Paul employs (Sanday and Headlam) the keywords of his gospel (faith, promise, grace) and arrays them against the current Jewish theology (law, works, merit)."

### John Gill:
1. "Abraham and all believers are the 'heirs' of this world, and of all things in it; 'all things' are theirs, and, among the rest, the world, Christ being theirs, and they being Christ's; he is heir of all things, and they are joint heirs with him."
2. "And as he and all the saints are heirs of this world, so of the world to come, the future salvation, the inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, never fading, and reserved in the heavens; for they are heirs of God himself, and shall inherit all things."
3. "This large and comprehensive promise, which takes in the things of time and eternity, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed through the law: not through the law of circumcision, or on the score of their obedience to that, for this promise was made before that was enjoined...but through the righteousness of faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "The promise, that he should be the heir of the world â€” Is the same as that he should be 'the father of all nations,' namely, of those in all nations who receive the blessing."
2. "The whole world was promised to him and them conjointly."
3. "Christ is the heir of the world, and of all things; and so are all Abraham's seed, all that believe in him with the faith of Abraham."
