# Romans 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the inheritance of the Messianic promise to Abraham belongs to those who adhere to the law, faith is stripped of its significance and the promise is rendered useless. Seeking salvation through works is futile, as it nullifies the promise and robs faith of its power. This would lead to uncertainty and despair, as the fulfillment of the promise is dependent on what is impossible.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if they which are of the law (who belong to the law, not â€˜who keep the lawâ€™) be heirs (i. e. inherit by virtue of the law; they may be inheritors by the righteousness of faith, but not Ly force of their legal standing), faith is (thereby) made empty (robbed of its virtue and rendered useless), and the promise is annulled (has no longer place)."
2. "faith is (thereby) made empty (robbed of its virtue and rendered useless), and the promise is annulled (has no longer place)."
3. "The Apostle himself immediately gives the reason."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 14. For if they which are of the law
	be heirsâ€”If the blessing is to be earned by obedience to the
	law. 
	
faith is made voidâ€”the
	whole divine method is subverted.


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Faith would have no place in the scheme; and consequently the strong commendations bestowed on the faith of Abraham, would be bestowed without any just cause."
2. "A promise looks to the future. Its design and tendency is to excite trust and confidence in him who makes it."
3. "If people seek to be justified by their morality or their forms of religion, they cannot depend on any promise of God; for he has made no promise to any such attempt."

### John Calvin:
1. "But what would be the case if the salvation of men was based on the keeping of the law? consciences would have no certainty, but would be harassed with perpetual inquietude, and at length sink in despair; and the promise itself, the fulfillment of which depended on what is impossible, would also vanish away without producing any fruit."
2. "Away then with those who teach the common people to seek salvation for themselves by works, seeing that Paul declares expressly, that the promise is abolished if we depend on works."
3. "Faith then is not a naked knowledge either of God or of his truth; nor is it a simple persuasion that God is, that his word is the truth; but a sure knowledge of Godâ€™s mercy, which is received from the gospel, and brings peace of conscience with regard to God, and rest to the mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They that are of the law are of that party whose religious life springs from the law, and who are legalists in character."
2. "Faith is made void, is made empty and continues so, there is no use of it."
3. "The promise is made permanently invalid."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If legalists are heirs of the Messianic promise to Abraham, the faith is emptied of all meaning and the promise to Abraham is made permanently idle." 
2. "The faith is emptied of all meaning."
3. "The promise to Abraham is made permanently idle."

### John Gill:
1. "For if the right to the inheritance is by the works of the law, there is no room for faith; that can be of no use or service."
2. "If salvation is by works, it is to no purpose for God to promise, or men to believe; for the thing promised depends not upon God's promise, but upon man's obedience to the law."
3. "The apostle here argues from the absurdities which follow upon the doctrine of justification by works, as he does from the different effects of the law, in the following verse."

### John Wesley:
1. "If they only who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void...and so the promise is of no effect."
2. "No blessing being to be obtained by it."
3. "Faith is made void."
