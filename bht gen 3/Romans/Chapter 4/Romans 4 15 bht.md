# Romans 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law works wrath and reveals transgression, offering nothing but condemnation and vengeance to those who break it. If there were no law, there would be no transgression. The law demands perfection, condemning every sin and making justification impossible. A more just and reasonable law results in less hope for justification and more certainty for wrath and condemnation. Therefore, the promise of inheritance cannot be based on the law, but is independent of it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For the law worketh wrath...but where there is no law, neither is there transgression." 
2. "No promise of inheritance can be by the law, because the property of the law the more it is promulgated, to reveal transgression more,‚Äînot to unfold grace." 
3. "If we conceive a state in which the law should be altogether absent, whether written or unwritten, there would be no transgression whatever."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Because the law worketh wrath‚Äîhas nothing to give to those who break is but condemnation and vengeance."
2. "For where there is no law, there is no transgression‚ÄîIt is just the law that makes transgression, in the case of those who break it; nor can the one exist without the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Law of God, demanding perfect purity, and denouncing every sin condemns the sinner, and consigns him to punishment."
2. "Law is a rule of conduct. If no such rule is given and known, there can be no crime. Law expresses what may be done, and what may not be done."
3. "Since human nature was depraved, and people were prone to sin, the more just and reasonable the laws, the less hope was there of being justified by the Law, and the more certainty was there that the Law would produce wrath and condemnation."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the law causeth wrath...the more we are taught what is right and just, the more openly is our iniquity discovered, and especially our contumacy, and thus a heavier judgment is incurred."
2. "By wrath, understand God‚Äôs judgment...condemnation only is what is brought on us all by the law."
3. "But the Apostle speaks not of the mere transgression of what is right...but a willful determination to violate what is right."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law does, indeed, stir up the wrath of man against God, as is set forth in chap. Romans 7:5, etc., but the train of thought in that chapter is distinct from that found here."
2. "Because the law brings about wrath, it cannot be the ground of promise (Romans 4:13)."
3. "The negative form is probably due to the character of the main thought, the promise was independent of law (Romans 4:13)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Worketh wrath (ŒøœÅŒ≥Œ∑ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±Œ∂ŒµœÑŒ±). Because of disobedience to it.
Neither is there transgression (ŒøœÖŒ¥Œµ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπœÇ). There is no responsibility for the violation of a non-existent law. 


### John Gill:
1. "The law is so far from justifying sinners, that it curses and condemns them; and when it comes into the heart and is let into the conscience of a sinner, it fills with terrible apprehensions of the wrath of God, and a fearful looking for of his judgment and fiery indignation."
2. "Had the law of Moses not been given, there was the law of nature which sin is a transgression of; but the law of Moses was added for the better discovery and detection of sin, which would not have been so manifest without it."
3. "No man can be justified by it; since [the law] convinces him of sin, and fills him with a sense of divine wrath on account of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Because the law...is so difficult, and we so weak and sinful, that...it only worketh wrath." 
2. "It becomes to us an occasion of wrath, and exposes us to punishment as transgressors." 
3. "Where there is no law in force, there can be no transgression of it."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The law brings about God's wrath because it reveals transgression and has nothing to offer but condemnation and vengeance. If there were no law, there would be no transgression, as transgression only exists when there is a law to be broken. The law demands perfection and condemns every sin, making it impossible for anyone to be justified by it. The more just and reasonable the laws, the less hope there is for justification, and the more certain it is that the law will produce wrath and condemnation. Therefore, the promise of inheritance cannot be based on the law, but is independent of it.
