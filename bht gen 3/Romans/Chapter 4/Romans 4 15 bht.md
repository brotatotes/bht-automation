# Romans 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law cannot promise inheritance because its purpose is to reveal transgression, not grace. It works wrath and condemnation, and where there is no law, there is no transgression. The promise of salvation is independent of the law. The law does not justify sinners; rather, it condemns them and fills them with divine wrath. No one can be justified by the law, as it only brings about wrath and exposes us to punishment as transgressors.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of the Apostle here is not to deny the existence of the law of God written in the heart before Moses, but to show that no promise of inheritance can be by the law, because the property of the law is, the more it is promulgated, to reveal transgression more, not to unfold grace."
2. "So that comparatively there was no transgression before the law of Moses; and if we conceive a state in which the law whether written or unwritten should be altogether absent, there would be no transgression whatever."
3. "But observe that this reasoning does not touch the doctrine of the original taint of our nature in Adam, only referring to the discrimination of acts, words, and thoughts by the conscience in the light of the law: for œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπœÇ is not natural corruption, but an act of transgression."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law worketh wrath‚Äîhas nothing to give to those who break it but condemnation and vengeance."
2. "Where there is no law, there is no transgression‚ÄîIt is just the law that makes transgression, in the case of those who break it."
3. "Nor can the one exist without the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "While man is fallen, and a sinner, its tendency, so far from justifying him, and producing peace, is just the reverse. It condemns, denounces wrath, and produces suffering."
2. "Law is a rule of conduct. If no such rule is given and known, there can be no crime... If there is no command to pursue a certain course, no injunction to forbid certain conduct, actions will be innocent."
3. "Since human nature was depraved, and people were prone to sin, the more just and reasonable the laws, the less hope was there of being justified by the Law, and the more certainty was there that the Law would produce wrath and condemnation."

### John Calvin:
1. "For such is the viciousness of our nature, that the more we are taught what is right and just, the more openly is our iniquity discovered..."
2. "And the reason is, that as the knowledge of God‚Äôs justice is discovered by the law, the less excuse we have, and hence the more grievously we offend against God..."
3. "Whichever reading you may follow, the meaning will be the same, ‚Äî that he who is not instructed by the written law, when he sins, is not guilty of so great a transgression, as he is who knowingly breaks and transgresses the law of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law, the Mosaic law, as in the entire discussion."
2. "The law does, indeed, stir up the wrath of man against God, as is set forth in chap. Romans 7:5, etc., but the train of thought in that chapter is distinct from that found here."
3. "The promise was independent of law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Worketh wrath (ŒøœÅŒ≥Œ∑ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±Œ∂ŒµœÑŒ±). Because of disobedience to it.
Neither is there transgression (ŒøœÖŒ¥Œµ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπœÇ). There is no responsibility for the violation of a non-existent law. 


### John Gill:
1. "The law is so far from justifying sinners, that it curses and condemns them; and when it comes into the heart and is let into the conscience of a sinner, it fills with terrible apprehensions of the wrath of God, and a fearful looking for of his judgment and fiery indignation."
2. "Had the law of Moses not been given, there was the law of nature which sin is a transgression of; but the law of Moses was added for the better discovery and detection of sin, which would not have been so manifest without it."
3. "No man can be justified by the law since that convinces him of sin and fills him with a sense of divine wrath on account of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Because the law - [...] instead of bringing us a blessing, it only worketh wrath." 
2. "Where there is no law in force, there can be no transgression of it."
3. "Considered apart from that grace, [...] it becomes to us an occasion of wrath, and exposes us to punishment as transgressors."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The purpose of this passage is not to deny the existence of the law written in the heart before Moses, but to show that no promise of inheritance can be attained by the law, as its purpose is to reveal transgression and not grace. The law works wrath and condemnation, and where there is no law, there is no transgression. The law stirs up the wrath of man against God, but the promise of salvation is independent of the law. The law does not justify sinners; rather, it condemns them and fills them with a sense of divine wrath. Therefore, no one can be justified by the law, as it only brings about wrath and exposes us to punishment as transgressors.
