### John Calvin:
1. "If the heirship of salvation comes to us by works, then faith in it vanishes, the promise of it is abolished; but it is necessary that both these should be sure and certain; hence it comes to us by faith, so that its stability being based on the goodness of God alone, may be secured."
2. "See how the Apostle, regarding faith as a thing firm and certain, considers hesitancy and doubt as unbelief, by which faith is abolished, and the promise abrogated."
3. "Let the testimony of Moses be included in a parenthesis, that this clause, 'Who is the father of us all,' may be connected with the other, 'before God,' etc.: for it was necessary to explain also what that relationship was, that the Jews might not glory too much in their carnal descent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is of faith. What? Not the promise, but the inheritance, in view of the contrast in Romans 4:14."

### John Gill:
1. "Which is done, 'that it might be by grace'; appear to be of the free grace and favour of God, as each of these blessings are: forasmuch as every blessing is received by faith, it is manifest it must be by grace; since faith itself is a gift of God's grace."
2. "The promise of the above blessings, particularly of the inheritance which is made in the covenant of grace, ordered in all things and sure, and which could not be disannulled by the law that came after it; this being by faith and of grace, and not of works, nor at all depending upon them, becomes sure to all believers, to all Abraham's spiritual seed."
3. "To the Gentiles, who though they are not by natural descent from Abraham, yet are of the same faith with him, and so are his seed in a spiritual sense: 'who is the father of us all'; whether Jews or Gentiles, who are Christ's, and so Abraham's spiritual seed, and heirs of eternal life, according to the free promise of grace."
