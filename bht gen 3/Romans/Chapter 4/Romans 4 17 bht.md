# Romans 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham, the father of us all, believed in God's power to surmount physical incapacity and to call into being what did not yet exist. His faith went above and beyond the natural, and it was this faith that God reckoned to him as righteousness. The promise of being a father of many nations was not limited to his physical descendants, but extended to those who believed as he did. This promise is a testament to God's ability to bring life to the dead and to speak things into existence that were not yet.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Abraham, the father of us all, exemplified a faith that went above and beyond the natural. He believed in God's power to bring forth new life out of physical incapacity and to speak things into existence that were not yet. This belief led to the fulfillment of God's promise that he would be a father of many nations. This promise extends beyond his physical descendants to encompass all who believe as he did. God's ability to bring life to the dead is showcased in this promise, reminding us of his immense power. Just as Abraham trusted in God's ability to rejuvenate him and Sarah, we too are called to have faith in God's power to call into being things that are not.
