# Romans 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's justification was not earned by works; otherwise, he would have reason to boast. Instead, it was through his trust in God's promise that he entered into the blessing promised to him. In the eyes of God, Abraham had no grounds for boasting, as justification is by faith alone. Works were never meant to be the source of salvation but rather a reflection of faith. Abraham's relationship with God was distinct from his relationship with man, as he had no basis for boasting before God. Salvation is found solely in Christ, not in our own merits.

3. "The objections to this view are that Romans 4:3 would then contain a refutation introduced by â€˜butâ€™ not â€˜for;â€™ that it is not like Paul to admit any ground of glorying toward men, much less toward God, in connection with the matter of justification."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Abrahamâ€™s justification was not based on works, but on his trust in God's promise. If works were the grounds of his justification, he would have reason to boast. However, in the sight of God, Abraham had no reason to boast because justification is not earned but freely given by faith. Works were never intended to be the source of salvation, as the Jews believed, but rather evidence of faith. Abraham's relationship with God was separate from his respect from men, as he had no ground of boasting before God. His justification was not built on his own merits, but on his faith in God's promises. In Christ alone can we find cause for glorying before God.
