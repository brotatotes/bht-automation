# Romans 4:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Resurrection of Jesus is central in Paul's gospel and is the central point of Paul's gospel. When the fact of Christâ€™s resurrection is denied or ignored by nominal Christians, their faith is weak in every respect. For it is the ground of our hope as to eternal life and when Christ comes forth and presents to us in his own resurrection a sure pledge of life, it then appears evident from what fountain the imputation of righteousness flows.

Ultimately, the Resurrection of Jesus establishes the significance of seeking justification through faith, not through works.
