# Romans 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our Lord was delivered up for our sins and raised up for our justification. The death of Christ is closely related to the forgiveness of sins, while His resurrection is connected to justification unto life everlasting. The resurrection has immense significance in revealing His incarnate life and glory, declaring the righteousness of God. Justification does not depend solely on His resurrection but is secured through His obedience and death. Without the resurrection, all our hopes would be buried.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord was delivered up (to death) for or on account of our sins (i. e. because we had sinned):‚ÄîHe was also raised up (from the dead) for or on account of our justification (i. e. not because we had been, but that we might be justified)."
2. "The great complex event by which our justification (death unto sin and new birth unto righteousness) has been made possible, may be stated in one word as the GLORIFICATION of Christ."
3. "The Death of Christ is more properly placed in close reference to forgiveness of sins,‚ÄîHis Resurrection, to justification unto life everlasting."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The way of a sinner's justification has been the same in all time, and the testimony of the Old Testament on this subject is one with that of the New."
2. "Faith and works, in the matter of justification, are opposite and irreconcilable, even as grace and debt."
3. "Justification, in this argument, cannot be taken‚Äîas Romanists and other errorists insist‚Äîto mean a change upon men's character; for besides that this is to confound it with Sanctification, which has its appropriate place in this Epistle, the whole argument of the present chapter‚Äîand nearly all its more important clauses, expressions, and words‚Äîwould in that case be unsuitable, and fitted only to mislead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was delivered up to death in order to make expiation for our sins."
2. "His resurrection was a proof that his work was accepted by the Father. Our justification, therefore, became sure."
3. "The fact that he was raised becomes the ground of hope that we shall be raised and accepted of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "But if the whole matter of the justification depends on what He has suffered for our offenses, we shall as certainly be justified or have our account made even, if He does not rise, as if He does."
2. "Doubtless the rising has an immense significance, when the justification is conceived to be the renewing of our moral nature in righteousness; for it is only by the rising that His incarnate life and glory are fully discovered, and the righteousness of God declared in His person in its true moral power."
3. "But in the other view of justification there is plainly enough nothing depending, as far as that is concerned, on His resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if justification means renovation, then that he died for our sins must be taken in the same sense, as signifying that he acquired for us grace to mortify the flesh; which no one admits."
2. "He therefore still speaks of imputative justification."
3. "Either therefore as the evidence of the acceptance of his suffering as our substitute, or as a necessary step toward securing the application of their merit to our benefit, the resurrection of Christ was essential to our justification."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‚Äòjustification‚Äô points to the act, though the state (of being justified) which results may be implied."
2. "Without the resurrection, Christ‚Äôs grave would be the grave of all our hopes."
3. "The sinner cannot be buried with Christ, without rising with Him as a new creature; the death with Christ is inseparable from the new life in Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul does not mean to separate the resurrection from the death of Christ in the work of atonement, but simply to show that the resurrection is at one with the death on the Cross in proof of Christ's claims."
2. "The first Œ¥ŒπŒ± with œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄœÑœâŒºŒ±œÑŒ± is probably retrospective, though it will make sense as prospective (to make atonement for our transgressions)."
3. "The second Œ¥ŒπŒ± is quite clearly prospective with a view to our justification."

### John Gill:
1. "He was delivered for these, as the causes of his death, and as the end for which he died; namely, to make reconciliation, atonement, and satisfaction for them."
2. "We may also learn from hence the nature of sin, the strictness of justice, the obligations we lie under to Christ, and how many favours and blessings we may expect from God through him."
3. "Christ's resurrection did not procure the justification of his people, that was done by his obedience and death; but was for the testification of it, that it might fully appear that sin was atoned for, and an everlasting righteousness was brought in."

### John Wesley:
1. Who was delivered ‚Äî To death.
For our offences ‚Äî As an atonement for them.
And raised for our justification ‚Äî To empower us to receive that atonement by faith.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Our Lord was delivered up for our sins, and He was also raised up for our justification. The death of Christ and His resurrection were both essential in the complex event of our justification. The resurrection of Christ serves as a proof of His claims and the acceptance of His work by the Father. Through His death, He made atonement for our transgressions, and through His resurrection, He declares the righteousness of God. Faith and works are opposite in the matter of justification; it is not a change in character but a renewal of our moral nature in righteousness. The resurrection of Christ has immense significance in revealing His incarnate life and glory. Without the resurrection, all our hopes would be buried. Justification is not dependent on His resurrection in the same sense but is secured through His obedience and death.
