# Romans 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith is set in opposition to works when it comes to justification, as seen in Abraham's case. His faith in the promises that embraced Christ was the means by which he obtained the blessing of righteousness. This act of faith was counted to him as righteousness, meaning God regarded him as righteous based on his belief. It is important to recognize that faith, not works, is what justifies us and allows us to be in right relationship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Romish expositors and Arminian Protestants make this to mean that God accepted Abraham's act of believing as a substitute for complete obedience. But this is at variance with the whole spirit and letter of the apostle's teaching."
2. "Throughout this whole argument, faith is set in direct opposition to works, in the matter of justification."
3. "The meaning plainly is that Abraham believed in the promises which embraced Christ, as we believe in Christ Himself and in both cases, faith is merely the instrument that puts us in possession of the blessing gratuitously bestowed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason why it was counted to him for righteousness was, that it was such a strong, direct, and unwavering act of confidence in the promise of God."
2. "Faith is uniformly an act of the mind. It is not a created essence which is placed within the mind."
3. "In order to justification; or to regard and treat him in connection with this as a righteous man; as one who was admitted to the favor and friendship of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Scripture [Œ∑ Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ∑] . The scripture passage."
2. "It was counted for righteousness [ŒµŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπœÉŒ∏Œ∑ ŒµŒπœÇ Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÉœÖŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ] ."
3. "The phrases ejlogisqh eijv and ejl. wJv are thus shown to be substantially equivalent."

### John Calvin:
1. "But they are in this mistaken; first, because they have not considered that believing extends to the whole context, and ought not to be confined to one clause."
2. "Abraham then laid hold on the benignity of God offered to him in the promise, through which he understood that righteousness was communicated to him."
3. "We hence conclude that the question is not, what men are in themselves, but how God regards them; not that purity of conscience and integrity of life are to be separated from the gratuitous favor of God; but that when the reason is asked, why God loves us and owns us as just, it is necessary that Christ should come forth as one who clothes us with his own righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word we translate 'reckon' occurs eleven times in this chapter, and is represented in the E. V. by 'count,' 'reckon,' 'impute;' elsewhere in this Epistle by 'account' (so Galatians 3:6). The idea of putting to one‚Äôs account is obvious; and the full expression is a technical one, the equivalent of God‚Äôs act of justification."
2. "Furthermore, they are opposed not only to the line of Paul‚Äôs argument, but to the facts of spiritual experience: the confusion of justification and sanctification has invariably, sooner or later, led to a decrease of holiness."
3. "In the case of the Christian, the object of faith is the personal Messiah, the contents of faith respect [is person and work. One who believes in Him will not be seeking to diminish the contents of his faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was reckoned unto him for righteousness."
2. "It was set down on the credit side of the ledger 'for' righteousness."
3. "What was set down? His believing God."

### John Gill:
1. "Abraham believed God; the object of his faith and trust were not his riches, nor his righteousness, but Jehovah, the Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, styled in Genesis 15:1, 'the Word of the Lord', the essential Word of God, and called his 'shield', and 'exceeding great reward'; characters which are very applicable to Christ."
2. "And it was counted to him for righteousness, the meaning of which is not, that Abraham imputed righteousness to God, or celebrated his righteousness and faithfulness, as some; or that the world reckoned Abraham a righteous person, as others; but that God reckoned him righteous, or imputed it to him for righteousness."
3. "Now since so great and good a man as Abraham was not justified by works, but by faith in the righteousness of the Messiah, it follows, that none of his sons, nor any other person whatever, ought to seek for, or expect to be justified in any other way."

### John Wesley:
1. "Abraham believed God...the promise concerning Christ, through whom all nations should be blessed."
2. "And it was imputed to him for righteousness."
3. "God accepted him as if he had been altogether righteous."
