# Romans 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The reward for those who work is not given by grace, but as a matter of debt. This is illustrated by the analogy of a workman receiving wages. It distinguishes between the legal method of salvation, based on one's own moral character, and the gospel method, which relies on faith in God's goodness. Righteousness cannot be earned, but is freely bestowed. Seeking God's mercy as sinful beings is the way to find acceptance with Him.

2. "If one merits any thing by his work, what is merited is not freely imputed to him, but rendered to him as his due.

### John Gill:

2. "There is no reward due to the creature's work, though ever so perfect, arising front any desert or dignity in itself."
3. "It remains therefore, that if it is reckoned for his works, it must be of debt: it must be his due, as wages are to an hireling."
