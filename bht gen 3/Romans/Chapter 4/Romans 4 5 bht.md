# Romans 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through faith, the ungodly man who does not work for his own salvation, but instead casts himself upon the mercy of God, is justified. This justification is not a legal fiction, but a true reckoning of righteousness by God. The believer is taken as they are, with all their flaws, and pardoned. It is only through this faith that righteousness can be obtained. God, who justifies the ungodly, offers this gift of righteousness to those who feel their own ungodliness and seek it from Him.

### Henry Alford:

2. "impiousness is the state of all men by nature" 
3. "his faith is reckoned for righteousness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But to him that worketh notâ€”who, despairing of acceptance with God by 'working' for it the work of obedience, does not attempt it."
2. "But believeth on him that justifieth the ungodlyâ€”casts himself upon the mercy of Him that justifieth those who deserve only condemnation."
3. "Second: David sings of the same justification."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He does not justify them because he sees them to be, or regards them to be righteous; but knowing that they are in fact polluted."
2. "God judges things as they are; and sinners who are justified, he judges not as if they were pure, or as if they had a claim; but he regards them as united by faith to the Lord Jesus."
3. "It is not meant that the righteousness of Christ is transferred to them, so as to become personally theirs - for moral character cannot be transferred; nor that it is infused into them, making them personally meritorious - for then they could not be spoken of as ungodly."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith is not a substitute for righteousness, since righteousness is involved in faith."
2. "When a man is reckoned righteous through faith, it is not a legal fiction. He is not indeed a perfect man, but God does not reckon something which has no real existence."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To him that worketh not; to one who does not work for hire."
2. "The ungodly individual, the original is in the singular. The word is chosen to present a strong contrast of â€˜justifying,â€™ one who is alienated from God is yet accounted righteous by God."
3. "The next verse speaks of Godâ€™s reckoning righteousness to a man, and the profound discussion at the close of chap. 5 points more directly to the imputation of Christâ€™s righteousness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The man is taken as he is and pardoned."
2. "The whole Pauline gospel could be summed up in this one word-- God who justifies the ungodly."
3. "A forensic figure."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the believer does not work at all, but not from such principles, and with such views as the other; he does not work in order to obtain life and salvation; he does not seek for justification by his doings." 
2. "Though he justifies the ungodly, he does not justify their ungodliness, but them from it; nor will he, nor does he leave them to live and die in it."
3. "Now to him that worketh not, that is perfect righteousness; or has no opportunity of working at all; or what he does, he does not do, that he might be justified by it; but exercises faith on God as justifying persons, who, like himself, are sinners, ungodly and destitute of a righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "But to him that worketh not... his faith is imputed to him for righteousness."
