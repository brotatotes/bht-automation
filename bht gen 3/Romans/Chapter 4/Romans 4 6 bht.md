# Romans 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This righteousness is not achieved through works, but rather through the forgiveness and hiding of offenses. The blessedness is a declaration of congratulation made on those whom the Lord regards as righteous, even without good works. It is essential not to be swayed by the congratulation of the majority, but to understand that this righteousness is the remission of sins granted without works. It is the righteousness of Christ, not human obedience, and those who possess it are justified, freed from condemnation, and accepted by God.
