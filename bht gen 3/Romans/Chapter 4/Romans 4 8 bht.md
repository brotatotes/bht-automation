## BHT:
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin. This blessing includes the fact of justification itself, where sin is covered by divine long-suffering until the work of Christ is complete.

The Lord will in no way reckon their sins, providing complete forgiveness where believers appear blameless and irreproachable in the sight of God with their sins never remembered to their hurt.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "will not reckon is strictly future, and must be referred to the great final judgment."
2. "the expression is an Old Test. one, regarding sin as lying covered by the divine long-suffering till the completion of the work of Christ."
3. "this blessing, or blessedness, of course includes the fact, on account of which the congratulation is pronouncedâ€”the justification itself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This shows clearly what the apostle meant by imputing faith without works. It is to pardon sin, and to treat with favor; not to reckon or charge a manâ€™s sin to him; but to treat him, though personally undeserving and ungodly Romans 4:5, as though the sin had not been committed."
2. "The word 'impute' here is used in its natural and appropriate sense, as denoting to charge on man what properly belongs to him."
3. "It is to pardon sin, and to treat with favor; not to reckon or charge a manâ€™s sin to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Will not reckon sin. The negation is very strong, â€˜will in no wise reckon.â€™"
2. "This may refer to the final judgment, but more probably points to the method of entire forgiveness (future to Davidâ€™s eye) revealed in the gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To whom (Ï‰). But the best MSS. read Î¿Ï… like the LXX and so Westcott and Hort, 'whose sin.'"

1. "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin."
2. "They now appear before the throne without fault, and are blameless and irreproveable in the sight of God."
