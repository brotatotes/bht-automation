# Romans 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's justification by faith is not dependent on circumcision as a sign of righteousness, but rather, faith was reckoned to him for righteousness long before he was circumcised. This declaration of righteousness applies not only to the circumcised, but also to the uncircumcised, as both Jews and Gentiles can share in this blessedness. It is by faith, not by any works or rituals, that we are justified and accepted by God. This faith, though not the cause of our acceptance, is the condition for our acceptance, and through it, our sins are forgiven and righteousness is imputed to us.
