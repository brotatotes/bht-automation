### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If it be the privilege of the justified to 'have peace with God,' why might not the apostle begin his enumeration of the fruits of justification by calling on believers to 'realize' this peace as belonged to them, or cherish the joyful consciousness of it as their own?"
2. "This 'peace' is first a change in God's relation to us; and next, as the consequence of this, a change on our part towards Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "When any one strives to seek tranquillity of conscience by works, he labors for it in vain; for either his heart is asleep through his disregard or forgetfulness of God‚Äôs judgment, or else it is full of trembling and dread, until it reposes on Christ, who is alone our peace." 
2. "Peace with God is opposed to the dead security of the flesh, and for this reason, ‚Äî because the first thing is, that every one should become awakened as to the account he must render of his life; and no one can stand boldly before God, but he who relies on a gratuitous reconciliation." 
3. "This is the strongest of proofs, that our opponents do nothing but prate to no purpose, when they ascribe righteousness to works; for this conclusion of Paul is derived from this fact, ‚Äî that miserable souls always tremble, except they repose on the grace of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God is at peace with us. Our feeling towards Him may and ought to correspond; but it is subject to change. God‚Äôs relation to us is the great matter; on that is based true peace of conscience."

3. "This personal Lord has made peace, satisfied justice, removed the curse, made it possible for a holy God to be righteous in accounting righteous those, who by nature and character, are sinners."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The mode is the volitive subjunctive and the present tense expresses linear action and so does not mean 'make peace' as the ingressive aorist subjunctive ŒµŒπœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ œÉœáœâŒºŒµŒΩ would mean."
2. "Here ŒµŒπœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµœáœâŒºŒµŒΩ can only mean: 'Let us enjoy peace with God' or 'Let us retain peace with God.'"
3. "The preceding justification (Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπœâŒ∏ŒµŒΩœÑŒµœÇ) 'made peace with God.'"

### John Gill:
1. "We are not justified by faith, either as God's work in us, for, as such, it is a part of sanctification; nor as our work or act, as exercised by us, for then we should be justified by works, by something of our own, and have whereof to glory."
2. "We are justified by faith objectively and relatively, as that relates to the object Christ, and his righteousness; or as it is a means of our knowledge, and perception of our justification by Christ's righteousness, and of our enjoying the comfort of it."
3. "Peace with God stands in the first place; and is so called, to distinguish it from peace with men, which persons, though justified by faith in Christ's righteousness, may not have; but are sure, having a sense of this, to find peace with God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being justified by faith ‚Äî This is the sum of the preceding chapters."
2. "We have peace with God ‚Äî Being enemies to God no longer, Romans 5:10; neither fearing his wrath, Romans 5:9."
3. "We have peace, hope, love, and power over sin, the sum of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters. These are the fruits of justifying faith: where these are not, that faith is not."
