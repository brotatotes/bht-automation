# Romans 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life. The term 'reconciled' represents the mutual estrangement and opposition between God and man that requires reconciliation. This reconciliation involves a change of character in man, the covering, forgiving, and cleansing of sin, and a thorough revolution in all dispositions and principles. By means of Christ's death, we become reconciled to God, and 'much more' we shall be saved by his life, for he ever lives to intercede for us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life." 
2. "Those unborn at the death of Christ could not have been enemies in the active sense."
3. "Both the objective reception into Godâ€™s favour by the death of Christ, and the subjective appropriation, by faith, of that reception, are included."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If that part of the Saviour's work which cost Him His blood, and which had to be wrought for persons incapable of the least sympathy either with His love or His labors in their behalfâ€”even our 'justification,' our 'reconciliation'â€”is already completed; how much more will He do all that remains to be done."
2. "He has it to do, not by death agonies any more, but in untroubled 'life,' and no longer for enemies, but for friendsâ€”from whom, at every stage of it, He receives the grateful response of redeemed and adoring souls?"
3. "To be 'saved from wrath through Him,' denotes here the whole work of Christ towards believers, from the moment of justification... till the Judge on the great white throne shall discharge that wrath upon them that 'obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ'; and that work may all be summed up in 'keeping them from falling, and presenting them faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "From being enemies we were changed to friends by that work. Thus, it was commenced by God; its foundation was laid while we were still hostile to it; it evinced, therefore, a determined purpose on the part of God to perform it; and he has thus given a pledge that it shall be perfected."
2. "We became his friends, laid aside our opposition, and embraced him as our friend and portion."
3. "If in this state, when humble, despised, dying, dead, he had power to accomplish so great a work as to reconcile us to God, how much more may we expect that he will be able to keep us now that he is a living, exalted, and triumphant Redeemer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Neither the active nor the passive meaning needs to be pressed. The term represents the mutual estrangement and opposition which must accompany sin on man's part, and which requires reconciliation."
2. "In the Christian sense, the change in the relation of God and man effected through Christ. This involves... a corresponding movement on man's part toward God; yielding to the appeal of Christ 's self - sacrificing love, laying aside his enmity, renouncing his sin, and turning to God in faith and obedience."
3. "A consequent change of character in man; the covering, forgiving, cleansing of his sin; a thorough revolution in all his dispositions and principles."

### John Calvin:
1. "We were enemies, he says, when Christ interposed for the purpose of propitiating the Father: through this reconciliation we are now friends; since this was effected by his death; much more influential and efficacious will be his life."
2. "By saying that we were reconciled to God by the death of Christ, he means, that it was the sacrifice of expiation, by which God was pacified towards the world."
3. "With regard to us, we are always enemies, until the death of Christ interposes in order to propitiate God. And this twofold aspect of things ought to be noticed; for we do not know the gratuitous mercy of God otherwise than as it appears from this â€” that he spared not his only-begotten Son."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only objection to it rests on a mechanical and false view of Scripture language."
