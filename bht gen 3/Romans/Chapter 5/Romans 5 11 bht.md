### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our first feeling towards God, after we have found peace with Him, is that of clinging gratitude for so costly a salvation; but no sooner have we learned to cry, Abba, Father, under the sweet sense of reconciliation, than 'gloriation' in Him takes the place of dread of Him, and now He appears to us 'altogether lovely!'" (Romans 5:11)
2. "How gloriously does the Gospel evince its divine origin by basing all acceptable obedience on 'peace with God,' laying the foundations of this peace in a righteous 'justification' of the sinner 'through our Lord Jesus Christ,' and making this the entrance to a permanent standing in the divine favor, and a triumphant expectation of future glory!" (Romans 5:1-2)
3. "Gratitude to God for redeeming love, if it could exist without delight in God Himself, would be a selfish and worthless feeling; but when the one rises into the otherâ€”the transporting sense of eternal 'reconciliation' passing into 'gloriation in God' Himselfâ€”then the lower is sanctified and sustained by the higher, and each feeling is perfective of the other." (Romans 5:11)

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Atonement at the time of the A. V. signified reconciliation, at - one - ment, the making two estranged parties at one."
3. "The word at present carries the idea of satisfaction rather than of reconciliation, and is therefore inappropriate here."

### John Calvin:

3. "All arguments as to the nature of the atonement which fail to recognize these linguistic facts, imply ignorance or dishonesty; neither of which should characterize one reconciled to God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Basis of all the exultation above (verses Romans 5:1-5)."
2. "Now" (Î½Ï…Î½) in contrast with the future consummation and a sure pledge and guarantee of it.

### John Gill:
1. "but we also joy in God"; himself, as our covenant God and Father in Christ, as the God of all grace, peace, and salvation; in his perfections, as engaged on our side, and as glorified in our salvation; in the purposes of God, and his covenant transactions with his Son, as they are made known in the everlasting Gospel.
2. The means by which saints come at this joying and glorying in God, is through our Lord Jesus Christ; not the light of nature, nor the law of Moses, nor any works of righteousness done by men, nor through angels or saints, but Christ, and him only.
3. And the ground of this joy is the expiation of sin by Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement; atonement is not made, but received by us; which denotes the application of the atoning blood and sacrifice of Christ to the conscience, the Spirit's witness of interest in it, and the office of faith, as a recipient of it.

### John Wesley:
1. "We not only 'rejoice in hope of the glory of God,' but also in the midst of tribulations we glory in God himself through our Lord Jesus Christ..." 
2. "We...glory in God himself through our Lord Jesus Christ..."
3. "...by whom we have now received the reconciliation."
