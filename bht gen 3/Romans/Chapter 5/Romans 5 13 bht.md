### Henry Alford:
1. "but sin is not reckoned (as transgression) where the law is not."
2. "Nor is there any inconsistency in this view."
3. "The objection to taking the words relatively, â€˜is not fully reckoned,â€™ will hardly be urged by those who bear in mind the Apostleâ€™s habit of constantly stating relative truths as positive."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For until the law sin was in the worldâ€”that is during all the period from Adam 'until the law' of Moses was given, God continued to treat men as sinners." 
2. "Sin is not imputed where there is no lawâ€”'There must therefore have been a law during that period, because sin was then imputed'; as is now to be shown."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is not imputed [Î¿Ï…Îº ÎµÎ»Î»Î¿Î³ÎµÎ¹Ï„Î±Î¹] . Put to account so as to bring penalty." 
2. "From logov an account or reckoning. Only here and Philippians 1:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though God had not as yet denounced judgment by a written law, yet mankind were under a curse, and that from the womb; and hence that they who led a wicked and vicious life before the promulgation of the law, were by no means exempt from the condemnation of sin."
2. "Without the law reproving us, we in a manner sleep in our sins; and though we are not ignorant that we do evil, we yet suppress as much as we can the knowledge of evil offered to us, at least we obliterate it by quickly forgetting it."
3. "If you translate this adversative Î´Îµ, though, the text would run better; for the meaning is, that though men may indulge themselves, they cannot yet escape Godâ€™s judgment, even when there is no law to reprove them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All sinned when Adam sinned, for the penalty of sin came from the very first, and that, too, when there was no such transgression of positive precept as in the case of Adam."
2. "Sin was in the world. Sin as a tyrant, with its penal consequences."
3. "But sin is not reckoned; 'fully reckoned' is perhaps the best reading of the compound verb in the original. In a certain sense it is reckoned, but it cannot be fully reckoned as 'transgression,' where law is not, or, in the absence of law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sin was there before the Mosaic law, for the Jews were like Gentiles who had the law of reason and conscience."

2. "Sin is not so much imputed, nor so severely punished by God, where there is no express law to convince men of it."
3. "Yet that all had sinned, even then, appears in that all died."
