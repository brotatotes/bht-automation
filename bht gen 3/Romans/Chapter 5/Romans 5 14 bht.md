# Romans 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sin of Adam, inherited by all, has brought death to the entire race. Death reigned over everyone, even infants and those who did not sin like Adam. Adam and Christ are both representative men, but their parallel is not exact. While Adam's sin resulted in death for all, the righteousness of Christ brings life to those who believe in Him. It is through Christ's righteousness that we are restored, just as we were lost through Adam's sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The aim is to prove, that the seed of sin planted in the race by the one man Adam, has sprung up and borne fruit in all..."
2. "As by Adam's transgression, of which we are by descent inheritors, we have become sinners, and have thus incurred death..."
3. "This clause is inserted on the first mention of the name Adam, the one man of whom he had been speaking, to recall the purpose for which he is treating of him - as the figure of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The meaning then must be, that 'death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those that had not, like Adam, transgressed against a positive commandment, threatening death to the disobedient.'"
2. "In this case, the particle 'even,' instead of specifying one particular class of those who lived 'from Adam to Moses,' merely explains what it was that made the case of those who died from Adam to Moses worthy of special noticeâ€”namely, that 'though unlike Adam and all since Moses, those who lived between the two had no positive threatening of death for transgression, nevertheless, death reigned even over them.'"
3. "The point of analogy intended here is plainly the public character which both sustained, neither of the two being regarded in the divine procedure towards men as mere individual men, but both alike as representative men."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Death reigned - People died; they were under the dominion of death in its various melancholy influences."
2. "The expression 'death reigned' is one that is very striking. It is a representation of death as a monarch; having dominion over all that period, and overall those generations."
3. "The race wandered without revelation. The difference contemplated is not that Adam was an actual sinner, and that they had sinned only by imputation."

### John Calvin:
1. "This verse is to be connected with the preceding clause, which says, that those who were without the law did not impute sin to themselves. Hence they sinned not after the similitude of Adamâ€™s transgression."
2. "As then we are all lost through Adamâ€™s sin, so we are restored through Christâ€™s righteousness: hence he calls Adam not inaptly the type of Christ."
3. "Observe this, lest you should foolishly go astray with [Origen ], and be involved in a pernicious error; for he reasoned philosophically and profanely on the corruption of mankind, and not only diminished the grace of Christ, but nearly obliterated it altogether."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Death reigned. â€˜Lorded it.â€™ The consequence of sin (â€˜death through sin,â€™ Romans 5:12) was universal, even before the law: from Adam until Moses."
2. "Death, which here includes more than physical death, as the penalty of sin, lorded it over even such as did not sin, etc., i.e., were not guilty of a definite transgression, the transgression of a definite command of God."
3. "The Apostleâ€™s argument is that death came upon these as a consequence of the sin of Adam, and thus he proves that â€˜death came through unto all men, because all sinnedâ€™ in that transgression."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sin and death followed all from Adam on till Moses, showing clearly that the sin of Adam brought terrible consequences upon the race."
2. "Death has come upon infants and idiots also as a result of sin, but one understands Paul to mean that they are not held responsible by the law of conscience."
3. "Adam is a type of Christ in holding a relation to those affected by the headship in each case, but the parallel is not precise as Paul shows."

### John Gill:
1. "Death is represented as a king, as sin and Satan sometimes are; and indeed, death reigns by sin, and Satan both by sin and death; their empires rise, stand, and fall together."
2. "The subjects of his government were not only adult persons, who had been guilty of many actual transgressions, but he reigned even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression."
3. "A child of a year old, the Jewish doctors say, has not tasted the taste of sin, that is, has not committed actual sin; and observe, that young children die on account of the sins of their parents: but the true reason of their dying is here suggested by the apostle; which is the transgression of Adam."

### John Wesley:
1. "Death reigned â€” And how vast is his kingdom! Scarce can we find any king who has as many subjects, as are the kings whom he hath conquered."
2. "Even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression â€” Even over infants who had never sinned, as Adam did, in their own persons; and over others who had not, like him, sinned against an express law."
3. "As the sin of Adam, without the sins which we afterwards committed, brought us death; so the righteousness of Christ, without the good works which we afterwards perform, brings us life: although still every good, as well as evil, work, will receive its due reward."
