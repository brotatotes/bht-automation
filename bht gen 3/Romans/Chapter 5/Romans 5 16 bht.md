# Romans 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through one sin came condemnation, but the gift of grace and justification was brought forth by many trespasses. Sin may have abounded, but God's abundant grace abounded even more. This grace covers not only the guilt of the initial offense but extends to the countless offenses accumulated in the life of every individual. It is a rich and complete righteousness that cancels out every sin, making us the righteousness of God in Christ. This gift of grace provides an acquittal that surpasses the judgment of strict justice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But the gift of grace came of (was by occasion of) many trespasses unto justification."
2. "Where sin abounded, there grace much more abounded: the existence of the law being implied in the word trespasses."
3. "The strict meaning is a sentence of acquittal, which, in fact, amounts to justification."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The condemnation by Adam was for one sin; but the justification by Christ is an absolution not only from the guilt of that first offense, mysteriously attaching to every individual of the race, but from the countless offenses it, to which, as a germ lodged in the bosom of every child of Adam, it unfolds itself in his life."
2. "This is the meaning of 'grace abounding towards us in the abundance of the gift of righteousness.' It is a grace not only rich in its character, but rich in detail."
3. "It is a 'righteousness' not only rich in a complete justification of the guilty, condemned sinner; but rich in the amplitude of the ground which it covers, leaving no one sin of any of the justified uncancelled, but making him, though loaded with the guilt of myriads of offenses, 'the righteousness of God in Christ.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The point in this verse is, that the evil consequences flowed from one crime, one act of guilt; but that the favors had respect to many acts of guilt."
2. "The effects of Adam‚Äôs sin, whatever they were, pertained to the one sin; the effects of the work of Christ, to many sins."
3. "The work of Christ is designed to have reference to many offences, so as to produce pardon or justification in regard to them all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The judgment. Judicial sentence."
2. "Condemnation. A condemnatory sentence."
3. "Justification. Not the subjective state of justification, but a righteous act or deed."

### John Calvin:
1. "This difference being settled, it appears evident, that their opinion is impious, who have taught that we recover nothing else by Christ but a freedom from original sin, or the corruption derived from Adam."
2. "Observe also, that these many offenses, from which he affirms we are freed through Christ, are not to be understood only of those which every one must have committed before baptism, but also of those by which the saints contract daily new guilt; and on account of which they would be justly exposed to condemnation, were they not continually relieved by this grace."
3. "He sets gift in opposition to judgment: by the latter he means strict justice; by the former, gratuitous pardon. From strict justice comes condemnation; from pardon, absolution. Or, which is the same thing, were God to deal with us according to justice, we should be all undone; but he justifies us freely in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A single act of sin is referred to in either case." 
2. "The many sins of men could be pardoned only by a 'free gift.'"
3. "The word, derived from the verb meaning 'to account righteous,' here denotes either, in opposition to 'condemnation,' the righteous decree or verdict which God pronounces on account of the perfect obedience of Christ, or, in opposition to 'trespass,' the righteous act of Christ on which that verdict is based."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. Justification: Act of righteousness, result, ordinance, righteous deed, verdict as here (acquittal). (Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπœâŒºŒ±)

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle goes on with the dissimilitude between the effects of Adam's sin, and Christ's righteousness."
2. "The righteousness of Christ...is to the justification of them; and that not only from the guilt of that particular offense, but from many other offenses, even all their actual sins and transgressions, of every sort."
3. "Another instance of the exuberance, or abounding of the grace of God, in the righteousness of Christ, not only over the sin of the one man, but also over the sins of many, even all the elect of God."

### John Wesley:
