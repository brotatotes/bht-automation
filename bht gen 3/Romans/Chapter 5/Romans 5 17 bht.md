# Romans 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the trespass of one man, death reigned and sin brought about condemnation. However, in Jesus Christ, we receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness, resulting in a reigning in life - a life that encompasses the whole person, both corporeal and spiritual. It is a life of blissful and loving relationship with God, filled with freedom and triumphant power. The effect of the second Adam cannot fall behind the first, as the grace and gift of life exceed the consequences of sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That which came in by the one sinner, was the reign of DEATH: that which shall come in by the One, Jesus Christ, will be a reigning in LIFE." 
2. "If by the trespass of the one [man], death reigned through the one [man], much more shall they which receive the abundance of the grace and of the free gift of righteousness reign in life (eternal) through the one (Man), even Jesus Christ." 
3. "Life is not only corporeal (the resurrection), but also spiritual and moralâ€”as also in 'death' we must include through sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here, for the first time in this section, he speaks of that LIFE which springs out of justification, in contrast with the death which springs from sin and follows condemnation."
2. "The proper idea of it therefore is, 'Right to live'â€”'Righteous life'â€”life possessed and enjoyed with the good will, and in conformity with the eternal law, of 'Him that sitteth on the Throne'; life therefore in its widest senseâ€”life in the whole man and throughout the whole duration of human existence, the life of blissful and loving relationship to God in soul and body, for ever and ever."
3. "'Much more,' when we stand forth enriched with God's 'abounding grace' and in the beauty of a complete absolution from countless offenses, shall we expatiate in a life divinely owned and legally secured, 'reigning' in exultant freedom and unchallenged might, through that other matchless 'One,' Jesus Christ!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If, under the administration of a just and merciful Being, it has occurred, that by the offence of one, death hath exerted so wide a dominion; we have reason much more to expect under that administration, that they who are brought under his plan of saving mercy shall be brought under a dispensation of life."
2. "The evils which they suffer in consequence of the sin of Adam bear no comparison with the mercies of eternal life that shall flow to them from the work of the Saviour."
3. "It denotes complete freedom from condemnation; from temporal death; from sickness, pain, and sin. It is the usual expression to denote the complete bliss of the saints in glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The effect of the second Adam cannot fall behind that of the first. If death reigned, there must be a reign of life."
2. "They which receive [Î¿Î¹ Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î±Î½Î¿Î½Ï„ÎµÏ‚] . Not believingly accept, but simply the recipients."
3. "Abundance of grace. Note the articles, the abundance of the grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the whole is this â€” that Christ surpasses Adam; the sin of one is overcome by the righteousness of the other; the curse of one is effaced by the grace of the other; from one, death has proceeded, which is absorbed by the life which the other bestows."
2. "But the parts of this comparison do not correspond; instead of adding, 'the gift of life shall more fully reign and flourish through the exuberance of grace,' he says, that 'the faithful shall reign;' which amounts to the same thing; for the reign of the faithful is in life, and the reign of life is in the faithful."
3. "The first is, that by Adamâ€™s sin we are not condemned through imputation alone, as though we were punished only for the sin of another; but we suffer his punishment, because we also ourselves are guilty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If this was God's way of justice, with much more certainty will His way of grace be." 
2. "With 'the trespass of the one' is contrasted the abundance of the grace as bestowed on, and accepted by, living persons." 
3. "The whole clause has a triumphant tone, pointing from present grace to future glory, all mediated through the one, Jesus Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Argument a fortiori again. Much more."
2. "Note balanced words in the contrast."
3. "The one or Adam, the one Jesus Christ; reign in both."

### John Gill:
1. "It was the single sin of Adam, the first sin that was committed by him, which gave death its reigning power over the sons of men."
2. "These words are a repetition, with a further explanation, of Romans 5:15; here 'by one man's offence', or 'by one offence, death reigned by one'; in which death is represented as a mighty monarch, a powerful king."
3. "Now such persons who have received this abundant grace and free gift, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ; in corporeal life, they are not now subject to death as a penal evil, as other persons are, and though they die this death, they will triumph over it in the resurrection morn, they will rise again to everlasting life."

### John Wesley:
1. There is a difference between grace and the gift. Grace is opposed to the offence; the gift, to death, being the gift of life.
