## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That which came in by the one sinner, was the reign of DEATH: that which shall come in by the One, Jesus Christ, will be a reigning in LIFE."
2. "If by the trespass of the one [man], death reigned through the one [man], much more shall they which receive the abundance of the grace and of the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one (Man), even Jesus Christ."
3. "The term shall reign is brought in by the antithesis: but it is elsewhere used to signify the state of blessedness, partly in an objective theocratic import, partly in a subjective moral one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The proper idea of it therefore is, 'Right to live'‚Äî'Righteous life'‚Äîlife possessed and enjoyed with the good will, and in conformity with the eternal law, of 'Him that sitteth on the Throne'; life therefore in its widest sense‚Äîlife in the whole man and throughout the whole duration of human existence, the life of blissful and loving relationship to God in soul and body, for ever and ever."
2. "Nor does he say Life reigns in us, which would have been a scriptural enough idea; but, which is much more pregnant, 'We shall reign in life.' While freedom and might are implied in the figure of 'reigning,' 'life' is represented as the glorious territory or atmosphere of that reign."
3. "If one man's one offense let loose against us the tyrant power of Death, to hold us as its victims in helpless bondage, 'much more,' when we stand forth enriched with God's 'abounding grace' and in the beauty of a complete absolution from countless offenses, shall we expatiate in a life divinely owned and legally secured, 'reigning' in exultant freedom and unchallenged might, through that other matchless 'One,' Jesus Christ!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If, under the administration of a just and merciful Being, it has occurred, that by the offence of one, death hath exerted so wide a dominion; we have reason much more to expect under that administration, that they who are brought under his plan of saving mercy shall be brought under a dispensation of life."
2. "The evils which they suffer in consequence of the sin of Adam bear no comparison with the mercies of eternal life that shall flow to them from the work of the Saviour."
3. "It means that they shall be exalted to a glorious state of happiness in heaven; that they shall be triumphant over all their enemies; shall gain an ultimate victory; and shall partake with the Captain of their salvation in the splendors of his dominion above."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The effect of the second Adam cannot fall behind that of the first." 
2. "They which receive...simply the recipients."
3. "Abundance of grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the whole is this ‚Äî that Christ surpasses Adam; the sin of one is overcome by the righteousness of the other; the curse of one is effaced by the grace of the other; from one, death has proceeded, which is absorbed by the life which the other bestows."
2. "But the parts of this comparison do not correspond; instead of adding, 'the gift of life shall more fully reign and flourish through the exuberance of grace,' he says, that 'the faithful shall reign;' which amounts to the same thing; for the reign of the faithful is in life, and the reign of life is in the faithful."
3. "But through the righteousness of Christ we are restored in a different way to salvation; for it is not said to be accepted for us, because it is in us, but because we possess Christ himself with all his blessings, as given to us through the bountiful kindness of the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If this was God's way of justice, with much more certainty will His way of grace be." 
2. "With 'the trespass of the one' is contrasted the abundance of the grace as bestowed on, and accepted by, living persons." 
3. "If, as a fact, sin and death were through Adam, then much more certain is it that abundant present grace and triumphant future glory shall be through our one head, Jesus Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Much more (œÄŒøŒªŒªœâ ŒºŒ±ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ). Argument a fortiori again."
2. "Note balanced words in the contrast (transgression œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄœÑœâŒºŒ±œÑ, grace œáŒ±œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ; death Œ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÑŒøœÇ, life Œ∂œâŒ∑; the one or Adam œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒΩŒøœÇ, the one Jesus Christ)."
3. "Reign Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœÖœâ in both."

### John Gill:
1. "...death is represented as a mighty monarch, a powerful king; and designs not only corporeal death, which has mounted the throne by sin, and is supported in its dominion by an ordinance of heaven; but also a moral or spiritual death, which has seized on all mankind, and reigns in every power and faculty of the soul of man; and likewise an eternal one..."
2. "...by abundance of grace is designed, either something distinct from the justifying righteousness of Christ; such as the abundant grace and mercy of God, in regeneration and conversion; the various graces of the Spirit then implanted; the many things then wrought in the heart; the large discoveries! of pardoning grace, and the abundance of the love of God shed abroad in the soul by the Spirit..."
3. "...now such persons who have received this abundant grace and free gift, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ; in corporeal life, they are not now subject to death as a penal evil, as other persons are, and though they die this death, they will triumph over it in the resurrection morn, they will rise again to everlasting life..."

### John Wesley:
1. There is a difference between grace and the gift. Grace is opposed to the offence; the gift, to death, being the gift of life.
