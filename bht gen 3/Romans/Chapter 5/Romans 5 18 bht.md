## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this summing up, the Apostle puts the antithetical elements as strongly and nakedly as possible in contrast." 
2. "[The Death of Christ viewed as the highest point of His Obedience]... equivalent to 'the obedience of the one,' below; not as in ver. 16,‚Äînor Righteousness, which would not contrast with trespass, a single act."
3. "[The issue was] unto all men (in extent of grace,‚Äîpossible, not actual, as the other) to justification of (conferring, leading to) life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As through one offense it [came] upon all men to condemnation; even so through one righteousness [it came] upon all men to justification of life."
2. "In this case, the apostle, resuming the statement of Romans 5:12, expresses it in a more concentrated and vivid form‚Äîsuggested no doubt by the expression in Romans 5:16, 'through one offense,' representing Christ's whole work, considered as the ground of our justification, as 'ONE RIGHTEOUSNESS.'"
3. "The expression 'justification of life,' is a vivid combination of two ideas already expatiated upon, meaning 'justification entitling to and issuing in the rightful possession and enjoyment of life'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is all that the argument requires. Perhaps there could not be found a more striking declaration any where, that the work of Christ had an original applicability to all people; or that it is in its own nature suited to save all."
2. "It does not prove that all will in fact be saved, but that the plan is suited to meet all the evils of the fall."
3. "He (the apostle) makes the grace common to all, because it is offered to all, not because it is in fact applied to all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The offense of one [ŒµŒΩŒøœÇ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄœÑœâŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ] . Rev., corrects, one trespass. 
The righteousness of one [ŒµŒΩŒøœÇ Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπœâŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ] . See on ver 16. Rev., correctly, one act of righteousness.


### John Calvin:
1. "As by the offense of one we were made (constitute) sinners; so the righteousness of Christ is efficacious to justify us. He does not say the righteousness ‚Äî Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÉ·ΩªŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ, but the justification ‚Äî Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±·Ω∑œâŒºŒ±, of Christ, in order to remind us that he was not as an individual just for himself, but that the righteousness with which he was endued reached farther, in order that, by conferring this gift, he might enrich the faithful." 
2. "These two words, which he had before used, judgment and grace, may be also introduced here in this form, 'As it was through God‚Äôs judgment that the sin of one issued in the condemnation of many, so grace will be efficacious to the justification of many.'"
3. "Justification of life is to be taken, in my judgment, for remission, which restores life to us, as though he called it life-giving. For whence comes the hope of salvation, except that God is propitious to us; and we must be just, in order to be accepted. Then life proceeds from justification."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With this phrase, which means 'in consequence of all this, it follows that,' Paul resumes the parallel, summing up all the previously stated points of resemblance and difference..."
2. "The 'righteous act' which forms the meritorious ground of God's justifying act is sufficient for all men without exception; and the Apostle speaks of it in this light."
3. "'Justification' is here the proper rendering. 'Of life,' i.e., leading to life, in the fullest sense; the interpretation 'justification which is life' confuses the Apostle's thought."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Conclusion of the argument."
2. "The first 'unto all men', the second 'they that receive, etc.'"

### John Gill:
1. "the judgment or guilt, which is unto condemnation, must design a condemnation to eternal death, the just wages of sin"
2. "the righteousness of Christ being freely imputed without works, as it is to all the men that belong to the second Adam, to all his seed and offspring, is their justification of life"
3. "The sentence of justification was conceived in the mind of God from eternity, when his elect were ordained unto eternal life, on the foot of his Son's righteousness"

### John Wesley:
1. Justification of life ‚Äî Is that sentence of God, by which a sinner under sentence of death is adjudged to life.
