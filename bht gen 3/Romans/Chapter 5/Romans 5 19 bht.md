# Romans 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the disobedience of Adam, all humanity became actual sinners, with their sinful nature being the cause for their condemnation. On the other hand, through the obedience of Christ, those who believe in Him shall be made truly and completely righteous, not just through imputation, but through a real and living spiritual union with Him. Paul emphasizes the positive and gracious aspect of this parallel, highlighting righteousness and life through Jesus Christ. Just as Adam's disobedience resulted in the death of all, Christ's obedience offers the opportunity for all believers to be constituted righteous, justified, and pardoned.

1. "As a consequence of the disobedience of the one man (Adam) the many (including all his posterity) were constituted sinners (put in the category of sinners, subject to condemnation), so also in consequence of the obedience of the one (Christ) shall the many (as many as believe in Him, Romans 5:17) be constituted righteous (be placed in that category)."
