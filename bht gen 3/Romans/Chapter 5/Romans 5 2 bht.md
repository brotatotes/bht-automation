We have had our access into this grace wherein we stand, on the ground of hope, rejoicing in the hope of the glory of God, for through faith we have been introduced into the permanent standing in the favor of God. This access is not something we have attained by our own merits, but rather it is through Christ, the only way of access to God. In this field of grace, we have obtained peace with God and should continuously enjoy all the privileges that this grace offers us. Therefore, let us keep on rejoicing, boasting, and triumphing in the hope of sharing in the glory of God.
