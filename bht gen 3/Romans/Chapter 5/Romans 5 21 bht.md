## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That as sin reigned in death, even so grace may reign through righteousness, unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." 
2. "Death, in and by which the reign was exercised and shown: death was the central act of sin's reign." 
3. "He does not here say, as the A.V. renders it, 'death reigned by sin,' as in vv. 12â€“14, because sin and grace are the two points of comparison, and require to be the subjects."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the reign of deathâ€”rather, 'in death,' triumphing and (as it were) revelling in that complete destruction of its victims." 
2. "the grace which originated the scheme of salvation, the grace which 'sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world,' the grace which 'made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin,' the grace which 'makes us to be the righteousness of God in Him'"
3. "It is vain to start back from this imputation to all of the guilt of Adam's first sin, as wearing the appearance of injustice. For not only are all other theories liable to the same objection, in some other formâ€”besides being inconsistent with the textâ€”but the actual facts of human nature, which none dispute, and which cannot be explained away, involve essentially the same difficulties as the great principle on which the apostle here explains them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The triumphs of the gospel here celebrated cannot refer to the number of the subjects, for it has not actually freed all people from the dominion of sin."
2. "Sin in all dispensations and states of things can be thus overcome; and the gospel is more than sufficient to meet all the evils of the apostasy, and to raise up the race to heaven."
3. "Christianity is no more answerable for the introduction and extent of sin, than the science of medicine is responsible for the introduction and extent of disease."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unto death, as the sphere or dominion of death's tyranny."
2. "How much is lost by the inaccurate rendering of the prepositions."
3. "Adam has passed away; Christ alone remains."

### John Calvin:
1. "He had previously said, that death reigned; he now ascribes reigning to sin; but its end or, effect is death. And he says, that it has reigned, in the past tense; not that it has ceased to reign in those who are born only of flesh, and he thus distinguishes between Adam and Christ, and assigns to each his own time. Hence as soon as the grace of Christ begins to prevail in any one, the reign of sin and death ceases."
2. "To preserve the contrast, the sentence might be rendered, 'grace through righteousness;' and then to show the medium or channel through which this 'grace through righteousness' is to reign so as to issue in 'eternal life,' it is added, 'through Jesus Christ our Lord.'"
3. "The reign of sin was that of death and misery; the reign of grace through Christâ€™s righteousness is that of life and happiness, which is never to end."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That--even so grace might reign." 
2. "The purpose of God and the goal for us through Christ." 
3. "This full rhetorical close has almost the value of a doxology."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin has such a power over man in a state of nature, as amounts to a dominion... it has a kingly, governing, and commanding power." 
2. "Grace reigns or bears sway in man's salvation in all its parts, 'through righteousness'; consistent with the justice of God, in a way in which that is glorified, through the redemption of Christ."
3. "Grace as it is in the hearts of converted persons, is meant where it reigns, has the dominion, is the governing principle, and that in a way of righteousness and true holiness; and will reign until it is perfected in glory, or is crowned with eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. "That as sin had reigned-so grace also might reign." 
2. "Here is pointed out the source of all our blessings, the rich and free grace of God."
3. "The meritorious cause; not any works of righteousness of man, but the alone merits of our Lord Jesus Christ."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Through the death and reign of sin, we see grace reigning through righteousness. Sin, which delighted in death, can no longer hold sway, for the grace of God, displayed through Jesus Christ, has triumphed. Let us not be mistaken, it is not the dominance of death that reigns, but rather the abundant grace that birthed the plan of salvation and sent the Son to be our Savior. Though the prepositions in the text are often misinterpreted, we ought to remember that Adam has passed away, but Christ remains. This passage serves as a final doxology, reminding us of the purpose and goal of God. Let us comprehend the great mystery of imputed guilt, recognizing that all other explanations fall short and are inconsistent with Scripture. It is in the sphere of death's tyranny that grace triumphs, leading us to eternal life.
