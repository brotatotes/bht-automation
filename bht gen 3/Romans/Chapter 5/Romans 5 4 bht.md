# Romans 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Patient endurance of trials produces a proven faith, a tested integrity, that serves as an experimental evidence of our hope in God's grace. This tested faith leads to a hope that is grounded in both our initial belief through grace and the subsequent transformation in our lives. As we navigate tribulations with patience, our experience of God's love, grace, mercy, power, and faithfulness deepens. This deepened experience of God's goodness strengthens and increases our hope, creating a linked chain of tribulation, patience, experience, and hope in the Christian life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "proof," as the same word is renderedâ€¦ that is, experimental evidence that we have "believed through grace." 
2. Thus have we hope in two distinct ways, and at two successive stages of the Christian life: first, immediately on believing, along with the sense of peace and abiding access to God; next, after the reality of this faith has been "proved," particularly by the patient endurance of trials sent to test it.
3. We first get it by looking away from ourselves to the Lamb of God; next by looking into or upon ourselves as transformed by that "looking unto Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Patient endurance of trial produces experience."
2. "Long afflictions borne patiently show a Christian what he is; they test his religion, and prove that it is genuine."
3. "The result of such long trial is to produce hope."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Experience [Î´Î¿ÎºÎ¹Î¼Î·Î½] . Wrong. The word means either the process of trial, proving, as 2 Corinthians 8:2, or the result of trial, approvedness, Philippians 2:22."
2. "Here it can only be the latter: tried integrity, a state of mind which has stood the test."
3. "The more accurate rendering is proof or approval."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul takes probation for the experience which the faithful have of the sure protection of God, when by relying on his aid they overcome all difficulties [...] how much avails the power of the Lord, which he has promised to be always present with his people." 
2. "According then to the present passage, we then only make advances in patience as we ought, when we regard it as having been continued to us by Godâ€™s power, and thus entertain hope as to the future, that Godâ€™s favor, which has ever succored us in our necessities, will never be wanting to us." 
3. "Hence he subjoins, that from probation arises hope; for ungrateful we should be for benefits received, except the recollection of them confirms our hope as to what is to come."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The term here used refers to the state of one who has successfully stood a test." 
2. "The more the Christian has become tried, the more also will hope continually possess him." 
3. "Every enlargement of Christian life enlarges this also."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He gives a linked chain, one linking to the other (tribulation Î¸Î»Î¹ÏˆÎ¹Ï‚, patience Ï…Ï€Î¿Î¼Î¿Î½Î·, experience Î´Î¿ÎºÎ¹Î¼Î·, hope ÎµÎ»Ï€Î¹Ï‚) running into verse Romans 5:5."
2. "One linking to the other"
3. "Tribulation, patience, experience, hope"

### John Gill:
1. "As tribulations tend to exercise and increase patience, so patience being exercised and increased, enlarges the saints' stock and fund of experience."
2. "Hope is a gift of God's grace, and is implanted in regeneration, but abounds, increases, and becomes more strong and lively by experience of the love, grace, mercy, power, and faithfulness of God."
3. "Hope is a gift of God's grace, and is implanted in regeneration, but abounds, increases, and becomes more strong and lively by experience of the love, grace, mercy, power, and faithfulness of God."

### John Wesley:
1. And patience works more experience of the sincerity of our grace, and of God's power and faithfulness.
