- Attempt 5 BHT: In Romans 5:6, it is emphasized that Christ's death was an act of divine Love towards ungodly individuals, characterized by their repulsiveness to God. This act took place when they were powerless and had nothing to offer to escape perdition. Christ's death was not only for the sake of humanity but on behalf of them, at the most fitting and proper time. The substitutionary death of Christ is not solely based on the preposition used, but on the broader context of biblical thought. His death was an act of compassion and rescue, demonstrating God's love for the ungodly.
