God commendeth His love toward us by sending Christ to die for us while we were yet sinners. This act of sacrificial love is the most striking manifestation of God's own love for us. It surpasses any love shown among people and is not based on our goodness or righteousness, but on His love for us as sinners. Through the death of Christ, God provides the means for our justification and salvation, saving us from eternal punishment. This love should compel us to love others sacrificially in return.
