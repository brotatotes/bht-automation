# Romans 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Against the doctrine of a purely gratuitous justification, the objection is plausible and it has been urged since ancient times. However, this objection is a total perversion of the doctrine of grace. God's grace does not justify persisting in sin, but rather it teaches us to renounce it. The abounding of grace comes through the pardon of sin, not through the commission of sin. We must not be deceived by this misguided argument, but rather understand that God's grace is glorified when we turn away from sin and live righteous lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "...that (God's) grace may be multiplied (v. 20)?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Against the doctrine of a purely gratuitous justification, the objection is plausible nor has there ever been an age in which it has not been urged." 
3. "That it was a total perversion of the doctrine of Grace the apostle here proceeds to show."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What shall we say to such a sentiment as that where sin abounded grace did much more abound?" 
2. "Shall we continue in sin? ... If sin has been the occasion of grace and favor, ought we not to continue in it, and commit as much as possible, in order that grace might abound?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A transition - expression and a debater's phrase" (Morison).
2. "The use of this phrase points to Paul's training in the Rabbinical schools, where questions were propounded and the students encouraged to debate, objections being suddenly interposed and answered."
3. "Shall we continue [ÎµÏ€Î¹Î¼ÎµÎ½Ï‰Î¼ÎµÎ½]. The verb means primarily to remain or abide at or with... So better here, persist."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought, at the same time, ever to obviate unreasonable questions, lest the Christian faith should appear to contain anything absurd."
2. "If it be true, that the more bountifully and abundantly will the grace of God aid us, the more completely we are overwhelmed with the mass of sin; then nothing is better for us than to be sunk into the depth of sin, and often to provoke Godâ€™s wrath with new offenses; for then at length we shall find more abounding grace; than which nothing better can be desired."
3. "The refutation of this we shall here after meet with."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜Then,â€™ in view of chap. Romans 5:20-21. Comp. the similar phrase in chap. Romans 4:1."
2. "The form of the question in the original indicates that this is the statement of a point to be discussed, or rather of a wrong inference that might be drawn from the abounding of grace."
3. "This wrong inference is a standing objection to the gospel, urged by those who have not felt its power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Yes, and an echo of the rabbinical method of question and answer, but also an expression of exultant victory of grace versus sin."
2. "But Paul sees the possible perversion of this glorious grace."
3. "There are occasionally so-called pietists who actually think that God's pardon gives them liberty to sin without penalty."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin is not 'per se', the cause of the glorifying God's grace, but 'per accidens': sin of itself is the cause of wrath, and not of grace; but God has been pleased to take an occasion of magnifying his grace, in the forgiveness of sin." 
2. "For it is not by the commission of sin, but by the pardon of it, that the grace of God is glorified, or made to abound." 
3. "Grace in conversion is glorified by putting a stop to the reign of sin, and not by increasing its power, which would be done by continuing in it; grace teaches men not to live in sin, but to abstain from it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle here sets himself more fully to vindicate his doctrine from the consequence above suggested." 
2. "He had then only in strong terms denied and renounced it: here he removes the very foundation thereof."

- Attempt 1 BHT: What shall we say to the objection that if grace abounds where sin increases, then we should continue in sin to experience even greater grace? This objection has been brought forth throughout history against the doctrine of gratuitous justification, but the apostle Paul vehemently refutes this misconstrued notion. The assertion that we should persist in sin to receive more grace is a complete perversion of the doctrine of grace. Grace does not justify continuing in sin, but rather it teaches us to renounce it and live righteous lives. The apostle establishes that the abounding of grace comes through the pardon of sin, not through the commission of sin. Thus, we must not be led astray by this fallacious argument and understand that God's grace is glorified when we turn away from sin and embrace righteousness.

- Attempt 4 BHT: Shall we persist in sin, thinking that we may continue in our natural state of wrongdoing and rebellion so that God's grace may multiply? This objection, arising from a misinterpretation of the doctrine of grace, has been raised throughout history. However, the apostle Paul vigorously refutes this distorted understanding. Grace does not justify a lifestyle of sin, but rather teaches us to renounce it. The multiplication of grace occurs through the forgiveness of sin, not the persistence of sin. Let us not be deceived by this fallacious argument, but instead recognize that God's grace is magnified when we turn away from sin and embrace righteousness.

This objection, a total perversion of the doctrine of grace, has been raised throughout history. However, the apostle Paul firmly rejects this distorted understanding. Grace does not justify a life characterized by sin, but rather instructs us to turn away from it. The abundance of grace comes through the forgiveness of sin, not through the persistence of sin. Let us not be deceived by this erroneous argument, but rather acknowledge that God's grace is magnified when we forsake sin and pursue righteousness.
