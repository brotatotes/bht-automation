# Romans 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Is it right to persist in sin, thinking that God's grace will cover us even more? The objection raised here challenges the doctrine of a purely gratuitous justification. However, we must remember that grace does not glorify sin but rather forgives it. We cannot let the faulty belief that God's pardon grants us the liberty to sin without consequence undermine our faith. Instead, grace in conversion is glorified by turning away from sin and embracing righteousness.

### John Gill:
1. "shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? that is, shall we persist in a vicious way of living with this view, that the grace of God may be magnified hereby? is it right to commit sin on such an account? or is this a fair inference, a just consequence, drawn from the doctrine of grace?...To be sure it was not, the objection is without any ground and foundation..." 
2. "sin is not 'per se', the cause of the glorifying God's grace, but 'per accidens'...God has been pleased to take an occasion of magnifying his grace, in the forgiveness of sin: for it is not by the commission of sin, but by the pardon of it, that the grace of God is glorified, or made to abound."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Should we continue in our sinful ways, thinking that God's grace will cover us? If we persist in sinning, will grace abound even more? Some argue that if our salvation depends on good works, this objection would not have been made. However, the doctrine of a purely gratuitous justification is being challenged. Yet, we must remember that the practice of sin as a habit is being addressed here, and there are those who mistakenly believe that God's pardon gives them the freedom to sin without consequences. We must not let these unreasonable questions shake our faith or make it appear absurd. The grace of God is glorified not by the commission of sin, but by the pardon of it. In fact, grace in conversion is glorified by putting a stop to the reign of sin, not by increasing its power. Therefore, we cannot continue in sin, for that would undermine the very foundation of our faith.
