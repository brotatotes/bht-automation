## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "an exhortation to realize this state of death unto sin and life unto God with Christ."
2. "do ye also account yourselves dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus."
3. "in this chapter it is not Christ's Mediatorship, but His Headship, which is prominent."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Antinomianism is not only an error; it is a falsehood and a slander" [HODGE].
	That "we should continue in sin that grace may abound," not
	only is never the deliberate sentiment of any real believer in the
	doctrine of Grace, but is abhorrent to every Christian mind, as a
	monstrous abuse of the most glorious of all truths.
2. As the death of Christ is not only the expiation of
	guilt, but the death of sin itself in all who are vitally united to
	Him; so the resurrection of Christ is the resurrection of believers,
	not only to acceptance with God, but to newness of life.
3. In the light of these two truths, let all who name the name of Christ "examine themselves whether they be in the faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "Take this view of your case, â€” that as Christ once died for the purpose of destroying sin, so you have once died, that in future you may cease from sin."
2. "You must daily proceed with that work of mortifying, which is begun in you, till sin be wholly destroyed."
3. "You are regenerated by the grace of God, that you may lead a life of holiness and righteousness, inasmuch as the power of the Holy Spirit, by which ye have been renewed, is eternal, and shall ever continue the same."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Reckon. The word may be either imperative, or indicative; the former suits the context best."
2. "Only in fellowship with Christ Jesus can we reckon ourselves dead unto sin and alive unto God."
3. "The obvious inference is that dying to sin and living to God is the evidence (and the only valid evidence) of our fellowship with Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul does not mean that baptism makes one dead to sin and alive to God."
2. "That is a spiritual operation 'in Christ Jesus' and only pictured by baptism."
3. "This is a plea to live up to the ideal of the baptized life."

### John Gill:
1. "Believe their discharge from it, and not fear condemnation and death on account of it; and that it shall not be imputed to them, or have any damning power over them."
2. "Men in a state of nature, or of 'Pharisaism', think themselves alive, when they are not; but when they come under a work of the Spirit of God, they see themselves otherwise."
3. "Their life of faith on the righteousness of Christ, is unto the glory of God, and will be followed with an eternal life with God, to which the justifying righteousness of Christ gives them a title."
