# Romans 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let not sin reign in your mortal body, for it is no comparison between sin merely indwelling and sin reigning and being deposed. The Apostle urges us to recognize the connection between sin and death and the abundant life found in Christ that frees us from the bondage of sin. While sin may dwell within us, its reign is inconsistent with the rectified will that Christ brings. Trust in the vicarious atonement and do not succumb to self-indulgence that contradicts your trust in Christ's sacrifice.

### Henry Alford:

3. "He does not say, â€˜Let not sin liveâ€™ or â€˜work,â€™ but, â€˜Let not sin reign:â€™ for He did not come to extinguish nature, but to rectify the will."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let not sin therefore â€” as a Master reign â€” in your mortal body, that ye should obey it â€” sin." 
2. "The 'body' is here viewed as the instrument by which all the sins of the heart become facts of the outward life, and as itself the seat of the lower appetites." 
3. "But the reign here meant is the unchecked dominion of sin within us."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Reign [Î²Î±ÏƒÎ¹Î»ÎµÏ…ÎµÏ„Ï‰] . The antithesis implied is not between reigning and existing, but between reigning and being deposed. 
Body. Literal, thus according with members, ver : 13.


### John Calvin:
1. "Though sin dwells in us, it is inconsistent that it should be so vigorous as to exercise its reigning power; for the power of sanctification ought to be superior to it."
2. "But if any makes this objection â€” that the case with the soul is different; to this the ready answer is â€” that in our present degenerate state our souls are fixed to the earth, and so enslaved to our bodies, that they have fallen from their own superiority."
3. "The nature of man is said to be corporeal, because he is destitute of celestial grace, and is only a sort of empty shadow or image."

2. "The mortality of the body is emphasized, in contrast with the life we have in fellowship with Christ who dieth no more."
3. "The reign of sin in our mortal body would have as its aim obedience to the desires of the body, which are sinful, because we are sinful."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let not sin continue to reign" as it did once.
2. "The reign of sin is over with you."
3. "Self-indulgence is inconsistent with trust in the vicarious atonement."

### John Gill:
1. "Seeing ye are dead to sin, are baptized into the death of Christ, and are dead with him, and alive through him, sin therefore should not reign in you, and over you."
2. "Though they are dead to sin as justified persons, yet not perfectly so as sanctified: they are indeed dead to sin, but sin is not dead in them; it struggles, it makes war, leads captive, and threatens absolute and universal dominion..."
3. "If by reigning sin is meant, sinning against God out of malice and contempt, with the whole heart, without any struggle against it, or repentance for it, or so as to lose the grace of God, and never rise more, then it must be said that it cannot be in a regenerate man; but if by it is meant, falling into sin against their consciences, knowingly and willingly, so as to distress their minds, lose their peace, and grieve the Spirit of God, so as to be held under it, and be led captive by it, such power sin may have in them, and over them; and therefore the exhortation is not needless."

### John Wesley:
1. Let not sin reign even in your mortal body â€” It must be subject to death, but it need not be subject to sin.
