# Romans 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin will not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but under the grace of God. As slaves to sin, it once held power over you, but now, being under grace, sin cannot subdue you. The grace of God, which reigns through righteousness and leads to eternal life, sets you free from sin's rule. Though sin may still tempt and harass, it cannot ultimately overcome you, for you are empowered by the Spirit of God and under the merciful dispensation of the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Your efforts to live a life of freedom from the tyranny of sin shall not be frustrated by its after all tyrannizing over you and asserting its dominion: for ye are not under that law which is the strength of sin, but under that grace." 
2. "I interpret 'having dominion' rather of the eventual triumph of sin by obtaining domination over us, than of its reducing us under its subjection as servants in this life."
3. "Whether we are bound by the law, and how far, depends on how far the law itself spoke the immutable moral truth of Godâ€™s government of the world, or was adapted to temporary observances and symbolic rites now abolished."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For Sin shall not have dominion over youâ€”as the slaves of a tyrant lord." 
2. "To be 'under grace,' is to be under the glorious canopy and saving effects of that 'grace which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.'"
3. "So that, as when they were 'under the law,' Sin could not but have dominion over them, so now that they are 'under grace,' Sin cannot but be subdued under them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For sin ... - The propensity or inclination to sin." 
2. "Shall not have dominion - Shall not reign, Romans 5:12; Romans 6:6. This implies that sin ought not to have this dominion; and it also expresses the conviction of the apostle that it would not have this rule over Christians." 
3. "But under grace - Under a scheme of mercy, the design and tendency of which is to subdue sin, and destroy it."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is one which has more probability in its favor than the rest, and it is this â€” that by law we are to understand the letter of the law, which cannot renovate the soul, and by grace, the grace of the Spirit, by which we are freed from depraved lusts."
2. "He seasonably comes to their aid, by interposing a consolation, derived from this circumstance â€” that their works are not now tested by the strict rule of the law, but that God, remitting their impurity, does kindly and mercifully accept them."
3. "For how much soever we may be harassed by the stings of sin, it cannot yet overcome us, for we are enabled to conquer it by the Spirit of God; and then, being under grace, we are freed from the rigorous requirements of the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The future tense is that of confident assertion, and hence of consolation."
2. "Freedom from the law gives you so little freedom to sin, that it is only by the exercise of grace upon you that your freedom from sin has begun."
3. "If the reason sin will not lord it over us, is that we are not under the law, but under grace, then grace sanctifies us, not the law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall not lord it over you."
2. "Even if not yet wholly dead."
3. "Shall not have dominion."

### John Gill:
1. "It is an absolute promise, that sin shall not have the dominion over believers; and respects not acts of sin, but the principle of sin; and means not its damning power, though that is took away, but its tyrannical, governing power." 
2. "The reason of this is, for ye are not under the law; by which is meant... the moral law: this they were under, so as to obey it, but not in order to obtain righteousness by it; or as forced to obey it by its threats and terrors; they were not under its rigorous exaction; nor under its curse and condemnation; nor as irritating sin, and causing it to abound; or as a covenant of works."
3. "The apostle's view in this is, to affect the saints with their present privilege, and to engage them in a cheerful conflict with sin, and to stir up in them an abhorrence of living in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sin shall not have dominion over you â€” It has neither right nor power."
2. "For ye are not under the law â€” A dispensation of terror and bondage, which only shows sin, without enabling you to conquer it."
3. "But under grace â€” Under the merciful dispensation of the gospel, which brings complete victory over it to every one who is under the powerful influences of the Spirit of Christ."
