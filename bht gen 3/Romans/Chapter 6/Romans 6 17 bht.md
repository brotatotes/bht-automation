### John Gill:
1. "This form of doctrine is ×§×‘×œ×”, 'a Cabala', but not like that of the Jews' oral law, or form of traditions, handed down, as they say, from one man, and set of men, to another; but this is delivered from the Father to Christ, from Christ to his apostles, and by them to the saints; and 'into which they were delivered', as it may be rendered, as into a mould; and so received the impression of it, and were evangelized by it."
2. "So such are who have a spirit of Gospel liberty, in opposition to a spirit of bondage; who live by faith on Christ, and not by the works of the law; who derive their comfort from him, and not from anything done by them; whose repentance and obedience are influenced by the grace of God, and who are zealous of good works, without any dependence on them."
3. "And this obedience did not lie in words, or proceed on mercenary views, and in an hypocritical way; but was 'from the heart'; and was real and sincere: and good reason there is why a hearty, cheerful, and voluntary obedience should be yielded to the Gospel; since it is from God; Christ is the substance of it; it is truth, and the word of our salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "The mould into which ye have been delivered; which, as it contains a beautiful allusion, conveys also a very instructive admonition."
2. "Our minds, all pliant and ductile, should be conformed to the gospel precepts, as liquid metal, take the figure of the mould into which they are cast."
3. "Our minds should be conformed to the gospel precepts."
