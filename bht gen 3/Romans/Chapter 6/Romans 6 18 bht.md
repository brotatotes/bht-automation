# Romans 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being made free from sin, we were made servants to righteousness. This transformation signifies a shift from the dominion of sin to the devoted service of righteousness. Rejecting God's reign over us led to slavery under sin, but through God's grace, we have experienced liberation. Now, our true freedom lies in surrendering ourselves as slaves to righteousness. There is no middle ground in this spiritual war; it is a choice between being a slave to sin or embracing the freedom found in serving righteousness.
