- Attempt 1 BHT: The servant of righteousness is no slave, under no yoke of bondage, but rather serves out of a sincere and unqualified surrender, cultivating holiness both inward and outward. It is a call to present all our faculties, all our members, to the service of righteousness, allowing our eyes to diligently search the Scriptures, our ears to hear the Gospel preached, and our lips to express the praises of God.

This notion of servitude in righteousness may appear demeaning, but it is a necessary reality that underscores the fundamental truth that we live according to the will of another, yet it is also the expression of liberty, as it aligns with our inclination and delight in righteousness.
