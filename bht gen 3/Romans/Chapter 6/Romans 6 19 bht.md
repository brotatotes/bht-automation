## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For the expression ·ºêŒ¥ŒøœÖŒªœéŒ∏Œ∑œÑŒµ the Apostle apologizes: 'it is not literally so; the servant of righteousness is no slave, under no yoke of bondage; but in order to set the contrast between the former and the new state better before you, I have used this word: I speak as a man.'" 
2. "I require of you nothing which your fleshly weakness will not bear." 
3. "Like as ye (once) rendered up your members (as) servants to impurity and to lawlessness, unto lawlessness, so now render up your members (as) servants to righteousness unto sanctification."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I speak after the manner of men‚Äîdescending, for illustration, to the level of common affairs."
2. "because of the infirmity of your flesh‚Äîthe weakness of your spiritual apprehension."
3. "Looking back upon the heartiness with which ye served Sin, and the lengths ye went to be stimulated now to like zeal and like exuberance in the service of a better Master."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I speak after the manner of men - I speak as people usually speak; or I draw an illustration from common life, in order to make myself better understood."
2. "It is well for Christians to be reminded of their former lives, to awaken repentance, to excite gratitude, to produce humility and a firmer purpose to live to the honor of God."
3. "If all Christians would employ the same energies in advancing the kingdom of God that they have in promoting the kingdom of Satan, the church would rise with dignity and grandeur, and every continent and island would soon feel the movement."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He seems to have felt that the figures of service, bondage, etc., were unworthy of the subject, and apologizes for his use of the image of the slave mart to enforce such a high spiritual truth."
2. "Iniquity issuing in an abiding iniquitous state. Lit., lawlessness."
3. "Agiasmov is used in the New Testament both of a process - the inauguration and maintenance of the life of fellowship with God, and of the resultant state of sanctification."

### John Calvin:
1. "I might, by comparing sin and righteousness, show how much more ardently ye ought to be led to render obedience to the latter, than to serve the former; but from regard to your infirmity I omit this comparison: nevertheless, though I treat you with great indulgence, I may yet surely make this just demand ‚Äî that you should not at least obey righteousness more coldly or negligently than you served sin." (198)
2. "As ye were formerly ready with all your faculties to serve sin, it is hence sufficiently evident how wretchedly enslaved and bound did your depravity hold you to itself: now then ye ought to be equally prompt and ready to execute the commands of God; let not your activity in doing good be now less than it was formerly in doing evil." (199)
3. "But if this idea of righteousness be disapproved of, we may still account for the apparent irregularity in the construction of the passage. It is an instance of an inverted order, many examples of which are found even in this Epistle. He begins with 'uncleanness,' he ends with 'holiness,' and then the intervening words which are in contrast correspond, 'iniquity' and 'righteousness.' Here is also an inversion in the meaning; 'uncleanness' is the principle, and 'holiness' is the action; while 'iniquity' is the action, and 'righteousness' is the principle. If this view is right, we have here a singular instance of the inverted parallelism, both as to words and meaning." (199)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I take a figure from human relations, in thus representing Christian freedom as a bond service."
2. "Because of the intellectual weakness resulting from the ‚Äòflesh,' which is here used in the ethical sense, of depraved human nature."
3. "The former would express the ultimate purpose or result, the latter the immediate result, coming into view here as a progressive state."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a good word, especially for our times when self-assertiveness and personal liberty bulk so large in modern speech."
2. "Neuter plural form of Œ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ to agree with ŒºŒµŒªŒ∑ (members). Patently true in sexual sins, in drunkenness, and all fleshly sins, absolutely slaves like narcotic fiends."
3. "This the goal, the blessed consummation that demands and deserves the new slavery without occasional lapses or sprees."

### John Gill:
1. "What he was about to say, he delivered in a manner suited to their understandings, and was Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒπŒΩŒøŒΩ, 'that which was human'; not angelic, or what required the power, purity, and perfection of angels; or what was unreasonable or impossible, but what was their reasonable service, as men."
2. "Let the same members that have been employed in the service of sin, be made use of in the service of righteousness."
3. "Let them be employed under the same form and character as servants, waiting upon the Lord, ready to fulfil his will; and in the same manner, freely, willingly, and cheerfully, and that constantly and universally, in all acts of righteousness and holiness."

### John Wesley:
1. "I speak after the manner of men...Thus it is necessary that the scripture should let itself down to the language of men."
2. "Slowness of understanding flows from the weakness of the flesh, that is, of human nature."
3. "Righteousness here is a conformity to the divine will; holiness, to the whole divine nature. Observe, they who are servants of righteousness go on to holiness; but they who are servants to iniquity get no farther. Righteousness is service, because we live according to the will of another; but liberty, because of our inclination to it, and delight in it."
