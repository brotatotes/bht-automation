# Romans 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard of righteousness. There is a latent irony in the use of the word free, as it does not appear until the end of that freedom is declared. While in the service of sin, you were not servants of righteousness and never did it one act of real service. Thus, you had full proof of the nature and advantages of sin's service. The searching question that follows further emphasizes this meaning.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Romans 6:20, the verse speaks about the state of those who were once servants of sin. Although they seemed free in relation to righteousness, there is an underlying irony in this freedom. It becomes clear that while they were in the service of sin, they were not truly servants of righteousness. Their actions and services were solely devoted to sin, with no genuine contribution to righteousness. This verse raises a probing question about the nature and advantages of serving sin versus serving righteousness. The word free here does not mean that they considered themselves free or that righteousness had no claims upon them, but rather, they were disengaged and independent from its demands. The dative case of righteousness indicates their personal relation to it. They could not serve two masters, thus highlighting the necessity of choosing between sin and righteousness.

- Attempt 5 BHT: In the previous state of being servants of sin, a deceptive sense of freedom existed in relation to righteousness. This ironic freedom did not truly involve the service of righteousness, but rather indicated a complete devotion to sin. Their actions were solely dedicated to serving sin, with no genuine contribution to righteousness. This raises a thought-provoking question about the nature and advantages of sin's service compared to serving righteousness. The verse emphasizes the impossibility of serving both sin and righteousness simultaneously, urging a conscious choice between the two paths.
