# Romans 6:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What fruit did you have in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. These sinful acts yield no permanent advantage, only a sense of shame. The ultimate consequence is death, both physical and spiritual. Sin brings no true profit or pleasure; it only leads to bitterness and eternal separation from God. Let us humbly acknowledge our past life without Christ and turn away from sin, embracing new life in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What fruit then had ye at that time? (Things, deeds) whereof ye are now ashamed."
2. "For the end (virtually the same as the wages, ver. 23, and would be a mere repetition of fruit on the first method of punctuation above) of those things (those fruits consisting of sinful acts) is death."
3. "Death in the widest sense, see note on ver. 16,â€”physical, which has been the end of sin, in which we all are involved,â€”and spiritual and eternal, which will be the end of actual sin if followed out."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death." 
2. "What permanent advantage, and what abiding satisfaction, have those things yielded? The apostle answers his own question:â€”'Abiding satisfaction, did I ask? They have left only a sense of shame.' Permanent advantage? 'The end of them is death.'"
3. "By saying they were 'now ashamed,' he makes it plain that he is not referring to that disgust at themselves, and remorse of conscience by which those who are the most helplessly 'sold under sin' are often stung to the quick; but that ingenuous feeling of self-reproach, which pierces and weighs down the children of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What fruit, then ... - What reward, or what advantage."
2. "Having seen their nature and tendency, you are now ashamed of them."
3. "For the end - The tendency; the result. Those things lead to death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What fruit were ye having during your service of sin?"
2. "In the things whereof ye are now ashamed."
3. "The question is of having fruit, not of the quality of the fruit."

### John Calvin:
1. "The godly, as soon as they begin to be illuminated by the Spirit of Christ and the preaching of the gospel, do freely acknowledge their past life, which they have lived without Christ, to have been worthy of condemnation."
2. "Yea, further, they call to mind the remembrance of their own disgrace, that being thus ashamed, they may more truly and more readily be humbled before God."
3. "He only then is imbued with the principles of Christian philosophy, who has well learnt to be really displeased with himself, and to be confounded with shame for his own wretchedness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What fruit therefore had ye then? Things whereof ye are now ashamed."
2. "The question in antithesis to Romans 6:21, is the having of fruit, not its quality."
3. "For the end of those things is death; here in its most comprehensive meaning in contrast with close of Romans 6:22."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A pertinent question. Ashes in their hands now."
2. "They are ashamed now of the memory of them."
3. "The end of them is death."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin yields no real profit to the servants of it. If a man, by sinful practices, could amass together the riches of the Indies, or gain the whole world, yet if his soul is lost thereby, what advantage would it be to him?"
2. "Nor is there any true pleasure in sin; persons may imagine within themselves they enjoy a real pleasure whilst they are serving divers lusts; but this is but imaginary, it is not real; and this imaginary pleasure is but for a season; it issues in bitterness and death."
3. "The profit, the reward, and wages of them is death: sin not only brings a spiritual or moral death on persons, on all the powers and faculties of their souls, and is followed with a corporeal death; but if grace prevent not, it will end in an eternal one."

### John Wesley:
1. Those things â€” He speaks of them as afar off.
