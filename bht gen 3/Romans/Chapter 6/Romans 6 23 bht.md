# Romans 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Death is the wages earned by sin, while eternal life is the free gift of God. Eternal life is not something we can earn or become entitled to; it is solely a result of God's grace. Sin pays its wages in full, but in contrast, eternal life is a gift of God, completely undeserved by us. Both death and life are before us as possible outcomes, and through Jesus Christ our Lord, we receive the gift of eternal life.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Death is the consequence of sin, earned and paid down by sinners, while eternal life is a free gift from God. It is not earned or deserved, but graciously given to us through Jesus Christ our Lord. In Gospel obedience, we are set free from the law to keep it, and brought under servitude to the law to be truly free. Death and life are two contrasting outcomes presented to all who hear the Gospel: death as the natural consequence of sin, and life as the absolutely free gift of God to sinners. Sin pays its wages in full, punishing its subjects with destruction. However, eternal life is not based on our righteousness or anything we can do to earn itâ€”it is solely a gift from God. Both death and life are eternal in their consequences, and it is through the rich and sovereign grace of God that sinners are saved and receive the gift of eternal life.
