# Romans 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through baptism into Jesus Christ, we are baptized into his death, formally surrendering our lives to sin and becoming a new creature. Baptism is not the means of achieving union with Christ, but rather a public proclamation of our inward spiritual relationship with Him. By being baptized into His death, we symbolize our fellowship with Him and die to sin. Therefore, it is absurd for us to persist in sin, for our baptism signifies that we have renounced sin and dedicated ourselves to live for God.
