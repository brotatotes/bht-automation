# Romans 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we were baptized into Jesus Christ, we were not only united with Him, but also with His death. Baptism signifies our conformity to and participation in Christ. It involves a surrender of our life of sin as if it were dead, sealing ourselves to be new creatures in Christ. Therefore, persisting in sin is contradictory, for baptism signifies our death to sin. It is a public proclamation of our inward spiritual relationship with Christ, where we are united with Him in both His death and resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Or (supposing you do not assent to the argument in the last verse) know ye not (the foregoing axiom is brought out into recognition by the further statement of a truth universally acknowledged), that all we who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?" 
2. "The Apostle refers to an acknowledged fact, in the signification, and perhaps also in the manner of baptism, that it put upon us a state of conformity with and participation in Christ." 
3. "This state involves a death to sin even as He died to sin; the meaning being kept in the background, but all the while not lost sight of, that the benefits of His death were likewise made ours by our introduction into the covenant."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whoso, then, has been baptized into Christ's death has formally surrendered the whole state and life of sin, as in Christ a dead thing."
2. "He has sealed himself to be not only 'the righteousness of God in Him,' but 'a new creature'; and as he cannot be in Christ to the one effect and not to the other, for they are one thing."
3. "'How,' then, 'can he live any longer therein?' The two things are as contradictory in the fact as they are in the terms."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By our very profession made in baptism, we have renounced sin, and have pledged ourselves to live to God."
2. "The act of baptism denotes dedication to the service of him in whose name we are baptized."
3. "Our baptism had a strong resemblance to his death. By that he became insensible to the things of the world; by baptism we in like manner become dead to sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The indicative mood presupposes an acquaintance with the moral nature of baptism, and a consequent absurdity in the idea of persisting in sin."
2. "Baptized into... denotes inward union, participation; not in order to bring about the union, for that has been effected."
3. "As He died to sin, so we die to sin, just as if we were literally members of His body."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul takes up another principle â€” that we are then really united to the body of Christ, when his death brings forth in us its fruit; yea, he teaches us, that this fellowship as to death is what is to be mainly regarded in baptism."
2. "It is hence evident, that when we become partakers of the grace of Christ, immediately the efficacy of his death appears."
3. "His object seems to be merely to show that a change takes place in every true Christian, symbolized by baptism, and that this change bears a likeness to the death and resurrection of our Savior."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If this is doubtful, then I appeal directly to your experimental knowledge."
2. "Baptism into Christ Jesus was the sign of participation in Him, union with Him."
3. "The reference to baptism does not suggest baptismal regeneration; it both connects and distinguishes baptism and regeneration, as the visible sign and the invisible grace of the renewing Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Baptism is the public proclamation of one's inward spiritual relation to Christ attained before the baptism."
2. "Baptism is like putting on an outward garment or uniform."
3. "Baptism is in relation to his death."

### John Gill:
1. "You must know this, you cannot be ignorant of it, that whoever were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death: and therefore must be dead to sin, and consequently ought not to live, nor can they live in sin."
2. "There is a difference between being baptized in water in the name of Christ, and being baptized into Christ, which believers in their baptism are; by which is meant, not a being brought by it into union with Christ, which is either secretly from eternity, or openly at conversion, and both before the baptism of true believers; nor a being brought by it into the mystical body of Christ the church, for this also is before it; but rather it designs a being baptized, or a being brought by baptism into more communion with Christ, into a participation of his grace and benefits; or into the doctrine of Christ, and a more distinct knowledge of it."
3. "I take to be, is to be baptized purely for the sake of Christ, in imitation of him, who has set us an example, and because baptism is an ordinance of his; it is to submit to it with a view to his glory, to testify our affection for him, and subjection to him, without laying any stress or dependence on it for salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "In baptism we, through faith, are ingrafted into Christ; and we draw new spiritual life from this new root, through his Spirit." 
2. "Who fashions us like unto him, and particularly with regard to his death and resurrection." 
3. "Through baptism, we are united with Christ in both his death and resurrection."

- Attempt 1 BHT: When we were baptized into Jesus Christ, we were not only united with Him, but also with His death. Baptism signifies our conformity to and participation in Christ. This involves a complete surrender of our old life of sin, as Christ died to sin. It signifies a sealing of ourselves to be new creatures in Christ, where righteousness and a new life reign. Therefore, it is contradictory for us to persist in sin, for baptism signifies our death to sin. Baptism is not merely an outward symbol, but a public proclamation of our inward spiritual relationship with Christ. Through baptism, we are united with Christ in both His death and resurrection, and we draw new spiritual life from Him.
