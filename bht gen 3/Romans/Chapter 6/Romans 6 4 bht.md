## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When we bow our heads under the water, our old man is buried as in a grave, and having been immersed below, is wholly and once for all put out of sight."
2. "Our baptism into His death belongs together, not we were buried into His death, which would hardly bear any sense."
3. "The divine glory includes all that manifests the Creator to the creature: and hence also his Almightiness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By the same baptism which publicly enters us into His death, we are made partakers of His burial also."
2. "As this was the last and lowest step of His humiliation, so it was the honorable dissolution of His last link of connection with that life which He laid down for us."
3. "Surely if our old life, now dead and buried with Christ, was wholly sinful, the new, to which we rise with the risen Savior, must be altogether a holy life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design was very different. It was to show that by the solemn profession made at our baptism, we had become dead to sin, as Christ was dead to the living world around him when he was buried; and that as he was raised up to life, so we should also rise to a new life."
2. "By our very baptism, by our very profession, we have become dead to sin, as Christ became dead; and being devoted to him by that baptism, we are bound to rise, as he did, to a new life."
3. "It arises from the fact of baptism, not from the mode. It is just as true that they who are baptized by affusion, or by sprinkling, are baptized into his death; become professedly dead to sin and the world, and under obligations to live to God, as those who are immersed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is probably an allusion to the immersion of baptism."
2. "The glorious collective perfection of God."
3. "A stronger expression than new life. It gives more prominence to the main idea, newness."

### John Calvin:
1. "He rightly makes a transition from a fellowship in death to a fellowship in life; for these two things are connected together by an indissoluble knot â€” that the old man is destroyed by the death of Christ, and that his resurrection brings righteousness, and renders us new creatures."
2. "Let us know, that the Apostle does not simply exhort us to imitate Christ, as though he had said that the death of Christ is a pattern which all Christians are to follow; for no doubt he ascends higher, as he announces a doctrine, with which he connects, as it is evident, an exhortation."
3. "By the glory of the Father, that is, by that illustrious power by which he exhibited himself as really glorious, and as it were manifested the greatness of his glory. Thus often is the power of God, which was exercised in the resurrection of Christ, set forth in Scripture in sublime terms, and not without reason."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The death of the old man is at the same time the birth of the new."
2. "The Christian who is in fellowship with Christ shares in his life."
3. "A life which never grows old, whose characteristic 'newness' is imperishable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We were buried therefore with him by means of baptism unto death."
2. "The picture in baptism points two ways, backwards to Christ's death and burial and to our death to sin, forwards to Christ's resurrection from the dead and to our new life."
3. "It is a tragedy that Paul's majestic picture here has been so blurred by controversy that some refuse to see it."

### John Gill:
1. "The nature of it, it is a 'burial'; and when the apostle so calls it, he manifestly refers to the ancient and only way of administering this ordinance, by immersion; when a person is covered, and as it were buried in water, as a corpse is when laid the earth, and covered with it."
2. "For the end of baptism is not only to represent the death and burial, but also the resurrection of Christ from the dead, which is here said to be 'by the glory of the Father', some read the words, 'unto the glory of the Father'; meaning either, that the Father might be glorified hereby; or that Christ, being raised from the dead, might enjoy glory with the Father, as he does in human nature."
3. "Whence it must be greatly incumbent on baptized believers, who are raised from the graves of sin by the power of Christ, to 'walk in newness of life'; for since they are become new creatures, and have new hearts and new spirits given them, new principles of light, life, grace, and holiness implanted in them, and have entered into a new profession of religion, of which baptism is the badge and symbol, they ought to live a new life and conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "We are buried with him â€” Alluding to the ancient manner of baptizing by immersion."
2. "That as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory â€” Glorious power. Of the Father, so we also, by the same power, should rise again; and as he lives a new life in heaven, so we should walk in newness of life."
3. "This, says the apostle, our very baptism represents to us."
