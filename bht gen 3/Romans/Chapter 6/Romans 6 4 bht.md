# Romans 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through baptism, our old selves are buried as in a grave, completely put out of sight. It symbolizes our death to sin and our spiritual participation in Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. The comparison between Christ's physical resurrection and our spiritual transformation goes far deeper, leading us to a holy life and a newness that is imperishable. Our baptism points both backward to Christ's death and burial, and forward to our resurrection and pledge of a new life. It represents the burial of Christ and our burial with him, into death.
