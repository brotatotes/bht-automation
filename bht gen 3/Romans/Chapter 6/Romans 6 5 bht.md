# Romans 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are united to Christ in His death shall also be united in His resurrection. Christians partake of the likeness of Christ's death, but also of His actual Resurrection itself. The participation in His Resurrection, however partially realized in the present state, will only then be accomplished in our entire being when we shall wake up after his likeness. The future tense is used for participation in His resurrection because this is but partially realized. Baptism as a picture of death and burial symbolizes our likeness to Christ in His death and represents the new life in Him.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who are united to Christ in His death shall also be united in His resurrection. Christians partake in the likeness of Christ's death, but also in His actual resurrection. Although this participation in His resurrection is partially realized in our present state, it will be fully accomplished when we wake up after His likeness. The future tense is used because participation in His resurrection is not fully realized yet. Baptism symbolizes our likeness to Christ in His death and burial, demonstrating our new life in Him. Through our vital union with Christ, we die to sin and experience newness of life.
