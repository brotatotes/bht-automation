# Romans 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are united to Him in His Death will also be in His resurrection. Christians partake of the likeness only of His death, but of His actual Resurrection itself. The participation in His Resurrection, however partially realized, will only then be accomplished in our entire being, when we shall wake up after His likeness. Union with Him in the one carries with it participation in the other, for privilege and for duty alike. Baptism as a picture of death and burial symbolizes our likeness to Christ in His death and our new life in Him.
