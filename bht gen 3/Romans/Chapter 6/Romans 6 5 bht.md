# Romans 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through our intimate union with Christ in His death, we also partake in His resurrection. Baptism serves as a visual representation of our likeness to Christ's death, as well as a prophecy of our new life in Him. This vital connection with Him involves dying to sin and experiencing a transformation that leads to newness of life. Ultimately, our union with Christ guarantees our future participation in His resurrection and the power it holds.
