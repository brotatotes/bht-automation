# Romans 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through our union with Christ, our old man, our former self before our new birth, was crucified with Him. This crucifixion signifies a complete cutting off and putting to shame and pain, aiming to destroy the body of sin that once ruled over us and to free us from bondage to sin. Our bodies, once instruments of unrighteousness, are gradually transformed as we are delivered from this miserable thralldom. Ultimately, we are empowered to no longer be in bondage to sin, but to be victorious in the contest against it.
