# Romans 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a person dies, they are acquitted and released from the guilt and bondage of sin. Similarly, when someone dies to sin, they are freed from its guilt and released from its control. This release from sin's dominion does not make Christians perfect, but it signifies that sin no longer has power over them. As a result, sin is cut off from their lives, just as natural death cuts off all communication with life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For, as a man that is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage (among men : no reference to God‚Äôs judgment of him): so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage."
2. "I express Œ¥ŒµŒ¥ŒπŒ∫ . by this periphrasis in both cases because I believe that all this is implied in it: ‚Äòis acquitted,‚Äô ‚Äòhas his quittance,‚Äô from sin, so that Sin (personified) has no more claims on him, either as a creditor or as a master: cannot detain him for debt, nor sue him for service."
3. "A larger reference is thus given to Œ¥ŒµŒ¥ŒπŒ∫ . than the purposes of the present argument, which is treating of the power, not the guilt of sin, required: but that it is so, lies in the nature of ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒØŒ± , the service of which is guilt, and the deliverance from whose service necessarily brings with it acquittal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is freed [Œ¥ŒµŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπœâœÑŒ±Œπ] . Lit., as Rev., is justified; i e., acquitted, absolved; just as the dead person sins no more, being released from sin as from a legal claim."

### John Calvin:

2. "But its increase ought to be diligently labored for, until thou arrivest at the goal." (189)

### John Gill:
1. "This is not to be understood of a natural or a corporeal death; for this is the effect of sin, and is inflicted by way of punishment for it, on Christless persons."
2. "but here it is to be understood of a spiritual or mystical death, and of persons who are dead to the law, by the body of Christ; dead to sin by the sacrifice and grace of Christ."
3. "such are 'freed from sin'; not from the being of it; nor from the burden of it; nor from a continual war with it; nor from slips and falls into it; no, not even freed from it, in the most solemn services and acts of religion; but they are freed from the dominion of it, from servitude to it, and also from the guilt of it, and from obligation to punishment on account of it."

### John Wesley:
1. For he that is dead ‚Äî With Christ. Is freed from the guilt of past, and from the power of present, sin, as dead men from the commands of their former masters.

- Attempt 1 BHT: When a person dies, they are acquitted and released from the guilt and bondage they once had. Similarly, when a person dies to sin, they are freed from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage. This acquittal from sin means that sin no longer has any claims on them, and they are no longer a debtor to the flesh. Just as a dead person is freed from commands, the Christian, being dead to sin, is released from the control of their former master. This release from sin's dominion does not mean that the Christian is perfect, but that sin no longer has power over them. The result of being justified, absolved, and set free from sin is a cutting off of all communication with sin, just as natural death cuts off all communication with life.
