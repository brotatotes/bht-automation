# Romans 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as a person who is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage, a person who has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage. This release from sin's claims and control is a permanent result, as death dissolves all claims and the whole claim of sin has been discharged once for all. The believer's death in Christ frees them from being a debtor to the flesh, as they are justified and set free from sin's dominion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For, as a man that is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage (among men: no reference to Godâ€™s judgment of him): so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin, and released from its bondage."
2. "All this is implied in the word used, â€˜is acquitted,â€™ â€˜has his quittance,â€™ from sin, so that Sin (personified) has no more claims on him, either as a creditor or as a master: cannot detain him for debt, nor sue him for service."
3. "A larger reference is thus given to the assertion than the purposes of the present argument, which is treating of the power, not the guilt of sin, required: but that it is so, lies in the nature of sin, the service of which is guilt, and the deliverance from whose service necessarily brings with it acquittal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For he that is dead... is freed from sin." 
2. "As death dissolves all claims, so the whole claim of sin... has been discharged once for all."
3. "The believer's penal death in the death of Christ... no longer a 'debtor to the flesh to live after the flesh'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When a man dies he is exempt from the power and dominion of his master, of him who reigned over him."
2. "The Christian being now dead to sin... is released from the control of his former master, sin."
3. "The apostle... is saying nothing of the future world. His whole argument has respect to the state of the Christian here; to his being freed from the bondage of sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Just as the dead person sins no more, being released from sin as from a legal claim."
2. "As a man that is dead is acquitted and released from bondage among men."
3. "A man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he who has died, etc... death, by freeing us from this life, sets us free from all its functions." 
2. "If thou art a Christian, there must appear in thee an evidence of a fellowship as to the death of Christ; the fruit of which is, that thy flesh is crucified together with all its lusts; but this fellowship is not to be considered as not existing, because thou findest that the relics of the flesh still live in thee; but its increase ought to be diligently labored for, until thou arrivest at the goal."
3. "It is indeed well with us, if our flesh is continually mortified; nor is it a small attainment, when the reigning power, being taken away from it, is wielded by the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For he that hath died. â€˜He that diedâ€™ is more literal, but â€˜hath diedâ€™ better expresses the relation to what follows."
2. "Is acquitted (lit., â€˜justifiedâ€™) from sin. This is the permanent result. The word â€˜justifiedâ€™ is to be taken here in its strictly legal sense, absolved, acquitted, freed."
3. "We prefer (1.), regarding the verse as a proverbial maxim. â€˜As natural death cuts off all communication with life, so must sanctification in the soul cut off all communication with sinâ€™ (Henry)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Is justified (Î´ÎµÎ´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Ï‰Ï„Î±). Perfect passive indicative of Î´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Î¿Ï‰, stands justified, set free from, adding this great word to death and life of verses Romans 6:1; Romans 6:2. 


### John Gill:
1. "This is not to be understood of a natural or a corporeal death; for this is the effect of sin... 
so far is it from being an atonement for sin."
2. "...there are many persons, who as they die in their sins, they will rise in them..."
3. "Such are 'freed from sin'; not from the being of it; nor from the burden of it;... 
but they are freed from the dominion of it, from servitude to it, and also from the guilt of it, and from obligation to punishment on account of it."

### John Wesley:
1. For he that is dead â€” With Christ. Is freed from the guilt of past, and from the power of present, sin, as dead men from the commands of their former masters.
