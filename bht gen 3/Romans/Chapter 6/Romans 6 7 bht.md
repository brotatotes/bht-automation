# Romans 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For, as a man that is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage, so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage. The believer's penal death in the death of Christ means he is no longer a 'debtor to the flesh to live after the flesh.' As death dissolves all claims, the whole claim of sin has been discharged once for all. Thus, the Christian is released from the control of his former master, sin, through his fellowship in the death of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For, as a man that is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage (among men: no reference to Godâ€™s judgment of him): so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin, and released from its bondage." 
2. "All this is implied in the word used, â€˜is acquitted,â€™ â€˜has his quittance,â€™ from sin, so that Sin (personified) has no more claims on him, either as a creditor or as a master: cannot detain him for debt, nor sue him for service."
3. "A larger reference is thus given to the assertion than the purposes of the present argument, which is treating of the power, not the guilt of sin, required: but that it is so, lies in the nature of sin, the service of which is guilt, and the deliverance from whose service necessarily brings with it acquittal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For he that is dead...is freed...from sin." 
2. "As death dissolves all claims, so the whole claim of sin...has been discharged once for all." 
3. "...the believer's penal death in the death of Christ...he is no longer a 'debtor to the flesh to live after the flesh.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is freed [Î´ÎµÎ´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Ï‰Ï„Î±Î¹] . Lit., as Rev., is justified; i e., acquitted, absolved; just as the dead person sins no more, being released from sin as from a legal claim."
2. "As a man that is dead is acquitted and released from bondage among men, so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage."

### John Calvin:

3. "It is indeed well with us if our flesh is continually mortified; nor is it a small attainment, when the reigning power, being taken away from it, is wielded by the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "â€˜He that diedâ€™ is more literal, but â€˜hath diedâ€™ better expresses the relation to what follows."
