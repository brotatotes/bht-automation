# Romans 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we died with Christ, our belief in Him leads us to the conviction that we shall also live with Him. This belief is not just intellectual, but a deep-seated dogmatic faith. The death and resurrection of Christ is not a mere event, but an ongoing and transformative reality that we partake in. Through our union with Christ, we are called to crucify the flesh and live a spiritual life. This pursuit of newness of life is an integral part of our identity as believers, allowing us to bear His image and bring glory unto Him.
