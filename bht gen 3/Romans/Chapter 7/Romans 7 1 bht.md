- Attempt 4 BHT: The law binds a person only as long as they are alive, similar to how a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive. As Christians, we are dead with Christ and alive to Him, and this death to the law sets us free from its authority. We, as believers, are no longer under its dominion and are released from its condemnation. The law has become abrogated for us, and through this release, we are able to draw our life and peace from the new source found in the gospel. This is a unique aspect of the Mosaic law, as it cannot be altered or suspended temporality like human laws. In our present life, the law continues to condemn and separate us from Christ, but thankfully, we are free from its grasp.
