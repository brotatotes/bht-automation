# Romans 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the commandment, sin became death for me, revealing its exceeding sinfulness as it perverts what is good. The Law acts as a mirror, exposing the deep depravity of the heart. Sin takes advantage of the law, using it for harm and demonstrating its wickedness. The fault lies with sin, not the law, as it turns what is meant for good into a provocative force for destruction. The Law leaves no excuse for the enormity of sin.

### John Calvin:
1. "But sin, etc. With no intention to offend others, I must state it as my opinion, that this passage ought to be read as I have rendered it, and the meaning is this, ‚Äî 'Sin is in a manner regarded as just before it is discovered by the law; but when it is by the law made known, then it really obtains its own name of sin; and hence it appears the more wicked, and, so to speak, the more sinful, because it turns the goodness of the law, by perverting it, to our destruction; for that must be very pestiferous, which makes what is in its own nature salutary to be hurtful to us.'" (218)
2. "The import of the whole is ‚Äî that it was necessary for the atrocity of sin to be discovered by the law; for except sin had burst forth into outrageous, or, as they say, into enormous excess, it would not have been acknowledged as sin; and the more outrageous does its enormity appear, when it converts life into death; and thus every excuse is taken away from it."

"That the corruption of nature might not only be seen and known to be sin, but exceeding sinful; as being not only contrary to the pure and holy nature of God, but as taking occasion by the pure and holy law of God to exert itself the more, and so appear to be as the words 'exceedingly a sinner'."
