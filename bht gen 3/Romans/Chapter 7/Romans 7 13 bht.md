### Albert Barnes:

2. "The sentiment of the whole is, that the tendency of the Law is to excite the dormant sin of the bosom into active existence, and to reveal its true nature. It is desirable that that should be done, and as that is all that the Law accomplishes, it is not adapted to sanctify the soul."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Working death to me through that which is good. This was the mode in which sin was made to appear sin: by making use of what is good to produce death in men, it reveals more fully its own hideous character."
2. "As it is the sovereign right of good to overrule evil results for good, so it is the curse of sin to pervert the effects of what is good to evil."
3. "Such is the design of the law, so far as the salvation of sinners is concerned. It does not prescribe the conditions of salvation. Neither is the law the means of sanctification. It cannot make us holy. On the contrary, its operation is to excite and exasperate sin to render its power more dreadful and destructive."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The excesses of sin reveal its real nature."
3. "Only then do some people get their eyes opened."

### John Gill:
1. "Nor is it any objection to the goodness of the law, that it is a ministration of condemnation and death to sinners; for 'lex non damnans, non est lex', a law without a sanction or penalty, which has no power to condemn and punish, is no law, or at least a law of no use and service."
2. "Moreover, he goes on to open the true end and reason of sin, by the law working death in his conscience."
