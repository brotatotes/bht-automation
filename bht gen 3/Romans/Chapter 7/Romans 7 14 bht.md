# Romans 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We know that the law is spiritual, sprung from God, who is a Spirit, and requiring of men spiritual purity. However, I am carnal, subject to the law of the flesh and in bondage to it. In this state, sin dominates the unrenewed man, making him a slave, completely sold under sin. While the law demands spiritual obedience, I, as a fleshly creature, am incapable of yielding such obedience. I am in a permanent state of slavery to sin, which controls my mind, heart, and actions.
