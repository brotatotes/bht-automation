## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "So now (the now is not said of time, but is used logically, 'seeing that things are so') it is no longer (again, not a chronological, but a logical sequence, 'it can no more be said, that') I that perform (see above, on ver. 15) it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
2. "Here the 'I' is not the complex responsible self, by which the evil deed is wrought, and which incurs the guilt of working it: but the self of the WILL in its higher sense, the 'inner man' of ver. 22."
3. "The not bearing this in mind has led to error in interpretation and doctrine: for example, when it is supposed that the Christian is not responsible for his sins committed against his spiritual will and higher judgment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To explain this and the following statements, as many do (even BENGEL and THOLUCK), of the sins of unrenewed men against their better convictions, is to do painful violence to the apostle's language, and to affirm of the unregenerate what is untrue." 
2. "That coexistence and mutual hostility of 'flesh' and 'spirit' in the same renewed man, which is so clearly taught in Romans 8:4, c., and in Romans 8:4- :, &amp;c., is the true and only key to the language of this and the following verses."
3. "His sole object in thus expressing himself was to bring more vividly before his readers the conflict of two opposite principles, and how entirely, as a new manâ€”honoring from his inmost soul the law of Godâ€”he condemned and renounced his corrupt nature, with its affections and lusts, its stirrings and its outgoings, root and branch."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He means to say that he does not approve or love it in his present state, but that it is the result of his native propensities and passions."
2. "In his heart, and conscience, and habitual feeling, he did not choose to commit sin, but abhorred it."
3. "The sense is, that he is strongly influenced by sin on the one hand, and by the Spirit on the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Now - no more [Î½Ï…Î½Î¹ - Î¿Ï…ÎºÎµÏ„Î¹] . Not temporal, pointing back to a time when it was otherwise, but logical, pointing to an inference." 
2. "After this statement you can no more maintain that, etc."
3. "I [ÎµÎ³Ï‰] . My personality proper; my moral self - consciousness which has approved the law (ver. 16) and has developed vague desires for something better."

### John Calvin:
1. "for the faithful are carried along in their obedience to God with such fervour of spirit that they deny the flesh." 
2. "Paul here denies that he is wholly possessed by sin; nay, he declares himself to be exempt from its bondage"
3. "he had the law of God engraven within him"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is no longer I that perform it, i.e., â€˜what I wish not.â€™ I am a slave under sin, what â€˜I perform, I know notâ€™." 
2. "The desire is powerless; the â€˜Iâ€™ is enslaved." 
3. "There is no sign of release, no assertion of power to do good of which the â€˜Iâ€™ approves."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But sin that dwelleth in me...Not my true self, my higher personality, but my lower self due to my slavery to indwelling sin." 
2. "Paul does not mean to say that his whole self has no moral responsibility by using this paradox." 
3. "To be saved from sin, a man must at the same time own it and disown it" (Denney).

### John Gill:
1. "It was not he as spiritual, as born again, as a new man, a new creature, that did it." 
2. "Sin that dwelleth in me; the old man, the carnal I, the evil present with him, the law in his members."
3. "Which not only existed in him, and wrought in him, and that at times very strongly, but dwelt in him, had its abode in him, as it has in all regenerate persons, and will have, as long as they are in the body."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is no more I that can properly be said to do it."
2. "Sin that dwelleth in me makes, as it were, another person, and tyrannizes over me."
