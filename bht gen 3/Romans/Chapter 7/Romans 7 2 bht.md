# Romans 7:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman who has a husband is bound by the law to him as long as he lives. However, if her husband dies, she is no longer bound by the law. This example serves as proof of the truth the Apostle Paul is trying to convey. Just as a wife is released from the law of her husband when he dies, believers are made dead to the law through their union with Christ. In this new relationship, there is no divorce or separation.
