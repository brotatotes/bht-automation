# Romans 7:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A married woman is bound by the law to her husband, but if he dies, she is set free from that law. This example serves as proof that believers are released from the law through Jesus' death. This does not mean freedom from righteousness, but from the rigid requirements and curse of the law. Similarly, death dissolves the marriage bond, freeing the woman to marry another. Believers are freed from the law and now belong to Christ.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: A married woman is bound by the law to her husband, and if he dies, she is set free from that law. This example serves as proof of the principle being discussed. Just as a woman is released from the law through her husband's death, believers are released from the law through Jesus' death. This does not mean that believers are released from righteousness, but rather from the rigid requirements and curse of the law. In the same way, the bond of marriage is dissolved by death, and the woman is at liberty to marry another. Similarly, believers are freed from the law of their husband (the law) and are now free to be joined to Christ.
