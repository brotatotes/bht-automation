## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The inward man is equivalent to the mind."
2. "It is absolutely necessary to presuppose the influence of the Holy Spirit, and to place the man in a state of grace, before this assertion can be true."
3. "The object is to set the conflict and misery, as existing even in the spiritual man, in the strongest light."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." 
2. "The word here rendered 'delight' is indeed stronger than 'consent' in Romans 7:16."
3. "Both express a state of mind and heart to which the unregenerate man is a stranger."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And this shows that the apostle is not speaking of an unrenewed man. Of such a man it might be said that his conscience approved the Law; that his understanding was convinced that the Law was good; but never yet did it occur that an impenitent sinner found emotions of pleasure in the contemplation of the pure and spiritual Law of God." 
2. "One mark of genuine piety is to be pleased with the whole of the divine requirements."
3. "The 'inward man' is called elsewhere 'the new man'... and denotes not the mere intellect, or conscience, but is a personification of the principles of action by which a Christian is governed; the new nature; the holy disposition; the inclination of the heart that is renewed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I delight in... It is the agreement of moral sympathy." 
2. "The inward man... the essence of the man which is conscious of itself as an ethical personality."
3. "Not to be confounded with the new man... It is substantially the same with the mind."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here then you see what sort of division there is in pious souls..."
2. "The inner man then is not simply the soul, but that spiritual part which has been regenerated by God..."
3. "To the other law he also gives two names, the 'law in his members,' and the 'law of sin.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Delight in' is stronger than 'agree with,' but must not be pressed too far, since Romans 7:21, of which this is an explanation, is a summing up of the experience in Romans 7:14-20."
2. "The inward man... is in a helpless condition, all the more miserable, because of its approval of the law."
3. "When the Christian is 'under the law,â€™ his delight may be more pronounced, but so long as he seeks sanctification through the law, he is quite as helpless."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I delight in the law of God, my real self 'after the inward man'." 
2. "My real self 'after the inward man' of the conscience." 
3. "The outward man."

### John Gill:
1. "Only a regenerate man delights in the law of God; which he does, as it is fulfilled by Christ, who has answered all the demands of it."
2. "He serves it with his mind, of a ready mind freely, and without any constraint but that of love."
3. "This in its nature is agreeable to the law of God, and according to this a regenerate man delights in it."

### John Wesley:
1. For I delight in the law of God â€” This is more than "I consent to," Romans 7:16. The day of liberty draws near.
The inward man â€” Called the mind, Romans 7:23,25.
