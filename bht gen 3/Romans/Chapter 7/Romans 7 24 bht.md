### John Calvin:
1. "He closes his argument with a vehement exclamation, by which he teaches us that we are not only to struggle with our flesh, but also with continual groaning to bewail within ourselves and before God our unhappy condition."
2. "This passage is indeed remarkably fitted for the purpose of beating down all the glory of the flesh; for Paul teaches us, that the most perfect, as long as they dwell in the flesh, are exposed to misery, for they are subject to death; nay, when they thoroughly examine themselves, they find in their own nature nothing but misery."
3. "And further, lest they should indulge their torpor, Paul, by his own example, stimulates them to anxious groanings, and bids them, as long as they sojourn on earth, to desire death, as the only true remedy to their evils; and this is the right object in desiring death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prominent ideas are of helplessness and wretchedness; the cry for deliverance follows. A believer may thus speak, doubtless often does; but this condition is precisely that from which we are delivered."
2. "Not merely a wish: would that I were delivered, but rather: who will deliver me, who can do it; not without a reference to help from a person."
3. "There is, however, no reference to physical death, but to the whole condition of helplessness, guilt, and misery just described, which is, in effect, spiritual death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Wretched man I." 
2. "A heart-rending cry from the depths of despair"
3. "If one feels that Paul has exaggerated his own condition, he has only to recall 1 Timothy 1:15 when he describes himself a chief of sinners."

### John Gill:
1. "O wretched man that I am...Not as considered in Christ, for as such he was a most happy man, being blessed with all spiritual blessings, and secure from all condemnation and wrath."
2. "This shows him to be, and to speak of himself as a regenerate man; since an unregenerate man feels no uneasiness upon that score, or makes any complaint of it."
3. "But from the load of sin, and burden of corruption, under which he groaned, and still bespeaks him a regenerate man."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wretched man that I am ‚Äî The struggle is now come to the height; and the man, finding there is no help in himself, begins almost unawares to pray, Who shall deliver me? He then seeks and looks for deliverance, till God in Christ appears to answer his question."
2. "The word which we translate deliver, implies force. And indeed without this there can be no deliverance."
3. "The body of this death ‚Äî That is, this body of death; this mass of sin, leading to death eternal, and cleaving as close to me as my body to my soul."
