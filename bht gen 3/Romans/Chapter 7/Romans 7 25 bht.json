He acknowledges how the conflict with sin in his own being highlights the glorious deliverance that comes from God. Although he serves the law of God with his mind, he recognizes that his flesh is subject to the law of sin. This acknowledgement of the war within himself shows his understanding that while he is accountable for his actions, his inability to overcome sin is consistent. It is through the grace of God and the work of Christ that Paul finds victory over death and experiences a deep heart-felt wonder and thankfulness. Despite his divided service in his unregenerate state, Paul finds hope and assurance in the fact that God will deliver him through Jesus Christ.",
