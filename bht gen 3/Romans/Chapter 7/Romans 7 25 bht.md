## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This exclamation and thanksgiving more than all convince me, that St. Paul speaks of none other than himself, and carries out as far as possible the misery of the conflict with sin in his members, on purpose to bring in the glorious deliverance which follows."
2. "He now sums up his vindication of the law as holy; and at the same time, sums up the other side of the evidence adduced in the passage, from which it appears that the flesh is still, even in the spiritual man, subject (essentially, not practically and energetically) to the law of sin."
3. "So then (as appears from the foregoing), I myself (I, who have said all this against and in disparagement of the law; I, who write of justification by faith without the deeds of the law; I, Paul, who am writing to you, and as I write it to you) with the mind (the 'mind' is 'the inward man,' as in ver. 23) serve the law of God... but with the flesh... the law of sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Note, (1) This whole chapter was of essential service to the Reformers in their contendings with the Church of Rome."
2. "Here we see that Inability is consistent with Accountability."
3. "If the first sight of the Cross by the eye of faith kindles feelings never to be forgotten... the experimental discovery... is attended with yet more heart-affecting wonder draws forth deeper thankfulness, and issues in more exalted adoration of Him whose work Salvation is from first to last."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is a way of rescue, and I trace it altogether to his mercy in the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "The superiority of the gospel to the Law in overcoming all the evils under which man labors, is thus triumphantly established."
3. "The flesh throughout, in all its native propensities and passions, leads to sin; it has no tendency to holiness; and its corruptions can be overcome only by the grace of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though Paul then bewailed his lot, and sighed for his departure, he yet confesses that he acquiesced in the good pleasure of God." 
2. "What is sufficient to bridle impatience and to cherish resignation, is the thought, that they have been received under the protection of God, that they may never perish." 
3. "The faithful never reach the goal of righteousness as long as they dwell in the flesh, but that they are running their course, until they put off the body."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Here is the key-note of a life distinctively Christian over against the attempt to live better under the law."
2. "With my mind, indeed, I serve the law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin; and, tried by the law, could not be justified but would come under condemnation if viewed in myself, and not in Christ Jesus."
3. "'The whole passage seems, by its alternations, its choice of words, as well as its position in the Epistle, to point to an experience which is produced by the holy, just, and good law of God, rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ; so that even the outburst of Christian gratitude is followed by a final recurrence to the conflict, which is, indeed, ever-recurring, so long as we seek holiness through the law rather than through Christ.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thanks to God." Note of victory over death through Jesus Christ our Lord."
2. "His whole self in his unregenerate state gives a divided service."
3. "In Romans 6:1-7 Paul proved the obligation to be sanctified."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of God shall deliver me. The grace of God the Father, which is communicated through Christ the Mediator by the Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life which is in Christ, the principle of grace formed in the soul by the Spirit of God, which reigns in the believer as a governing principle, through righteousness unto eternal life, will in the issue deliver from indwelling sin, and all the effects of it." 
2. "The thing for which thanks is given is not expressed, but is implied, and is deliverance; either past, as from the power of Satan, the dominion of sin, the curse of the law, the evil of the world, and from the hands of all spiritual enemies, so as to endanger everlasting happiness; or rather, future deliverance, from the very being of sin."
3. "So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin...he divides himself as it were into two parts, the mind, by which he means his inward man, his renewed self; and 'the flesh', by which he designs his carnal I, that was sold under sin...and this shows the apostle's sure and certain faith and hope of this matter, who concludes his discourse on this head thus."

### John Wesley:
1. "God will deliver me through Christ."
2. "My reason and conscience declare for God."
3. "The man is now utterly weary of his bondage, and upon the brink of liberty."
