# Romans 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we were in our corrupt, unregenerate state, the passions of sins prompted us to commit sins and brought forth fruit unto death. These sinful propensities made use of our members as instruments for gratification. It is important to note that the 'flesh' is not inherently sinful, but subject to sin. The law, while not making men holy, increased sin through its prohibition. However, when we are freed from the yoke of the law and united with Christ, we have hope for righteousness and life.
