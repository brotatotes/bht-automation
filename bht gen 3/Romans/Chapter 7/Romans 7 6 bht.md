## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But now we have been loosed from the law...we who are dead to it." 
2. "So that we serve in the newness of the spirit...and not in the oldness of the letter." 
3. "Newness and oldness are...states in which those genitives are the ruling elements."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "we were slain to the law by the body of Christ; language which, though harsh to the ear, is designed and fitted to impress upon the reader the violence of that death of the Cross, by which, as by a deadly wrench, we are 'delivered from the law.'" 
2. "The death spoken of, as we have seen, is not the law's, but ours, through union with the crucified Saviour."
3. "Not in our old way of literal, mechanical obedience to the divine law, as a set of external rules of conduct, and without any reference to the state of our hearts; but in that new way of spiritual obedience which, through union to the risen Saviour, we have learned to render."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are delivered - We who are Christians. Delivered from it as a means of justification, as a source of sanctification, as a bondage to which we were subjected, and which tended to produce pain and death."
2. "That we should serve - That we may now serve or obey God. In newness of spirit - In a new spirit; or in a new and spiritual manner."
3. "And not in the oldness of the letter - Not in the old letter. It is implied here in this, To understand this, it is necessary to remember that the Law which prescribed the forms of worship among the Jews, was regarded by the apostle as destitute of that efficacy and power in renewing the heart which he attributed to the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. We are delivered [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑œÅŒ≥Œ∑Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒµŒΩ] . Rev., have been discharged, as the woman, ver. 2. See on ch. Romans 3:3. 
We were held. Lit., held down. See on ch. Romans 1:18.


### John Calvin:
1. "If the restraint of the law availed so little to bridle the flesh, that it became rather the exciter of sin; then, that we may cease from sin, we must necessarily be freed from the law."
2. "Observe, then, that we are then freed from the law, when God emancipates us from its rigid exactions and curse, and endues us with his Spirit, through whom we walk in his ways."
3. "He sets the spirit in opposition to the letter; for before our will is formed according to the will of God by the Holy Spirit, we have in the law nothing but the outward letter, which indeed bridles our external actions, but does not in the least restrain the fury of our lusts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We died so far as the law is concerned, hence the marriage tie is dissolved."
2. "The sphere of the Christian service of God is a new one, of which the Holy Spirit is the ruling element or force."
3. "The former service was in oldness of the letter... it was a grievous yoke. The new service is the only true service."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But now (ŒΩœÖŒΩ Œ¥Œµ). In the new condition."
2. "Wherein we were holden (ŒµŒΩ œâ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµŒπœáŒøŒºŒµŒ∏Œ±). Imperfect passive of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœáœâ, picture of our former state."
3. "The death to the letter of the law (the old husband) has set us free to the new life in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "But now we are delivered from the law... all this by Christ... but not from obedience to it." 
2. "The saints' deliverance from the law... is not that they may live a loose licentious life and conversation, but that they should serve the Lord their God without slavish fear."
3. "A believer without the law, being delivered from it... lives a better life and conversation under the influence of the Spirit of God, than one that is under the law... the other serves the Lord, 'in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being dead to that whereby we were held - To our old husband, the law."
2. "That we might serve in newness of spirit - In a new, spiritual manner."
3. "And not in the oldness of the letter - Not in a bare literal, external way, as we did before."
