The law, in the full sense of the Mosaic law, served as a means for Paul to recognize the virulence and strength of his own sinful inclinations. It is important to note that the law did not reveal the existence of sin, as even the heathens recognized and wrote about it, but rather it unveiled the dreadful nature and desperate power of sin. The law, by forbidding certain desires, actually stirred up Paul's corruption and led to various lusts. In this passage, Paul speaks not only of his own personal experience, but also represents the universal experience of humanity. Thus, to claim that the law is sin would be a misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of the law.",
