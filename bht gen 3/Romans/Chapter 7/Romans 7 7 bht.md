# Romans 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law is not sin itself, but it uncovers and stirs up sinful desires. Through the law, Paul gained knowledge of the virulence and strength of his inward sin. The law is not responsible for sin; rather, it reveals the dreadful nature and power of sin. By prohibiting certain desires, the law actually triggered a wide range of sinful lusts. Paul's personal experience illustrates the universal experience of humanity. To consider the law as sin would be a misinterpretation of its purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Is the law sin?â€”not â€˜the cause of sin,â€™ but sin, abstract for concrete, sinful, or, as Bengel expresses it, the sinful cause of sin."
2. "The law here is in the full sense of the Mosaic law as regarded himself,â€”not excluding the wider sense on which I have insisted in the former part of the Epistle when applied to others."
3. "The word expresses the motions of the flesh towards sin,â€”whether acted on or not,â€”whether consented to or not:â€”this motion he would not have perceived, because he was simply moving with it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I had not known sin but by the law... It was by means of the law that I came to know what a virulence and strength of sinful propensity I had within me."
2. "The existence of this it did not need the law to reveal to him; for even the heathens recognized and wrote of it. But the dreadful nature and desperate power of it the law alone discovered."
3. "The law forbidding all such desire so stirred his corruption that it wrought in him 'all manner of lusting'â€”desire of every sort after what was forbidden."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though these effects often followed, yet that the Law itself was good and pure."
2. "I deny that the Law is sin. My doctrine does not lead to that; nor do I affirm that it is evil."
3. "He was not merely acquainted abstractly with the nature and existence of sin, with what constituted crime because it was forbidden, but he was conscious of a certain effect on his mind resulting from this knowledge."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I had not known [Î¿Ï…Îº ÎµÎ³Î½Ï‰Î½]. I did not know."
2. "The I refers to Paul himself."
3. "His personal experience is not excluded, but represents the universal experience."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law is the discoverer, not the begetter of sin."
2. "The law prohibits sin; it is not then the cause of it: sin is made known by the law; it is not then by the law produced."
3. "Lust is not simply a sin, for it brings it forth; and when it is sin, it is not mortal sin, for it afterwards brings forth death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Is the law sin? Because, on account of it, we sin, as already described, is it of an immoral nature? This the Apostle indignantly denies, with the usual formula: Let it never be; and then proceeds to show how the good law occasions these results in us."
2. "The law discovers sin, and in a measure incites to it, but it is not itself sin nor the cause of sin."
3. "The objects of the coveting are omitted, for it was the evil desire itself which was made known to him by the commandment forbidding it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is the law sin? A pertinent query in view of what he had said. Some people today oppose all inhibitions and prohibitions because they stimulate violations. That is half-baked thinking."
2. "I had not known sin. Second aorist indicative of Î³Î¹Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎºÏ‰, to know. It is a conclusion of a second class condition, determined as unfulfilled."
3. "But all the same the law is not itself sin nor the cause of sin. Men with their sinful natures turn law into an occasion for sinful acts."

### John Gill:
1. "God forbid! a way of speaking often made use of by the apostle, when any dreadful consequence was drawn from, or any shocking objection was made to his doctrine."
2. "The law is so useful to discover, and so to discountenance sin, that itself cannot be sin, or sinful."
3. "By the law he came to know, not only the sinfulness of outward actions, but also of inward lusts."

### John Wesley:
1. "Is the law sin â€” Sinful in itself, or a promoter of sin."
2. "I had not known lust â€” That is, evil desire. I had not known it to be a sin; nay, perhaps I should not have known that any such desire was in me: it did not appear, till it was stirred up by the prohibition."
3. "To have spoken this of himself, or any true believer, would have been foreign to the whole scope of his discourse; nay, utterly contrary thereto, as well as to what is expressly asserted, Romans 8:2."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse in question raises the question of whether the law is sin. What the apostle Paul is clarifying here is that the law is not the cause of sin, but rather sin itself. The law, in the full sense of the Mosaic law, served as a means for Paul to recognize the virulence and strength of his own sinful inclinations. It is important to note that the law did not reveal the existence of sin, as even the heathens recognized and wrote about it, but rather it unveiled the dreadful nature and desperate power of sin. The law, by forbidding certain desires, actually stirred up Paul's corruption and led to various lusts. In this passage, Paul speaks not only of his own personal experience, but also represents the universal experience of humanity. Thus, to claim that the law is sin would be a misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of the law.
