# Romans 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The presence of the law awakened the dormant nature of sin within me, intensifying its desires and lusts. Sin found an occasion in the commandments to provoke and excite evil desires, like a forbidden blessing that stirs even more vehemently against the restriction. The law provided the material for sin to assail, giving it a fulcrum to exert its power. Prior to the law, sin appeared as good as dead, but in reality, it was merely lying in a dormant state, waiting for its opportunity to manifest itself.

3. "I hence wonder what could have come into the minds of interpreters to render the passage in the preterimperfect tense, as though Paul was speaking of himself; for it is easy to see that his purpose was to begin with a general proposition, and then to explain the subject by his own example."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The excitement resulting from the pressure of the law is now described."
