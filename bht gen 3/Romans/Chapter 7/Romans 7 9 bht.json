            "bht": "When reflecting on Romans 7:9, we can glean various insights from the commentaries. It seems that Paul is describing a time in his life when he was blissfully ignorant of the law, when he deemed himself righteous and deserving of life from God. However, when the commandment came, forbidding all irregular desires and revealing the true nature of sin, it unexpectedly revived and manifested itself as a deadly force within him. This awareness of sin resulted in Paul experiencing a sense of death, as he saw himself as dead in sin, deserving of eternal death. This realization brought about a humble, subdued, and helpless state, which is often found in a converted sinner. Prior to understanding the nature and extent of the Divine law, an individual's sin may be less active and desperate, but once confronted with the specifics of the commandments, the sin becomes alive, and the person dies to their self-righteousness. This verse highlights the transformative power of the law in convicting and humbling us, ultimately leading us to recognize our need for God's grace and redemption.",
