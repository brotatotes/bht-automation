# Romans 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, but your spirit is alive because of righteousness. Though your bodies have to pass through the stage of death because of the first Adam's sin, your spirit is imbued with new and undying life brought in by the righteousness of the second Adam. There is a real and vital union between Christ and his people, and the indwelling of the Spirit of God is the manifestation of this great fact.
