# Romans 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though our bodies may face physical death due to the consequences of sin, if Christ dwells within us by His Spirit, our spirits are alive with the new life He brings. This union is formed by the Holy Spirit, who permeates both Christ and His believers. Our bodies, influenced by the sinful nature, lack the elements of spiritual life and are subject to death. But our spirits receive the gift of eternal life from Christ, offering us communion with Him.

- Attempt 1 BHT: Though our bodies may experience the consequence of sin and face physical death, if Christ dwells within us by His indwelling Spirit, our spirits are alive with the new and undying life brought by the righteousness of Christ. This real and vital union is established by the Holy Spirit who pervades both Christ and His believers. The body, referring to our fleshly state before conversion, lacks the elements of spiritual life and is subject to death. On the other hand, our spirit receives the gift of spiritual and eternal life from Christ himself. In this way, even a spark of the Holy Spirit is the seed of life, granting us communion with Christ and the hope of being swallowed up by His life that overcomes mortality.
