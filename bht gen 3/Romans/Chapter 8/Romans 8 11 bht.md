So, our bodies, though yielding to the effects of sin, will not be left unredeemed.

3. "It is the whole process of bringing from death to life, extending even to the mortal body, which is here spoken ofâ€”and unquestionably, â€˜the Lord and Giver of Lifeâ€™ is the agent throughout in this quickening."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If He dwell in you as the Spirit of the Christ-raising One."
2. "Your bodies indeed are not exempt from the death which sin brought in; but your spirits even now have in them an undying life."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since by the power of Godâ€™s Spirit Christ was raised, and since the Spirit possesses eternal power, he will also exert the same with regard to us."
2. "For it might have been objected, 'That Christ was able by his own power to raise up himself, and this is what no man can do.' But when he says, that God raised up Christ by his Spirit, and that he also communicated his Spirit to us, there is nothing that can be alleged to the contrary; so that he thus makes sure to us the hope of resurrection."
3. "We hence conclude, that he speaks not of the last resurrection, which shall be in a moment, but of the continued working of the Spirit, by which he gradually mortifies the relics of the flesh and renews in us a celestial life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that the indwelling Spirit is the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is a pledge that the spiritual quickening will be followed by the physical quickening."
2. "Even the body which here succumbs to the effects of sin, shall be quickened; the victory of redemption will be complete when this occurs."
3. "If this Spirit now dwells in the body of the believer, that body will not be left unredeemed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall quicken (Î¶Ï‰Î¿Ï€Î¿Î¹Î·ÏƒÎµ). Future active indicative of Î¶Ï‰Î¿Ï€Î¿Î¹ÎµÏ‰, late verb from Î¶Ï‰Î¿Ï€Î¿Î¹Î¿Ï‚, making alive."
2. "Through his Spirit (Î´Î¹Î± Ï„Î¿Ï… Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±Ï„Î¿Ï‚). B D L have Î´Î¹Î± Ï„Î¿ Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î± (because of the Spirit)."
3. "Both ideas are true, though the genitive is slightly more probably correct."

### John Gill:
1. "To understand the words in such a sense, is not so agreeable to the resurrection of Christ here mentioned; whereas Christ's resurrection is often used as an argument of ours, which is designed here, where the apostle argues from the one to the other." 
2. "This act of quickening seems here designed to express the peculiar blessing of the saints; for though the wicked shall be raised from the dead, yet they will not rise with the saints, nor by virtue of union to Christ, nor to an eternal life of joy and happiness." 
3. "The bodies of the saints are the temples of the Holy Ghost, they are sanctified by him, where he continues to dwell by virtue of union to Christ, and in consequence of it will quicken them at the last day."
