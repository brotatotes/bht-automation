# Romans 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we live according to our sinful nature, the outcome is certain: death. However, if we put to death the deeds of the body through the power of the Holy Spirit, the result is life. This life is not a natural consequence but a gift from God through Christ. Our sanctification is rooted in Christ's atoning death and is sustained through the indwelling of the Spirit. The true test of our character lies in the direction of our thoughts, affections, and pursuits. Therefore, let us strive to kill sin, for if we do not, it will surely kill us.
