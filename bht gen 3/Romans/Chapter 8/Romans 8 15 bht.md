## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The spirit ye received was not a spirit of bondage."
2. "Such was your condition before ye believed, living in legal bondage, haunted with incessant forebodings under a sense of unpardoned sin. But it was not to perpetuate that wretched state that ye received the Spirit."
3. "Abba is the Syro-Chaldaic word for Father; and the Greek word for that is added, not surely to tell the reader that both mean the same thing, but for the same reason which drew both words from the lips of Christ Himself during his agony in the garden. He, doubtless, loved to utter His Father's name in both the accustomed forms; beginning with His cherished mother tongue, and adding that of the learned."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The spirit of religion is that of freedom and of confidence; the spirit of children, and not of slaves."
2. "Every sinner is subject to such fear. He has everything of which to be alarmed... But it is not so with the Christian."
3. "He that can in sincerity, and with ardent affection apply this term [Abba] to God, addressing him with a filial spirit as his Father, has the spirit of a Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Spirit which ye received was not a spirit of bondage."
2. "The Spirit of God, producing the condition of adoption."
3. "The adopted son of God becomes, in a peculiar and intimate sense, one with the heavenly Father."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not then pursue only the argument which he had before stated, but dwells more on another clause, which he had connected with it, even the paternal mercy of God, by which he forgives his people the infirmities of the flesh and the sins which still remain in them." 
2. "By such a comparison of contrary things the certainty of our salvation, which he intended to confirm, is, as you see, made more evident."
3. "The faithful also under the law did indeed call God their Father, but not with such full confidence, as the vail kept them at a distance from the sanctuary: but now, since an entrance has been opened to us by the blood of Christ, we may rejoice fully and openly that we are the children of God; hence arises this crying."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that they are â€˜sonsâ€™ is now proven from their Christian experience at conversion."
2. "All unchristian religiousness is in principle legalism, which is a bondage; and bondage produces fear."
3. "They were sons of God, not by birth, but by reason of grace numbering them among His children; the particular reference being to the method by which they became sons, rather than to their sonship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The spirit of adoption...both Jews and Gentiles receive this 'adoption' into the family of God with all its privileges." 
2. "Whereby we cry, Abba, Father." 
3. "This double use of Father as the child's privilege."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the spirit of bondage' is meant, not the Spirit of God: for this is just the reverse of his character, who is a 'free Spirit', or 'a Spirit of liberty'; and is contrary to his work and office, which is to show a soul its state of bondage by nature, and to deliver out of it; and though fear may arise from the convictions of sin, yet this he removes by discoveries of love."
2. "rather a filial child like spirit, such a spirit as becomes the children of God is here meant; a spirit of freedom with God, of reverence of him, and of love of him, and of obedience to him; springing from filial affection and without mercenary views; a meek, harmless, and inoffensive spirit."
3. "The word 'Abba' signifies 'my Father', and is expressive of interest and of faith in it; and read backwards is the same as forwards, God is the Father of his people in adversity as well as prosperity; it is the word used by Christ himself in prayer, and which he directs his people to; to say no more, it is a word which the Jews did not allow servants, only freemen to make use of, and to be called by."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have not received the spirit of bondage â€” The Holy Ghost was not properly a spirit of bondage, even in the time of the Old Testament."
2. "Abba, Father â€” The latter word explains the former. By using both the Syriac and the Greek word, St. Paul seems to point out the joint cry both of the Jewish and gentile believers."
3. "The spirit of bondage here seems directly to mean, those operations of the Holy Spirit by which the soul, on its first conviction, feels itself in bondage to sin, to the world, to Satan, and obnoxious to the wrath of God."
