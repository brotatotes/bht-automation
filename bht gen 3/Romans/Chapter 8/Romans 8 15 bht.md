# Romans 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we have received the Spirit of adoption, not a spirit of bondage and fear. This spirit of adoption is the very element of the new life in us, produced by the Spirit of God. It is through this spirit that we become intimately connected to our heavenly Father, crying out to Him as Abba, Father. This is a significant departure from our previous state of legal bondage, as adopted children of God, we can now approach Him with affection, confidence, and a spirit of freedom.
