# Romans 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The confidence we have as children of God is grounded on the testimony of the Spirit itself, which is higher than our own inferences. The Holy Ghost within us sets His distinct seal to our cry of conscious sonship, Abba, Father. The Spirit bears witness with our spirit, assuring us of our adoption into God's family. This testimony is not the satisfaction of others, but our own assurance that the Spirit conveys to our souls. It is a clear and constant witness of our true identity as children of God.
