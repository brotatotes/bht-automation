# Romans 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sufferings of this present time are minuscule compared to the glory that will be revealed in us. We may endure hardships for a while, but they are nothing when weighed against the eternal and ever-increasing glory that awaits us. Our sufferings are momentary, while the glory is everlasting. We can be assured that these sufferings are of no worth when compared to the magnitude of the glory we will experience.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The sufferings we face in this present time pale in comparison to the glorious future that awaits us. These sufferings, though real and necessary for our participation in Christ's glory, are nothing when set against the radiance of that future glory. We should not be disheartened by the hardships we encounter, for they are temporary while the glory is eternal. The sufferings are but a moment, while the glory is everlasting, ever-increasing, and will completely overshadow any pain we experience now. We can be confident in this perspective because we have reasoned it out and are convinced that the sufferings are insignificant in light of the glory to come.
