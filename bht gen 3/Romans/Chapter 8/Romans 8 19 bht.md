## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "For the patient expectation of the creation waits for the revelation of the sons of God."
3. "The right explanation is, all animate and inanimate nature as distinguished from mankind."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle, fired with the thought of the future glory of the saints, pours forth this splendid passage, in which he represents the whole creation groaning under its present degradation, and looking and longing for the revelation of this glory as the end and consummation of its existence."
2. "The creation... is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God."
3. "For the redemption of their bodies from the grave, which will reveal their sonship, now hidden."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is waiting for his future glory; that is, desirous of obtaining the full development of the honors that await him as the child of God." 
2. "This condition of things does not exist merely in regard to the Christian, but is the common condition of the world. It all groans, and is in trial, as much as the Christian."
3. "Christians only have the prospect of deliverance. To them is held out the hope of final rescue, and of an eternal inheritance beyond all these sufferings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A watching with the head erect or outstretched. Hence a waiting in suspense. 'Apo from, implies abstraction, the attention turned from other objects."
2. "The second explanation is preferable, the non-rational creation viewed collectively, animate and inanimate. Equivalent to all nature."

### John Calvin:

2. "it hence also appears how immense is the value of eternal glory, that it can excite and draw all things to desire it."
3. "he means not, that the sons of God shall be manifested in the last day, but that it shall be then made known how desirable and blessed their condition will be, when they shall put off corruption and put on celestial glory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The entire universe without any limitation. But this does away with the contrast to â€˜sons of Godâ€™, and involves incorrect inferences."
2. "Inanimate creation. This avoids some difficulties, but, by shutting out all intelligent creatures deprives the passage of its most appropriate application."
3. "Humanity alone, either as a whole, or with limitations. This seems too restricted. Further, if Christians are included, the contrast with â€˜sons of Godâ€™ is done away; but if non-Christian humanity alone is meant, it is singular that Paul should choose the word â€˜creationâ€™ rather than the common term â€˜worldâ€™."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The earnest expectation of creation... to watch eagerly with outstretched head." 
2. "Waiteth for... to wait it out." 
3. "This mystical sympathy of physical nature with the work of grace is beyond the comprehension of most of us. But who can disprove it?"

### John Gill:
1. "The earnest expectation of the creature... as waiting for deliverance and a restoration to their paradisiacal estate."
2. "It is best of all by 'the creature' to understand the Gentile world."
3. "The Gentiles might be said to be in earnest expectation of, and waiting for, the manifestation of the Son of God himself, the Messiah."

1. "The word denotes a lively hope of something drawing near, and a vehement longing after it."
2. "All these have been sufferers through sin; and to all these shall refreshment redound from the glory of the children of God."
3. "In their sober, quiet, sleepless, afflicted hours, pour forth many sighs in the ear of God."
