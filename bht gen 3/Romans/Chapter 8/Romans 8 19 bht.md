### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

1. "For the earnest expectation of the creature.... Some by the creature understand the universe, all created beings animate and inanimate, which having suffered much by the sin of man, are introduced by a rhetorical figure, as waiting for deliverance and a restoration to their paradisiacal estate."
2. "It is best of all by 'the creature' to understand the Gentile world. 'The creature' here, and 'the whole creation', Romans 8:22, must be the same... by which name the Jews often in their writings call the Gentiles, to distinguish them from the Israelites."
3. "Now what 'the creature', the Gentile world, is represented as earnestly waiting, and wistly looking out for, is the manifestation of the sons of God; which is made first at their conversion, and afterwards openly and more fully at the appearance of Christ in the resurrection morn."

### John Wesley:
1. "The earnest expectation â€” The word denotes a lively hope of something drawing near, and a vehement longing after it."
2. "All these have been sufferers through sin; and to all these (the finally impenitent excepted) shall refreshment redound from the glory of the children of God."
3. "Upright heathens are by no means to be excluded from this earnest expectation: nay, perhaps something of it may at some times be found even in the vainest of men; who (although in the hurry of life they mistake vanity for liberty, and partly stifle. partly dissemble, their groans, yet) in their sober, quiet, sleepless, afflicted hours, pour forth many sighs in the ear of God."
