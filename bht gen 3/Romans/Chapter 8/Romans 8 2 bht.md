## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This â€˜law of the Spirit of lifeâ€™ having freed him from the law of sin and death, so that he serves another master, all claim of sin on him is at an end he is acquitted, and there is no condemnation for him)." 
2. "If ÏƒÎµ be read, the address is a general one to the reader, leading on to the á¼¡Î¼á¿–Î½ below: and the foregoing argument does not apply." 
3. "There is no stronger proof to my mind of the identity of the speaker in the first person throughout with the Apostle himself, than this extension of that form of speaking into this chapter: nothing more clearly shews, that there he was describing a really existing state within himself, but insulating, and as it were exaggerating it (as so often), to bring out more clearly the glorious deliverance to follow."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the Holy Ghost who is here called 'the Spirit of life,' as opening up in the souls of believers a fountain of spiritual life... just as He is called 'the Spirit of truth,' as 'guiding them into all truth' and 'the Spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord,' as the inspirer of these qualities."
2. "And as the word 'law' here has the same meaning as in Romans 7:23, namely, 'an inward principle of action, operating with the fixedness and regularity of a law,' it thus appears that 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus' here means, 'that new principle of action which the Spirit of Christ has opened up within usâ€”the law of our new being.'"
3. "That the triumph of believers over their inward corruption, through the power of Christ's Spirit in them, proves them to be in Christ Jesus, and as such absolved from condemnation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Spirit of life then means the Holy Spirit producing or giving life; that is, giving peace, joy, activity, salvation; in opposition to the law spoken of in Romans 7 that produced death and condemnation."
2. "The Spirit is sent by Christ; his influence is a part of the Christian scheme; and his power accomplishes what the Law could not do."
3. "He cannot mean that he was perfect, for the whole tenor of his reasoning is opposed to that. But the design, the tendency, and the spirit of the gospel was to produce this freedom from what the Law could not deliver; and he was now brought under the general power of this scheme."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life, proceeding from the life of Jesus and producing and imparting life."
2. "The divine Spirit who inspires the law."
3. "In Christ Jesus, hath made me free."

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds that it is life-giving, (for the genitive case, after the manner of the Hebrew, is to be taken as an adjective,) it hence follows, that they who detain man in the letter of the law, expose him to death."
2. "The meaning then is, â€” that the law of God condemns men, and that this happens, because as long as they remain under the bond of the law, they are oppressed with the bondage of sin, and are thus exposed to death."
3. "I dare not, with some, take the law of sin and death for the law of God, because it seems a harsh expression. For though by increasing sin it generates death, yet Paul before turned aside designedly from this invidious language."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Law of the Spirit of life... The reference is not to the moral law, or the Mosaic law, or to the law of the mind, nor yet to the gospel as a system, but to the new principle of living which comes from the working of the Holy Spirit, here called the Spirit of life, because it gives life, works life in us."
2. "Freed me... The reference is to a single act; not, however, to justification, but to the first act of ethical emancipation which attends it, because the Spirit then begins its work."
3. "The law of sin and death... the old principle of sin which held us captive, and which had â€˜death,â€™ spiritual and eternal, as its consequence. It is this consequence which is denied in Romans 8:1."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life. The principle or authority exercised by the Holy Spirit which bestows life and which rests 'in Christ Jesus.'"
2. "Made me free. We are pardoned, we are free from the old law of sin and death, we are able by the help of the Holy Spirit to live the new life in Christ."
3. "We are able by the help of the Holy Spirit to live the new life in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel may be designed by 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus'; which may be called a law, not as succeeding the law of works, but as a doctrine, order, and chain of truths, as the Hebrew word ×ª×•×¨×” signifies."
2. "This powerful and quickening efficacy of the Spirit delivers regenerate persons from the force and tyranny of sin, called here 'the law of sin and death'; a 'law of sin', because it has power and dominion over unregenerate persons, its throne is in the heart of man, and its laws are many and powerful; and 'the law of death', because its reign is tyrannical, barbarous and cruel, it is unto death."
3. "That Christ's human nature is pure and holy is certain, from express texts of Scripture, from its union to the Son of God, from the ends and purposes of its assumption, from the inefficacy of Satan's temptations, and from the whole course of his life and conversation; for though he was in the likeness of sinful flesh, yet his nature was pure and untainted."

### John Wesley:
1. The law of the Spirit â€” That is, the gospel.
Hath freed me from the law of sin and death â€” That is, the Mosaic dispensation.
