## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (a reason why there is no condemnation) the law (method, or influence, as in viii. 23,â€”used here perhaps for sharper contrast to the law of sin, below) of the Spirit of life (the Lord and Giver of lifeâ€”life used in an incipient higher sense than 'I was alive,' in ch. vii. 9,â€”see below) in Christ Jesus..."
2. "set me free (not, as A.V., 'hath made me free: he is speaking of a definite time when this took place, and referring to the period of his conversion..."
3. "This 'law of the Spirit of life' having freed him from the law of sin and death, so that he serves another master, all claim of sin on him is at an endâ€”he is acquitted, and there is no condemnation for him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me freeâ€”rather, 'freed
me'â€”referring to the time of his conversion, when first he believed."
2. "It is the Holy Ghost who is here called 'the Spirit
of life,' as opening up in the souls of believers a
fountain of spiritual life."
3. "And as the word 'law'
here has the same meaning as in Romans 7:23, namely, 'an inward principle of action, operating with
the fixedness and regularity of a law,' it thus appears that 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus' here
means, 'that new principle of action which the Spirit of Christ
has opened up within usâ€”the law of our new being.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'the Spirit of life' then means the Holy Spirit producing or giving life; that is, giving peace, joy, activity, salvation; in opposition to the law spoken of in Romans 7:0 that produced death and condemnation."
2. "The Spirit is sent by Christ; his influence is a part of the Christian scheme; and his power accomplishes what the Law could not do."
3. "The design, the tendency, and the spirit of the gospel was to produce this freedom from what the Law could not deliver; and he was now brought under the general power of this scheme."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life...proceeding from the life of Jesus and producing and imparting life." 
2. "The Spirit, the divine Spirit who inspires the law." 
3. "In Christ Jesus...hath made me free."

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds that it is life-giving, (for the genitive case, after the manner of the Hebrew, is to be taken as an adjective,) it hence follows, that they who detain man in the letter of the law, expose him to death."
2. "...the law of God condemns men, and that this happens, because as long as they remain under the bond of the law, they are oppressed with the bondage of sin, and are thus exposed to death; but that the Spirit of Christ, while it abolishes the law of sin in us by destroying the prevailing desires of the flesh, does at the same time deliver us from the peril of death."
3. "...the grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Law of the Spirit of life. â€˜Lawâ€™ is here to be taken in its wide sense, the principle, ruling power, etc. The reference is not to the moral law, or the Mosaic law, or to the law of the mind, nor yet to the gospel as a system, but to the new principle of living which comes from the working of the Holy Spirit, here called the Spirit of life, because it gives life, works life in us."
2. "In Christ Jesus. This should be joined with what follows. The deliverance took place in virtue of union to Him who fulfilled the law and delivers from its bondage."
3. "Freed me. The reference is to a single act; not, however, to justification, but to the first act of ethical emancipation which attends it, because the Spirit then begins its work. The whole verse refers to what occurs in the man who is in Christ Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life...rests 'in Christ Jesus.'" 
2. "We are pardoned, we are free from the old law of sin and death, we are able...to live the new life in Christ."
3. "The principle or authority exercised by the Holy Spirit...bestows life."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel may be designed by 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus'; which may be called a law, not as succeeding the law of works, by which that is abrogated; nor as requiring conditions to be performed, or as enjoining duties to be observed, or as delivering out threatenings in case of disobedience; but as it is a doctrine, order, and chain of truths."
2. "The law of sin and death may intend the law of Moses, called 'the law of sin'; not as if it was sinful, or commanded or encouraged sin, for it severely prohibits it; but because by it, through the corruption of man's nature, sin is irritated, and made to abound; it is the strength of sin, and by it is the knowledge of it."
3. "And all this may be said to be 'in Christ': the life which the Spirit is the author and giver of, is in Christ as the head of his people, the proper repository of all grace, and the fountain of life; the Spirit himself is in him, both as God and as man, and as Mediator."

### John Wesley:
1. The law of the Spirit â€” That is, the gospel.
Hath freed me from the law of sin and death â€” That is, the Mosaic dispensation.
