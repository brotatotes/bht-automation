## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus set me free from the law of sin and death." (Romans 8:2)
2. "There is no stronger proof to my mind of the identity of the speaker in the first person throughout with the Apostle himself than this extension of that form of speaking into this chapter."
3. "This 'law of the Spirit of life' having freed him from the law of sin and death, so that he serves another master, all claim of sin on him is at an endâ€”he is acquitted, and there is no condemnation for him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me freeâ€”rather, 'freed me'â€”referring to the time of his conversion, when first he believed."
2. "And as the word 'law' here has the same meaning as in :-, namely, 'an inward principle of action, operating with the fixedness and regularity of a law,' it thus appears that 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus' here means, 'that new principle of action which the Spirit of Christ has opened up within usâ€”the law of our new being.'"
3. "That the triumph of believers over their inward corruption, through the power of Christ's Spirit in them, proves them to be in Christ Jesus, and as such absolved from condemnation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'the Spirit of life' then means the Holy Spirit producing or giving life; that is, giving peace, joy, activity, salvation; in opposition to the law spoken of in Romans 7:0 that produced death and condemnation."
2. "The Spirit is sent by Christ; his influence is a part of the Christian scheme; and his power accomplishes what the Law could not do."
3. "He cannot mean that he was perfect, for the whole tenor of his reasoning is opposed to that. But the design, the tendency, and the spirit of the gospel was to produce this freedom from what the Law could not deliver; and he was now brought under the general power of this scheme."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law, the regulative principle; the Spirit, the divine Spirit who inspires the law."
2. "Of life, proceeding from the life of Jesus and producing and imparting life."
3. "In Christ Jesus. Construe with hath made me free."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law of God condemns men, and that this happens, because as long as they remain under the bond of the law, they are oppressed with the bondage of sin, and are thus exposed to death."
2. "The Spirit of Christ, while it abolishes the law of sin in us by destroying the prevailing desires of the flesh, does at the same time deliver us from the peril of death."
3. "The grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Law of the Spirit of life. â€˜Lawâ€™ is here to be taken in its wide sense, the principle, ruling power, etc. The reference is not to the moral law, or the Mosaic law, or to the law of the mind, nor yet to the gospel as a system, but to the new principle of living which comes from the working of the Holy Spirit, here called the Spirit of life, because it gives life, works life in us."
2. "Freed me. The reference is to a single act; not, however, to justification, but to the first act of ethical emancipation which attends it, because the Spirit then begins its work. The whole verse refers to what occurs in the man who is in Christ Jesus."
3. "The law of sin and death. Not the Mosaic law, as those hold who refer â€˜law of the Spirit of lifeâ€™ to the gospel system, but rather, as chap. Romans 7:23-25 indicates, the old principle of sin which held us captive, and which had â€˜death,â€™ spiritual and eternal, as its consequence. It is this consequence which is denied in Romans 8:1."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The law of the Spirit of life...bestows life and...rests 'in Christ Jesus.'" 
2. "We are pardoned, we are free from the old law of sin and death...we are able by the help of the Holy Spirit to live the new life in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel may be designed by 'the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,' which may be called a law, not as succeeding the law of works, by which that is abrogated; nor as requiring conditions to be performed, or as enjoining duties to be observed, or as delivering out threatenings in case of disobedience; but as it is a doctrine, order, and chain of truths." 
2. "The life which the Spirit is the author and giver of, is in Christ as the head of his people, the proper repository of all grace, and the fountain of life."
3. "That Christ's human nature is pure and holy is certain, from express texts of Scripture, from its union to the Son of God, from the ends and purposes of its assumption, from the inefficacy of Satan's temptations, and from the whole course of his life and conversation; for though he was in the likeness of sinful flesh, was reckoned a sinner by men, was attended with infirmities, the effects of sin, though not sinful, had all the sins of his people imputed to him, and endured afflictions, and at last death; yet his nature was pure and untainted."

### John Wesley:
1. The law of the Spirit â€” That is, the gospel.
Hath freed me from the law of sin and death â€” That is, the Mosaic dispensation.
