# Romans 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Creation itself, though not willingly, was made subject to vanity by the superior power that linked it with mankind. This vanity signifies a perishable and decaying condition separated from God, pursuing false ends. However, there is hope within creation, as it sustains itself with the expectation of a better condition, awaiting the revelation of promised incorruption. Although willingly engaging in vanity, creation was not willingly made subject to it but was led captive by the devil. By subjecting creation to vanity, God offers the hope of delivering it into the liberty of the glory of His children.
