# Romans 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly but on account of God who made it so. This subjection, caused by Adam's sin, signifies an empty and idle state, far from God's intended purpose. However, there is hope in this subjection, as God subjected creation with the expectation of its future deliverance from corruption and bondage into the freedom and glory of His children.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly but on account of Him who made it subject."
2. "At the same time such a way of putting it, removing as it were the supreme will of God to a wider distance from corruption and vanity, and making it not so much the worker as the occasion of it, as well as this indefinite mention of Him, is quite intelligible on the ground of that reverential awe which so entirely characterizes the mind and writings of the Apostle."
3. "The creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle, personifying creation, represents it as only submitting to the vanity with which it was smitten, on man's account, in obedience..."
2. "...to that superior power which had mysteriously linked its destinies with man's."
3. "And so he adds but by reason of him who hath subjected the same â€” 'who subjected it' â€” in hope."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The present state is not one of choice, or one which is preferred, but one to which it has been subjected for wise reasons by God."
2. "The Christian is brought under this influence; his joys are marred; his peace is discomposed; his affections wander; his life is a life of vanity and vexation."
3. "It is not what they desire, to be subjected to the toils of this life, and to the temptations and vanities of this world. They sigh for deliverance."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vain is also used to render kenov (1 Corinthians 14:14, 1 Corinthians 14:58; Ephesians 5:6; James 2:20). Kenov signifies empty; mataiov idle, resultless."
2. "All which has not God for the true end of its being is mataiov."
3. "Adam's sin and not God's will was the direct and special cause of the subjection to vanity."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says, that they have been subjected to vanity, and for this reason, because they abide not in a constant and durable state, but being as it were evanescent and unstable, they pass away swiftly; for no doubt he sets vanity in opposition to a perfect state." 
2. "But he introduces all parts of the world, by a sort of personification, as being endued with reason; and he does this in order to shame our stupidity, when the uncertain fluctuation of this world, which we see, does not raise our minds to higher things." 
3. "God has given to everything its charge; and he has not only by a distinct order commanded what he would to be done, but also implanted inwardly the hope of renovation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For the creation was made subject...in consequence of the fall of man."
2. "It became empty, lost its original significance...the whole creation fell away from its original design."
3. "The subjection to vanity was, therefore, not a self-subjection, but by reason of him who subjected it...the will of God was the moving cause."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To vanity (Ï„Î· Î¼Î±Ï„Î±Î¹Î¿Ï„Î·Ï„). Dative case. Rare and late word, common in LXX. From Î¼Î±Ï„Î±Î¹Î¿Ï‚, empty, vain."
2. "Not of its own will (Î¿Ï…Ï‡ ÎµÎºÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÎ±). Common adjective, in N.T. only here and 1 Corinthians 9:27. It was due to the effect of man's sin."
3. "In hope that (ÎµÏ†' ÎµÎ»Ï€Î¹Î´ Î¿Ï„). Note the form ÎµÎ»Ï€Î¹Î´ rather than the usual ÎµÎ»Ï€Î¹Î´ and so ÎµÏ†'. HÎ¿Ï„ can be causal 'because' instead of declarative 'that.'"

### John Gill:
1. "This designs the vanity and emptiness of the minds of the Gentiles, who were without God and Christ, and the Holy Spirit..."
2. "They willingly went into idolatrous and other evil practices, but the devil made them subject, or slaves unto them..."
3. "He led them captive at his will, and powerfully worked in them, by divine permission, so that they became vassals to him, and to their lusts..."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The creation, not willingly but on account of God who made it subject, was subjected to vanity. This subjection was not the result of God's direct action, but rather the consequence of Adam's sin. The creation, personified by the Apostle, submitted to vanity because it has been mysteriously linked to man's destiny. The subjection to vanity implies emptiness, idleness, and resultlessness, a state that is in contrast to God's true purpose. However, there is hope in this subjection, for God subjected creation with the expectation of a future deliverance from the bondage of corruption into the glorious freedom of His children.
