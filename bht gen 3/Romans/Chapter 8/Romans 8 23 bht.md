# Romans 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we have the firstfruit of the Spirit, a guarantee of God's complete possession of us. While we groan within ourselves, longing for the end of our adoption and the redemption of our bodies, we also recognize the greatness of heaven within us. We bear the burden of sin and earthly troubles, but our hope lies in the fullness of our adoption and the complete redemption of our soul and body. In anticipation, we wait for the manifestation of our adoption and the fulfillment of our redemption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "having (not â€˜which have,â€™ but â€˜though we haveâ€™) the firstfruit of the Spirit... as an earnest of the full harvest of His complete possession of us." 
2. "the firstfruit of the Spirit,â€”which Spirit is the harvest,â€”or the firstfruit of the Spirit, which the Spirit gives:â€”or even in apposition, the firstfruit of the Spirit, i.e. which consists in (the gift of) the Spirit."
3. "we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the end of the (or, our) adoption, to wit [or namely], the redemption of our body."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not only [so], but even we ourselvesâ€”though we have so much of heaven already within usâ€”groan within ourselves under this 'body of sin and death'." 
2. "We groan within ourselves, under this 'body of sin and death', and under the manifold 'vanity and vexation of spirit' that are written upon every object and every pursuit and every enjoyment under the sun."
3. "Waiting for the manifestation of our adoption, to wit, the redemption of our bodyâ€”from the grave: 'not... the deliverance of ourselves from the body, but the redemption of the body itself from the grave'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not only they - Not only the creation in general. 'But ourselves also.' Christians."
2. "Which have the first-fruits of the Spirit - The Christians... had partaken of the first influences of the Spirit."
3. "Waiting for the adoption - Waiting for the full blessings of the adoption... the final consummation of all things."

### John Calvin:
1. "The excellency of our glory is of such importance even to the very elements, which are destitute of mind and reason, that they burn with a certain kind of desire for it; how much more it behoves us, who have been illuminated by the Spirit of God, to aspire and strive with firmness of hope and with ardour of desire, after the attainment of so great a benefit."
2. "To avoid, therefore, any ambiguity, I have rendered the word beginnings, (primordia, the elements,) for I do not apply the expression, as they do, to the Apostles only, but to all the faithful who in this world are besprinkled only with a few drops by the Spirit; and indeed when they make the greatest proficiency, being endued with a considerable measure of it, they are still far off from perfection."
3. "Improperly indeed, but not without the best reason, is adoption employed here to designate the fruition of the inheritance to which we are adopted; for Paul means this, that the eternal decree of God, by which he has chosen us to himself as sons before the foundation of the world, of which he testifies to us in the gospel, the assurance of which he seals on our hearts by his Spirit, would be void, except the promised resurrection were certain, which is its consummation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even Christians who are highly privileged unite with creation in its groaning."
2. "Though we have the first-fruits of the Spirit, our salvation is incomplete; the groaning is internal and intense."
3. "The redemption is not complete until the body is redeemed: then we shall have the full blessing of adoption."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Holy Spirit came on the great Pentecost and his blessings continue as seen in the 'gifts' in Romans 8:1, in the moral and spiritual gifts of Galatians 5:22. And greater ones are to come." 
2. "We have our 'groaning' as well as nature." 
3. "Our full 'adoption,' 'the redemption of our body.' That is to come also. Then we shall have complete redemption of both soul and body."

### John Gill:
1. "Grace is of the same kind with glory, and is a pledge and earnest of it; saints judge by grace the firstfruits, what glory is, and therefore long after it."
2. "Their groans were inward from their hearts, not hypocritical or were among themselves, common to them all; and that not merely on their own account, but also for the conversion of the Gentiles, for which they incessantly laboured, and prayed night and day."
3. "Adoption is explained by the redemption of the body; and by the one may be known what the other means: by 'the redemption of our body' is not meant the redemption of God's elect, body and soul, by the blood and death of Christ, but it designs either the redemption of the natural body, by the resurrection from the dead, or else the redemption of the mystical body, the church."

### John Wesley:
1. "And even we, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit." 
2. "The adoption â€” Persons who had been privately adopted among the Romans were often brought forth into the forum, and there publically owned as their sons by those who adopted them."
3. "The redemption of our body â€” From corruption to glory and immortality."
