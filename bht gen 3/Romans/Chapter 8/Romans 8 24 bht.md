# Romans 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our salvation is found in the hope that something future will become present. This hope sustains us in trials and is the characteristic of our salvation. While hope extends to things not yet obtained, what is already seen or possessed is not an object of hope. We are saved by hope, not fully or perfectly saved. We hope for the eternal glory and happiness that is the object of our calling. Hope brings us to the enjoyment of our salvation.
