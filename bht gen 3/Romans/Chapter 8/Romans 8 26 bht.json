            "He shows them their need, what their wants are; he stirs them up to prayer, he supplies them with arguments, puts words into their mouths, enlarges their hearts, gives strength of faith in prayer, and all the ardor and fervency of it; he enables them to come to God as their Father; and gives them liberty and boldness in his presence."
