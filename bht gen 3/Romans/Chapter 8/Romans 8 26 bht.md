## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But the Spirit itself maketh intercession [for us] with groanings which cannot be uttered:‚Äîi.e. the Holy Spirit of God dwelling in us, knowing our wants better than we, Himself pleads in our prayers, raising us to higher and holier desires than we can express in words, which can only find utterance in sighings and aspirations."
2. "Chrysostom interprets the words of the spiritual gift of prayer, and adds, 'For the man who is granted this grace, standing praying in great earnestness, supplicating God with many mental groanings, asks what is good for all.'"
3. "No intercession in heaven is here spoken of, but a pleading in us by the indwelling Spirit, of a nature above our comprehension and utterance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But after the like manner doth the Spirit also help." 
2. "It is not the proper matter of prayer that believers are at so much loss about, for the fullest directions are given them on this head: but to ask for the right things 'as they ought' is the difficulty."
3. "'The Spirit Himself' is in them, giving to the emotions which He Himself has kindled the only language of which they are capable; so that though on our part they are the fruit of impotence to utter what we feel, they are at the same time the intercession of the Spirit Himself in our behalf."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Spirit greatly aids or supports us in those deep emotions, those intense feelings, those inward sighs which cannot be expressed in language, but which he enables us to bear, and which are understood by Him that searcheth the hearts."

1. "There is then no reason for any one to complain, that the bearing of the cross is beyond their own strength, since we are sustained by a celestial power."
2. "For what we should pray for...our thoughts nevertheless continue oppressed with darkness, until the Spirit guides them by his light."
3. "The Spirit is said to intercede...because he stirs up in our hearts those desires which we ought to entertain; and he also affects our hearts in such a way that these desires by their fervency penetrate into heaven itself."

1. "The Spirit of God which dwells in us, by whom we are led, who is the spirit of adoption to us, who has witnessed to our spirits, that we are the children of God, whose firstfruits we have received, over and above, and besides what he has done for us, 'also helpeth our infirmities'; whilst we are groaning within ourselves, both for ourselves and for others, and are waiting patiently for what we are hoping for."
2. "The Holy Spirit of God himself; who, as the word here used signifies, 'helps together', with hope and patience, graces which he has implanted, and which he invigorates and draws forth into act and exercise; or with the saints labouring under their burdens; or with the Father and the Son, who also are helpers of the saints."
3. "He shows them their need, what their wants are; he stirs them up to prayer, he supplies them with arguments, puts words into their mouths, enlarges their hearts, gives strength of faith in prayer, and all the ardor and fervency of it; he enables them to come to God as their Father; and gives them liberty and boldness in his presence."

### John Wesley:
1. "Likewise the Spirit ‚Äî Nay, not only the universe, not only the children of God, but the Spirit of God also himself, as it were, groaneth, while he helpeth our infirmities, or weaknesses."
2. "Our understandings are weak, particularly in the things of God our desires are weak; our prayers are weak."
3. "The Spirit maketh intercession for us - In our hearts, even as Christ does in heaven."
