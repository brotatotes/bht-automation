## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The assurance which we have that God the Heart-Searcher interprets the inarticulate sighings of the Spirit in us,‚Äîis not, strictly speaking, His Omniscience,‚Äîbut the fact that the very Spirit who thus pleads, does it according to God,‚Äîin pursuance of the divine purposes and in conformity with God‚Äôs good pleasure."
2. "All these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when inarticulately uttered."
3. "We may extend the same comforting assurance to the imperfect and mistaken verbal utterances of our prayers, which are not themselves answered to our hurt, but the answer is given to the voice of the Spirit which speaks through them, which we would express, but cannot."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the Searcher of hearts, He watches the surging emotions of them in prayer, and knows perfectly what the Spirit means by the groanings which He draws forth within us."
2. "These inarticulate groanings are the Spirit's own vehicle for conveying into 'the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth' their whole case; and come up before the Hearer of prayer as the Spirit's own intercession in their behalf."
3. "What a view do these two verses (Romans 8:26; Romans 8:27) give of the relations subsisting between the Divine Persons in the economy of redemption, and the harmony of their respective operations in the case of each of the redeemed!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He does not need that those deep emotions should be expressed in words; he does not need the eloquence of language to induce him to hear; but he sees the anxious feelings of the soul, and is ready to aid and to bless."
2. "That man is most safe who yields himself most entirely to the influence of the Holy Spirit."
3. "But in the midst of our feebleness we may look to God for the aid of his Spirit, and rejoice in his presence, and in his power to sustain us in our sighings, and to guide us in our wanderings."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a remarkable reason for strengthening our confidence, that we are heard by God when we pray through his Spirit, for he thoroughly knows our desires, even as the thoughts of his own Spirit."
2. "And here must be noticed the suitableness of the word to know; for it intimates that God regards not these emotions of the Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as unreasonable, but that he allows them, and at the same time kindly accepts them, as allowed and approved by him."
3. "Let us also hence learn, that what holds the first place in prayer is consent with the will of the Lord, whom our wishes do by no means hold under obligation. If then we would have our prayers to be acceptable to God, we must pray that he may regulate them according to his will."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though the groanings are unutterable, God understands their meaning."
2. "The mind of the Spirit... may be but partially recognized by us in our weakness."
3. "The ground of the perfect knowledge is the fact that He pleadeth for the saints according to the will of God, in harmony with the Divine will."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Holy Spirit is the 'other Paraclete' who pleads God's cause with us as Christ is our Paraclete with the Father."
2. "The Holy Spirit interprets our prayers to God and 'makes intercession for us in accord with God's will.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He knows the wise meaning there is in them, for so œÜœÅŒøŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ± may signify, and is opposed to the carnal mind, or wisdom of the flesh, which desires foolish things." 
2. "The omniscient God understands, and respects such kind of prayer: and the reason is, because he, the Spirit of God, maketh intercession for the saints, according to the will of God."
3. "Saints may be confident of the prevalence and success of such intercession."

### John Wesley:
1. "But he who searcheth the hearts...Knoweth...What is the mind of the Spirit"
2. "for he maketh intercession for the saints"
3. "According to God...acceptable to him"
