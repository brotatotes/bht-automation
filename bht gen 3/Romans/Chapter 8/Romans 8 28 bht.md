## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To those who love God...all things work together for good." 
2. "They are sure that all things work for their good, not only because they love Him who worketh all things, but also because He who worketh all things hath loved and chosen them, and carried them through the successive steps of their spiritual life."
3. "GOD'S SOVEREIGNTYâ€”on the other, MAN'S FREE WILLâ€”is plainly declared to us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We know that to them that love God all things work together for good [even] to them who are the called (rather, 'who are called') according to His (eternal) purpose." 
2. "And this, it seems, was a 'household word,' a 'known' thing, among believers."
3. "And knowing that it is in pursuance of an eternal 'purpose' of love that they have been 'called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ', they naturally say within themselves, 'It cannot be that He 'of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things,' should suffer that purpose to be thwarted by anything really adverse to us.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All things - All our afflictions and trials; all the persecutions and calamities to which we are exposed. Though they are numerous and long-continued yet they are among the means that are appointed for our welfare."
2. "They take off our affections from this world; they teach us the truth about our frail, transitory, and lying condition; they lead us to look to God for support, and to heaven for a final home; and they produce a subdued spirit, a humble temper, a patient, tender, and kind disposition."
3. "The Christian is made a better man by receiving afflictions as they should be received, and by desiring that they should accomplish the purpose for which they are sent; the sinner is made more hardened by resisting them, and refusing to submit to their obvious intention and design."

3. "Jacob cried, all these things are against me."

2. "All things which happen to the saints are so overruled by God, that what the world regards as evil, the issue shows to be good."
3. "The faithful do not love God before they are called by him... afflictions avail not to advance the salvation of any but of those who love God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All things. All events, even afflictive ones... indeed all created things."
2. "Work together. The usual sense: cooperate, combine to produce the result, is preferable."
3. "The love of believers for God is therefore not the ground of their confidence, but the sign and security that they were first loved of God."
