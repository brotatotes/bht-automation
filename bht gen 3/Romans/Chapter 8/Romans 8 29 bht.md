2. "God's 'knowledge' of His people cannot be restricted to a mere foresight of future events, or acquaintance with what is passing here below."
3. "But probably God's foreknowledge of His own people means His 'peculiar, gracious, complacency in them,' while His 'predestinating' or 'foreordaining' them signifies His fixed purpose, flowing from this, to 'save them and call them with an holy calling' (2 Timothy 1:9)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It does not here have reference to all the human family; for all are not, and have not, been conformed to the image of his Son."
