## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those who He foreknew would repent and believe... but this is to thrust into the text."
2. "God's foreknowledge of His own people means His 'peculiar, gracious, complacency in them,' while His 'predestinating' or 'foreordaining' them signifies His fixed purpose, flowing from this, to 'save them and call them with an holy calling.'"
3. "He, in the Humanity of the Only-begotten of the Father, bearing our sins on the accursed tree; they in that of mere men ready to perish by reason of sin, but redeemed by His blood from condemnation and wrath, and transformed into His likeness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In what way such an event became certain is not determined by the use of this word. But it must have been somehow in connection with a divine appointment or arrangement, since in no other way can it be conceived to be certain." 
2. "This passage simply teaches that he knew them; that his eye was fixed on them; that he regarded them as to be conformed to his Son; and that, thus knowing them, he designated them to eternal life."
3. "The only evidence which we can have that we are the subjects of his gracious purpose is, that we are 'in fact' conformed to the Lord Jesus Christ. For this was the design of the decree. This is the only satisfactory proof of piety; and by this alone can we determine that we are interested in his gracious plan of saving people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is God's being aware in His plan, by means of which, before the subjects are destined by Him to salvation, He knows whom He has to destine thereto" (Meyer).

3. "There is another kind of life of which science as yet has taken little cognizance. It obeys the same laws. It builds up an organism into its own form. It is the Christ - life."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is therefore no reason for us to be grieved, or to think it hard and grievous, that we are afflicted, unless we disapprove of the Lord‚Äôs election..."
2. "The meaning then is, that gratuitous adoption, in which our salvation consists, is inseparable from the other decree, which determines that we are to bear the cross."
3. "Hence, that the celestial Father may in every way bear testimony to the authority and honor which he has conferred on his own Son, he will have all those whom he adopts to be the heirs of his kingdom, to be conformed to his example."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God knew beforehand certain individuals of our race, and those He destined beforehand."
2. "The beginning of the whole plan is in the good pleasure of God: He foreknew certain persons as those whom He would destine unto salvation, and those He foreordained."
3. "The purpose of grace began in Him, even as His glory is its end. Nothing can separate the first-born and His many brethren."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This fore-knowledge and choice is placed in eternity."
2. "Here we have both ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒ∑ and ŒµŒπŒ∫œâŒΩ to express the gradual change in us till we acquire the likeness of Christ."

- Attempt 1 BHT: God's foreknowledge of His own people means His special favor and purpose for them, as they are redeemed by His blood and transformed into the likeness of Christ. This conformity is an inner and essential change, gradually molding us to acquire the likeness of our Eldest Brother, Jesus. The purpose of God's grace begins in Him and ends with His glory, as Christ is the firstborn from the dead and the head of the family of God's sons.

To bear the cross and be conformed to Christ's example is inseparable from the gratuitous adoption that comprises our salvation. Therefore, we should not be disheartened by afflictions, but instead rejoice in being part of the Lord's election, for those who are foreknown and conformed to the image of His Son bear His mark and will be glorified.
