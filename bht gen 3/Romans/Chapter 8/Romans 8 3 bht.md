# Romans 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in His wisdom, sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh. Unlike the law, Jesus condemned sin and its power over humanity. He took on our nature, yet remained sinless, demonstrating both the condemnation of unholiness and the destruction of sin. Through His sacrifice, sin was condemned and believers were delivered from its grip. The law alone could not accomplish this; it is through Jesus that our sins are expiated and righteousness is conferred.
