# Romans 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in sending His own Son, accomplished what the law could not do. The law, being weak through the flesh, was unable to secure its own fulfillment or bring righteousness to us. However, God, by sending His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh but sinless Himself, condemned sin in the flesh. Through Jesus' sacrifice, sin was disarmed, losing its power over humanity. This condemnation of sin was impossible for the law to achieve, but God made it possible through His Son's redemptive work.

- Attempt 1 BHT: God, in sending His own Son, accomplished what the law could not do. The law, though it revealed the way to life, was powerless against the sinful nature of humanity. But God, in His righteous act, condemned sin in the flesh of Jesus. Jesus took on human flesh, in perfect likeness but without sin, and in doing so, He condemned the power of sin. Through His sacrificial death, sin was both condemned and weakened, paving the way for redemption and sanctification for all who believe. The law, due to its inherent weakness tied to the sinful nature, could never achieve this. But through His Son, God brought about the impossible - the liberation of humanity from the bondage of sin.
