## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His only-begotten, the only one of Godâ€™s sons who is One with Him in nature and essence, begotten of Him before all worlds." 
2. "No other sense of own will suit its position here, in a clause already made emphatic by at least, in consequence of which whatever epithet is fixed to son must partake of the emphasis."
3. "How shall He not (how can it be that He will not) also with Him (in consequence of and in analogy with this His greatest gift: it is a question arguing from the greater to the less) give freely to us all things."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In 'not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up,' or surrendering Him, God exercised, in His Paternal character, a mysterious act of Self-sacrifice, which, though involving none of the pain and none of the loss which are inseparable from the very idea of self-sacrifice on our part, was not less real."
2. "In that sense, certainly, the Jews charged our Lord with making Himself 'equal with God', which He in reply forthwith proceeded, not to disown, but to illustrate and confirm."
3. "Understand Christ's Sonship thus, and the language of Scripture regarding it is intelligible and harmonious; but take it to be an artificial relationship, ascribed to Him in virtue either of His miraculous birth, or His resurrection from the dead, or the grandeur of His works, or all of these togetherâ€”and the passages which speak of it neither explain of themselves nor harmonize with each other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His giving his Son is a proof that he will give to us all things that we need. The argument is from the greater to the less."
2. "All things - All things that may be needful for our welfare. These things he will give freely; without money and without price."
3. "He that has given his Son to die for his people will not withdraw the lesser mercies that may be necessary to secure their salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His own. See on Acts 1:7; 2 Peter 1:3, 2 Peter 1:20."
2. "With Him. Not merely in addition to Him, but all gifts of God are to be received, held, and enjoyed in communion with Christ."
3. "Freely give. In contrast with spared."

### John Calvin:
1. "It greatly concerns us to be so thoroughly persuaded of the paternal love of God, as to be able to retain our rejoicing on its account."
2. "This passage ought to remind us of what Christ brings to us, and to awaken us to contemplate his riches...filled with all celestial treasures, so that they who possess him may not want anything necessary for their perfect felicity."
3. "Christ himself, and everything that comes with or through him, is a favor freely bestowed, and not what we merit. This shuts out...everything as meritorious on the part of man. All is grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He who even, or, indeed."
2. "The gift of Christ for us is the gift of Christ to us."
