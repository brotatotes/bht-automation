# Romans 8:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who, or what, can separate us from the love of Christ? None of these [tribulation, distress, etc.], nor all together, however terrible to the flesh, are tokens of God's wrath or the least ground for doubt of His love. The apostle says not 'What,' but 'Who,' just as if all creatures and all afflictions were so many gladiators taking arms against the Christians. Can any one put a distance between Christ's love and us? The items mentioned will not make Christ love us less.
