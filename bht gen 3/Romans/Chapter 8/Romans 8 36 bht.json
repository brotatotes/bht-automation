The psalmist's words, we are killed as sheep for the slaughter describe the persecution and violence endured by the saints of old, a condition that is mirrored in the challenges faced by Christians in the time of the apostle Paul. These passages highlight the unyielding enmity of the enemies of righteousness and their callous disregard for the lives of the righteous, treating them as sheep designated for slaughter without remorse. Consequently, believers are often subjected to the constant threat of death, their lives hanging by a thread. Nevertheless, the enduring message of this verse is to encourage God's people to remain steadfast in the face of adversity, knowing that suffering and even death have been the common lot of the saints throughout all ages.",
