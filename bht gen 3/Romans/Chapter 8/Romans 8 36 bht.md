# Romans 8:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Throughout history, the faithful followers of God have experienced trials and persecution. This is not a new phenomenon, as we see in the lives of God's saints of old. The hatred of righteousness by our enemies knows no bounds, and there is nothing to restrain the persecution that we may face. In fact, the treatment that God's people can expect from their enemies is likened to sheep being led to the slaughter. This continuous martyrdom is vividly described as being slaughtered like sheep all day long. The psalmist's words resonate with the sufferings that Christians in Paul's time endured, and they serve as a reminder that the danger of persecution, even to the point of death, has been a reality for God's people throughout history.
