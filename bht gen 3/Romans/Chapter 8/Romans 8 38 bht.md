## BHT:
I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor any other created thing shall be able to sever us from the love of God.

Neither death, nor any creature beneath the Almighty, can separate us from His love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For I am persuaded...that neither death, nor life...nor any other created thing shall be able to sever us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
2. "Our victory is not only over these things, but I dare assert it over greater and more awful than these."
3. "No vicissitudes of time, no extremes of space, no creature such as are all the things named shall be able to sever us from the love of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers‚Äîwhether good or bad."
2. "nor things present, nor things to come‚Äîno condition of the present life and none of the unknown possibilities of the life to come."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am persuaded - I have a strong and unwavering confidence. Latin Vulgate, 'I am certain.' The expression here implies unwavering certainty." 
2. "Neither death - Neither the fear of death, nor all the pains and tortures of the dying scene, even in the most painful trials of persecution; death in no form."
3. "Nor things present - Calamities and persecutions to which we are now subject. Nor things to come - Trials to which we may be yet exposed. It evinced strong confidence to say that no possible trials should be sufficient to destroy their love for Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Powers [Œ±œÅœáŒ±Œπ] . Angelic, higher than mere angels."
2. "Things present [ŒµŒΩŒµœÉœÑœâœÑŒ±] . Only in Paul and Hebrews 9:9. The verb literally means to stand in sight. Hence to impend or threaten."
3. "Things past are not mentioned, not even sins, for they have passed away."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whatever, he says, there is in life or in death, which seems capable of tearing us away from God, shall effect nothing; nay, the very angels, were they to attempt to overturn this foundation, shall do us no harm." 
2. "The meaning then is, ‚Äî that we ought not to fear, lest the continuance of evils, however long, should obliterate the faith of adoption." 
3. "This declaration is clearly against the schoolmen, who idly talk and say, that no one is certain of final perseverance, except through the gift of special revelation, which they make to be very rare."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Dying or living, we are the objects of this love."
2. "To refer the one term to the former, and the other to the latter, is both abrupt and arbitrary; to leave the evil spirits unnoticed in such a catalogue would seem strange- Hence, we may refer both terms to both classes, in the wide hypothesis the Apostle here conceives."
3. "The first and second terms point to vicissitudes of time, the third to earthly powers of any kind."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am persuaded... The items mentioned are those that people dread."
2. "The items mentioned are those that people dread, covering any omissions."
3. "The items mentioned... any creature to cover any omissions."

### John Gill:
1. "nothing whatever could separate him and the rest of God's people, from his love towards them in Christ Jesus."
2. "the things enumerated, which are not able to separate from the love of God."
3. "death; death separates men from the world, their worldly habitations and substance; it separates the soul from the body, and one friend from another; and in process of time, may take off all thoughts and affections for departed friends, but it is not able to separate from the love of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither death - Terrible as it is to natural men; a violent death in particular." 
2. "Nor height, nor depth ‚Äî The former sentence respected the differences of times; this, the differences of places." 
3. "Nor any creature ‚Äî Nothing beneath the Almighty; visible enemies he does not even deign to name."
