### John Gill:
1. "The wisdom of the flesh, or carnal mindedness, 'is death'; not that it is conversant about death; or that such persons are thoughtful of it, endeavour to make it familiar to them; or are desirous of it, and esteem it as a privilege; this only spiritually minded men do: but the sense is, that this issues in death; death is not the object, but the end of carnal mindedness..."
2. "but spiritually minded men are evidently living persons; they have a spiritual discerning of spiritual things; they breathe after them, savour and relish them; they talk of spiritual things, and walk in a spiritual manner; they are not only alive, but lively in the exercise of grace and discharge of duty; and are the means of enlivening others..."
3. "Peace" also is another effect of spiritual mindedness; such enjoy peace of conscience: this is a fruit of the Spirit; a part of the kingdom of grace the are possessed of; and the things their minds are conversant with are productive of it; which is the gift of God, passes all understanding, and is of more worth than all the world..."

### John Wesley:
1. "But to be spiritually minded - That is, to mind the things of the Spirit. Is life - A sure mark of spiritual life, and the way to life everlasting." 
2. "And attended with peace - The peace of God, which is the foretaste of life everlasting; and peace with God, opposite to the enmity mentioned in the next verse."
3. "Is death - The sure mark of spiritual death, and the way to death everlasting."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The mind of the flesh leads not only to physical death or unhappiness, but to eternal death. On the other hand, the mind of the Spirit is life and peace, a blessed contrast to the tumult of fleshly lusts. Pursuing fleshly ends ultimately leads to the carrying of death into its bosom, causing one to be spiritually dead even while physically alive. To be spiritually minded is to seek the feelings and views produced by the Holy Spirit, and to follow His leadings. It is a pursuit of the graces of the Spirit, the only path to true happiness and life. The carnal mind is characterized by death, while the spiritually minded are alive and lively in the exercise of grace and duty, enjoying the peace of conscience that passes all understanding. This contrast between the mind of the flesh and the mind of the Spirit is a matter of life and death, with the former leading to death and the latter to life everlasting.
