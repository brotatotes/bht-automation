- Attempt 1 BHT: Because the mind of the flesh is in complete opposition to God, there can be no true peace. This state of enmity leads to a complete disregard for God's law, as the carnal mind is incapable of submitting to it. This is evident in the continued insubordination and inability to be subject to God's law. The minding of the flesh is synonymous with death, as it is incompatible with the life and peace that come from the spirit. The enmity against God stemming from the carnal mind is universal and deeply rooted in the human heart. However, there is hope in Christ and the Spirit of life, who can transform this enmity and bring about true obedience to God's law.
