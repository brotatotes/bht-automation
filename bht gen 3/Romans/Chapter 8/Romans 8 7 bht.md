# Romans 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mind of the flesh is enmity against God and does not submit to His law. In this state, there is no subjection to God's law, as actions are not done to purely please Him. This enmity is like a hostile army, continually insubordinate and unable to do otherwise. However, hope lies in Christ and the Spirit of life, as the carnal mind leads to death and hostility against God, which can be reconciled through His power and grace.

1. "The carnal mind, the wisdom of the flesh, is not only an enemy, but enmity itself against God: against his being; it reasons against it; it wishes he was not; it forms unworthy notions of him; thinks him such an one as itself; and endeavours to bury him in forgetfulness, and erase out of its mind all memorials of him..."

3. "The carnal mind is so far from an obedient subjection to the law, that it is far off from the law, and the law from that; it hates and despises it, thwarts and contradicts it in every instance, and, as much as in it lies, makes it void; which fully proves the enmity of the carnal mind against God..."

### John Wesley:
1. Enmity against God â€” His existence, power, and providence.
