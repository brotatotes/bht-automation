# Romans 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those under the control of their sinful nature cannot please God. This refutes the idea that people can obey God's law without the Holy Spirit. Those led by the flesh cannot please God because of the bondage to sin. However, this does not mean that the sinner has no responsibility and cannot be saved. They are responsible and can be saved through a change of heart by the Holy Spirit.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Those who are under the control of their sinful nature, led by their own desires and not by the Spirit of God, are unable to please Him. This passage serves as a strong refutation against the notion that people can obey God's law on their own without the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The mind set on satisfying the desires of the flesh cannot be subject to God's law and therefore falls short of pleasing Him. However, it should be noted that this does not absolve the sinner from responsibility or prevent them from being saved. By having a change of heart through the transformative power of the Holy Spirit, they can still find redemption and restoration with God.
