# Romans 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If you are not under the dominion of your own renewed mind and influenced by the meek, pure, and holy spirit of the Lord Jesus, then you are not in the spirit and belong not to Christ. The dwelling of the Spirit of God in you indicates a mystical union with Christ in the Holy Spirit and serves as evidence that you are a child of God. It is a sharp and solemn statement: if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.
