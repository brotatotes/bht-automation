## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I say the truth in Christâ€”as if steeped in the spirit of Him who wept over impenitent and doomed Jerusalem."
2. "My conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghostâ€”my conscience as quickened, illuminated, and even now under the direct operation of the Holy Ghost."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "In Christ - Most interpreters regard this as a form of an oath, as equivalent to calling Christ to witness. It is certainly to be regarded, in its obvious sense, as an appeal to Christ as the searcher of the heart, and as the judge of falsehood."
2. "Conscience is that act or judgment of the mind by which we decide on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of our actions, and by which we instantly approve or condemn them. It exists in every man, and is a strong witness to our integrity or to our guilt."
3. "In the Holy Ghost - He does not say that he speaks the truth by or in the Holy Spirit, as he had said of Christ; but that the conscience pronounced its concurring testimony by the Holy Spirit; that is, conscience as enlightened and influenced by the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Conscience. See on 1 Peter 3:16."
2. "Bearing me witness. Rev., bearing witness with me. See on ch. Romans 8:16. Concurring with my testimony."
3. "In the Holy Ghost. So Rev. The concurrent testimony of his declaration and of conscience was 'the echo of the voice of God's Holy Spirit' (Morison)."

### John Calvin:
1. "It so happened in this way, â€” Having finished the doctrine he discussed, he turned his attention to the Jews, and being astonished at their unbelief as at something monstrous, he burst forth into this sudden protestation, in the same way as though it was a subject which he had previously handled." 
2. "By this example and the like, (as I reminded you in the first chapter,) we ought to learn that oaths are lawful, that is, when they render that truth credible which is necessary to be known, and which would not be otherwise believed."
3. "It often happens that a person, blinded by the passions of the flesh, (though not purposing to deceive,) knowingly and wilfully obscures the light of truth. But to swear by the name of God, in a proper sense of the word, is to call him as a witness for the purpose of confirming what is doubtful, and at the same time to bind ourselves over to his judgment, in case we say what is false."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I say the truth in Christ."
2. "I lie not."
3. "My conscience also bearing me witness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul really takes a triple oath here so strongly is he stirred."
2. "He makes a positive affirmation in Christ, a negative one (not lying),"
3. "the appeal to his conscience as co-witness 'in the Holy Spirit.'"

### John Gill:
1. "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not."
2. "My conscience bearing me witness."
3. "Here are three witnesses called in, Christ, conscience, and the Holy Ghost."

### John Wesley:
1. In Christ â€” This seems to imply an appeal to him.
In the Holy Ghost â€” Through his grace.
