# Romans 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the case of Rebecca, Jacob was chosen by God over his brother Esau, not due to any reason related to their mother, but solely because of God's unconditional choice. Their different destinies, despite sharing the same parents, show that true succession is determined by divine disposition, not by physical descent. This exemplifies that God's fulfillment of the promise does not extend to all the children of the flesh. It serves as a significant illustration of God's purpose according to election, where He chooses and calls according to His own good pleasure.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In the case of Rebecca, the only reason for the choice of her son Jacob over his brother Esau was the unconditional choice of God. Despite having the same mother and father, their destinies were divinely ordained to be different. This example illustrates that the true succession lies not in physical descent, but in the divine disposal. Just as the distinction among the descendants of Abraham was recognized in the original promise, here we see a stronger proof that God's fulfillment of the promise does not extend to all the children of the flesh. It is clear that God's blessing does not belong to all the descendants, as demonstrated by the case of Jacob and Esau, who were chosen before they had done anything good or evil. This is an example of God's purpose according to election, as He chooses and calls according to His own good pleasure.
