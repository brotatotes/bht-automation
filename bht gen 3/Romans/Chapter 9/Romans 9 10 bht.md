# Romans 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not only do we see the election of one son and the rejection of another, but also the election and rejection of twins from the same mother. The choice of Jacob over Esau was based solely on God's unconditional choice, not their actions. Despite having the same parents, God appointed a different destiny for each of them, showing that true succession is determined by divine appointment, not physical descent. Rebecca's example further emphasizes that God makes distinctions among Abraham's descendants according to His own pleasure and purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not only have we an example of the election of a son of Abraham by one woman, and the rejection of a son by another, but also of election and rejection of the children of the same woman." 
2. "These children by the same father and the same mother, the issue of the same birth,â€”own brothers on both sides, and twins besides, had not the same destiny."
3. "The argument here is to show that not all the children of promise belonged to the election."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "He not only made a distinction between Jacob and Esau, but that he did it according to his good pleasure."
3. "In order to prove that this was done according to his own pleasure, he shows that the distinction was made before they were born."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "But it may be thus supplied, â€” 'and not only so,' i.e., as to the word of promise; 'but Rebecca also had a word,' or a message conveyed to her." 
2. "The three verses may be thus rendered, â€” 'And not only so, but Rebecca also received a message, when she conceived by the first, (i.e., son or seed,) even our father Isaac: for they being not yet born, and having not done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not through works, but through him who calls, it was said to her, 'The elder shall serve the younger.'" 
3. "Isaac was the first son or seed of promise: and a difference was made in the children of the very first seed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These words introduce a second proof from history, namely, the case of Rebecca and her two sons, one of whom was chosen. 'This' is preferable to 'so,' because this case is not strictly of the same kind as that of Sarah, but furnishes a stronger proof."
2. "But Rebecca also. Some explain: not only Sarah, but Rebecca also, had a divine promise, was treated in the same manner. Others find a broken construction, 'Rebecca' being re-introduced in Romans 9:12: 'unto her.' Accepting the latter view, we place a dash at the end of this verse. In any case 'also' points to the previous case of Sarah."
3. "Having conceived by one, our father Isaac. In the previous instance the two children were of two mothers; here the children were twins, having the same father and mother, and yet of such a different destiny. 'Our father Isaac;' recalling the quotation in Romans 9:7."

3. "One father and twins."

### John Gill:
1. "This instance of Ishmael and Isaac... proving that Abraham's natural seed, the children of the flesh, are not all children, the children of God." 
2. "The apostle was aware, that the Jews would be ready to say, that the instance of Ishmael and Isaac was not a pertinent one... he proceeds to mention the case of Jacob and Esau, which was not liable to any such exception."
3. "And yet a difference was made between these two by God himself, and which was notified by him to the mother of them, before either were born."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither were their ancestors accepted through any merit of their own."
2. "Not of works, not for any preceding merit in him he chose."
3. "But of him that called, of his own good pleasure who called to that privilege whom he saw good."

This serves to demonstrate that not all the children of promise are chosen for election. The choice of Jacob over Esau was not based on their deeds, but solely on the unconditional choice of God. Even though they shared the same father and mother, God determined a different destiny for each of them. This highlights that divine appointment, not physical descent, determines true succession. The example of Rebecca and her sons reinforces the principle that God makes distinctions among the descendants of Abraham according to His own pleasure and purpose.
