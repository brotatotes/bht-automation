# Romans 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The purpose of God according to election may abide, not depending on works, but on God's calling. The stability of our election is conveyed in God's unchangeable purpose, which is not founded on right or merit. Our salvation is not contemplated in this matter; it is the part we play from the theocratic standpoint. The foundation of our election lies in the goodness of God alone, with no regard to our works or worthiness. The purpose of God is formed through His selection, not based on any human merit or causes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the purpose of God according to (purposed in pursuance of, or in accordance with, or with reference to His) election may (not might; the purpose is treated as one in all time, which would be nullified if once thwarted) abide (stand firm)"
2. "not depending on works"
3. "but on him that calleth (this is decisive against the Pelagianism of the Romanists, who by making our faith as foreseen by God the cause of our election, affirm it to be dependent on works)"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was laid back of any such character, and therefore had its foundation in the purpose or plan of God."
2. "The purpose of God is antecedent to the formation of character, or the performance of any actions, good or bad."
3. "It is not by the merit of man, but it is by a purpose having its origin with God, and formed and executed according to his good pleasure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Purpose according to election [Œ∑ Œ∫Œ±œÑ ŒµŒ∫ŒªŒøŒ≥Œ∑ŒΩ œÄœÅŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ]... The phrase signifies a purpose so formed that in it an election was made. The opposite of one founded upon right or merit." 
2. "Might stand [ŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑] . Lit., abide, continue: remain unchangeable. This unchangeableness of purpose was conveyed in His declaration to Rebecca. Contrast with come to nought (ver. 6)." 
3. "Calleth [Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒøœÇ] . Eternal salvation is not contemplated. 'The matter in question is the part they play regarded from the theocratic stand-point' (Godet)."

### John Calvin:
1. "In the salvation of the godly nothing higher must be sought than the goodness of God, and nothing higher in the perdition of the reprobate than his just severity."
2. "There is no other basis for this election than the goodness of God alone, and also since the fall of Adam, his mercy; which embraces whom he pleases, without any regard whatever to their works."
3. "We have then the whole stability of our election enclosed in the purpose of God alone: here merits avail nothing, as they issue in nothing but death; no worthiness is regarded, for there is none; but the goodness of God reigns alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole expression involves God‚Äôs freedom in His choice of individuals as an essential part of His purpose of redemption."
2. "It is not only in the thought of man, it is really that the liberty of God would be compromised, if any human merit regulated his choice."
3. "Our salvation is not on account of faith, but through faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The purpose of God (Œ∑ œÄœÅŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÖ). See Romans 8:28 for œÄœÅŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ."
2. "According to election (Œ∫Œ±œÑ' ŒµŒ∫ŒªŒøŒ≥Œ∑ŒΩ). Old word from ŒµŒ∫ŒªŒµŒ≥œâ, to select, to choose out. See 1 Thessalonians 1:4."
3. "Not of works (ŒøœÖŒ∫ ŒµŒæ ŒµœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ). Not of merit."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows, that the apostle designs not the posterity, but the very persons of Jacob and Esau..."
2. "it cannot be said with any propriety, that 'Rebecca conceived' their several offspring 'by one, even by our father Isaac'"
3. "it follows, that works neither good nor evil are the causes moving God to predestinate, whether to life or death"
