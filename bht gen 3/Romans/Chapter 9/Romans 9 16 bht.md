# Romans 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is not of human will or effort, but solely of God's mercy. While inward desire and active effort are necessary for salvation, they do not determine it. God is not obligated by human will or works. Instead, salvation is entirely dependent on God's grace and mercy. The effects of God's Spirit incline the heart toward seeking mercy, and it is God who bestows salvation according to His will. Thus, salvation cannot be earned or achieved through personal striving, but is a result of God's unfathomable kindness and divine choice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "So then (inference from the citation) it is not of (Godâ€™s mercy â€˜does not belong to,â€™â€” â€˜is not in the power ofâ€™) him that willeth (any man willing it), nor yet of him that runneth (any man contending for it)..."
2. "I must also protest against all endeavours to make it appear, that no inference lies from this passage as to the salvation of individuals."
3. "It is in parts of Scripture like this, that we must be especially careful not to fall short of what is written: not to allow of any compromise of the plain and awful words of Godâ€™s Spirit for the sake of a caution which He Himself does not teach us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "So then it is not of him that willethâ€”hath the inward desire."
2. "nor of him that runnethâ€”maketh active effort."
3. "Both these are indispensable to salvation, yet salvation is owing to neither, but is purely 'of God that showeth mercy.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The effect of the influences of Godâ€™s Spirit on the heart is to make it 'willing in the day of his power;'" 
2. "The meaning here is evidently, that eternal life is not bestowed because man had any original willingness or disposition to be saved; it is not because he commences the work, and is himself disposed to it; but it is because God inclines him to it, and disposes him to seek for mercy, and then confers it in his own way."
3. "There is no merit in his anxiety, and prayers, and agony, on account of which God would forgive him; but he is still dependent on the mere mercy of God to save or destroy him at his will."

1. "It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth."
2. "God is laid under no obligation by a human will or a human work."
3. "God is not dependent upon human effort or human exertion."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not then of him who wills, etc. From the testimony adduced he draws this inference, that beyond all controversy our election is not to be ascribed to our diligence, nor to our striving, nor to our efforts, but that it is wholly to be referred to the counsel of God."
2. "Take simply this view of the matter, that it is neither by our will nor efforts...that we are counted among the elect, but that it wholly depends on the divine goodness."
3. "Let us then feel assured that the salvation of those whom God is pleased to save, is thus ascribed to his mercy, that nothing may remain to the contrivance of man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The participation in any and all of the effects of Godâ€™s mercy and compassion, does not depend on human will, nor on human effort, but on the will of God." 
2. "It is in parts of Scripture like this that we must be especially careful not to fall short of what is written." 
3. "The reference of â€˜him that willethâ€™ to Abrahamâ€™s wish respecting Ishmael, and of â€˜him that runnethâ€™ to Esauâ€™s running home from hunting, is worth mentioning as a specimen of farfetched interpretation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mercy is not of."
2. "The articular participles can be understood as in the genitive with mercy understood or as the predicate ablative of source like in 2 Peter 1:20."
3. "Paul is fond of the metaphor of running."

### John Gill:
1. "Election, which is the leading step to salvation, is not owing at all to the will of men, but to the good pleasure and will of God."
2. "Salvation in all its parts and branches...is not to be ascribed at all to the will of men, nor at all to the works of men, but entirely and alone to the love, grace, and mercy of God through Christ."
3. "To give [grace and mercy] to some, and deny it to others, can never be accounted an act of injustice, since he is not bound to give it to any."

### John Wesley:
