## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I may shew forth my power in thee, and that my name may be published abroad in all the earth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God did not make Pharaoh wicked He only forbore to make him good, by the exercise of special and altogether unmerited grace."
2. "It was not that Pharaoh was worse than others that he was so dealt with, but in order that he might become a monument of the penal justice of God."
3. "This is the principle on which all punishment is inflicted, that the true character of the Divine Lawgiver should be known. This is of all objects, where God is concerned, the highest and most important; in itself the most worthy, and in its results the most beneficent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This passage is designed to illustrate the doctrine that God shows mercy according to his sovereign pleasure by a reference to one of the most extraordinary cases of hardness of heart which has ever occurred." 
2. "He did not exert a positive evil influence on the mind of Pharaoh; for, in all this the monarch acted freely. He did what he chose to do. He pursued his own course. He was voluntary in his schemes of oppressing the Israelites. He was voluntary in his opposition to God." 
3. "Neither Pharaoh nor any sinner can justly blame God for placing them in circumstances where they shall develop their own character, and show what they are. It is not the fault of God, but their own fault."

3. "Might be declared... 'Even to the present day, wherever throughout the world Exod. is read, the divine intervention is realized'."

1. "He then takes his proof from Exodus 9:16, where the Lord declares that it was he who raised up Pharaoh for this end, that while he obstinately strove to resist the power of God, he might, by being overcome and subdued, afford a proof how invincible the arm of God is" (299).
2. "It hence follows, that it is in vain to contend with him, as though he were bound to give a reason; for he of himself comes forth before us, and anticipates the objection, by declaring, that the reprobate, through whom he designs his name to be made known, proceed from the hidden fountain of his providence" (299).
3. "Paul, in quoting this passage, Exodus 9:16, substitutes a clause for the first that is given by the Septuagint: instead of '·ºìŒΩŒµŒ∫ŒµŒΩ œÑŒø·ΩªœÑŒø Œ¥ŒπŒµœÑŒ∑œÅ·ΩµŒ∏Œ∑œÇ on this account thou hast been preserved,' he gives, 'Œµ·º∞œÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ω∏ œÑŒø·ø¶œÑŒø ·ºêŒæ·ΩµŒ≥ŒµŒπœÅ·Ω± œÉŒµ ‚Äî for this very end have I raised thee'" (300).

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The choice of an illustration outside the Jewish nation confirms the view that Paul is here concerned with principles of universal application. The case of Pharaoh presents the antithesis to God‚Äôs showing mercy."

### John Gill:
1. "God said to Pharaoh; the testimony here cited, stands in Exodus 9:16; where it is read thus, 'For this cause have I raised thee up', even for this same purpose have I raised thee up."
2. "All the rest may well enough be thought to be comprised in it; as that God ordained and appointed him from eternity, by certain means to this end; that he made him to exist in time, or brought him into being; that he raised him to the throne, promoted him to that high honour and dignity."
3. "The ultimate end which God had in view in this was, that my name might be declared throughout all the earth; that he himself might be glorified, and that the glory of his perfections, particularly of his wisdom, power, and justice, might be celebrated throughout the world."

### John Wesley:
1. "God has an indisputable right to reject those who will not accept the blessings on his own terms."
2. "Unless thou repent, this will surely be the consequence of my raising thee up, making thee a great and glorious king, that my power will be shown upon thee."
