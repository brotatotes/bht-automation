# Romans 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in His sovereignty, extends His mercy to whomever He chooses and hardens those whom He wills. While this may seem puzzling in relation to human responsibility, Christians are to understand that God's forgiveness is based on His free mercy and His judgment by equitable justice through Jesus Christ. The hardening of hearts is the result of God judicially abandoning individuals to the hardening influence of sin and its incentives. This demonstrates God's holiness and His use of wicked men and even Satan to punish and oppose sin.
