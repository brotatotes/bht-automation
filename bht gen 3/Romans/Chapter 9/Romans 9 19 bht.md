- Attempt 1 BHT: Who are we to question God's will and blame Him for our circumstances? Just as a potter has the authority to mold clay into vessels of different purposes, God has the power to choose whom He wills for salvation and honor. The objection to this doctrine arises from a place of irreverence and presumption, as it is not for the creature to question the Creator. While it is true that man may attempt to resist God's will, such resistance cannot be sustained. The objection to God's will is ultimately a refusal to submit to His authority and a denial of His righteousness. Those who resist God's will are not only storming against Him, but they also charge Him with tyranny and cruelty, failing to recognize His justice and righteousness. In their unwillingness to acknowledge God's sovereignty, they blame Him for their own hardened state. However, it is important to remember that it is unreasonable to hold people accountable for being and doing what God Himself wills them to be and do.
