# Romans 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who are we to reply to God, questioning His ways? Can the formed object question its maker, asking why it was created in a particular way? Just as a potter has authority over the clay, God has the power to create vessels for honor or dishonor from the same source. The objection to this doctrine reveals its true nature - it is about election and non-election to eternal salvation before any distinction in personal character. One may resist God's will, but cannot maintain that resistance.

### John Gill:
1. "what as if he should say, is he not content with the injustice he has already exercised, in passing by some, when he chose others; in leaving them to themselves, and hardening their hearts against him, and to go on in their own ways, which must unavoidably end in destruction; but after all this, is angry with them, finds fault with them, blames, accuses, and condemns them, for that which they cannot help? this is downright cruelty and tyranny."
2. "The objector seems to have a particular regard to the case of Pharaoh... and yet he himself had hardened his heart, and continued to harden his heart, that he might not let them go as yet; and when he had let them go, hardened his heart again to pursue after them, when he drowned him and his host in the Red sea; all which in this objection, is represented as unparalleled cruelty and unmercifulness."
3. "This is said in support of the former, and means not God's will of command, which is always resisted more or less, by wicked men and devils; but his will of purpose, his counsels and decrees, which stand firm and sure, and can never be resisted, so as to be frustrated and made void."

### John Wesley:
1. "The particle still is strongly expressive of the objector's sour, morose murmuring."
2. "The word his likewise expresses his surliness and aversion to God, whom he does not even deign to name."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Who are we, mere creatures, to question or challenge the ways of God? Can the creation presume to question its Creator, asking why it was made one way and not another? Just as a potter has power over the clay to shape vessels for different purposes, God has the right to choose whom He will honor and whom He will not. Some may object to this notion of God's election, but it is a presumptuous and irreverent act to oppose the will of the Almighty. While individuals may resist God's will, ultimately their resistance is futile. The question then becomes, who can truly stand against Him? It is a futile endeavor to go against God's purpose, and those who do so only find themselves blaming and resisting the one who has ultimate authority.
