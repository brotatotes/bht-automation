This sorrow is not just a simple sadness, but a consuming pain that devours him. It can be compared to the grief of a Jew witnessing the fall of Jerusalem. The cause of this immense grief is the unbelief of his fellow countrymen and their hostile rejection of the Gospel. Despite recognizing that their perdition is part of God's will, the author still deeply mourns their destruction. This sorrow does not contradict the obedience to God's providence but rather demonstrates the compassionate heart of a believer. It is not driven by prejudice, but by a genuine desire for their salvation. Thus, the author's sorrow and grief reflect a profound empathy even in the face of God's just judgment.",
