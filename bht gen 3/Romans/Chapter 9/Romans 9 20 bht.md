- Attempt 1 BHT: Why do you, mere mortal, dare to argue with God? Shall the created question the Creator, asking why they were made a certain way?

Like a potter, He takes the clay as He finds it and shapes it according to His purpose. So, instead of questioning God, humbly submit to His sovereignty and trust in His infinite wisdom, for He knows what is best for His creation.
