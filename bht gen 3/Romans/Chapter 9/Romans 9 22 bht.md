## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What if God, in the case of the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, has, in willing to manifest His power and wrath, also exhibited towards them longsuffering... and in having mercy on the vessels of mercy prepared for glory, has also made manifest the riches of His glory?"
2. "Then in both these dispensations will appear, not the arbitrary power, but the rich goodness of God."
3. "Vessels of wrath and vessels of mercy are vessels prepared to subserve, as it were to hold, His wrath and mercy: hardly, as Calvin, instruments to shew them forth: that is done, over and above their being vessels, but is not necessary to it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What if God, willing to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath..."
2. "It is well remarked by STUART that the 'difficulties which such statements involve are not to be got rid of by softening the language of one text, while so many others meet us which are of the same tenor.'"
3. "Yet, even in the necessary punishment of the wicked, as HODGE observes, so far from proceeding with undue severity, the apostle would have it remarked that God 'endures with much long-suffering' those objects of His righteous displeasure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Referring not to the determinate purpose of God, but to His spontaneous will growing out of His holy character."
2. "Fitted [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑œÅœÑŒπœÉŒºŒµŒΩŒ±] . Lit., adjusted. Not fitted by God for destruction, but in an adjectival sense, ready, ripe for destruction."
3. "The apostle has probably chosen this form because the being ready certainly arises from a continual reciprocal action between human sin and the divine judgment of blindness and hardness."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not indeed give a reason for divine election, so as to assign a cause why this man is chosen and that man rejected; for it was not meet that the things contained in the secret counsel of God should be subjected to the judgment of men; and, besides, this mystery is inexplicable."
2. "He yet shows, that as far as God‚Äôs predestination manifests itself, it appears perfectly just."
3. "Whatever way may be adopted, the sense is materially the same. It has also been suggested thatŒµ·º∞ Œ¥·Ω≤ is for Œµ·º¥œÄŒµœÅ, since, seeing, 2 Thessalonians 1:6; 1 Peter 2:3. In this case no apodosis is necessary."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But what will be said, if, as is the case, God, etc. ‚ÄòBut‚Äô thus introduces an additional thought, which forms the main answer to the objection."
2. "This peculiar expression, meaning ‚Äòwhat is possible to him,‚Äô suits the view we take of ‚Äòwilling.‚Äô"
3. "Probably the mediate agency of God is not to be excluded, but the obvious differences between the two phrases (‚Äòfitted for destruction‚Äô and ‚Äòwhich He before prepared for glory') point unmistakably to such a difference as should guard the passage against fatalistic interpretations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Although willing, [God] endured with much long-suffering." 
2. "Vessels of wrath, the objects of God's wrath." 
3. "Endless perdition, not annihilation."

### John Gill:
1. "In this verse, the apostle considers the conduct of God towards the vessels of dishonour; and let it be observed, that these are called vessels of wrath fitted for destruction..."
2. "...they may be so called, being as vessels filled with his wrath; as such who are the instruments and executioners of his wrath are called..."
3. "...by themselves, by their own wickedness, hardness of heart, and impenitence do they treasure up to themselves wrath, against the day of wrath, so that their destruction is of themselves..."

### John Wesley:
1. "What if God, being willing... To show his wrath - Which necessarily presupposes sin." 
2. "And to make his power known... Yet endured... With much longsuffering." 
3. "The vessels of wrath... Fitted for destruction - By their own wilful and final impenitence. Is there any injustice in this?"
