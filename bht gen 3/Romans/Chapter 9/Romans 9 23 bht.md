### John Calvin:
1. "The second reason which manifests the glory of God in the destruction of the reprobate, because the greatness of divine mercy towards the elect is hereby more clearly made known."
2. "It cannot then be but that the infinite mercy of God towards the elect must appear increasingly worthy of praise, when we see how miserable are all they who escape not his wrath."

3. "For glory. The end of the preparation is the possession of the full and eternal glory of the kingdom of heaven."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Afore prepared (œÄœÅŒøŒ∑œÑŒøŒπŒºŒ±œÉŒµŒΩ). First aorist active indicative of œÄœÅŒøŒµœÑŒøŒπŒºŒ±Œ∂œâ, old verb to make ready (from ŒµœÑŒøŒπŒºŒøœÇ, ready) and œÄœÅŒø, before, in N.T. only here and Ephesians 2:10."

2. "...but because God of his infinite goodness fills them with his mercy, displays it in them, in the redemption of them by his Son, in the regeneration of them by his Spirit, and in their eternal salvation..."
3. "The whole of his conduct is free from blame and censure; the vessels of wrath he shows his wrath upon, are such as fit themselves for destruction, and whom he endures with much longsuffering and patience, and therefore he cannot be chargeable with cruelty..."

### John Wesley:
1. "What if by showing such longsuffering even to 'the vessels of wrath,' he did the more abundantly show the greatness of his glorious goodness, wisdom, and power, on the vessels of mercy."
