## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine was, (2)That he was bound by no promise and no principle of obligation to bestow salvation on all the Jews."
2. "That, therefore, it was right for him to reject any or all of the Jews, if he chose, and cut them off from their privileges as a people and from salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle uses the LXX. equivalent of these names (â€˜not belovedâ€™ for Lo-Ruhamahâ€™), inverting the order, to emphasize the thought â€˜not my people,â€™ which was prominent in his mind."
2. "'I will callâ€™ is substituted for â€˜I will say to,â€™ without altering the sense, forâ€™ callingâ€™ here means to â€˜name,â€™ as do the words of the original prophecy."
3. "But undoubtedly the Apostle in this application had in mind the calling of the Gentiles to salvation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "ÎŸ Î¿Ï… Î»Î±Î¿Ï‚ Î¼Î¿Ï… 'the not people of mine.' ÎŸÏ… with substantives obliterates the meaning of the substantive..." 
2. "The use of Î¿Ï…Îº with the perfect passive participle is emphatic, since Î¼Î· is the usual negative of the participle in the Koine." 
3. "The LXX rendering of Lo-ruhamah (not mercy, without mercy or love), name of Hosea's daughter."

### John Gill:
1. "His calling them his people, is his acquainting them with their relation to him, which he had taken them in to himself, of his own grace."

3. "The loving kindness of God is let down into their hearts in the effectual calling, and with it he draws them to himself, as a fruit and evidence of his everlasting and unchangeable love to them."

### John Wesley:
