## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The consummation (or consumption) decided, overfloweth with righteousness: for a decision (or consumption) and a decree shall the Lord Jehovah of Sabaoth make in the midst of all the land."
2. "The Lord will complete and soon fulfil His word in righteousness (viz. his denunciation of consuming the Assyrian and liberating the remnant of His people): for the Lord will make a rapidly-accomplished word in the midst of all the land."
3. "This verse is adduced by the Apostle as confirming the certainty of the salvation of the remnant of Israel, seeing that now, as then, He with whom a thousand years are as a day, will swiftly accomplish His prophetic word in righteousness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness." 
2. "A short work will the Lord make upon the earth." 
3. "The 'short reckoning' seems to mean the speedy completing of His word, both in cutting off the one portion and saving the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Lord will execute His word upon the earth, finishing and cutting it short." 
2. "Work [Î»Î¿Î³Î¿Î½] . It does not mean work, but word, utterance, doctrine; not decree."
3. "Finish - cut short [ÏƒÏ…Î½Ï„ÎµÎ»Ï‰Î½ - ÏƒÏ…Î½Ï„ÎµÎ¼Î½Ï‰Î½] . The preposition sun together signifies summarily; bringing to an end at the same time."

### John Calvin:
1. "The few who shall remain from the consumption shall be a proof of the work of Godâ€™s righteousness."
2. "The residue may seem as it were a consumption, that is, may have the appearance and the vestige of a very great ruin."
3. "For completed and soon executed shall it be; The Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall do it, In the midst of the whole land."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Finishing and cutting short his word, not, â€˜work,â€™ as in the E. V. The Greek word has been rendered â€˜decree,â€™ to correspond more closely with the Hebrew, but this is not its meaning, though the idea of such a decree underlies Paulâ€™s use of the passage."
2. "The question is whether the LXX. has varied from the meaning of the original prophecy as well as from its form. We think that the LXX., especially as here applied by the Apostle, has preserved most fully the thought of the original prophecy, in fact conveying it to the mind of a reader familiar with Greek more clearly than could have been done by a literal rendering of the Hebrew."
3. "While the original reference was to the Jews in the time of Isaiah, the Apostle here makes a prophecy of more general validity, applying it to the sad fact, discussed in this part of the Epistle, that most of the Jews were cut off, but including the other fact that the remnant should be saved."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Finishing it and cutting it short (ÏƒÏ…Î½Ï„ÎµÎ»Ï‰Î½ ÎºÎ± ÏƒÏ…Î½Ï„ÎµÎ¼Î½Ï‰Î½)." 
2. "Present active participles and note ÏƒÏ…Î½- with each (perfective use of the preposition, finishing completely as in Luke 4:13, cutting off completely or abridging and here only in N.T.)" 
3. "The quotation is from Isaiah 28:22."

### John Gill:
1. "For he will finish the work,...." 
2. "The words...contain a most strong and invincible reason, why the remnant shall be saved; because God has made an absolute decree, concerning the salvation of it, which he will accomplish in the fullest manner, agreeably to his justice and holiness." 
3. "Hence as the decree of election stands firm and sure, not upon the works of men, but upon the absolute, sovereign, and efficacious will of God; so the salvation of his chosen people is not precarious, but a most sure and certain thing."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is finishing or cutting short his account." 
2. "In rigorous justice, will leave but a small remnant." 
3. "There will be so general a destruction, that but a small number will escape."
