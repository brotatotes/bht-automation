He expresses this wish passionately, emphasizing how his whole being is consumed by the salvation of his fellow countrymen. This selfless devotion reflects the highest form of love and exemplifies Paul's deep longing for the salvation of his nation, even to the extent of being accursed from Christ if it meant their deliverance.",

It is the expression of an affectionate and self-denying heart, willing to surrender all things, even, if it might be so, eternal glory itself, if thereby he could obtain for his beloved people those blessings of the Gospel which he now enjoyed, but from which they were excluded.\" ",
            "The sense of the imperfect tense in such expressions is the proper and strict one,\u2014and no new discovery, but common enough in every schoolboy\u2019s reading: the act is unfinished, an obstacle intervening.",
            "Attempts have been made to explain away the meaning here, by understanding excommunication; or even natural death only: but excommunication included cursing and delivering over to Satan:\u2014and the mere wish for natural death would, as Chrysostom eloquently remarks, be altogether beneath the dignity of the passage."

            "To explain away the wish here expressed, as too strong for any Christian to utter or conceive, some have rendered the opening words, 'I did wish,' referring it to his former unenlightened state; a sense of the words too tame to be endured.",
            "But our version gives the true import of the original; and if it be understood as the language rather of 'strong and indistinct emotions than of definite ideas,' expressing passionately how he felt his whole being swallowed up in the salvation of his people, the difficulty will vanish.",

            "The word rendered 'accursed' (anathema) properly means,... a devotion of any thing to destruction, or to complete ruin... 'I could be willing to be destroyed, or devoted, to death, for the sake of my countrymen.'",
            "He was willing to be devoted by Christ; that is, to be regarded by him, and appointed by him, to suffering and death, if by that means he could save his countrymen. It was thus the highest expression of true patriotism and benevolence."

            "I could wish that my dear Lord and Master, as if he should say, would appoint and order me to die, might this nation of mine but escape that ruin and destruction I see is coming upon them, as a nation and a church; I could be content to die the most accursed death, and be treated in the most ignominious manner, might they but be saved.",
            "For a man to die for his country, that a whole nation perish not, was agreeably to the sentiments both of Jews and Gentiles, and was the highest instance of love among men; 'greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'"

He is willing to give up everything, even forfeit his own eternal glory, if it would mean that they could experience the blessings of the Gospel that he now enjoys. His desire is not to be seen as inconsistent in loving his people more than his Savior, but rather as a selfless expression of his heart, focused on the salvation of his beloved nation. Paul's wish goes beyond mere excommunication or natural death; it is an expression of his fervent love and longing for their salvation. His willingness to endure such sacrifice echoes Moses' similar sentiment, and highlights the depth of Paul's devotion to his people. Though the full comprehension of this love may be beyond our finite understanding, it showcases the profound impact of salvation and the lengths one would go to see others saved.",
