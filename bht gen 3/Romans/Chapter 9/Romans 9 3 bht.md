## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The wish is evidently not to be pressed as entailing on the Apostle the charge of inconsistency in loving his nation more than his Saviour. It is the expression of an affectionate and self-denying heart, willing to surrender all things, even, if it might be so, eternal glory itself, if thereby he could obtain for his beloved people those blessings of the Gospel which he now enjoyed, but from which they were excluded." 
2. "The sense of the imperfect tense in such expressions is the proper and strict one,‚Äîand no new discovery, but common enough in every schoolboy‚Äôs reading: the act is unfinished, an obstacle intervening."
3. "Attempts have been made to explain away the meaning here, by understanding excommunication; or even natural death only: but excommunication included cursing and delivering over to Satan:‚Äîand the mere wish for natural death would, as Chrysostom eloquently remarks, be altogether beneath the dignity of the passage."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To explain away the wish here expressed, as too strong for any Christian to utter or conceive, some have rendered the opening words, 'I did wish,' referring it to his former unenlightened state; a sense of the words too tame to be endured."
2. "But our version gives the true import of the original; and if it be understood as the language rather of 'strong and indistinct emotions than of definite ideas,' expressing passionately how he felt his whole being swallowed up in the salvation of his people, the difficulty will vanish."
3. "We shall be reminded of the similar idea so nobly expressed by Moses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I could desire Œ∑ÃìœÖœáŒøÃÅŒºŒ∑ŒΩ eÃÑuchomeÃÑn, implying that he was willing now to endure it; that his present love for them was so strong, that he would, if practicable, save them from the threatened ruin and apostasy."
2. "The word rendered 'accursed' (anathema) properly means,... a devotion of any thing to destruction, or to complete ruin... 'I could be willing to be destroyed, or devoted, to death, for the sake of my countrymen.'"
3. "He was willing to be devoted by Christ; that is, to be regarded by him, and appointed by him, to suffering and death, if by that means he could save his countrymen. It was thus the highest expression of true patriotism and benevolence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul would wish to save his countrymen, even at such sacrifice, if it were morally possible."
2. "An expression of deep devotion."
3. "For our limited reason does not grasp it, as the child cannot comprehend the courage of warriors."

### John Calvin:
1. "For I could wish, etc. He could not have expressed a greater ardour of love than by what he testifies here; for that is surely perfect love which refuses not to die for the salvation of a friend."
2. "But I connect the love of men with a zeal for God‚Äôs glory."
3. "It was not therefore a simple and exclusive regard for men: for though it is better that one member should perish than the whole body; it was yet for this reason that Paul had such a high regard for the Jews, because he viewed them as bearing the character, and, as they commonly say, the quality of an elect people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I could wish that I myself were devoted to destruction from Christ for the sake of my brethren."
2. "The Apostle, however, is not using a hyperbole, nor is his language a senseless straining of the idea of self denial."
3. "It is the expression of an affectionate and self-denying heart, willing to surrender all things even, if it might be so, eternal glory itself if thereby he could obtain for his beloved people those blessings of the gospel which he now enjoyed, but from which they were excluded."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I could wish (Œ∑œÖœáŒøŒºŒ∑ŒΩ). Idiomatic imperfect, 'I was on the point of wishing.'"
2. "He is shut up to the imperfect indicative."
3. "According to the flesh (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫Œ±). As distinguished from Paul's Christian brethren."

### John Gill:
1. "He saw that these branches, the people of the Jews, were going to be cut off, and no longer to be of the church of God; and such was his affection to them, that he could have wished rather to be cut off himself, that they might be spared; and this was an instance of great love to them, since, next to Christ, the church and the ordinances of it were exceeding dear unto, and highly valued by the apostle."
2. "I could wish that my dear Lord and Master, as if he should say, would appoint and order me to die, might this nation of mine but escape that ruin and destruction I see is coming upon them, as a nation and a church; I could be content to die the most accursed death, and be treated in the most ignominious manner, might they but be saved."
3. "For a man to die for his country, that a whole nation perish not, was agreeably to the sentiments both of Jews and Gentiles, and was the highest instance of love among men; 'greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "I could wish to suffer in their stead; yea, to be an anathema from Christ in their place." 
2. "In how high a sense he wished this, who can tell, unless himself had been asked and had resolved the question?" 
3. "Certainly he did not then consider himself at all, but only others and the glory of God."
