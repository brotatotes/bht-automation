# Romans 9:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The surprising result is that the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have attained the righteousness of faith through embracing the Gospel. This attainment is not their own righteousness from works, but the righteousness of Christ that they have comprehended through the light of faith. The calling of the Gentiles solely depends on the Lord's mercy and grace, not on their own worthiness. In contrast, Israel, despite their pursuit of the law of righteousness, have not attained the law of righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What now is the result of the whole? The result is thisâ€”very different from what one would have expected."
2. "The Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness of faith."
3. "The Gentiles, who while strangers to Christ were quite indifferent about acceptance with God, having embraced the Gospel as soon as it was preached to them, experienced the blessedness of a justified state."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Gentiles...had actually embraced the righteousness of faith."
2. "The prevailing characteristic among [the Gentiles] was that they did not follow after righteousness."
3. "The gospel finds more obstacles among some people than among others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Attained [ÎºÎ±Ï„ÎµÎ»Î±Î²ÎµÎ½]. The meaning is substantially the same, only the imagery in the two words differs; the former being that of laying hold of a prize, and the latter of arriving at a goal." 
2. "The latter is appropriate to following after, and is carried out in stumbling (ver. 32)."
3. "Even [Î´Îµ] or and that. Subjoining something distinct and different from what precedes, though not sharply opposed to it. Attained righteousness, that is not that arising from these works, but from faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "That the Gentiles who did not pursue, etc. Nothing appeared more unreasonable, or less befitting, than that the Gentiles, who, having no concern for righteousness, rolled themselves in the lasciviousness of their flesh, should be called to partake of salvation, and to obtain righteousness..."
2. "Paul brings forward this, which was so singular a paradox, in such a manner, that by adding a reason he softens whatever asperity there might be in it; for he says, that the righteousness which the Gentiles attained was by faith; and that it hence depends on the Lordâ€™s mercy, and not on manâ€™s own worthiness..."
3. "But in the first clause it was the Apostleâ€™s object to exalt the grace of God alone, that no other reason might be sought for in the calling of the Gentiles but this, â€” that he deigned to embrace them when unworthy of his favor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The article is wanting; what is affirmed is true of Gentiles, but not of the Gentiles as a whole."
2. "While this word does not mean â€˜justification,â€™ we need not give it here a purely ethical sense..."
3. "The peculiar form of the original suggests that this is the true righteousness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Attained (ÎºÎ±Ï„ÎµÎ»Î±Î²ÎµÎ½). Second aorist active indicative of ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î±Î½Ï‰, old verb, to grasp, to seize, to overtake (carrying out the figure in Î´Î¹Ï‰ÎºÏ‰ (to pursue). It was a curious paradox."
2. "Which is of faith (Ï„Î·Î½ ÎµÎº Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„ÎµÏ‰Ï‚). As Paul has repeatedly shown, the only way to get the God-kind of righteousness."

### John Gill:
1. "The very same persons among them, who are called by grace, and are vessels of mercy, before their calling were without a righteousness, stout hearted, and far from one."
2. "The righteousness they attained unto, was not a righteousness of their own, not the righteousness of works, or a righteousness by the deeds of the law, to which the righteousness which is of faith is always opposed; nor faith itself, which is distinguished from it; but the righteousness of Christ."
3. "These Gentiles being called by grace, 'attained', 'comprehended', or 'apprehended' this righteousness; not by the light of nature, which makes no discovery, nor gives the least hint of it; but by the light of faith they apprehended it, as revealed in the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "What is to be concluded from all that has been said but this, That the gentiles, who followed not after righteousness...Have attained to righteousness." 
2. "Even the righteousness which is by faith." 
3. "Israel...Although following after the law of righteousness...Have not attained to the law of righteousness."
