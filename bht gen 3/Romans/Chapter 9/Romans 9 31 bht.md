# Romans 9:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews in their pursuit of righteousness hoped to achieve it through the observance of the law. However, they failed to understand that true justification came through faith, not by their own efforts. Their offense at Christ caused them to stumble instead of embracing the righteousness offered through him. In contrast, the Gentiles, who did not strive to attain righteousness, obtained it through faith. Merely conforming externally to the law was insufficient; they needed to grasp its spiritual demands for truth and holiness within.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews followed after, aimed at the fulfilment of â€˜the law of righteousness,â€™ thinking by the observance of that law to acquire righteousness."
2. "They stumbled at the stone of stumbling."
3. "There is a close analogy between our text and the exhortation in Heb. xii 1 f. There, after the triumphs of faith have been related, we are exhorted to run with patience the race set before us, looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Israel, though sincerely and steadily aiming at acceptance with God, nevertheless missed it."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "All similar experiments must fail, and that none now can be justified by the Law."
3. "Man must come as a poor, lost, ruined sinner, and throw himself upon the mere mercy of God in Christ for justification and life."

### John Calvin:
1. "That Israel, depending on the righteousness of the law, even that which is prescribed in the law, did not understand the true method of justification."
2. "But there is a striking contrast in the expression, when he teaches us that the legal righteousness was the cause that they had fallen away from the law of righteousness."
3. "The Gentiles did not run at all, but the Jews did, and in running, they stumbled; while the Gentiles reached the goal, not by running, or by their own efforts, but by faith, and laid hold on the prize of righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They arrived at the letter, but not at the meaning of the Holy Spirit, for the law, rightly understood, would have led them to Christ."
2. "Had they started from faith in their striving, they would have obtained in Christianity the realization of their endeavor."
3. "Offence at Christ is culpable; it is taken, not given."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Legal righteousness Israel failed to reach, because to do that one had to keep perfectly all the law."

1. "The Israelites, the far greater part of the Jews, who were not called by the grace of God, were all very zealous of the law, called 'the law of righteousness'; because the matter of it was righteous, it was so in its own nature."
2. "They very violently and eagerly pursued after it, they tugged and toiled, and laboured with all their might, as persons in running a race, to get up to the law, and the righteousness of it."
3. "Some of them fancied they had, supposing an external conformity to it, to be all that it insisted upon; not knowing the spirituality of it, that it required truth and holiness in the inward parts."
