## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were‚Äîrather simply, 'as' by the works of the law‚Äîas if it were thus attainable, which justification is not: Since, therefore, it is attainable only by faith, they missed it."
2. "They stumbled at that stumbling-stone‚Äîbetter, 'against the stone of stumbling,' meaning Christ."
3. "But in this they only did."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They sought it not by faith...They depended on their own righteousness, and not on the mercy of God to be obtained by faith."
2. "The sacrifices had reference to a future state of things, and were doubtless so understood."
3. "That was the rejection and the crucifixion of their own Messiah; their unwillingness to be saved by him; their contempt of him and his message."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In their foolish course Israel thought they were advancing on a clear path, and lo! all at once there was found in this way an obstacle upon which they were broken..." (Godet).
2. "...this obstacle was the very Messiah whom they had so long invoked in all their prayers" (Godet).
3. "They stumbled" (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒµŒ∫ŒøœàŒ±ŒΩ) (Godet).

### John Calvin:
1. "They are deservedly rejected, who attempt to attain salvation by trusting in their own works; for they, as far as they can, abolish faith, without which no salvation can be expected."
2. "Whosoever obtrudes on God the righteousness of works, attempts to rob him of his own office."
3. "When we claim for ourselves any righteousness we in a manner contend with the power of Christ; for his office is no less to beat down all the pride of the flesh, than to relieve and comfort those who labour and are wearied under their burden."

### John Gill:
1. "...because, as they did not seek for righteousness in a right place, or object, they sought for it in the law, and the works of it, where it is never to be found by a sinful creature, and not in Christ, in whom only are righteousness and strength..."
2. "...they sought it as if they expected their justification before God was to be by works of righteousness done by them; or as if it was partly by their own works, and partly by the goodness of God, accepting of them for a justifying righteousness."
3. "...meaning the word of the Gospel, at which Peter says they stumbled, and particularly the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ; or rather Christ himself, who was 'to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Is it because God eternally decreed they should not?"
2. "Because they sought it not by faith - whereby alone it could be attained."
3. "For they stumbled at that stumblingstone ‚Äî Christ crucified."
