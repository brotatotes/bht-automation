## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The 'stone of stumbling and rock of offence,' mentioned ch. viii. 14, is substituted for the 'cornerstone elect, precious,' of ch. xxviii. 16."
2. "What was there then to prevent the Apostle from giving to this Stone, plainly foretold as to be laid in Zion, that designation which prophecy also justifies, and which bears immediately on the matter here in hand?"
3. "Shall not be put to shame seems to he a secondary meaning of the Hebrew word, which signifies, as in our version of Isa. xxviii. 16, 'shall not make haste: i.e. shall not fly in terror, shall not be confounded."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To belong to the visible Church of God, and enjoy its high and holy distinctions, is of the sovereign mercy of God, and should be regarded with devout thankfulness."
2. "Yet the most sacred external distinctions and privileges will avail nothing to salvation without the heart's submission to the righteousness of God."
3. "On all subjects which from their very nature lie beyond human comprehension, it will be our wisdom to set down what God says in His word, and has actually done in His procedure towards men, as indisputable, even though it contradict the results at which in the best exercise of our limited judgment we may have arrived."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is called rock of stumbling, not because it was the design of sending him that people should fall, but because such would be the result."
2. "The man who believes shall not be agitated, or thrown into commotion, by fear of want or success: shall not be disappointed in his hopes; and, of course, he shall never be ashamed that he became a Christian."
3. "The fact that the gospel has been extended to all nations, is proof that it is from heaven. To a Jew there was no motive to attempt to break down all the existing institutions of his nation, and make the blessings of religion common to all nations, unless he knew that the gospel system was true."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Offense [ÏƒÎºÎ±Î½Î´Î±Î»Î¿Ï…] . See on Matthew 5:29; Matthew 16:9 Matthew 16:3. 
Shall not be ashamed [Î¿Ï… ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î¹ÏƒÏ‡Ï…Î½Î¸Î·ÏƒÎµÏ„Î±Î¹] . The Hebrew in Isaiah 28:16 is, shall not make haste, or flee hastily. The quotation combines Isaiah 8:4 and Isaiah 28:16. 


### John Calvin:
1. "Because Christ is called the stone of stumbling, there is no reason that we should dread him, or entertain fear instead of confidence; for he is appointed for ruin to the unbelieving, but for life and resurrection to the godly."
2. "He is a firm stone, precious, a corner-stone, most firmly fixed, and whosoever builds on it shall never fall."
3. "By putting shall not be ashamed instead of shall not hasten or fall, he has followed the Greek Translator. It is indeed certain that the Lord in that passage intended to strengthen the hope of His people: and when the Lord bids us to entertain good hope, it hence follows that we cannot be ashamed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stone of stumbling, etc. In Isaiah 8:14, God Himself is represented as being â€˜for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offenceâ€™ to His enemies."
2. "He who believeth on him, etc. In chap. Romans 10:11 this clause is introduced again, but there â€˜every oneâ€™ (E. V. incorrectly: â€˜whosoeverâ€™) occurs, which is to be omitted here, according to the best authorities. In the LXX. it is not found; nor could it be emphatic here, since the antithesis to â€˜stumbledâ€™ makes â€˜believethâ€™ the prominent word."
3. "Shall not be put to shame. The Hebrew is: â€˜shall not make haste,â€™ or, â€˜flee hastily,â€™ with a primary reference to escaping from danger, but the LXX., from which Paul varies very slightly, gives the meaning with substantial correctness (comp. â€˜confoundedâ€™ in the margin of the E. V.). This negative promise is rightly regarded as implying a positive blessing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A rock of offense, a rock which the Jews made a cause of stumbling."
2. "Shall not make haste" (Hebrew meaning), rather than "shall not be put to shame."
3. "Either Peter had read Romans or both Paul and Peter had a copy of Christian Testimonia like Cyprian's later."

### John Gill:
1. "The layer of this stone is God the Father, who laid him as the foundation stone, in his eternal purposes and decrees, in his counsels and covenant, in promise and in prophecy."
2. "He shall neither be ashamed of his faith and hope in Christ; nor of Christ, as the Lord his righteousness; nor shall he be ashamed or confounded at his appearing, but shall be justified before men and angels, and be received into his kingdom and glory."
3. "He that is afraid runs about here and there, and at length is put to shame and confusion."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold, I lay in Sion - I exhibit in my church, what, though it is in truth the only sure foundation of happiness, yet will be in fact a stumblingstone and rock of offense."
2. "An occasion of ruin to many, through their obstinate unbelief."
3. "Though it is in truth the only sure foundation of happiness."
