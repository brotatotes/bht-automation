## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Who are Israelites (a name of honour, see John i. 47; 2 Cor. xi. 22; Phil. iii. 5); whose (is) the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service, and the promises."
2. "God over all, blessed for ever."
3. "From them sprung, according to the flesh, He who is God over all, blessed for ever."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Compared with the state of the surrounding heathen, the choice of Abraham and his seed was a real separation of them to be a Family of God."
2. "This was what the Jews called the 'Shekinah.'"
3. "The great Abrahamic promises, successively unfolded, and which had their fulfilment only in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who are Israelites - Descended from Israel, or Jacob; honored by having such an ancestor, and by bearing a name so distinguished as that of his descendants."
2. "The adoption - Of the nation into the family of God, or to be regarded as His special people; Deuteronomy 7:6."
3. "And the promises - Of the Messiah; and of the spread of the true religion from them as a nation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Israel is always represented as the Lord's son or first-born among all peoples."
2. "Not the final glory of God's kingdom; for this belongs to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews."
3. "The collective messianic promises on which the covenants were based."

### John Calvin:
1. "But Paul continued justly to respect them, that he might teach us that the ungodly cannot so contaminate the good endowments of God, but that they always deserve to be praised and admired."
2. "The whole drift of Paul’s discourse is to this purpose, — that though the Jews by their defection had produced an ungodly divorce between God and themselves, yet the light of God’s favor was not wholly extinguished."
3. "For the Lord, passing by other nations, had selected them as a people peculiar to himself, and had adopted them as his children, as he often testifies by Moses and the prophets."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Israelites, belonging to God’s chosen people. In Romans 9:3 it is stated that they are Paul’s people, but he loved them all the more because they were God’s people, descendants of one whom God himself had chosen and named." 
2. "Six privileges of the Jews are enumerated in the remainder of this verse: ‘purely sacred, historical divine benefactions’ (Meyer). The first is ‘adoption,’ not in the full New Testament sense (comp. Romans 9:6-7), but in the theocratic sense pointing forward to the close union between God and men formed by Christ the only begotten, through the Holy Ghost."
3. "This includes all the promises made to the chosen people, from the days of Abraham onward. This inclusive term prepares for the next clause."

3. "The patriarchs (Acts 3:13; Acts 7:32)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that special adoption, which springs from eternal predestination, is a blessing of the covenant of grace, comes through the redemption of Christ, and is received and enjoyed only by believers in him; for all that were Israelites, were not in this sense the children of God; but national adoption is here meant, by which the whole body of the people, as nation, were the sons of God, his firstborn." 
2. "And the giving, of the law: a way of speaking the Jews make use of when they take notice of this privilege; for it was peculiarly given to them with great solemnity by God himself, through the disposition of angels into the hands of Moses the mediator, and by him to them."
3. "And the promises both temporal and spiritual, especially such as related to the Messiah, and which now had their accomplishment."

### John Wesley:
1. "Israel is the first-born child of God, and the God of glory is their God." 
2. "God himself is 'the glory of his people Israel.'"
3. "The true way of worshipping God; and all the promises made to the fathers."
