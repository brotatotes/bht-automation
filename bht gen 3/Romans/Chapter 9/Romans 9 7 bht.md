# Romans 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In regard to Abraham's descendants, not all are considered true children who inherit the promise. The call for Abraham's seed to be named in Isaac reveals that physical lineage alone does not determine the true election. This distinction is demonstrated by the exclusion of Ishmael and other descendants from receiving the promise. The true children of Abraham are those unconditionally chosen by God. Hence, bodily descent is not what establishes true sonship with Abraham, but rather God's sovereign choice.
