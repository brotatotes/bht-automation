# Romans 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The true children and heirs of the promise are not determined by physical lineage alone, not all physical descendants of Abraham are his true children. Only those who are descended from Isaac, not Ishmael or any other son, can be called the true seed of Abraham for the purposes of the covenant. The election and true sonship of Abraham's seed are not based on mere fleshly descent, but on God's unconditional choice. In Isaac, the true descendants of Abraham are recognized, as God had promised.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not in the line of mere fleshly descent from Abraham does the election run; else Ishmael, Hagar's child, and even Keturah's children, would be included, which they were not."
2. "the true election are such of Abraham's seed as God unconditionally chooses, as exemplified in that promise."
3. "in Isaac shall thy seed be called" (Genesis 21:12).

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "The hidden election of God overrules the outward calling, and...tends to its confirmation and completion."
2. "For if there ought to have been any natural progeny, which fell not away from the covenant; this ought to have been especially the case with those who obtained the privilege at first."
3. "It hence follows, that some men are by special privilege elected out of the chosen people, in whom the common adoption becomes efficacious and valid."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Neither; 'and also not,' extending the same thought to physical relationship with Abraham, the father of the faithful."
2. "The seed of Abraham. A well-known phrase, here meaning, as the context shows, 'the physical posterity of Abraham.'"
3. "In Isaac shall thy seed be called. Spoken to Abraham (Genesis 21:12), at the time when Hagar and Ishmael were sent away."

### John Gill:
1. "They were not all the spiritual children of Abraham, nor the children of God by the special grace of adoption; these characters only belonged to some of them, and which are equally true of Gentile believers."
2. "Natural descent from Abraham avails nothing in this case, as is clear from the instance of Ishmael and Isaac."
3. "This has respect to the most eminent and famous seed of Abraham, the Messiah, in whom all nations of the earth were to be blessed; who was to spring from him by Isaac, in the line of Jacob."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither because they are lineally the seed of Abraham, will it follow that they are all children of God - This did not hold even in Abraham's own family; and much less in his remote descendants."
2. "But God then said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called - That is, Isaac, not Ishmael, shall be called thy seed."
3. "That seed to which the promise is made."
