# Romans 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being children of God is not based on physical descent, but through the divine promise we are reckoned as His seed. The privileges of the Jews were not solely due to their lineage from Abraham, as the distinction lies in the children of the promise, those selected by the Lord. Believers, who are born of God, are the true children of God, not by fleshly descent, but by being children of the promise.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse teaches us that being children of God is not solely based on physical descent, but rather it is through the divine promise that we are reckoned as His seed. This distinction is important to understand, as it emphasizes that the privileges of the Jews were not solely due to their physical lineage from Abraham. Instead, the children of the promise, those who are selected by the Lord, can truly be regarded as children of God. This distinction is seen throughout history, where the promises of God are fulfilled in those who are chosen, rather than being common and equal to all. Therefore, believers, who are the children of the promise, are the true children of God, not by fleshly descent, but by being born of God.
