# Romans 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This word is one of promise, as seen in the reference to Genesis 18:14. The promise states that at the specified time next year, God will come and Sarah will have a son. This promise is significant because it distinguishes the children of the promise, like Isaac, as the true seed. Isaac represents those born after the Spirit, in contrast to Ishmael who represents those born after the flesh. Therefore, this promise holds great meaning, illustrating a deeper spiritual truth about the identity of God's chosen people.
