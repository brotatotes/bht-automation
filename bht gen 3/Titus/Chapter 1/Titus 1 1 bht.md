# Titus 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The occurrence of the servant of God, not elsewhere found in the superscriptions of St. Paulâ€™s Epistles, is a mark of genuineness. The best sense seems to be that of reference, to bring about, cherish, and perfect their faith as the only true faith which the apostolic office would subserve. This election has its ground in the purpose and will of God from everlasting. The writer is an apostle according to the faith of God's elect, and according to the truth which is contained in the faith, as that truth is intelligently apprehended and held.

3. "Their faith is the only true faithâ€”the only faith which the apostolic office would subserve."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The full expression of his apostolic office answers, in both Epistles, to the design, and is a comprehensive index to the contents."
2. "This election has its ground, not in anything belonging to those thus distinguished, but in the purpose and will of God from everlasting."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "But when Paul describes it to be a quality which essentially belongs to faith â€” to know the truth, he plainly shews that there is no faith without knowledge."
3. "And hence we are also informed, that the greater progress any one has made in godliness, he is so much the better disciple of Christ; and that he ought to be reckoned a true theologian who edifies consciences in the fear of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The title servant of God, occurring in James 1:1, but nowhere else in Paulâ€™s inscriptions, is a peculiarity which tells against suspicion of forgery."
2. "According to (better, â€˜with a view toâ€™), introduces the double design of his apostle-ship, viz: (1) the production of faith in Godâ€™s chosen ones (or of that genuine faith which only the chosen have) (cf. Romans 1:5); and (2) the production in believers of a full knowledge ( not â€˜acknowledgingâ€™ ) of the truth, or entire Gospel revelation."
3. "A dual design: faith and knowledge. Against certain errorists, this truth tends to godliness, a Pauline word frequent in Pastoral Epistles, denoting that religious fear of God in the heart which penetrates and rules the whole conduct."

### John Gill:

2. "There are some persons who are styled the elect of God; these are not all men, some are vessels of wrath fitted to destruction, ungodly men, foreordained to condemnation and given up to believe a lie, that they might be damned; nor the Jews only, nor all of them, for though, as a nation, they were chosen, above all others, to many outward privileges, yet they were not chosen to special grace, and eternal glory; only a remnant, according to the election of grace."
3. "The Gospel is a doctrine according to godliness; the truths of it have an influence, both on internal and external godliness; they direct to, and promote the worship and fear of God, and a religious, righteous, sober, and godly life and conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "We serve God according to the measure of our faith: we fulfil our public office according to the measure of our knowledge."
2. "The truth that is after godliness - Which in every point runs parallel with and supports the vital, spiritual worship of God; and, indeed, has no other end or scope."
