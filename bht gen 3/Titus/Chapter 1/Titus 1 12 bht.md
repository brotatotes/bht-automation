# Titus 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Cretans are known for being habitual liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons. Their reputation for lying was so well-known that to Cretanize became synonymous with lying. The phrase evil beasts implies their resemblance to wild animals in their behavior. Epimenides, a Cretan prophet, even sarcastically remarked that the lying of the Cretans surpassed the need for wild beasts in their land. While some may find these words unnecessary, Paul's intention was to alert his audience to the true character of the people they would be ministering to.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."
2. "EPIMENIDES was a native of Ph√¶stus in Crete... and is said to have lived to an extreme old age, and to have been buried at Laced√¶mon."
3. "The appellation 'prophet' seems to have belonged to him in its literal sense: Cicero describes him as one of those who in an excitement of mind, or by its free motion, foretold future events."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To Cretanize was proverbial for to lie: as 'to Corinthianize' was for to be dissolute."
2. "Not merely at times, as every natural man is. Contrast 1 Corinthians 15:33, 'God that cannot lie.' They love 'fables'; even the heathen poets laughed at their lying assertion that they had in their country the sepulchre of Jupiter."
3. "Crete was a country without wild beasts. Epimenides' sarcasm was that its human inhabitants supplied the place of wild beasts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Cretians are always liars - This character of the Cretans is abundantly sustained by the examples adduced by Wetstein."
2. "In their character, beasts or brutes of a ferocious or malignant kind."
3. "Mere gormandizers. Two vices seem here to be attributed to them, which indeed commonly go together - gluttony and sloth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Always. Habitually."
2. "The Cretan habit of lying passed into a verb, krhtizein to speak like a Cretan = to lie."
3. "They are strange words from a venerable Christian minister to a younger minister to whom he had intrusted the care of those very souls; and, in any case, are superfluous, as addressed to one who must have known the characteristics of the Cretans quite as well as the writer himself."

### John Calvin:
1. "From this passage we may infer that those persons are superstitious, who do not venture to borrow anything from heathen authors. All truth is from God; and consequently, if wicked men have said anything that is true and just, we ought not to reject it; for it has come from God." 
2. "Besides, all things are of God; and, therefore, why should it not be lawful to dedicate to his glory everything that can properly be employed for such a purpose?"
3. "Let him read Basil‚Äôs discourse on this subject, instructing young persons how they ought to avail themselves of the assistance to be derived from heathen authors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The hexameter verse quoted is from a lost poem by Epimenides, a Cretan sage of the sixth century B.C., who is well called 'a prophet of their own,' for he is described by classic writers as a philosophic seer and priest, venerated for his predictions, around whose memory popular legends gathered, and to whom almost sacred honors came to be paid."
2. "Impossible to infer that Paul ascribed an inspired character to heathen sages."
3. "The vices here ascribed to the national character (falsehood, violence, and gluttony) find confirmation from other authors."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A prophet of their own (ŒπŒ¥ŒπŒøœÇ Œ±œÖœÑœâŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ). 'Their own prophet.'"
2. "Liars (œàŒµœÖœÉœÑŒ±)."
3. "Idle gluttons (Œ≥Œ±œÉœÑŒµœÅŒµœÇ Œ±œÅŒ≥Œ±). 'Idle bellies.'"

### John Gill:
1. "the Cretians are always liars: lying was a governing vice among them; they were not only guilty of it in some particular instances, but always; not only for saying that Jupiter's sepulchre was with them, when it was the sepulchre of Minos his son, which they had fraudulently obliterated"
2. "Crete is, by Ovid, called 'mendax Creta', lying Crete. Hence, with the Grecians, to 'cretize', is proverbially used for to lie; this is a sin, than which nothing makes a man more like the devil, or more infamous among men, or more abominable to God."
3. "the Cretians are called, by the poet, slow bellies partly for their intemperance, their gluttony and drunkenness: which suited with the false teachers, whose god was their belly, and which they served, and not the Lord Jesus; and partly for their sloth and idleness, eating the bread of others without working."

### John Wesley:
1. "A prophet ‚Äî So all poets were anciently called; but, besides, Diogenes Laertius says that Epimenides, the Cretan poet, foretold many things."
2. "Evil wild beasts ‚Äî Fierce and savage."
