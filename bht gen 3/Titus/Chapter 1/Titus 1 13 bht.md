### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: To reprove sharply may seem harsh, but at times it is necessary when dealing with those who are unresponsive to gentleness and have been led astray by false teachers. This is precisely the case with the people in Crete, whose character and vices are well-known. However, there is wisdom in Paul endorsing Epimenides' testimony about them, for it reveals the truth of their condition. Titus is thus instructed to reprove them sharply so that they may be brought back to soundness in the faith, their spiritual health restored. In doing so, Titus must be bold, cutting off the deception and confronting the root of their errors. This may require a certain bluntness for the sake of their safety and the preservation of the gospel. After all, rebukes are meant to facilitate healing, acting as a surgical operation that goes deep, exposing the true nature of the wound and aiming for its complete removal.
