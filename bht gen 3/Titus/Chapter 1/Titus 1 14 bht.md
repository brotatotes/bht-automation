# Titus 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of Jewish fables and commandments of men that deviate from the truth. These fables may have sparked gnostic mythologies, but they served no purpose and did not lead to godliness. The commandments, which advocated for abstinence from certain foods and practices, were an early form of Gnosticism. They were likely promoted by Jewish individuals, emphasizing circumcision and oral traditions. Instead, we should reprove them sharply and stay steadfast in the faith, not giving heed to these futile traditions and man-made teachings.
