# Titus 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To the pure, all things are pure. This statement underscores the idea that the distinction between pure and impure is not rooted in the things themselves, but rather in the disposition of the person using them. However, for those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure. Their moral pollution stains everything with its own quality, making even the purest things suggestors and ministers of impurity. This contrast highlights the impact of a defiled mind and conscience on one's perception and interpretation of the world around them.
