2. "If the elders and bishops in the times of the apostles were of different ranks, this direction would be wholly unmeaningful."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Note the importance of organization to preserve pure doctrine in the Church."
2. "But the word ordain (used of deacons in Acts 6:3) tells nothing of how the elders were selected or appointed."
3. "As I had appointed, verbally, before leaving."

2. "The ordination of elders was the sole act of Titus, or alone resided in him; but in like manner as Paul and Barnabas ordained elders in every church, by the suffrages of the people, signified by the stretching out of their hands; in which they directed, presided, and also assisted in prayer, with fasting."
