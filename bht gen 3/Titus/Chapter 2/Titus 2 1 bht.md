# Titus 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine; that the aged men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in their faith, in their love, in their patience. Nothing so effectually allays men's wandering curiosity as being brought to recognize those duties in which they ought to exercise themselves. True Christian doctrine is ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô for the soul because it is accompanied by practical goodness. Sound doctrine ought to be spoken out openly and publicly, fully and faithfully, with great plainness and evidence, that it may be understood and known by all.
