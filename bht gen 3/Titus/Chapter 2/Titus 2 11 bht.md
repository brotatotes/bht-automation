## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The education which the Christian man receives from the grace of God, is a discipline, properly so called, of self-denial and training in godliness, accompanied therefore with much mortification and punitive treatment."
2. "The great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ is His own glory, and that of His Father."
3. "Whichever way taken, the passage is just as important a testimony to the divinity of our Saviour: according to (1), by asserting His possession of Deity and right to the appellation of the Highest: according to (2), even more strikingly, asserting His equality in glory with the Father, in a way which would be blasphemy if predicated of any of the sons of men)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The grace of God hath now been embodied in Jesus, the brightness of the Father's glory," manifested as the "Sun of righteousness," "the Word made flesh."
2. "The Gospel dispensation is hence termed 'the day.'"
3. "Hence God is called 'our Saviour.' The very name Jesus means the same."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The manifestation of the grace of God unavoidably carries along with it exhortations to a holy life." 
2. "Yet he does not mean individual men, but rather describes individual classes, or various ranks of life. And this is not a little emphatic, that the grace of God hath let itself down even to the race of slaves."
3. "Paul did not mean in this passage, or in 1 Timothy 2:6, anything else than that the great are called by God, though they are unworthy of it; that men of low condition, though they are despised, are nevertheless adopted by God, who stretches out his hand to receive them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christâ€™s work is the appearance, or literally, epiphany, of that Divine grace or 'favour' to man which had previously been concealed."

2. "Bringing salvation, 'the saving act.'"
3. "The three adverbs set off the opposite (soberly, righteously, godly)."

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant, not the free love and favour of God, which lies in his own heart; for though that is productive of salvation, and is the source and spring of it, and what brings it forth, and is far from encouraging licentiousness, but instructs in real piety, and constrains to obedience to the will of God; yet this does not appear, nor has it been, nor is it made manifest unto all men..."
2. "But by the grace of God is intended the doctrine of grace, the Gospel of the grace of God; called so, because it is a declaration of the grace of God, and of salvation by it: and is the means, in the hand of the Spirit, of conveying grace to the heart, and implanting it in it..."
3. "The Gospel had been like a candle lighted up in one part of the world, only in Judea, but now it shone out like the sun in its meridian glory, and appeared to all men; not to every individual person; it has neither shined upon, nor in everyone: it did not in the apostle's time, when it appeared the most illustrious, and shone out the most extensively, as well as the most clearly; nor has it in ages since, nor does it in ours; there are multitudes who know nothing of it, and are neither under its form nor power..."

### John Wesley:
1. The saving grace of God â€” So it is in its nature, tendency, and design.
Hath appeared to all men â€” High and low.
