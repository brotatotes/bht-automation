## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Looking forâ€”with constant expectation (so the Greek) and with joy (Philippians 3:21- :). This will prove the antidote to worldly lusts, and the stimulus to 'live in this present world' conformably to this expectation."

3. "The phrase occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but often in the Old Testament. Deuteronomy 7:21; Deuteronomy 10:17, predicated of Jehovah, who, as their manifested Lord, led the Israelites through the wilderness, doubtless the Second Person in the Trinity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Looking for - Expecting; waiting for. That is, in the faithful performance of our duties to ourselves, to our fellow-creatures, and to God, we are patiently to wait for the coming of our Lord."
2. "The doctrine there is, that God will be manifest in his Son; that the divine approach to our world be through him to judge the race; and that though he will be accompanied with the appropriate symbols of the divinity, yet it will be the Son of God who will be visible."
3. "Without going into a critical examination of this passage, which would not be in accordance with the design of these Notes, it may be remarked in general: That no plain reader of the New Testament, accustomed to the common language there, would have any doubt that the apostle referred here to the coming of the Lord Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "He calls God great, because his greatness... shall be fully manifested on the last day."
3. "Christ is held out to us as our 'Savior,' who will also be our judge."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christianâ€™s duty during this present life does not exclude but include a reference to that which is to come."
2. "The Christianâ€™s hope is another or second â€˜epiphanyâ€™ still future. The first is an epiphany of grace as the source of Christian life; the other of â€˜gloryâ€™ as its end."
3. "There is a grammatical presumption in favour of referring â€˜Godâ€™ to our Lord in this passage; yet not such as can be much depended on, seeing the usage of the writer tells the other way."

### John Gill:
1. "But as this may be something distinct from that, it may be best, by this blessed hope, to understand the thing hoped for, eternal glory and happiness..."
2. "and to be looking for this, is to be desiring it with the heart and affections set upon it, longing to be in the enjoyment of it, and yet waiting patiently in the exercise of faith and hope..."
3. "this appearance will be a glorious one; for Christ will come in his own glory, in the glory of his deity, particularly his omniscience and omnipotence will be very conspicuous..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Looking - With eager desire. For that glorious appearing - Which we hope for."
2. "Of the great God, even our Saviour Jesus Christ."
