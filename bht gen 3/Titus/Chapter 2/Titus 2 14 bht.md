- Attempt 4 BHT: Christ, the greatest gift ever given, freely and willingly gave himself for us, not just instead of us, but on behalf of us. His act of giving himself as a ransom and redeemer was to redeem us, a people for his own possession. This act of redemption has consecrated us to good works and calls us to be zealous in doing what is pleasing to him. Our redemption is not merely an external act, but it ought to bring forth a transformation in our lives, causing us to be set apart as a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Through the death of Christ, we have been purged from the filth of sin, and it would be shameful for us to return to the same defilement. Therefore, let us live as those who belong to the Lord Jesus, bringing glory to his name through our actions and service.
