# Titus 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Someone who becomes perverse and continues in sin after repeated admonition is essentially turning their life inside out. They intentionally sin against their knowledge and condemn themselves. This person is like a building that is completely demolished, with no hope of repair. Their actions show that they are self-condemned sinners, and it is right for them to be separated from the fellowship of believers.
