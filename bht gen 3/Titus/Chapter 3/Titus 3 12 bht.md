3. "Hence it appears, he was not there yet; if so, he would have said, to winter here. Consequently, this letter was not written from thence."

- Attempt 4 BHT: Paul urges Titus to come to him in Nicopolis for the winter, demonstrating Paul's intention to spend the winter there. Zenas the Lawyer and Apollos are also encouraged to proceed on their journey with zeal. There is some uncertainty surrounding certain individuals mentioned, such as Artemas and Tychicus. It is speculated that Tychicus may have been a disciple of Paul, as he is mentioned in other letters by the apostle. Regardless, Titus, being an evangelist, had no fixed residence and would assist other elders as he traveled. The specific location of Nicopolis is disputed, with some suggesting it may be in Macedonia or along the sea-coast of Epirus. This epistle was likely not written from Nicopolis, as Paul would have used here instead of there if he was already there.
