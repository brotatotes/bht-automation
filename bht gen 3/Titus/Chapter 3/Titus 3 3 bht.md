# Titus 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Because we were once without understanding, disobedient, passing our lives in malice and envy, hating one another, we should despise none and treat our neighbors with the same grace that God has shown us. Reflecting on our own past life of foolishness and malice can humble us and prevent us from being harsh towards others. Let us exercise moderation and remember that the same grace that transformed us can transform others as well.

2. "we (Christians) also (as well as they) were (emphatically prefixed) once without understanding (of spiritual things; see Eph. iv. 18), disobedient (to God, ch. i. 16: he is no longer speaking of authorities, but has passed into a new train of thought)"
3. "passing our lives in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Exercise now, therefore, the same moderation towards others."
3. "We must be humbled before God, in order that we may be gentle towards brethren; for pride is always cruel and disdainful of others."

### Philip Schaff:

- Attempt 4 BHT: Once, as the thief said, we were condemned just like everyone else. We, who are now Christians, were once without understanding, disobedient to God. We used to live our lives in malice, envy, hating one another. But we should remember not to despise anyone, for we were in the same position. Just as God treated us with grace, we ought to treat our neighbor. Foolishness was the state of our mind, full of vice and lacking understanding. We used to hate one another, which was the natural result of being hateful. Therefore, let us reflect on our past lives, remember what we were, and thus show kindness and understanding towards others.
