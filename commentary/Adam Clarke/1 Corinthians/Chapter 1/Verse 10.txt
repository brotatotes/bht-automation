<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>. <i><b>Now I beseech you, brethren</b></i> — The apostle having finished his <i>introduction</i> comes to his <i>second</i> point, exhorting them to abstain from dissensions, that they might be of the same heart and mind, striving together for the hope of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>By the name of our Lord Jesus</b></i> — By his <i>authority</i>, and in his place; and on account of your infinite obligations to his mercy in calling you into such a state of salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye all speak the same thing</b></i> — If they did not agree exactly in <i>opinion</i> on every subject, they might, notwithstanding, agree in the words which they used to express their religious faith. The members of the Church of God should labour to be of the <i>same mind</i>, and to speak the <i>same thing</i>, in order to prevent divisions, which always hinder the work of God. On every essential doctrine of the Gospel all genuine Christians agree: why then need religious communion be interrupted? This <i>general</i> agreement is all that the apostle can have in view; for it cannot be expected that any number of men should in <i>every respect</i> perfectly coincide in their views of all the minor points, on which an exact conformity in sentiment is impossible to minds so variously constituted as those of the human race. <i>Angels</i> may thus agree, who see nothing through an <i>imperfect</i> or <i>false</i> medium; but to man this is impossible. Therefore men should bear with each other, and not be so ready to imagine that none have the truth of God but they and their party.</p>
