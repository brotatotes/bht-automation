<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>. <i><b>Every one of you saith</b></i> — It seems from this expression that the whole Church at Corinth was in a state of <i>dissension</i>: they were all <i>divided</i> into the following sects</p>
<p>1. <i>Paulians</i>, or followers of St. Paul;</p>
<p>2. <i>Apollonians</i>, or followers of Apollos;</p>
<p>3. <i>Kephians</i>, or followers of Kephas;</p>
<p>4. <i>Christians</i>, or followers of Christ.</p>
<p>See the introduction, sec. v.</p>
<p>The converts at Corinth were partly <i>Jews</i> and partly <i>Greeks</i>. The <i>Gentile</i> part, as Dr. Lightfoot conjectures, might boast the names of <i>Paul</i> and <i>Apollos</i>; the <i>Jewish</i>, those of <i>Kephas</i> and <i>Christ</i>. But these again might be subdivided; some probably considered themselves disciples of <i>Paul</i>, he being the immediate instrument of their conversion, while others might prefer <i>Apollos</i> for his extraordinary eloquence.</p>
<p>If by <i>Kephas</i> the apostle <i>Peter</i> be meant, some of the <i>circumcision</i> who believed might prefer him to all the rest; and they might consider him more immediately sent to <i>them</i>; and therefore have him in higher esteem than they had <i>Paul</i>, who was the minister or apostle of the <i>uncircumcision</i>: and on this very account the converted Gentiles would prize him more highly than they did Peter.</p>
<p>Instead of <i>Christ</i>, χριστου, some have conjectured that we should read κρισπου, of <i>Crispus</i>; who is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>. And some think that χριστου, <i>of Christ</i>, is an interpolation, as it is not likely that Christ in any sense of the word could be said to be the <i>head of a sect</i>, or <i>party</i>, in his own Church; as <i>all</i> those parties held that <i>Gospel</i>, of which himself was both the <i>author</i> and the <i>subject</i>. But it is very easy to conceive that, in a Church so divided, a party might be found, who, dividing Christ from his ministers, might be led to say, "We will have nothing to do with your <i>parties</i>, nor with your <i>party spirit</i>; we are the <i>disciples of</i> <i>Christ</i>, and will have nothing to do with <i>Paulians, Apollonians</i>, or <i>Kephians</i>, as contradistinguished from Christ." The reading κρισπου for χριστου is not acknowledged by any MS. or version.</p>
