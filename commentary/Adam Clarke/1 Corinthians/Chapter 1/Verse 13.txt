<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:13">1 Corinthians 1:13</span>. <i><b>Is Christ divided?</b></i> — Can he be split into different sects and parties? Has he different and opposing systems? Or, is the Messiah to appear under different persons?</p>
<p><i><b>Was Paul crucified for you?</b></i> — As the Gospel proclaims salvation through the <i>crucified</i> only, has Paul poured out his blood as an atonement for you? This is impossible, and therefore your being called by my name is absurd; for his disciples you should be, alone, who has bought you by his blood.</p>
<p><i><b>Were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</b></i> — To be <i>baptized in</i>, or <i>into</i> the <i>name</i> of one, implied that the <i>baptized</i> was to be the <i>disciple</i> of him into whose name, religion, c., he was baptized. As if he said: Did I ever attempt to set up a <i>new</i> religion, one founded on <i>my own authority</i>, and coming from myself? On the contrary, have I not preached Christ crucified for the sin of the world and called upon all mankind, both Jews and Gentiles, to believe on Him?</p>
