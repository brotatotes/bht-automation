Verse 1 Corinthians 1:13. Is Christ divided? — Can he be split into different sects and parties? Has he different and opposing systems? Or, is the Messiah to appear under different persons?Was Paul crucified for you? — As the Gospel proclaims salvation through the crucified only, has Paul poured out his blood as an atonement for you? This is impossible, and therefore your being called by my name is absurd; for his disciples you should be, alone, who has bought you by his blood.Were ye baptized in the name of Paul? — To be baptized in, or into the name of one, implied that the baptized was to be the disciple of him into whose name, religion, c., he was baptized. As if he said: Did I ever attempt to set up a new religion, one founded on my own authority, and coming from myself? On the contrary, have I not preached Christ crucified for the sin of the world and called upon all mankind, both Jews and Gentiles, to believe on Him?
