<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>. <i><b>I thank God that I baptized none of you</b></i> â€” None of those who now live in Corinth, except <i>Crispus</i>, the ruler of the synagogue, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:8">Acts 18:8</span>. <i>And Gaius</i>, the same person probably with whom Paul lodged, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>, where see the notes. Dr. Lightfoot observes: "If this be Gaius, or Caius, to whom the third epistle of John was written, which is very probable when the first verse of that epistle is compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:1">3 John 1:1</span> then it will appear probable that John wrote his first epistle to the <i>Corinthians. I wrote</i>, says he, <i>unto the Church</i>-What Church? Certainly it must have been some <i>particular</i> Church which the apostle has in view, and the Church <i>where</i> Gaius himself resided. And if this be true, we may look for <i>Diotrephes</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:9">3 John 1:9</span>) in the Corinthian Church; and the author of the <i>schism</i> of which the apostle complains. See the <i>Introduction</i>, sect. viii.</p>
