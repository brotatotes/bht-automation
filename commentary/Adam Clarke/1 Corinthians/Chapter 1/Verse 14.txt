Verse 1 Corinthians 1:14. I thank God that I baptized none of you â€” None of those who now live in Corinth, except Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, Acts 18:8. And Gaius, the same person probably with whom Paul lodged, Romans 16:23, where see the notes. Dr. Lightfoot observes: "If this be Gaius, or Caius, to whom the third epistle of John was written, which is very probable when the first verse of that epistle is compared with Romans 16:23, 3 John 1:1 then it will appear probable that John wrote his first epistle to the Corinthians. I wrote, says he, unto the Church-What Church? Certainly it must have been some particular Church which the apostle has in view, and the Church where Gaius himself resided. And if this be true, we may look for Diotrephes (3 John 1:9) in the Corinthian Church; and the author of the schism of which the apostle complains. See the Introduction, sect. viii.
