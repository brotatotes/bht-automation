Verse 1 Corinthians 1:15. Lest any should say, c.] He was careful not to baptize, lest it should be supposed that he wished to make a party for himself because superficial observers might imagine that he baptized them into his own name-to be his followers, though he baptized them into the name of Christ only.Instead of εβαπτισα, I have baptized, the Codex Alexandrinus, the Codex Ephraim, and several others, with the Coptic, Sahidic, later Syriac in the margin, Armenian, Vulgate, some copies of the Itala, and several of the fathers, read εβαπτισθητε, ye were baptized. And if we read ινα, so that, instead of lest, the sentence will stand thus: So that no one can say that ye were baptized into my name. This appears to be the true reading, and for it Bp. Pearce offers several strong arguments.
