<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:15">1 Corinthians 1:15</span>. <i><b>Lest any should say</b></i>, c.] He was careful not to baptize, lest it should be supposed that he wished to make a party for himself because superficial observers might imagine that he baptized them <i>into his own name</i>-to be his <i>followers</i>, though he baptized them into the name of Christ only.</p>
<p>Instead of εβαπτισα, <i>I have baptized</i>, the Codex <i>Alexandrinus</i>, the Codex <i>Ephraim</i>, and several others, with the <i>Coptic, Sahidic</i>, later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, <i>Armenian, Vulgate</i>, some copies of the <i>Itala</i>, and several of the <i>fathers</i>, read εβαπτισθητε, <i>ye were</i> <i>baptized</i>. And if we read ινα, <i>so that</i>, instead of <i>lest</i>, the sentence will stand thus: <i>So that no one can say that ye were</i> <i>baptized into my name</i>. This appears to be the true reading, and for it Bp. Pearce offers several strong arguments.</p>
