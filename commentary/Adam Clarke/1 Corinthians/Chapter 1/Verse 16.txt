<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:16">1 Corinthians 1:16</span>. <i><b>The household of Stephanas</b></i> — From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>, we learn that the family of <i>Stephanas</i> were the <i>first converts</i> in Achaia, probably converted and baptized by the apostle himself. <i>Epenetus</i> is supposed to be one of this family. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>I know not whether I baptized any other.</b></i> — I do not recollect that there is any person now residing in <i>Corinth</i>, or <i>Achaia</i>, besides the above mentioned, whom I have baptized. It is strange that the <i>doubt</i> here expressed by the apostle should be construed so as to affect his <i>inspiration</i>! What, does the inspiration of prophet or apostle necessarily imply that he must understand the geography of the universe, and have an intuitive knowledge of all the inhabitants of the earth, and how <i>often</i>, and <i>where</i> they may have changed their residence! Nor was that <i>inspiration</i> ever given so to work on a man's memory that he could not forget any of the <i>acts</i> which he had performed during life. Inspiration was given to the holy men of old that they might be able to write and proclaim the <i>mind of God</i> in the times which concern the <i>salvation</i> of men.</p>
