<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For Christ sent me not to baptize</b></i> — Bp. Pearce translates thus: <i>For Christ sent me, not so much to baptize as to</i> <i>preach the Gospel</i>: and he supports his version thus-"The writers of the Old and New Testaments do, almost every where (agreeably to the Hebrew idiom) express a preference given to one thing beyond another by an <i>affirmation</i> of <i>that</i> which is <i>preferred</i>, and a <i>negation</i> of that which is <i>contrary</i> to it: and so it must be understood here, for if St. Paul was not sent <i>at all</i> to baptize, he baptized <i>without a commission</i>; but if he was sent, not only to baptize but to preach <i>also</i>, or to preach <i>rather</i> than baptize, he did in fact discharge his duty aright." It appears sufficiently evident that <i>baptizing</i> was considered to be an <i>inferior</i> office, and though every minister of Christ might administer it, yet apostles had more <i>important</i> work. Preparing these adult heathens for baptism by the continual preaching of the word was of much greater consequence than baptizing them when thus prepared to receive and profit by it.</p>
<p><i><b>Not with wisdom of words</b></i> — ουκ εν σοφια λογου. In several places in the New Testament the term λογος is taken not only to express a <i>word</i>, a <i>speech</i>, a <i>saying</i>, c., but <i>doctrine</i>, or the <i>matter of teaching</i>. Here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</span>, and in several other places, it seems to signify <i>reason</i>, or that mode of <i>rhetorical</i> <i>argumentation</i> so highly prized among the Greeks. The apostle was sent not to pursue this mode of conduct, but simply to announce the truth to proclaim Christ crucified for the sin of the world; and to do this in the <i>plainest</i> and <i>simplest</i> manner possible, lest the numerous conversions which followed might be attributed to the <i>power</i> of the apostle's <i>eloquence</i>, and not to the <i>demonstration</i> of the <i>Spirit of God</i>. It is worthy of remark that, in all the revivals of religion with which we are acquainted, God appears to have made very little use of human <i>eloquence</i>, even when possessed by pious men. His own nervous truths, announced by plain common sense, though in homely phrase, have been the general means of the conviction and conversion of sinners. Human <i>eloquence</i> and <i>learning</i> have often been successfully employed in defending the <i>outworks</i> of Christianity; but <i>simplicity</i> and <i>truth</i> have preserved the <i>citadel</i>.</p>
<p>It is farther worthy of remark, that when God was about to promulgate his laws he chose <i>Moses</i> as the instrument, who appears to have laboured under some natural <i>impediment in his speech</i>, so that <i>Aaron</i> his brother was obliged to be his spokesman to Pharaoh; and that, when God had purposed to publish the Gospel to the Gentile world-to Athens, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome, he was pleased to use <i>Saul</i> of <i>Tarsus</i> as the principal instrument; a man <i>whose bodily presence was weak, and his speech contemptible</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>. And thus it was proved that <i>God sent him to preach, not with human</i> <i>eloquence, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect</i> but with the <i>demonstration and power of his own Spirit</i>; and thus <i>the excellence of the power</i> appeared <i>to be of God, and not of man</i>.</p>
