<p>Verse 18. <i><b>For the preaching of the cross</b></i> — Ὁ λογος γαρ ὁ του σταυρου, <i>The doctrine of the cross</i>; or the <i>doctrine</i> that is <i>of</i> or <i>concerning</i> the <i>cross</i>; that is, the doctrine that proclaims salvation to a lost world through the <i>crucifixion</i> of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>Is to them that perish foolishness</b></i> — There are, properly speaking, but two classes of men known where the Gospel is preached: απολλυμενοι, the <i>unbelievers</i> and <i>gainsayers</i>, who are perishing; and σοζομενοι, the <i>obedient believers</i>, who are in a state of <i>salvation</i>. To those who <i>will</i> continue in the first state, the preaching of salvation through the merit of a crucified Saviour is <i>folly</i>. To those who believe this doctrine of Christ crucified is the power of God to their salvation; it is divinely efficacious to deliver them from all the power, guilt, and pollution of sin.</p>
