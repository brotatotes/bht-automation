<p>Verse 19. <i><b>For it is written</b></i> — The place referred to is <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:14">Isaiah 29:14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise</b></i> — των σοφων, Of <i>wise</i> <i>men</i>-of the <i>philosophers</i> who in their investigations seek nothing less than God, and whose highest discoveries amount to nothing in comparison of the grand truths relative to God, the invisible world, and the true end of man, which the Gospel has brought to light. Let me add, that the very discoveries which are really useful have been made by men who feared God, and conscientiously credited Divine revelation: witness <i>Newton, Boyle, Pascal</i>, and many others. But all the skeptics and deists, by their schemes of natural religion and morality, have not been able to save one soul! No sinner has ever been converted from the error of his ways by their preaching or writings.</p>
