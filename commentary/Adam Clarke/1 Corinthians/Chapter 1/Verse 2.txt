<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>. <i><b>The Church of God which is at Corinth</b></i> — This Church was planted by the apostle himself about A. D. 52, as we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1">Acts 18:1</span>, c., where see the notes.</p>
<p><i><b>Sanctified in Christ Jesus</b></i> — ηγιασμενοις, <i>Separated</i> from the corruptions of their place and age.</p>
<p><i><b>Called</b></i><b> to be </b><i><b>saints</b></i> — κλητοις αγιοις, <i>Constituted saints</i>, or <i>invited</i> to become such this was the design of the Gospel, for Jesus Christ came to save men from their sins.</p>
<p><i><b>With all that in every place</b></i>, c.] All who profess Christianity, both in <i>Corinth, Ephesus</i>, and other parts of <i>Greece</i> or <i>Asia Minor</i> and by this we see that the apostle intended that this epistle should be a general property of the universal Church of Christ; though there are several matters in it that are suited to the state of the Corinthians only.</p>
<p><i><b>Both theirs and ours</b></i> — That is, Jesus Christ is the <i>common Lord</i> and Saviour of <i>all</i>. He is the <i>exclusive</i> property of no one Church, or people, or nation. <i>Calling on</i> or <i>invoking</i> the name of the Lord Jesus, was the proper distinguishing mark of a <i>Christian</i>. In those times of apostolic light and purity no man attempted to invoke God but in the name of Jesus Christ; this is what genuine Christians still mean when they ask any thing from God <i>for</i> <i>Christ's</i> SAKE.</p>
