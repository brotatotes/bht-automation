<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Where is the wise - the scribe - the disputer of this</b></i><b> </b><i><b>world?</b></i> — These words most manifestly refer to the Jews; as the places (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:14">Isaiah 29:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+33:18">Isaiah 33:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:25">Isaiah 44:25</span>) to which he refers cannot be understood of any but the <i>Jews</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>wise man</i> σοφος, of the apostle, is the חכם <i>chakam</i> of the prophet; whose office it was to teach others.</p>
<p>The <i>scribe</i>, γραμματευς, of the apostle, is the ספר <i>sopher</i> of the prophet; this signifies any man of learning, as distinguished from the common people, especially any master of the traditions.</p>
<p>The <i>disputer</i>, συζητητης, answers to the דרש <i>derosh</i>, or דרשן <i>darshan</i>, the <i>propounder of questions</i>; the <i>seeker</i> of allegorical, mystical, and cabalistical senses from the Holy Scriptures. Now as all these are characters well known among the Jews, and as the words αιωνος τουτου, <i>of this world</i> are a simple translation of עולם הזה <i>olam hazzeh</i>, which is repeatedly used to designate the Jewish republic, there is no doubt that the apostle has the Jews immediately in view. This wisdom of theirs induced them to seek out of the sacred oracles any sense but the true one; and they made the word of God of none effect by their traditions. After them, and precisely on their model, the <i>schoolmen</i> arose; and they rendered the doctrine of the Gospel of no effect by their <i>hypercritical questions</i>, and endless <i>distinctions</i> without <i>differences</i>. By the preaching of Christ crucified God made foolish the wisdom of the <i>Jewish wise men</i>; and, after that the pure religion of Christ had been corrupted by a Church that was of this world, God rendered the wisdom and <i>disputing</i> of the schoolmen foolishness, by the revival of pure Christianity at the <i>Reformation</i>. The Jews themselves allow that nothing is <i>wise</i>, nothing <i>strong</i>, nothing <i>rich</i>, without God.</p>
<p>"Our rabbins teach that there were two <i>wise men</i> in this world; one was an Israelite, <i>Achitophel</i>, the other was a Gentile, <i>Balaam</i>; but both were miserable in this world."</p>
<p>"There were also two <i>strong men</i> in the world; one an Israelite, <i>Samson</i>, the other a Gentile, <i>Goliah</i>; but they were both miserable in this world."</p>
<p>"There were two <i>rich men</i> in the world; one an Israelite, <i>Korah</i>, the other a Gentile, <i>Haman</i>; but both these were miserable in this world. And why? Because their gifts came not from God." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>In truth the world has derived very little, if any, moral good, either from the Jewish rabbins or the Gentile philosophers.</p>
