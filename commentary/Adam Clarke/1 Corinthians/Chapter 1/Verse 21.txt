<p>Verse 21. <i><b>For after that in the wisdom of God</b></i> — Dr. Lightfoot observes, "That σοφια του θεου, <i>the wisdom of God</i>, is not to be understood of that wisdom which had God for its <i>author</i>, but that wisdom which had God for its <i>object</i>. There was, among the heathen, σοφια της φυσεως, <i>wisdom about natural things</i>, that is, <i>philosophy</i>; and σοφια του θεου, <i>wisdom about God</i>; that is, <i>divinity</i>. But the world in its <i>divinity</i> could not, by wisdom, know God." The plain meaning of this verse is, that the wise men of the world, especially the Greek philosophers, who possessed every advantage that human nature could have, independently of a Divine revelation, and who had cultivated their minds to the uttermost, could never, by their learning, wisdom, and industry, find out God; nor had the most refined philosophers among them just and correct views of the Divine nature, nor of that in which human happiness consists. The work of LUCRETIUS, <i>De Natura Rerum</i>, and the work of CICERO, <i>De Natura Deorum</i>, are incontestable proofs of this. Even the writings of <i>Plato</i> and <i>Aristotle</i> have contributed little to remove the veil which clouded the understanding of men. No wisdom but that which came from God could ever penetrate and illuminate the human mind.</p>
<p><i><b>By the foolishness of preaching</b></i> — By the preaching of Christ crucified, which the Gentiles termed μωρια, <i>foolishness</i>, in opposition to their own doctrines, which they termed σοφια, <i>wisdom</i>. It was not by the foolishness of preaching, literally, nor by the foolish preaching, that God saved the world; but by that Gospel which they called μωρια, <i>foolishness</i>; which was, in fact, the wisdom of God, and also the power of God to the salvation of them that believed.</p>
