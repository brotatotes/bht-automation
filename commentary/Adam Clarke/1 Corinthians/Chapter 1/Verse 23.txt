<p>Verse 23. <i><b>But we</b></i> — Apostles, differing widely from these Gentile philosophers:-</p>
<p><i><b>Preach Christ crucified</b></i> — Call on men, both Jews and Gentiles, to believe in Christ, as having purchased their salvation by shedding his blood for them.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto the Jews a stumbling block</b></i> — Because Jesus came meek, lowly, and impoverished; not seeking worldly glory, nor affecting worldly pomp; whereas <i>they</i> expected the Messiah to come as a mighty prince and conqueror; because Christ did not come so, they were offended at him. Out of their own mouths, we may condemn the gainsaying Jews. In <i>Sohar Chadash</i>, fol. 26, the following saying is attributed to Moses, relative to the brazen serpent: "Moses said, This serpent is a stumbling block to the world. The holy blessed God answered: Not at all, it shall be for punishment to sinners, and life to upright men." This is a proper illustration of the apostle's words.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto the Greeks foolishness</b></i> — Because they could not believe that proclaiming supreme happiness through a man that was crucified at Judea as a malefactor could ever comport with reason and common sense; for both the <i>matter</i> and <i>manner</i> of the preaching were opposite to every notion they had formed of what was dignified and philosophic. In <i>Justin Martyr's</i> dialogue with <i>Trypho</i> the Jew we have these remarkable words, which serve to throw light on the above. "Your Jesus," says Trypho, "having fallen under the extreme curse of God, we cannot sufficiently admire how you can expect any good from God, who place your hopes επ ανθρωπον σταυρωθεντα, upon a man that was CRUCIFIED." The same writer adds: "They count us mad, that after the eternal God, the Father of all things, we give the second place, ανθρωπω σταυρωθεντι, <i>to a man that was crucified</i>." "Where is your <i>understanding</i>," said the Gentiles, "who worship for a god him who was crucified?" Thus Christ crucified was to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness. See <i>Whitby</i> on this verse.</p>
