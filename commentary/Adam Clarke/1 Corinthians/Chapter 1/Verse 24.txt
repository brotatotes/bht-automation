<p>Verse 24. <i><b>But unto them which are called</b></i> — τοις κλητοις. Those, both of Jews and Greeks, who were by the preaching of the Gospel <i>called</i> or <i>invited</i> to the <i>marriage feast</i>, and have accordingly believed in Christ Jesus; they prove this doctrine to be divinely powerful, to enlighten and convert the soul, and to be a proof of God's infinite wisdom, which has found out such an effectual way to glorify both his justice and mercy, and save, to the uttermost, all that come to him through Christ Jesus. The <i>called</i>, or <i>invited</i>, κλητοι, is a title of genuine <i>Christians</i>, and is frequently used in the New Testament. αγιοι, <i>saints</i>, is used in the same sense.</p>
