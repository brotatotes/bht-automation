<p>Verse 25. <i><b>The foolishness of God is wiser</b></i>, c.] The meaning of these strong expressions is, that the things of God's appointment, which seem to men <i>foolishness</i>, are infinitely beyond the highest degree of human wisdom and those works of God, which appear to superficial observers weak and contemptible, surpass all the efforts of human power. The means which God has appointed for the salvation of men are so <i>wisely</i> imagined and so <i>energetically</i> <i>powerful</i>, that all who properly use them shall be infallibly brought to the <i>end</i>-final blessedness, which he has promised to them who <i>believe</i> and <i>obey</i>.</p>
