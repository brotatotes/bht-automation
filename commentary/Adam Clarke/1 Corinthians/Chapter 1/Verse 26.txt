<p>Verse 26. <i><b>Ye see your calling</b></i> — την κλησιν. The <i>state</i> of grace and blessedness to which ye are <i>invited</i>. I think, βλεπετε την κλησιν, c., should be read in the imperative: <i>Take heed to</i>, or <i>consider your calling, brethren that</i> (οτι) <i>not many</i> of you <i>are wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble: men</i> is not in the original, and Paul seems to allude to the Corinthian believers in particular. This seems to have been said in opposition to the high and worldly notions of the Jews, who assert that the Divine Spirit never rests upon any man, unless he be <i>wise, powerful</i>, and <i>rich</i>. Now this Divine Spirit did rest upon the Christians at Corinth, and yet these were, in the sense of the <i>world</i>, neither <i>wise, rich</i>, nor <i>noble</i>. We spoil, if not corrupt the apostle's meaning, by adding <i>are called</i>, as if God did not send his Gospel to the <i>wise</i>, the <i>powerful</i>, and the <i>noble</i>, or did not <i>will</i> their salvation. The truth is, the Gospel has an equal call to all classes of men; but the <i>wise</i>, the <i>mighty</i>, and the <i>noble</i>, are too busy, or too sensual, to pay any attention to an invitation so <i>spiritual</i> and so <i>Divine</i>; and therefore there are few of these in the Church of Christ in general.</p>
