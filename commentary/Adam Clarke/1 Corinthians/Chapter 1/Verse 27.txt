<p>Verse 27. <i><b>But God hath chosen the foolish things</b></i> â€” God has chosen by means of men who are esteemed <i>rude</i> and <i>illiterate</i> to confound the greatest of the Greek <i>philosophers</i>, and overturn their <i>systems</i>; and, by means of men <i>weak</i>, without secular <i>power</i> or <i>authority</i>, to confound the <i>scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>, and in spite of the exertions of the Jewish <i>sanhedrin</i>, to spread the doctrine of Christ crucified all over the land of Judea, and by such instruments as these to convert thousands of souls to the faith of the Gospel, who are ready to lay down their lives for the truth. The Jews have proverbs that express the same sense as these words of the apostle. In <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, sec. 17, fol. 117, it is said: "There are certain matters which appear <i>little</i> to men, yet by them God points out <i>important precepts</i>. Thus <i>hyssop</i> in the sight of man is <i>worth nothing</i>, but in the sight of God its <i>power</i> is great; sometimes he equals it to the <i>cedar</i>, particularly in the ordinance concerning the <i>lepers</i>, and in the burning of the <i>red heifer</i>. Thus God commanded them in Egypt, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:22">Exodus 12:22</span>: <i>And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop</i>, c. And concerning Solomon it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+4:33">1 Kings 4:33</span>: <i>And he discoursed of trees, from the cedar on Lebanon to the</i> <i>hyssop that grows out of the wall</i>. Whence we may learn that <i>great</i> and <i>small things</i> are <i>equal</i> in the eyes of the Lord, and that even by <i>small things</i> He can work <i>great miracles</i>."</p>
