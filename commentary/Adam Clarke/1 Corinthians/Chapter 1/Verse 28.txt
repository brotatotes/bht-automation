<p>Verse 28. <i><b>And base things - and things which are despised</b></i> â€” It is very likely that the apostle refers here to the <i>Gentiles</i> and to the Gentile converts, who were considered base and despicable in the eyes of the Jews, who counted them no better than <i>dogs</i>, and who are repeatedly called <i>the things that are not</i>. By these very people, converted to Christianity, God has <i>brought to nought</i> all the Jewish pretensions; and by means of the Gentiles themselves, he has annihilated the whole Jewish polity; so that even Jerusalem itself was soon after this, trodden under foot of the Gentiles.</p>
