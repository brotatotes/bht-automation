<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>. <i><b>According as it is written</b></i> â€” In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:23-24">Jeremiah 9:23-24</span>: <i>Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise</i> man <i>glory in his wisdom,</i> <i>neither let the mighty</i> man <i>glory in his might; let not the rich</i> man <i>glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in this</i>: <i>That he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which</i> <i>exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the</i> <i>earth</i>. So then, as all good is of and from God, let him that has either <i>wisdom, strength, riches, pardon, holiness</i>, or any other blessing, whether <i>temporal</i> or <i>spiritual</i>, acknowledge that he has nothing but what he has received; and that, as he has cause of <i>glorying</i> (<i>boasting</i> or <i>exultation</i>) in being made a partaker of these benefits and mercies of his Creator and Redeemer, let him <i>boast</i> in God alone, by whom, through Christ Jesus, he has received the whole.</p>
<p>1. THIS is an admirable chapter, and drawn up with great skill and address. The <i>divided</i> state of the Corinthian Church we have already noticed, and it appears that in these factions the apostle's authority had been set at nought by some, and questioned by many. St. Paul begins his letter with showing his authority; he had it immediately through Christ Jesus himself, by the <i>will of</i> <i>God</i>. And indeed the <i>success</i> of his preaching was a sufficient proof of the Divinity of his call. Had not God been with him he never could have successfully opposed the whole system of the national religion of the Corinthians, supported as it was by the prejudice of the people, the authority of the laws, and the eloquence and learning of their most eminent philosophers. It was necessary, therefore, that he should call the attention of this people to the Divine origin of his mission, that they might acknowledge that the excellency of the power was of God, and not of man.</p>
<p>2. It was necessary also that he should conciliate their esteem, and therefore speak as favourably concerning them as truth would allow; hence he shows them that they were a <i>Church of God,</i> <i>sanctified in Christ Jesus</i>, and <i>called to be saints</i>; that they abounded and even <i>excelled</i> in many extraordinary <i>gifts</i> and graces; and that they were not <i>inferior</i> to any Church of God in any gift. And he shows them that they received all these through God's <i>confirmation</i> of that testimony which he had delivered among them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4-7">1 Corinthians 1:4-7</span>.</p>
<p>3. When he had thus prepared their minds to receive and profit by his admonitions he proceeds to their schisms, which he mentions and reprehends in the most delicate manner, so that the most obstinate and prejudiced could take no offence.</p>
<p>4. Having gained this point, he gently leads them to consider that, as God is the fountain of all good, so their good had all come from him; and that none of them should <i>rest</i> in the <i>gift</i>, but in the <i>giver</i>; nor should they consider themselves as of particular consequence on account of possessing such gifts, because all earthly good is transitory, and those who trust in power, wisdom, or wealth, are confounded and brought to nought; and that they alone are <i>safe</i> who receive every thing as from the hand of God, and, in the strength of his gifts, <i>glorify</i> him who is the <i>donor</i> of all good. He who can read this chapter without getting much profit has very little spirituality in his soul, and must be utterly unacquainted with the work of God in the heart.</p>
