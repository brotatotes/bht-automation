Verse 1 Corinthians 1:5. Ye are enriched - ye abound - in all utterance — εν παντι λογω, In all doctrine; for so the word should certainly be translated and understood. All the truths of God relative to their salvation had been explicitly declared to them; and they had all knowledge; so that they perfectly comprehended the doctrines which they had heard.
