<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:9">1 Corinthians 1:9</span>. <i><b>God is faithful</b></i> — The <i>faithfulness of God</i> is a favourite expression among the ancient Jews; and by it they properly understand the integrity of God in preserving whatever is entrusted to him. And they suppose that in this sense the <i>fidelity of man</i> may illustrate the <i>fidelity of God</i>, in reference to which they tell the two following stories. "Rabbi <i>Phineas</i>, the son of <i>Jair</i>, dwelt in a certain city, whither some men came who had two measures of barley, which they desired him to preserve for them. They afterwards forgot their barley and went away. Rabbi <i>Phineas</i> each year sowed the barley, reaped, thrashed, and laid it up in his granary. When seven years had elapsed the men returned, and desired to have the barley with which they had entrusted him. Rabbi <i>Phineas</i> recollected them, and said, 'Come and take your treasure,' i.e. the barley they had left, with all that it had produced for seven years. Thus, from the faithfulness of man ye may know the faithfulness of God."</p>
<p>"Rabbi <i>Simeon</i>, the son of <i>Shetach</i>, bought an ass from some Edomites, at whose neck his disciples saw a <i>diamond</i> hanging; they said unto him, Rabbi, <i>the blessing of the Lord maketh rich</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:22">Proverbs 10:22</span>. But he answered: The <i>ass</i> I have bought, but the <i>diamond</i> I have not bought; therefore he returned the diamond to the Edomites. Thus, from the fidelity of man ye may know the fidelity of God." This was an instance of rare honesty, not to be paralleled among the <i>Jews</i> of the present day, and probably among few <i>Gentiles</i>. Whatever is committed to the keeping of God he will most carefully preserve; for he is <i>faithful</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto the fellowship</b></i>, c.] εις κοινωνιαν, Into the communion or participation of Christ, in the graces of his Spirit and the glories of his future kingdom. God will continue to uphold and save you, if you entrust your bodies and souls to him. But can it be said that God will keep what is either <i>not</i> entrusted to him or, after being entrusted, is <i>taken away</i>?</p>
