<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:11">1 Corinthians 10:11</span>. <i><b>Upon whom the ends of the world are come.</b></i> — Τα τελη των αιωνων· The end of the times included within the whole duration of the Mosaic economy. For although the word αιων means, in its <i>primary</i> sense, <i>endless being</i>, or <i>duration</i>; yet, in its accommodated sense, it is applied to any round or duration that is <i>complete in itself</i>: and here it evidently means the whole duration of the Mosaic economy. "Thus, therefore," says Dr. Lightfoot, "the apostle speaks in this place that those things, which were transacted in the beginning of the Jewish ages, are written for an example to you upon whom the ends of those ages are come; and the beginning is like to the end, and the end to the beginning. Both were forty years; both consisted of temptation and unbelief; and both ended in the destruction of the unbelievers-<i>that</i>, in the destruction of those who perished in the wilderness; <i>this</i>, in the destruction of those that believed not: viz. the destruction of their city and nation." The phrase סוף יומיא <i>soph yomaiya</i>, the end of days, says the Targum of Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>, means ביומוי דמלכא משיחא <i>beyomoi demalca Meshicha</i>, in the days of the King Messiah. We are to consider the apostle's words as referring to the end of the Jewish dispensation and the commencement of the Christian, which is the last dispensation which God will vouchsafe to man in the state of probation.</p>
