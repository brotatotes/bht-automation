<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:12">1 Corinthians 10:12</span>. <i><b>Let him that thinketh he standeth</b></i> — ο δοκων εσταναι. <i>Let him who most confidently standeth</i>-him who has the <i>fullest conviction</i> in his own conscience that his heart is right with God, and that his mind is right in the truth, take heed lest he fall from his faith, and from the state of holiness in which the grace of God has placed him. I have already shown that the verb δοκειν, which we render to <i>seem</i>, to <i>think</i>, to <i>suppose</i>, is used by the best Greek writers, not to <i>lessen</i> or <i>weaken</i> the sense, but to render it <i>stronger</i> and more <i>emphatic</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span>.</p>
<p>In a state of probation every thing may change; while we are in this life we may <i>stand</i> or <i>fall</i>: our standing in the faith depends on our union with God; and that depends on our watching unto prayer, and continuing to possess that faith that worketh by love. The highest saint under heaven can stand no longer than he depends upon God and continues in the obedience of faith. He that ceases to do so will fall into sin, and get a darkened understanding and a hardened heart: and he may <i>continue</i> in this state till God come to take away his soul. Therefore, <i>let him who most assuredly</i> <i>standeth, take heed lest he fall</i>; not only <i>partially</i>, but <i>finally.</i></p>
