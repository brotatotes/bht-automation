<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:13">1 Corinthians 10:13</span>. <i><b>But such as is common to man</b></i> — ανθρωπινος. Chrysostom has properly translated this word ανθρωπινος, τουτεστι μικρος, βραχυς, συμμετρος; that is, <i>small, short, moderate</i>. Your temptations or trials have been but trifling in comparison of those endured by the Israelites; they might have been easily resisted and overcome. Besides, God will not suffer you to be tried above the strength he gives you; but as the trial comes, he will provide you with sufficient strength to resist it; as the trial <i>comes in</i>, he will make your <i>way out</i>. The words are very remarkable, ποιησει συν τῳ πειρασμῳ και την εκβασιν, "He will, with the temptation, make the deliverance, or way out." Satan is never permitted to <i>block</i> up our way, without the providence of God making a <i>way through the wall</i>. God ever makes a <i>breach</i> in his otherwise impregnable fortification. Should an upright soul get into difficulties and straits, he may rest assured that there is <i>a</i> <i>way out</i>, as there was a <i>way in</i>; and that the trial shall never be above the strength that God shall give him to bear it.</p>
