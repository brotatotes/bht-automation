<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:15">1 Corinthians 10:15</span>. <i><b>I speak as to wise men</b></i> â€” The Corinthians valued themselves not a little on their <i>wisdom</i> and various gifts; the apostle admits this, and draws an argument from it against themselves. As ye are <i>so wise</i>, surely ye can see the propriety of abominating idolatry of every kind: for an idol is nothing in the world, and can do nothing <i>for</i> you and nothing <i>against</i> you.</p>
