<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16">1 Corinthians 10:16</span>. <i><b>The cup of blessing</b></i> — The apostle speaks here of the Eucharist, which he illustrates by the כוס הברכה <i>cos habberacah</i>, cup of blessing, over which thanks were expressed at the conclusion of the passover. See this largely explained at the conclusion of <i>Clarke's notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:75">Matthew 26:75</span><i>"</i>, and in my <i>Discourse upon the Eucharist</i>, 8vo. 2d edit. 1814.</p>
<p><i><b>The communion of the blood of Christ?</b></i> — We who partake of this sacred cup, in commemoration of the death of Christ, are <i>made</i> <i>partakers of his body and blood</i>, and thus have <i>fellowship</i> with him; as those who partake of an <i>idol feast</i>, thereby, as much as they can, participate with the idol, to whom the sacrifice was offered. This I have proved at large in the above tract, to which I must refer the reader, as the subject is too voluminous to be inserted here.</p>
