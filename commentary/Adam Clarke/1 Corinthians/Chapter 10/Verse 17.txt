<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For we</b></i><b>, being many, </b><i><b>are one bread</b></i> â€” The original would be better translated thus: <i>Because there is one bread</i>, or <i>loaf; we, who are many, are one body</i>. As only one loaf was used at the passover, and those who partook of it were considered to be <i>one religious body</i>; so we who partake of the <i>eucharistical bread</i> and <i>wine</i>, in commemoration of the sacrificial death of Christ, are one spiritual society, because we are all made partakers of that <i>one Christ</i> whose blood was shed for us to make an atonement for our sins; as the blood of the paschal lamb was shed and sprinkled in reference to this of which it was the type.</p>
