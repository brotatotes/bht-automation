<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Behold Israel after the flesh</b></i> â€” The Jews not yet <i>converted</i> to Christianity: the latter being <i>Israel after the</i> <i>Spirit</i>. As the design of the apostle was to withdraw his converts at Corinth from all temptations to idolatry, he produces two <i>examples</i> to show the propriety of his endeavours.</p>
<p>1. All who join together in celebrating the Lord's Supper, and are partakers of that one bread, give proof by this that they are Christians, and have fellowship with Christ.</p>
<p>2. All the Israelites who offer sacrifice, and partake of those sacrifices, give proof thereby that they are Jews, and are in fellowship with the object of their worship: so they who join in idol festivals, and eat things which have been offered to idols, give proof that they are in <i>communion</i> <i>with those idolaters</i>, and that they have <i>fellowship with the</i> <i>demons</i> they worship.</p>
