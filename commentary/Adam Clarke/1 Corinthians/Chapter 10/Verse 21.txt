<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord</b></i> â€” It is in vain that you who frequent these idol festivals profess the religion of Christ, and commemorate his death and passion in the holy eucharist; for you can not have that fellowship with Christ which this ordinance implies, while you are partakers of the table of demons. That the Gentiles, in their sacrifices, fed on the slain beasts, and ate bread and drank wine in honour of their gods, is sufficiently clear from various accounts. <i>See my Discourse on the</i> <i>Holy Eucharist</i>, where many examples are produced. The following from Virgil, AEn. viii, verse 179-273, is proof in point:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> In bowls; the priests renewed the rites divine:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Broiled entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Fill high the <i>goblets</i> with a sparkling flood,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And with <i>deep draughts invoke our common god.</i> </p>
