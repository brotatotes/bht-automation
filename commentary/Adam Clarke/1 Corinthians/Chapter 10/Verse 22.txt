<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?</b></i> — All idolatry is represented as a sort of spiritual <i>adultery</i>; it is giving that heart to Satan that should be devoted to God; and he is represented as being <i>jealous</i>, because of the infidelity of those who have <i>covenanted</i> to give their hearts to him.</p>
<p><i><b>Are we stronger than he?</b></i> — As he has threatened to punish such transgressors, and will infallibly do it, can we resist his omnipotence? A sinner should consider, while he is in rebellion against God, whether he be able to resist that power whereby God will inflict vengeance.</p>
