<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles</b></i><b>, that </b><i><b>eat</b></i> — The case to which the apostle refers is simply this; it was customary to bring the flesh of the animal to market, the blood of which had been poured out in sacrifice to an idol; or, taken more <i>particularly</i>, the case was this; <i>one</i> part of the sacrifice was <i>consumed</i> on the altar of the idol: a <i>second</i> part was <i>dressed</i> and eaten by the <i>sacrificer</i>; and a <i>third</i> belonged to the <i>priest</i>, and was often sold in the shambles. To partake of the <i>second share</i>, or to <i>feast upon the sacrifice</i>, St. Paul absolutely forbids, because this was one <i>part of the religious worship</i> which was paid to the <i>idol</i>; it was sitting down as guests at his table, in token that they were in <i>fellowship</i> with him. This was utterly incompatible with receiving the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which was the <i>communion of the body and blood of Christ</i>. But as to the <i>third</i> share, the apostle leaves them at liberty either to eat of it or forbear; except that, by eating, their weak brethren should be offended; in that case, though the thing was <i>lawful</i>, it was their duty to abstain. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>, c. <i>Hindoos</i> eagerly embrace whatever has been offered to an idol: hence it is common to see the <i>flowers</i> that have been thus <i>offered</i> placed in the hair of a Hindoo. <i>Water</i> that has been thus made sacred is preserved in Hindoo houses, and with it they rub their bodies, and occasionally <i>sip</i> a <i>drop</i>, regarding it as the water <i>of</i> <i>life</i>.-See <i>Ward</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Asking no questions for consciences sake</b></i> — Dr. Lightfoot observes, that "the Jews were vexed with innumerable scruples in their <i>feasts</i>, as to the <i>eating</i> of the <i>thing</i>, as well as to the <i>company</i> with which they ate and even the <i>manner</i> of their eating. Of <i>fruits</i> and <i>herbs</i> brought to the table, they were to inquire whether they were <i>tithed</i> according to custom; whether they were consecrated by the <i>Truma</i>, or whether they were profane; whether they were clean, or touched with some pollution, c. And concerning <i>flesh</i> set on the table, they were to inquire whether it was of that which had been offered to idols whether it were the flesh of an <i>animal</i> that had been <i>torn</i> by wild beasts; or of that which had been <i>strangled</i>, or not <i>killed</i> according to the <i>canons</i>; &amp;c., &amp;c. All which doubts the liberty of the Gospel abolished as to one's own conscience, with this <i>proviso</i>, that no scandal or offence be cast before another man's weak or scrupulous conscience."</p>
<p>From this it is evident that the apostle had the case of the <i>Jewish converts</i> in view, and not the Gentiles. The latter were not troubled with such extraordinary scrupulousness.</p>
