<p>Verse 28. <i><b>This is offered in sacrifice unto idols</b></i> — While they were not apprized of this circumstance they might lawfully eat; but when told that the flesh set before them had been offered to an idol, then they were not to eat, for the sake of his weak conscience who pointed out the circumstance. For the apostle still takes it for granted that even the flesh offered in sacrifice to an idol might be eaten innocently at any <i>private</i> table, as in that case they were no longer in danger of being <i>partakers with devils</i>, as this was no idol festival.</p>
<p><i><b>For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof</b></i> — This whole clause, which appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:26">1 Corinthians 10:26</span>, is wanting here in ABCDEFGH, several others, the <i>Syriac, Erpen, Coptic, Sahidic,</i> <i>AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala</i>; and in several of the <i>fathers</i>. Griesbach has left it out of the text: and Professor <i>White</i> says, "<i>Certissime delendum</i>;" it should most undoubtedly be erased. It has scarcely any authority to support it.</p>
