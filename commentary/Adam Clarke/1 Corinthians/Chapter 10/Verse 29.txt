<p>Verse 29. 30. <i><b>For why is my liberty judged of another man's</b></i><b> </b><i><b>conscience?</b></i><b> c.</b>] Though in the case of flesh offered to idols, and other matters connected with idolatry, (on which it appears there was much of a tender conscience among some of the Corinthians,) it was necessary to sacrifice something to an over-scrupulous conscience, yet the Gospel of Christ did not lay any man under this general burthen, that he must do nothing at which <i>any weak brother</i> might <i>feel hurt</i> or be <i>stumbled</i> for the liberty of the Gospel must not take for its <i>rule</i> the scrupulosity of any conscience for if a man, by <i>grace</i>-by the allowance or authority of the Gospel, partake of any thing that God's bounty has sent, and which the Gospel has not forbidden, and give thanks to God for the blessing, no man has right or authority to condemn such a person. This seems to be the meaning of these two verses; and they read a lesson of caution to rash judges, and to those who are apt to take offence.</p>
