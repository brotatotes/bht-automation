Verse 31. Whether therefore ye eat, or drink â€” As no general rule can be laid down in reference to the above particulars, there is one maxim of which no Christian must lose sight-that whether he eats or drinks of this or the other kind of aliments, or whatever else he may do, he must do it so as to bring glory to God. This is a sufficient rule to regulate every man's conscience and practice in all indifferent things, where there are no express commands or prohibitions.
