<p>Verse 31. <i><b>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink</b></i> â€” As no general rule can be laid down in reference to the above particulars, there is one maxim of which no Christian must lose sight-<i>that whether he</i> <i>eats or drinks</i> of this or the other kind of aliments, or <i>whatever</i> <i>else</i> he may <i>do</i>, he must do it so as to bring <i>glory to God</i>. This is a sufficient rule to regulate every man's conscience and practice in all <i>indifferent</i> things, where there are no express commands or prohibitions.</p>
