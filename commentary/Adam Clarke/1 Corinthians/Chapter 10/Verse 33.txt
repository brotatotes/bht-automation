<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:33">1 Corinthians 10:33</span>. <i><b>Even as I please all men</b></i> â€” Act as <i>I</i> do: forgetting myself, my own interests, convenience, ease, and comfort, I labour for the welfare of others; and particularly that they may be <i>saved</i>. How blessed and amiable was the spirit and conduct of this holy man!</p>
<p>THIS chapter has already presented the serious reader with a variety of maxims for his regulation.--</p>
<p>1. As to his own <i>private</i> <i>walk</i>;</p>
<p>2. His <i>domestic duties</i>; and</p>
<p>3. His connection with the <i>Church</i> of God.</p>
<p>Let us review some of the principal parts.</p>
<p>1. We should be on our guard against what are called <i>little</i> <i>sins</i>, and all <i>occasions</i> and <i>excitements</i> to sin. Take heed what <i>company</i> you frequent. One thing, apparently <i>harmless</i>, may lead by almost imperceptible links to sins of the <i>deepest dye</i>. See the example in this chapter: 1. The people sat down to <i>eat</i> and <i>to</i> <i>drink</i>. 2. They rose up to <i>play, dance</i>, and <i>sing</i>: and 3. They committed <i>fornication</i>, and brought upon themselves <i>swift</i> <i>destruction</i>.</p>
<p>2. However conscious we may be of our own sincerity and uprightness, we should ever distrust ourselves. God has made nothing <i>independent</i> of himself; the soul has no principle of self-dependence either in itself or its attainments: it is wise, powerful, and happy, only while it is depending on infinite wisdom, unlimited power, and endless mercy.</p>
<p>3. The Gentiles were in communion with demons by their idolatrous services. In what communion are those who feed themselves without fear, who eat with the glutton and drink with the drunkard? So they partake of the Lord Jesus who are under the influence of pride, self-will, hatred, censoriousness, c., and who carry their self-importance and worldly spirit even into the house and worship of God?</p>
<p>4. A spirit of <i>curiosity</i> too much indulged may, in an irreligious man, lead to <i>covetousness</i> and <i>theft</i>: in a godly man, to a <i>troublesome</i> and <i>unscriptural scrupulosity</i> of conscience, productive of nothing but uneasiness to itself, and disturbance to others. <i>Simplicity</i> of heart saves from this, and is an excellent <i>gift</i>.</p>
<p>5. In many actions we have a <i>twofold</i> rule-the <i>testimony</i> of God and <i>charity</i>: and in many things <i>charity</i> is the best interpreter of the <i>testimony</i>. The testimony often <i>permits</i> what <i>charity forbids</i>, because circumstances in time, place, c., may render a thing improper on one occasion that might be proper on another.</p>
<p>6. Pious Quesnel has well said: Every thing <i>honours</i> God when it is done for his sake every thing <i>dishonours</i> him when any ultimate end is proposed beside his <i>glory</i>. It is an unchangeable principle of the Christian morality that all comes from God by his <i>love</i>, and all should be returned to him by ours. This rule we should keep inviolate.</p>
<p>7. Though many of the advices given in this chapter appear to respect the Corinthians alone, yet there is none of them that is not applicable to Christians in general in certain circumstances. God has given no portion of his word to any people or age exclusively the <i>whole</i> is given to the Church universal in all ages of the world. In reading this epistle let us seriously consider what parts of it apply to ourselves; and if we are disposed to appropriate its <i>promises</i>, let us act conscientiously, and inquire how many of its <i>reprehensions</i> we may fairly appropriate also.</p>
