<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span>. <i><b>Spiritual drink</b></i> — By the βρωμα πνευματικον <i>spiritual</i> <i>meat</i>, and πομα πνευματικον, <i>spiritual drink</i>, the apostle certainly means both <i>meat</i> and <i>drink</i>, which were furnished to the Israelitish assembly <i>miraculously</i>, as well as <i>typically</i>: and he appears to borrow his expression from the Jews themselves, who expressly say הלחם הלז רוחני <i>hallechem hallaz ruchani</i>, that bread was spiritual, and מיים רוחניים היו <i>meyim ruchainiyim haiu</i>, the waters were spiritual. <i>Alschech</i> in legem. fol. 238, to which opinion the apostle seems particularly to refer. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The spiritual rock that followed them</b></i> — There is some difficulty in this verse. How could the rock <i>follow</i> them? It does not appear that the rock ever moved from the place where Moses struck it. But to solve this difficulty, it is said that <i>rock</i> here is put, by metonymy, for the <i>water</i> of the rock; and that this water did follow them through the wilderness. This is more likely; but we have not direct proof of it. The ancient Jews, however, were of this opinion, and state that the streams followed them in all their journeyings, up the mountains, down the valleys, c., c. and that when they came to encamp, the waters formed themselves into <i>cisterns</i> and <i>pools</i> and that the rulers of the people guided them, by their staves, in rivulets to the different tribes and families. And this is the sense they give to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:17">Numbers 21:17</span>: <i>Spring up, O well</i>, c. See the places in <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>Others contend, that by the <i>rock following them</i> we are to understand their having <i>carried of its waters</i> with them on their journeyings. This we know is a common custom in these deserts to the present day and that the Greek verb ακολουθεω, <i>to follow</i>, has this sense, Bishop Pearce has amply proved in his note on this place. The Jews suppose that the <i>rock</i> itself went with the Israelites, and was present with them in their thirty-eight stations, for only so many are mentioned. See <i>Alschech</i> in legem. fol. 236. And see <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>Now, though of all the senses already given that of Bishop Pearce is the best, yet it does appear that the apostle does not speak about the <i>rock</i> itself, but of <i>Him</i> whom it represented; namely, Christ: this was the Rock that followed them, and ministered to them; and this view of the subject is rendered more probable by what is said <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:9">1 Corinthians 10:9</span>, that they tempted <i>Christ</i>, and were destroyed by serpents. The same rock is in the <i>vale of Rephidim</i> to the present day; and it bears aboriginal marks of the water that flowed from it in the <i>fissures</i> that appear on its sides. It is one block of fine <i>granite</i>, about seven yards long, five broad, and - high. A fragment of this typical rock now lies before me, brought by a relative of my own, who broke it off, and did not let it pass into any hand till he placed it in mine. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:6">Exodus 17:6</span>.</p>
