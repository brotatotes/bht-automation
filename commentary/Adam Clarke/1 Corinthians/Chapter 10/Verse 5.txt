<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:5">1 Corinthians 10:5</span>. <i><b>They were overthrown in the wilderness.</b></i> â€” And yet ALL these persons <i>were under the cloud</i> - ALL <i>passed through the sea</i> - ALL <i>were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea</i> - ALL <i>ate the</i> <i>same spiritual meat</i> - ALL <i>drank the same spiritual drink</i>, for they were made partakers of the spiritual Rock, CHRIST. Nothing can be a more decisive proof than this that people, who have every outward ordinance, and are made partakers of the grace of our Lord Jesus, may so abuse their privileges and grieve the Spirit of God as to fall from their state of grace, and perish ever lastingly. Let those who are continually asserting that this is impossible, beware lest they themselves, <i>if</i> in a state of grace, become, through their overmuch security, proofs in point of the possibility of ending in the <i>flesh</i>, though they began in the <i>Spirit</i>. Reader, remember who said, <i>Ye shall not surely die</i>; and remember the mischiefs produced by a belief of his doctrine.</p>
