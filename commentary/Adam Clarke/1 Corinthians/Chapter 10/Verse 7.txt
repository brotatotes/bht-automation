<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:7">1 Corinthians 10:7</span>. <i><b>Neither be ye idolaters</b></i> — The apostle considers partaking of the idolatrous feasts as being real acts of <i>idolatry</i>; because those who offered the flesh to their gods considered them as feeding invisibly with them on the flesh thus offered, and that every one that partook of the feast was a real participator with the god to whom the flesh or animal had been offered in sacrifice.

<p><i><b>Rose up to play.</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:6">Exodus 32:6</span>. The Jews generally explain this word as implying <i>idolatrous acts</i> only: I have considered it as implying acts of <i>impurity</i>, with which idolatrous acts were often accompanied. It also means those <i>dances</i> which were practised in honour of their gods. That this is one meaning of the verb παιζειν, <i>Kypke</i> has largely proved. The whole idolatrous process was as follows:</p>
<p>1. The proper victim was prepared and set apart.</p>
<p>2. It was slain, and its blood poured out at the altar of the deity.</p>
<p>3. The flesh was dressed, and the priests and offerers feasted on it, and thus endeavoured to establish a <i>communion</i> between <i>themselves</i> and the <i>object</i> of their <i>worship</i>.</p>
<p>4. After eating, they had idolatrous dances in honour of their god; and,</p>
<p>5. as might be expected, <i>impure mixtures</i>, in consequence of those <i>dances. The people sat down to eat and to</i> <i>drink, and rose up to play</i>; and it is in reference to this issue of idolatrous feasts and dancings that the apostle immediately subjoins: <i>Neither let us commit</i> FORNICATION, &amp;c.</p>
