<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:8">1 Corinthians 10:8</span>. <i><b>Fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:9">Numbers 25:9</span>, the number <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:0">Isaiah 24:0</span>; and, allowing this to be the genuine reading, (and none of the Hebrew MSS. exhibit any various reading in the place,) Moses and the apostle may be thus reconciled: in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:4">Numbers 25:4</span>, God commands Moses to <i>take all the heads</i> (the rulers) <i>of the</i> <i>people, and hang them up before the Lord against the sun</i>; these possibly amounted to 1000, and those who fell by the <i>plague</i> were 23,000, so that the whole amounted to 24,000. Instead of εικοσιτρεις χιλιαδες, 23,000, two MSS., with the later <i>Syriac</i> and the <i>Armenian</i>, have εικοσιτεσσαρες χιλιαδες, 24,000; but this authority is too slender to establish a various reading, which recedes so much from the received text. I think the discordance may be best accounted for by supposing, as above, that <i>Phineas</i> and his <i>companions</i> might have slain 1000 men, who were heads of the people, and chief in this idolatry; and that the plague sent from the Lord destroyed 23,000 more; so an equal number to the whole tribe of Levi perished in one day, who were just 23,000. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+26:62">Numbers 26:62</span>; and see Lightfoot.</p>
