<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:9">1 Corinthians 10:9</span>. <i><b>Neither let us tempt Christ</b></i> — I have already supposed, in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:4">1 Corinthians 10:4</span><i>"</i>, that Christ is intended by the spiritual rock that followed them: and that it was <i>he</i>, not the rock, that did <i>follow</i> or <i>accompany</i> the Israelites in the wilderness. This was the angel of God's presence who <i>was with the</i> <i>Church in the wilderness, to whom our fathers would not obey</i>, as St. Stephen says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:39">Acts 7:39</span>. Instead of χριστον, <i>Christ</i>, several MSS. and a few versions have κυριον, <i>the Lord</i>, and some few θεον, <i>God</i>. But though some respectable MSS. have <i>the Lord</i> instead of <i>Christ</i>, yet this latter has the greatest proportion of authority on its side. And this affords no mean proof that the person who is called <i>Yehovah</i> in the Old Testament, is called <i>Christ</i> in the New. By <i>tempting</i> <i>Christ</i> is meant disbelieving the providence and goodness of God; and presuming to prescribe to him how he should send them the necessary supplies, and of what kind they should be, &amp;c.</p>
