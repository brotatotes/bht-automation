<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:10">1 Corinthians 11:10</span>. <i><b>For this cause ought the woman to have power on</b></i><b> her </b><i><b>head because of the angels.</b></i> — There are few portions in the sacred writings that have given rise to such a variety of conjectures and explanations, and are less understood, than this verse, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:29">1 Corinthians 15:29</span>. Our translators were puzzled with it; and have inserted here one of the largest marginal readings found any where in their work; but this is only on the words <i>power on her</i> <i>head</i>, which they interpret thus: that is, <i>a covering, in sign that</i> <i>she is under the power of her husband</i>. But, admitting this marginal reading to be a satisfactory solution so far as it goes, it by no means removes all the difficulty. Mr. Locke ingenuously acknowledged that he did not understand the meaning of the words; and almost every critic and learned man has a different explanation. Some have endeavoured to <i>force</i> out a meaning by <i>altering</i> the text. The emendation of Mr. Toup, of Cornwall, is the most remarkable: he reads εξιουσα, <i>going out</i>, instead of εξουσιαν, <i>power</i>; wherefore the woman, <i>when she goes out</i>, should <i>have a veil on her head</i>. Whatever ingenuity there may appear in this emendation, the consideration that it is not acknowledged by any MS., or <i>version</i>, or primitive writer, is sufficient proof against it. Dr. Lightfoot, Schoettgen, and Bishop Pearce, have written best on the subject, in which they allow that there are many difficulties. The latter contends, 1. That the original should be read, <i>Wherefore the woman ought to have</i> A <i>power upon her</i> <i>head</i>, that is, the power of the husband over the wife; the word <i>power</i> standing for the <i>sign</i> or <i>token</i> of that power which was a <i>covering</i> or <i>veil. Theophylact</i> explains the word, το του εξουσιαζεσθαι συμβολον, τουτεστι, το καλυμμα, "the symbol of being under power, that is, a <i>veil</i>, or <i>covering</i>." And <i>Photius</i> explains it thus: της υποταγης συμβολον το επι της κεφαλης καλυμμα φερειν; <i>to wear a veil on the head is a symbol of subjection</i>. It is no unusual thing, in the Old and New Testament, for the <i>signs</i> and <i>tokens</i> of things to be called by the names of the <i>things</i> <i>themselves</i>, for thus <i>circumcision</i> is called the <i>covenant</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:10">Genesis 17:10</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:13">Genesis 17:13</span>, though it was only the <i>sign</i> of it.</p>
<p>2. The word <i>angels</i> presents another difficulty. Some suppose that by these the apostle means the <i>fallen angels</i>, or devils; others, the <i>governors of the Church</i>; and others, those who were <i>deputed</i> among the Jews <i>to espouse a virgin in the name of a lover</i>. All these senses the learned bishop rejects, and believes that the apostle uses the word <i>angels</i>, in its most obvious sense, for the heavenly angels; and that he speaks according to the notion which then prevailed among Jews, that the holy angels interested themselves in the affairs of men, and particularly were present in their religious assemblies, as the cherubim, their representation, were present in their temple. Thus we read in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ec+5:6">Ecclesiastes 5:6</span>: <i>Neither say thou before the</i> ANGEL, <i>it was an error</i>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:21">1 Timothy 5:21</span>: <i>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect</i> ANGELS, c. Parallel to these is what Agrippa says in his oration to the Jews, Josephus, War, b. ii. chap. 16: <i>I protest before God,</i> <i>your holy temple, and all the</i> ANGELS <i>of heaven</i>, c. All which passages <i>suppose</i>, or were spoken to <i>those who supposed</i>, that the angels know what passes here upon earth. The notion, whether just or not, prevailed among the Jews and if so, St. Paul might speak according to the common opinion.</p>
<p>3. Another difficulty lies in the phrase διατουτο, <i>wherefore</i>, which shows that this verse is a <i>conclusion</i> from what the apostle was arguing before which we may understand thus: that his conclusion, from the foregoing argument, ought to have the more weight, upon account of the presence, real or supposed, of the holy angels, at their religious meetings. See Bishop <i>Pearce</i>, in loc.</p>
<p>The learned bishop is not very willing to allow that the doctrine of the presence of angelic beings in religious assemblies is legitimate; but what difficulty can there be in this, if we take the words of the apostle in another place: <i>Are they not all</i> <i>ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be</i> <i>heirs of salvation</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>. And perhaps there is no time in which they can render more essential services to the followers of God than when they are engaged in Divine ordinances. On the whole, the bishop's sense of the passage and paraphrase stands thus: "And because of this superiority in the man, I conclude that the woman should have on her head a veil, the mark of her husband's power over her, especially in the religious assemblies, where the angels are supposed to be invisibly present."</p>
<p>The ancient versions make little alteration in the common reading, and the MSS. leave the verse nearly as it stands in the common printed editions. The Armenian has a word that answers to <i>umbram</i>, a shade or <i>covering</i>. The AEthiopic, <i>her head should be</i> <i>veiled</i>. The common editions of the Vulgate have <i>potestatem</i>, power; but in an ancient edition of the Vulgate, perhaps one of the first, if not the first, ever <i>printed</i>, 2 vols. fol., <i>sine ulla</i> <i>nota anni</i>, c.: the verse stands thus: <i>Ideo debet mulier</i> velamen <i>habere super caput suum: et propter angelos</i>. My old MS. translation seems to have been taken from a MS. which had the same reading: <i>Wherefore the woman schal haue a veyl on her heuyd and</i> <i>for aungels</i>. Some copies of the <i>Itala</i> have also <i>velamen</i>, a veil.</p>
<p>In his view of this text, <i>Kypke</i> differs from all others; and nothing that so judicious a critic advances should be lightly regarded. 1. He contends that εξουσιαν occurs nowhere in the sense of <i>veil</i>, and yet he supposes that the word καλυμμα, <i>veil</i> is understood, and must in the translation of the passage be supplied. 2. He directs that a comma be placed after εξουσιαν, and that it be construed with οφειλει, <i>ought</i>; after which he translates the verse thus: <i>Propterea mulier potestati obnoxia est,</i> <i>ita ut velamen in capite habeat propter angelos</i>; On this account the woman is subject to power, so that she should have a veil on her head, because of the angels. 3. He contends that both the Latins and Greeks use <i>debere</i> and οφειλειν elegantly to express that to which one is <i>obnoxious</i> or <i>liable</i>. So <i>Horace</i>:- </p>
<p>4. He contends that the words taken in this sense agree perfectly with the context, and with διατουτο, <i>wherefore</i>, in this verse, "Because the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man, <i>therefore</i> she is subject to his authority, and should have a veil on her head as a token of that subjection; and particularly before the holy angels, who are present in the congregations of the saints."</p>
<p>For Dr. Lightfoot's opinion, that by <i>angels</i> we are to understand the <i>paranymphs</i>, or messengers who came on the part of others, to look out for proper spouses for their friends, I must refer to his works, vol. ii. fol., p. 772. The reader has now before him every thing that is likely to cast light on this difficult subject, and he must either adopt what he judges to be best, or else <i>think for himself</i>.</p>
<p>After all, the custom of the <i>Nazarite</i> may cast some light upon this place. As <i>Nazarite</i> means one who has <i>separated</i> himself by vow to some religious austerity, wearing his <i>own hair</i>, c. so a married woman was considered a <i>Nazarite</i> for life; i.e. separated from all others, and <i>joined</i> to <i>one husband</i>, who is her lord: and hence the apostle, alluding to this circumstance, says, <i>The woman</i> <i>ought to have power on her head</i>, i.e. wear <i>her hair</i> and <i>veil</i>, for her <i>hair</i> is a proof of her being a <i>Nazarite</i>, and of her subjection to <i>her husband</i>, as the Nazarite was under subjection to the Lord, according to the rule or law of his order.
