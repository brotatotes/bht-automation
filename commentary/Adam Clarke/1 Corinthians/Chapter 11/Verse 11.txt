<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:11">1 Corinthians 11:11</span>. <i><b>Neither</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the man without the woman</b></i> — The apostle seems to say: I do not intimate any <i>disparagement</i> of the female sex, by insisting on the necessity of her being under the power or authority of the man; for they are both equally dependent on each other, <i>in the Lord</i>, ενκυριω: but instead of this reading, Theodoret has εν τωκοσμω, <i>in the world</i>. Probably the apostle means that the human race is continued by an especial providence of God. Others think that he means that men and women equally make a Christian society, and in it have equal rights and privileges.</p>
