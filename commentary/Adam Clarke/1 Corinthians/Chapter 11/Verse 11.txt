Verse 1 Corinthians 11:11. Neither is the man without the woman — The apostle seems to say: I do not intimate any disparagement of the female sex, by insisting on the necessity of her being under the power or authority of the man; for they are both equally dependent on each other, in the Lord, ενκυριω: but instead of this reading, Theodoret has εν τωκοσμω, in the world. Probably the apostle means that the human race is continued by an especial providence of God. Others think that he means that men and women equally make a Christian society, and in it have equal rights and privileges.
