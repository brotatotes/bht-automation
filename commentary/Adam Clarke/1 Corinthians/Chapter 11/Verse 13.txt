<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:13">1 Corinthians 11:13</span>. <i><b>Judge in yourselves</b></i> â€” Consider the subject <i>in your</i> <i>own common sense</i>, and then say whether it be decent for a woman to pray in public without a veil on her head? The heathen priestesses prayed or delivered their oracles bare-headed or with dishevelled hair, <i>non comptae mansere comae</i>, as in the case of the Cumaean Sibyl, AEn. vi., ver. 48, and otherwise in great disorder: to be conformed to <i>them</i> would be very disgraceful to Christian women. And in reference to such things as these, the apostle appeals to their sense of honour and decency.</p>
