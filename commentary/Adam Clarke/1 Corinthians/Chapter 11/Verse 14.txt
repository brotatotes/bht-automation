<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:14">1 Corinthians 11:14</span>. <i><b>Doth not - nature - teach you, that, if a man have long</b></i><b> </b><i><b>hair</b></i> — Nature certainly teaches us, by bestowing it, that it is proper for women to have long hair; and it is not so with men. The hair of the male rarely grows like that of a female, unless <i>art</i> is used, and even then it bears but a scanty proportion to the former. Hence it is truly <i>womanish</i> to have long hair, and it is a shame to the man who affects it. In ancient times the people of Achaia, the province in which Corinth stood, and the Greeks in general, were noted for their <i>long hair</i>; and hence called by <i>Homer</i>, in a great variety of places, καρηκομοωντεςαχαιοι, <i>the</i> <i>long-haired Greeks</i>, or <i>Achaeans</i>. Soldiers, in different countries, have been distinguished for <i>their long hair</i>; but whether this can be said to their praise or blame, or whether <i>Homer</i> uses it always as a term of respect, when he applies it to the Greeks, I shall not wait here to inquire. <i>Long hair</i> was certainly not in repute among the Jews. The Nazarites let their hair grow, but it was as a token of <i>humiliation</i>; and it is possible that St. Paul had this in view. There were consequently two reasons why the apostle should condemn this practice: - </p>
<p>1. Because it was a sign of <i>humiliation</i>;</p>
<p>2. Because it was <i>womanish</i>.</p>
<p>After all it is possible that St. Paul may refer to <i>dressed,</i> <i>frizzled</i> and <i>curled hair</i>, which shallow and effeminate men might have affected in <i>that time</i>, as they do in <i>this</i>. Perhaps there is not a sight more ridiculous in the eye of common sense than a high-dressed, curled, cued, and powdered head, with which the <i>operator</i> must have taken considerable pains, and the silly <i>patient</i> lost much time and comfort in submitting to what all but senseless custom must call an indignity and degradation. Hear <i>nature</i>, common sense, and reason, and they will inform you, <i>that if a man have</i> <i>long hair, it is a shame unto him</i>.</p>
