<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:15">1 Corinthians 11:15</span>. <i><b>But if a woman have long hair</b></i> â€” The Author of their being has given a larger proportion of hair to the head of women than to that of men; and to them it is an especial ornament, and may in various cases serve as a <i>veil</i>.</p>
<p>It is a certain fact that a man's long hair renders him contemptible, and a woman's long hair renders her more amiable. <i>Nature</i> and the <i>apostle</i> speak the same language; we may account for it as we please.</p>
