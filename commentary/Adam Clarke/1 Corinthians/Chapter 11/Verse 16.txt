<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:16">1 Corinthians 11:16</span>. <i><b>But if any man seem to be contentious</b></i> — Ει δε τις δοκει φιλονεικος ειναι· If any person <i>sets himself up</i> as a wrangler-<i>puts himself forward</i> as a defender of such points, that a <i>woman may pray or teach with her head uncovered</i>, and that <i>a man</i> may, without reproach, <i>have long hair</i>; let him know that we have no such custom as either, nor are they sanctioned by any of the Churches of God, whether among the <i>Jews</i> or the <i>Gentiles</i>. We have already seen that the verb δοκειν, which we translate to <i>seem</i>, generally <i>strengthens</i> and increases the sense. From the attention that the apostle has paid to the subject of <i>veils</i> and <i>hair</i>, it is evident that it must have occasioned considerable disturbance in the Church of Corinth. They have produced evil effects in much later times.</p>
