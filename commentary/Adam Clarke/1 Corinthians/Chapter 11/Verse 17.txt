<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Now in this - I praise you not</b></i> — In the beginning of this epistle the apostle did <i>praise</i> them for their attention in general to the rules he had laid down, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>; but here he is obliged to <i>condemn</i> certain irregularities which had crept in among them, particularly relative to the celebration of the Lord's Supper. Through some false teaching which they had received, in the absence of the apostle, they appear to have celebrated it precisely in the same way the Jews did their <i>passover</i>. That, we know, was a regular meal, only accompanied with certain peculiar circumstances and ceremonies: two of these ceremonies were, eating bread, solemnly broken, and drinking a cup of wine called the cup of blessing. Now, it is certain that our Lord has taken these two things, and made them expressive of the <i>crucifixion</i> of his <i>body</i>, and the <i>shedding</i> of his <i>blood</i>, as an atonement for the sins of mankind. The teachers which had crept into the Corinthian Church appear to have perverted the whole of this Divine institution; for the celebration of the Lord's Supper appears to have been made among them a part of an <i>ordinary</i> meal. The people came together, and it appears brought their provisions with them; some had much, others had less; some ate to excess, others had scarcely enough to suffice nature. <i>One was hungry</i>, and the <i>other was drunken</i>, μεθυει, <i>was filled to the full</i>; this is the sense of the word in many places of Scripture. At the conclusion of this irregular meal they appear to have done something in reference to our Lord's institution, but more resembling the Jewish passover. These irregularities, connected with so many indecencies, the apostle reproves; for, instead of being <i>benefited</i> by the Divine ordinance, they were <i>injured</i>; they <i>came together not for the better, but for</i> <i>the worse</i>.</p>
