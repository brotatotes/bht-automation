<p>Verse 18. <i><b>There be divisions among you</b></i> — They had σχισματα, <i>schisms</i>, among them: the old parties were kept up, even in the place where they assembled to eat the <i>Lord's Supper</i>. The Paulians, the Kephites, and the Apollonians, continued to be distinct parties; and ate their meals separately, even in the same house.</p>
