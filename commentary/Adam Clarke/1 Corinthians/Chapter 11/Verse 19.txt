<p>Verse 19. <i><b>There must be also heresies</b></i> — αιρεσεις. Not a common <i>consent</i> of the members of the Church, either in the <i>doctrines</i> of the Gospel, or in the <i>ceremonies</i> of the Christian religion. Their difference in religious <i>opinion</i> led to a difference in their religious <i>practice</i>, and thus the Church of God, that should have been one body, was split into sects and parties. The <i>divisions</i> and the <i>heresies</i> sprung out of each other. I have spoken largely on the word <i>heresy</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>, to which place I beg leave to refer the reader.</p>
