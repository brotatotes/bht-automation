<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Every one taketh before - his own supper</b></i> â€” They had a grand feast, though the different sects kept in parties by themselves; but all took as ample a supper as they could provide, (each bringing his own provisions with him,) before they took what was called the <i>Lord's Supper</i>.
