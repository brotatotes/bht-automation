Verse 21. Every one taketh before - his own supper â€” They had a grand feast, though the different sects kept in parties by themselves; but all took as ample a supper as they could provide, (each bringing his own provisions with him,) before they took what was called the Lord's Supper. See note on 1 Corinthians 11:17.
