Verse 22. Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? — They should have taken their ordinary meal at home, and have come together in the church to celebrate the Lord's Supper.Despise ye the church of God — Ye render the sacred assembly and the place contemptible by your conduct, and ye show yourselves destitute of that respect which ye owe to the place set apart for Divine worship.And shame them that have not? — τους μη εχοντας, Them that are poor; not them who had not victuals at that time, but those who are so poor as to be incapable of furnishing themselves as others had done. Matthew 13:12.
