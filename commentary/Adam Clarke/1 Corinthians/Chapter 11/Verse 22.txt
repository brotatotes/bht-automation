<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?</b></i> — They should have taken their ordinary meal at <i>home</i>, and have come together in the church to celebrate the Lord's Supper.</p>
<p><i><b>Despise ye the church of God</b></i> — Ye render the sacred assembly and the place contemptible by your conduct, and ye show yourselves destitute of that respect which ye owe to the place set apart for Divine worship.</p>
<p><i><b>And shame them that have not?</b></i> — τους μη εχοντας, <i>Them that are</i> <i>poor</i>; not them who <i>had not victuals</i> at that time, but those who are <i>so poor</i> as to be incapable of furnishing themselves as others had done. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:12">Matthew 13:12</span>.</p>
