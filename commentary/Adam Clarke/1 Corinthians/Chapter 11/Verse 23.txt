<p>Verse 23. <i><b>I have received of the Lord</b></i> — It is possible that several of the people at Corinth did receive the bread and wine of the eucharist as they did the paschal bread and wine, as a mere commemoration of an event. And as our Lord had by this institution consecrated that bread and wine, not to be the means of commemorating the deliverance from Egypt, and their joy on the account, but their deliverance from sin and death by his passion and cross; therefore the apostle states that he had received from the Lord what he delivered; <i>viz</i>. that the eucharistic bread and wine were to be understood of the accomplishment of that of which the paschal lamb was the type-the body broken for them, the blood shed for them.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord Jesus-took bread</b></i> — See the whole of this account, collated with the parallel passages in the four Gospels, amply explained in my <i>Discourse on the Eucharist</i>, and in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:12">Matthew 26:12</span>.</p>
