<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Whosoever shall eat - and drink - unworthily</b></i> â€” To put a final end to controversies and perplexities relative to these words and the context, let the reader observe, that to <i>eat</i> and <i>drink</i> the <i>bread</i> and <i>wine</i> in the Lord's Supper <i>unworthily</i>, is to eat and drink as the Corinthians did, who ate it not in reference to Jesus Christ's sacrificial death; but rather in such a way as the Israelites did the passover, which they celebrated in remembrance of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. Likewise, these mongrel Christians at Corinth used it as a kind of historical commemoration of the death of Christ; and did not, in the whole institution, discern the Lord's body and blood as a sacrificial offering for sin: and besides, in their celebration of it they acted in a way utterly unbecoming the gravity of a sacred ordinance. Those who acknowledge it as a sacrificial offering, and receive it in remembrance of God's love to them in sending his Son into the world, can neither bring <i>damnation</i> upon themselves by so doing, nor eat nor drink <i>unworthily</i>. See our translation of this verse vindicated at the end of the chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:34">1 Corinthians 11:34</span>.</p>
<p>Shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. If he use it irreverently, if he deny that Christ suffered unjustly, (for of some such persons the apostle must be understood to speak,) then he in effect joins issue with the Jews in their condemnation and crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, and renders himself guilty of the death of our blessed Lord. Some, however, understand the passage thus: is guilty, <i>i.e.</i> eats and drinks unworthily, and brings on himself that punishment mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30">1 Corinthians 11:30</span>.</p>
