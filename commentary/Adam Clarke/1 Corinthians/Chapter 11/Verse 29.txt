<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Eateth and drinketh damnation</b></i> — κριμα, <i>Judgment,</i> <i>punishment</i>; and yet this is not unto <i>damnation</i>, for the judgment or punishment inflicted upon the disorderly and the profane was intended for their <i>emendation</i>; for in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:32">1 Corinthians 11:32</span>, it is said, then we are <i>judged</i>, κρινομενοι, we are chastened, παιδευμεθα, corrected as a father does his children, <i>that we should not be</i> <i>condemned with the world</i>.</p>
