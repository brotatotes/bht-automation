Verse 29. Eateth and drinketh damnation — κριμα, Judgment, punishment; and yet this is not unto damnation, for the judgment or punishment inflicted upon the disorderly and the profane was intended for their emendation; for in 1 Corinthians 11:32, it is said, then we are judged, κρινομενοι, we are chastened, παιδευμεθα, corrected as a father does his children, that we should not be condemned with the world.
