<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:3">1 Corinthians 11:3</span>. <i><b>The head of every man is Christ</b></i> â€” The apostle is speaking particularly of Christianity and its ordinances: <i>Christ</i> <i>is the Head</i> or Author of this religion; and is the creator, preserver, and <i>Lord</i> of every man. The <i>man</i> also <i>is the lord</i> or <i>head of the woman</i>; and the <i>Head</i> or Lord <i>of Christ</i>, as Mediator between <i>God</i> and man, <i>is God</i> the Father. Here is the <i>order</i>-God sends his Son Jesus Christ to redeem man; Christ comes and lays down his life for the world; every man who receives Christianity confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father; and every believing woman will acknowledge, according to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:16">Genesis 3:16</span>, that God has placed her in a dependence on and subjection to the man. So far there is no difficulty in this passage.</p>
