<p>Verse 30. <i><b>For this cause</b></i> â€” That they partook of this sacred ordinance without discerning the Lord's body; <i>many are weak and</i> <i>sickly</i>: it is hard to say whether these words refer to the consequences of their own intemperance or to some extraordinary disorders inflicted immediately by God himself. That there were disorders of the most reprehensible kind among these people at this sacred supper, the preceding verses sufficiently point out; and after such excesses, many might be <i>weak</i> and <i>sickly</i> among them, and <i>many</i> might <i>sleep</i>, i.e. <i>die</i>; for continual experience shows us that many fall <i>victims</i> to their own intemperance. How ever, acting as they did in this solemn and awful sacrament, they might have "provoked God to plague them with divers diseases and sundry kinds of death." <i>Communion service</i>.</p>
