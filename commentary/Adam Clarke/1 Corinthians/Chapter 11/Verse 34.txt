<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:34">1 Corinthians 11:34</span>. <i><b>And if any man hunger</b></i> — Let him not come to the house of God to eat an ordinary meal, <i>let him eat at home</i>-take that in his own house which is necessary for the support of his body before he comes to that sacred repast, where he should have the feeding of his soul alone in view.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye come not together unto condemnation</b></i> — That ye may avoid the <i>curse</i> that must fall on such worthless communicants as those above mentioned; and that ye may get that especial <i>blessing</i> which every one that discerns the Lord's body in the eucharist must receive.</p>
<p><i><b>The rest will I set in order</b></i>, c.] All the other matters relative to this business, to which you have referred in your letter, I will regulate when I come to visit you as, God permitting, I fully design. The apostle did visit them about one year after this, as is generally believed.</p>
<p>I HAVE already been so very particular in this long and difficult chapter, that I have left neither room nor necessity for many supplementary observations. A few remarks are all that is requisite.</p>
<p>1. The apostle inculcates the necessity of <i>order</i> and <i>subjection</i>, especially in the Church. Those who are <i>impatient of</i> <i>rule</i>, are generally those who wish to <i>tyrannize</i>. And those who are loudest in their complaints against authority, whether civil or ecclesiastical, are those who wish to have the power in their own hands, and would infallibly abuse it if they had. They alone who are <i>willing to obey</i>, are capable of <i>rule</i>; and he who can rule well, is as willing to <i>obey</i> as to <i>govern</i>. Let all be submissive and orderly; let the woman know that the man is head and protector; let the man know that Christ is his head and redeemer, and the gift of God's endless mercy for the salvation of a lost world.</p>
<p>2. The apostle insisted on the woman having her <i>head covered</i> in the Church or Christian assembly. If he saw the manner in which Christian women now dress, and appear in the ordinances of religion, what would he think? What would he say? How could he even distinguish the <i>Christian</i> from the <i>infidel</i>? And if they who are in Christ are <i>new creatures</i>, and the persons who ordinarily appear in religious assemblies are really <i>new creatures</i> (as they profess in general to be) in Christ, he might reasonably inquire: If these are <i>new</i> creatures, what must have been their appearance when they were <i>old</i> creatures. Do we dress to be <i>seen</i>? And do we go to the house of God to exhibit ourselves? Wretched is that man or woman who goes to the house of God to be seen by any but God himself.</p>
<p>3. The Lord's Supper may be well termed the <i>feast of charity</i>; how unbecoming this sacred ordinance to be the subject of dispute, party spirit, and division! Those who make it such must answer for it to God. Every man who believes in Christ as his atoning sacrifice should, as frequently as he can, receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. And every minister of Christ is bound to administer it to every man who is seeking the salvation of his soul, as well as to all <i>believers</i>. Let no man dare to oppose this ordinance; and let every man receive it according to the institution of Christ.</p>
<p>4. Against the fidelity of our translation of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:27">1 Corinthians 11:27</span> of this chapter, <i>Whosoever shall eat this bread</i>, AND <i>drink this cup</i> <i>unworthily</i>, several popish writers have made heavy complaints, and accused the Protestants of wilful corruption; as both the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Vulgate</i> texts, instead of και and <i>et</i>, AND, have η and <i>vel</i>, OR: <i>Whosoever shall eat this bread</i>, OR <i>drink this cup</i>. As this criticism is made to countenance their unscriptural communion in <i>one kind</i>, it may be well to examine the ground of the complaint. Supposing even this objection to be valid, their cause can gain nothing by it while the 26th and 28th verses stand, both in the Greek text and Vulgate, as they now do: <i>For as often as ye eat</i> <i>this bread</i>, AND <i>drink this cup</i>, c. <i>Let him eat of that bread</i>, AND <i>drink of that cup</i>. But although η, OR, be the reading of the <i>common</i> printed text, και AND, is the reading of the <i>Codex</i> <i>Alexandrinus</i>, and the <i>Codex Claromontanus</i>, two of the best MSS. in the world: as also of the <i>Codex Lincolniensis</i>, 2, and the <i>Codex</i> <i>Petavianus</i>, 3, both MSS. of the first character: it is also the reading of the ancient <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic</i>, the margin of the <i>later Syriac</i>, the <i>AEthiopic</i>, different MSS. of the <i>Vulgate</i>, and of one in my own possession and of <i>Clemens</i> <i>Chromatius</i>, and <i>Cassiodorus</i>. Though the present text of the Vulgate has <i>vel</i>, OR, yet this is a <i>departure</i> from the <i>original</i> <i>editions</i>, which were all professedly taken from the <i>best</i> MSS. In the famous Bible with out <i>date, place</i>, or <i>printer's name</i>, 2 vols. fol., two columns, and forty-five lines in each, supposed by many to be the <i>first Bible</i> ever <i>printed</i>, the text stands thus: <i>Itaque</i> <i>quicunque manducaverit panem</i>, ET <i>biberit calicem</i>, c. <i>Wherefore</i> <i>whosoever shall eat this bread</i> AND <i>drink this cup</i>, c.: here is no <i>vel</i>, OR. The Bible printed by Fust, 1462, the <i>first</i> Bible with a <i>date</i>, has the same reading. Did the <i>Protestants corrupt</i> these texts? In the <i>editio princeps</i> of the Greek Testament, printed by the authority of Cardinal <i>Ximenes</i> at Complutum, and published by the authority of <i>Pope Leo X</i>., though η, OR, stands in the Greek text yet, in the opposite column, which contains the <i>Vulgate</i>, and in the opposite line, ET, <i>and</i>, is found, and not VEL, <i>or</i>; though the Greek text would have authorized the editor to have made this change: but he conscientiously preserved the text of his <i>Vulgate</i>. Did the <i>Protestants</i> corrupt this <i>Catholic text</i> also? Indeed, so little design had any of those who differed from the Romish Church to make any alteration here, that even Wiclif, having a faulty MS. of the Vulgate by him, which read <i>vel</i> instead of <i>et</i>, followed that faulty MS. and translated, <i>And so who ever schal ete the breed or</i> <i>drinke the cup</i>.</p>
<p>That και, AND, is the <i>true reading</i>, and not η, <i>or</i>, both MSS. and <i>versions</i> sufficiently prove: also that <i>et</i>, not <i>vels</i> is the proper reading in the <i>Vulgate</i>, those original editions formed by Roman Catholics, and one of them by the highest authority in the papal Church, fully establish: likewise those MSS., versions, fathers, and original editions, must be allowed to be, not only competent, but also unsuspected and incontrovertible witnesses.</p>
<p>But as this objection to our translation is brought forward to vindicate the withholding the <i>cup</i> from the laity in the Lord's Supper, it may be necessary to show that without the <i>cup</i> there can be no eucharist. With respect to the <i>bread</i>, our Lord had simply said, <i>Take, eat, this is my body</i>; but concerning the <i>cup</i>, he says <i>Drink ye all of this</i>; for as this pointed out the very <i>essence</i> of the institution, viz. the <i>blood of atonement</i>, it was necessary that each should have a particular application of it, therefore he says, Drink ye ALL of THIS. By this we are taught that the <i>cup</i> is essential to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper; so that they who deny the <i>cup</i> to the <i>people</i>, sin against God's institution; and they who receive not the cup, are not partakers of the body and blood of Christ. If either could without mortal prejudice be omitted, it might be the <i>bread</i>; but the <i>cup</i> as pointing out the blood poured out, i.e. the <i>life</i>, by which alone the great sacrificial act is performed, and remission of sins procured, is absolutely indispensable. On this ground it is demonstrable, that there is not a popish priest under heaven, who denies the cup to the people, (and they all do this,) that can be said to celebrate the Lord's Supper at all; nor is there one of their votaries that ever received the holy sacrament. All pretension to this is an absolute farce so long as the <i>cup</i>, the emblem of the atoning blood, is denied. How strange is it that the very men who plead so much for the bare, <i>literal</i> meaning of <i>this is my body</i>, in the preceding verse, should deny all meaning to <i>drink ye all of this</i> <i>cup</i>, in this verse! And though Christ has, in the most positive manner, enjoined it, they will not permit one of the laity to taste it! See the whole of this argument, at large, in my <i>Discourse on the Nature and Design of the Eucharist</i>.</p>
