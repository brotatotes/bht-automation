<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:4">1 Corinthians 11:4</span>. <i><b>Praying, or prophesying</b></i> — Any person who engages in public acts in the worship of God, whether prayer, singing, or exhortation: for we learn, from the apostle himself, that προφητευειν, <i>to prophesy</i>, signifies to <i>speak unto men to</i> <i>edification, exhortation, and comfort</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>. And this comprehends all that we understand by <i>exhortation</i>, or even <i>preaching</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Having</b></i><b> his </b><i><b>head covered</b></i> — With his cap or turban on, <i>dishonoureth his head</i>; because the head being covered was a sign of subjection; and while he was employed in the public ministration of the word, he was to be considered as a <i>representative</i> of Christ, and on this account his being veiled or covered would be improper. This decision of the apostle was in point blank hostility to the canons of the Jews; for they would not suffer a man to pray unless he was <i>veiled</i>, for which they gave this reason. "He should veil himself to show that he is <i>ashamed</i> before God, and unworthy with open face to behold him." See much in <i>Lightfoot</i> on this point.</p>
