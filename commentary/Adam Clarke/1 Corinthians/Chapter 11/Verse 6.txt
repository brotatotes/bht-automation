<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:6">1 Corinthians 11:6</span>. <i><b>For if the woman be not covered</b></i> — If she will not wear a veil in the public assemblies, <i>let her be shorn</i>-let her carry a public badge of infamy: <i>but if it be a shame</i>-if to be shorn or shaven would appear, as it must, a badge of infamy, <i>then</i> <i>let her be covered</i>-let her by all means wear a veil. Even in mourning it was considered disgraceful to be obliged to shear off the hair; and lest they should lose this ornament of their heads, the women contrived to evade the custom, by cutting off the <i>ends</i> of it only. <i>Euripides</i>, in <i>Orest</i>., ver. 128, speaking of Helen, who should have shaved her head on account of the death of her sister Clytemnestra, says: ειδετε παρ' ακρας ὡς απεθρισεν τριχας, σωζουσα καλλος, εστι δε ἡ παλαι γυνη: "see how she cuts off only the very points of her hair, that she may preserve her beauty, and is just the same woman as before." See the note on the preceding verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:5">1 Corinthians 11:5</span>.</p>
<p>In <i>Hindostan</i> a woman cuts off her <i>hair</i> at the death of her husband, as a token of <i>widowhood</i>; but this is never performed by a <i>married</i> woman, whose hair is considered an <i>essential ornament</i>. The <i>veil</i> of the Hindoo women is nothing more than the <i>garment</i> brought over the face, which is always very carefully done by the higher classes of women when they appear in the streets.-<i>Ward's</i> <i>Customs</i>.</p>
