<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:7">1 Corinthians 11:7</span>. <i><b>A man indeed ought not to cover his head</b></i> — He should not wear his <i>cap</i> or <i>turban</i> in the public congregation, for this was a badge of servitude, or an indication that he had a conscience overwhelmed with guilt; and besides, it was contrary to the custom that prevailed, both among the Greeks and Romans.</p>
<p><i><b>He is the image and glory of God</b></i> — He is God's vicegerent in this lower world; and, by the <i>authority</i> which he has received from his Master, he is his <i>representative</i> among the creatures, and exhibits, more than any other part of the creation, the <i>glory</i> and perfections of the <i>Creator</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But the woman is the glory of the man.</b></i> — As the man is, among the creatures, the representative of the glory and perfections of God, so that the fear of him and the dread of him are on every beast of the field, c. so the woman is, in the house and family, the representative of the power and authority of the man. I believe this to be the meaning of the apostle; and that he is speaking here principally concerning <i>power</i> and <i>authority</i>, and skill to use them. It is certainly not the <i>moral image</i> of God, nor his <i>celestial glory</i>, of which he speaks in this verse.</p>
