<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:8">1 Corinthians 11:8</span>. <i><b>For, the man is not of the woman</b></i> — Bishop Pearce translates ου γαρ εστιν ανηρ εκ γυναικος, αλλα γυνη εξ ανδρος, thus: "For the man doth not BELONG to the woman, but the woman to the man." And vindicates this sense of εκ, by its use in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:15">1 Corinthians 12:15</span>. If the foot shall say, ουκ ειμι εκ του σωματος, I am not of the body, i.e. I do not belong to the body. He observes that as the verb εστιν is in the <i>present</i> tense, and will not allow that we should understand this verse of something that is <i>past</i>, γαρ, for, in the following verse, which is unnoticed by our translators, will have its full propriety and meaning, because it introduces a reason <i>why</i> the woman belongs to the man and not the man to the woman. His meaning is, that the man does not belong to the woman, as if she was the <i>principal</i>; but the woman belongs to the man in that view.</p>
