<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:1">1 Corinthians 12:1</span>. <i><b>Now concerning spiritual gifts</b></i> — This was a subject about which they appear to have written to the apostle, and concerning which there were probably some contentions among them. The words περι των πνευματικων may as well be translated <i>concerning spiritual persons</i>, as <i>spiritual gifts</i>; and indeed the former agrees much better with the context.</p>
<p><i><b>I would not have you ignorant.</b></i> — I wish you fully to know whence all such gifts come, and for what end they are given, that each person may serve the Church in the capacity in which God has placed him, that there may be no misunderstandings and no schism in the body.</p>
