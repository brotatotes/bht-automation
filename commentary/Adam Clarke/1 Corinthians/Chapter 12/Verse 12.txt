<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:12">1 Corinthians 12:12</span>. <i><b>For as the body is one</b></i> — Though the human body have many <i>members</i>, and though it be composed of a great variety of <i>parts</i>, yet it is but <i>one entire system</i>; every part and member being necessary to the integrity or completeness of the whole.</p>
<p><i><b>So also</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>Christ.</b></i> — That is, So is the Church the body of Christ, being composed of the different officers already mentioned, and especially those enumerated, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>, <i>apostles, prophets, teachers</i>, &amp;c. It cannot be supposed that Christ is <i>composed</i> of <i>many members</i>, &amp;c., and therefore the term <i>Church</i> must be understood, unless we suppose, which is not improbable, that the term ο χριστος, <i>Christ</i>, is used to express the <i>Church</i>, or whole body of Christian believers.</p>
