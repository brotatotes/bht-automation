Verse 1 Corinthians 12:13. For by one Spirit are we all baptized, c.] As the body of man, though composed of many members, is informed and influenced by one soul so the Church of Christ, which is his body, though composed of many members, is informed and influenced by one Spirit, the Holy Ghost; actuating and working by his spiritual body, as the human soul does in the body of man.To drink into one Spirit. â€” We are to understand being made partakers of the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost agreeably to the words of our Lord, John 7:37, &c.: If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink: this he spake of the Spirit which they that believed on him should receive.On this verse there is a great profusion of various readings, which may be found in Griesbach, but cannot be conveniently noticed here.
