<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:2">1 Corinthians 12:2</span>. <i><b>Ye were Gentiles</b></i> — Previously to your conversion to the Christian faith; ye were <i>heathens, carried away</i>, not guided by <i>reason</i> or <i>truth</i>, but <i>hurried</i> by your passions into a senseless worship, the chief part of which was calculated only to excite and gratify animal propensities.</p>
<p><i><b>Dumb idols</b></i> — Though often supplicated, could never return an answer; so that not only the <i>image</i> could not speak, but the <i>god</i> or <i>demon</i> pretended to be represented by it could not speak: a full proof that an <i>idol was nothing in the world</i>.</p>
