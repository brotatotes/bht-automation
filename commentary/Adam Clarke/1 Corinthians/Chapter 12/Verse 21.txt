<p>Verse 21. <i><b>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need</b></i><b> </b><i><b>of thee</b></i> â€” The apostle goes on, with his principal object in view, to show that the gifts and graces with which their different teachers were endowed were all necessary for their salvation, and should be <i>collectively</i> used; for not one of them was unnecessary, nor could they dispense with the least of them; the body of Christ needed the whole for its nourishment and support. The famous apologue of <i>Menenius Agrippa</i>, related by Livy, will serve to illustrate the apostle's reasoning: the Roman <i>people</i>, getting into a state of insurrection and rebellion against the <i>nobility</i>, under pretext that the <i>great men</i> not only had all the <i>honours</i> but all the <i>emoluments</i> of the nation, while <i>they</i> were obliged to bear all the burdens, and suffer all the privations; they then in riotous assemblage left their homes and went to Mount Aventine. Matters were at last brought to such an issue, that the <i>senators</i> and <i>great</i> <i>men</i> were obliged to fly from the city, and the public peace was on the point of being utterly ruined: it was then thought expedient to send <i>Menenius Agrippa</i> to them, who was high in their esteem, having vanquished the <i>Sabines</i> and <i>Samnites</i>, and had the first triumph at Rome. This great general, who was as eloquent as he was valiant, went to the <i>Mons Sacer</i>, to which the insurgents had retired, and thus addressed them: <i>Tempore, quo in homine non, ut</i> <i>nunc emnia in unum consentiebant, sed singulis</i> membris <i>suum cuique</i> <i>consilium, suus sermo fuerat, indignatas reliquas partes, sua</i> <i>cura, suo labore ac ministerio</i> ventri <i>omnia quaeri; ventrem, in</i> <i>medio quietum, nihil aliud, quam datis voluptatibus frui.</i> <i>Conspirasse inde, ne manus ad os cibum ferrent, nec os acciperet</i> <i>datum, nec dentes conficerent. Hac ira, dum ventrem fame domare</i> <i>vellent, ipsa una membra totumque corpus ad extremam tabem</i> <i>venisse. lnde apparuisse, ventris quoque haud segne ministerium</i> <i>esse: nec magis ali, quam alere eum, reddentem in omnes corporis</i> <i>partes hunc, quo vivimus vigemusque, divisum pariter in venas</i> <i>maturum, confecto cibo, sanquinem</i>. <i>T. Livii</i>, Histor. lib. ii. cap. 32. "In that time in which the different <i>parts</i> of the human body were not in a state of <i>unity</i> as they now are, but each <i>member</i> had its <i>separate</i> office and <i>distinct language</i>, they all became discontented, because whatever was procured by their care, labour, and industry, was spent on the <i>belly</i>; while this, lying at ease in the midst of the body, did nothing but enjoy whatever was provided for it. They therefore conspired among themselves, and agreed that the hands should not convey food to the mouth, that the mouth should not receive what was offered to it, and that the teeth should not masticate whatever was brought to the mouth. Acting on this principle of revenge, and hoping to reduce the belly by famine, all the members, and the whole body itself, were at length brought into the last stage of a consumption. It then plainly appeared that the <i>belly</i> itself did no small service; that it contributed not less to <i>their</i> nourishment than they did to <i>its</i> support, distributing to every part that from which they derived life and vigour; for by properly concocting the food, the pure blood derived from it was conveyed by the arteries to every member."</p>
<p>This sensible comparison produced the desired effect; the <i>people</i> were persuaded that the <i>senators</i> were as necessary to <i>their</i> existence as they were to that of the senators, and that it required the strictest <i>union</i> and mutual support of <i>high</i> and <i>low</i> to preserve the body politic. This transaction took place about 500 years before the Christian era, and was handed down by unbroken tradition to the time of <i>Titus Livius</i>, from whom I have taken it, who died in the year of our Lord 17, about forty years before St. Paul wrote this epistle. As his works were well known and universally read among the Romans in the time of the apostle, it is very probable that St. Paul had this famous apologue in view when he wrote from the 14th verse to the end of the chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:1">1 Corinthians 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:14-31">1 Corinthians 12:14-31</span></p>
