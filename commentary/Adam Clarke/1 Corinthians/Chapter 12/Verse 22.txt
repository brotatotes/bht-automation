<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Those members - which seem to be more feeble</b></i> â€” These, and the <i>less honourable</i> and <i>uncomely</i>, mentioned in the next verses, seem to mean the principal <i>viscera</i>, such as the <i>heart,</i> <i>lungs, stomach</i>, and <i>intestinal canal</i>. These, when compared with the <i>arms</i> and <i>limbs</i>, are comparatively <i>weak</i>; and some of them, considered in <i>themselves, uncomely</i> and less honourable; yet these are more essential to life than any of the others. A man may lose an <i>eye</i> by accident, and an <i>arm</i> or a <i>leg</i> may be amputated, and yet the <i>body</i> live and be vigorous; but let the <i>stomach, heart, lungs</i>, or any of the <i>viscera</i> be removed, and life becomes necessarily extinct. Hence these parts are not only <i>covered</i>, but the parts in which they are lodged are surrounded, ornamented, and fortified for their preservation and defence, on the proper performance of whose functions life so immediately depends.</p>
