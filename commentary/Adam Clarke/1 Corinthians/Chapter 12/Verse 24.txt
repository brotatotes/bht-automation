<p>Verse 24. <i><b>For our comely parts have no need</b></i> â€” It would be easy to go into great detail in giving an <i>anatomical</i> description of the different members and parts to which the apostle refers, but it would not probably answer the end of general edification; and to explain every <i>allusion</i> made by the apostle, would require a minuteness of description which would not be tolerated except in a treatise on the anatomy of the human body. My readers will therefore excuse my entering into this detail.</p>
