<p>Verse 25. <i><b>That there should be no schism in the body</b></i> â€” That there should be no unnecessary and independent part in the whole human machine, and that every part should contribute something to the general proportion, symmetry, and beauty of the body. So completely has God tempered the whole together, that not the smallest visible part can be removed from the body without not only injuring its proportions, but producing deformity. Hence the members have the same care one for another. The <i>eyes</i> and <i>ears</i> watch for the general safety of the whole; and they are placed in the <i>head</i>, like sentinels in a tower, that they may perceive the first approach of a foe, and give warning. The <i>hands</i> immediately on an attack exert themselves to defend the <i>head</i> and the <i>body</i>; and the <i>limbs</i> are swift to carry off the body from <i>dangers</i> against which <i>resistance</i> would be <i>vain</i>. Even the <i>heart</i> takes alarm from both the <i>eyes</i> and the <i>ears</i>; and when an attack is made on the body, every external muscle becomes inflated and contracts itself, that, by thus <i>collecting</i> and <i>concentrating</i> its force, it may the more effectually resist the assailants, and contribute to the defence of the system.</p>
