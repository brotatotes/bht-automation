<p>Verse 26. <i><b>And whether one member suffer</b></i> â€” As there is a mutual exertion for the general defence, so there is a mutual sympathy. If the <i>eye</i>, the <i>hand</i>, the <i>foot</i>, c., be injured, the <i>whole man</i> grieves and if by <i>clothing</i>, or <i>any</i> thing else, any particular member or part is <i>adorned, strengthened</i>, or <i>better secured</i>, it gives a general pleasure to the whole man.</p>
