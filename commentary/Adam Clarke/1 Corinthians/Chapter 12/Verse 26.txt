Verse 26. And whether one member suffer â€” As there is a mutual exertion for the general defence, so there is a mutual sympathy. If the eye, the hand, the foot, c., be injured, the whole man grieves and if by clothing, or any thing else, any particular member or part is adorned, strengthened, or better secured, it gives a general pleasure to the whole man.
