<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Now ye are the body of Christ</b></i> â€” The apostle, having finished his apologue, comes to his application.</p>
<p>As the members in the human body, so the different members of the mystical body of Christ. All are intended by him to have the same relation to each other; to be mutually subservient to each other; to mourn for and rejoice with each other. He has also made each necessary to the <i>beauty, proportion, strength</i>, and <i>perfection</i> of the whole. Not one is <i>useless</i>; not one <i>unnecessary</i>. Paul, Apollos, Kephas, &amp;c., with all their variety of gifts and graces, are <i>for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the</i> <i>ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:12">Ephesians 4:12</span>. Hence no teacher should be <i>exalted</i> above or <i>opposed</i> to an other. As the <i>eye</i> cannot say to the <i>hand</i>, I have no need of thee, so <i>luminous</i> Apollos cannot say to <i>laborious</i> Paul, I can build up and preserve the Church without thee. The <i>foot</i> planted on the ground to support the whole fabric, and the <i>hands</i> that swing at liberty, and the eye that is continually taking in near and distant prospects, are all equally serviceable to the whole, and mutually helpful to and dependent on each other. So also are the different ministers and members of the Church of Christ.</p>
<p>From a general acquaintance with various ministers of Christ, and a knowledge of their different <i>talents</i> and endowments manifested either by their <i>preaching</i> or <i>writings</i>, and with the aid of a little <i>fancy</i>, we could here make out a sort of correspondency between <i>their services</i> and the <i>uses</i> of the different <i>members</i> of the human body. We could call one <i>eye</i>, because of his <i>acute</i> <i>observation</i> of men and things, and <i>penetration</i> into cases of conscience and Divine <i>mysteries</i>. Another <i>hand</i>, from his <i>laborious</i> exertions in the Church. Another <i>foot</i>, from his industrious <i>travels</i> to spread abroad the knowledge of Christ crucified: and so of others. But this does not appear to be any part of the apostle's plan.</p>
