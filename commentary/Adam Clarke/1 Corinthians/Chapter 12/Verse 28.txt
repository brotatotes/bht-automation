<p>Verse 28. <i><b>God hath set some in the Church</b></i> — As God has made evident distinctions among the members of the human body, so that some occupy a more eminent place than others, so has he in the Church. And to prove this, the apostle numerates the principal offices, and in the order in which they should stand.</p>
<p><i><b>First, apostles</b></i> — αποστολους, from απο <i>from</i>, and στελλο <i>I send</i>; to <i>send</i> from one <i>person</i> to <i>another</i>, and from one <i>place</i> to <i>another</i>. Persons immediately designated by Christ, and <i>sent</i> by him to preach the Gospel to all mankind.</p>
<p><i><b>Secondarily, prophets</b></i> — προφητας, from προ, <i>before</i>, and φημι, <i>I speak</i>; a person who, under Divine inspiration, predicts future events; but the word is often applied to these who preach the Gospel. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Thirdly, teachers</b></i> — διδασκαλους, from διδασκω, <i>I teach</i>; persons whose chief business it was to instruct the people in the elements of the Christian religion, and their duty to each other. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:8">Romans 8:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:8">Romans 8:8</span></span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Miracles</b></i> — δυναμεις. Persons endued with miraculous gifts, such as those mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:17">Mark 16:17</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:18">Mark 16:18</span>; casting out devils, speaking with new tongues, c. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>, and at the end of the chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span> (note)</p>
<p><i><b>Gifts of healings</b></i> — χαρισματα ιαματων. Such as laying hands upon the sick, and healing them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:18">Mark 16:18</span> which, as being one of the most <i>beneficent</i> miraculous powers, was most frequently conceded. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Helps</b></i> — αντιληψεις. Dr. Lightfoot conjectures that these were the apostles' helpers; persons who accompanied them, baptized those who were converted by them, and were sent by them to such places as they could not attend to, being otherwise employed.</p>
<p>The <i>Levites</i> are termed by the Talmudists <i>helps of the priests</i>. The word occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:54">Luke 1:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Governments</b></i> — κυβερνησεις. Dr. Lightfoot contends that this word does not refer to the <i>power of ruling</i>, but to the case of a person endued with a <i>deep and comprehensive mind</i>, who is <i>profoundly wise</i> and <i>prudent</i>; and he thinks that it implies the same as <i>discernment of spirits</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>, where see the note. He has given several proofs of this use of the word in the <i>Septuagint</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Diversities of tongues.</b></i> — γενη γλωσσων. <i>Kinds of tongues</i>; that is, <i>different kinds</i>. The power to speak, on all necessary occasions, languages which they had not learned. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>.</p>
