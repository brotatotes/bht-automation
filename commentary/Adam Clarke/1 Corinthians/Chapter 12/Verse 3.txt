<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>. <i><b>No man speaking by the Spirit of God</b></i> — It was granted on all hands that there could be no religion without <i>Divine</i> <i>inspiration</i>, because God alone, could make his will known to men: hence heathenism <i>pretended</i> to this inspiration; Judaism <i>had</i> it in the law and the prophets; and it was the very <i>essence</i> of the <i>Christian</i> religion. The heathen priests and priestesses pretended to receive, by inspiration from their god, the <i>answers</i> which they gave to their votaries. And as far as the people believed their pretensions, so far they were <i>led</i> by their teaching.</p>
<p>Both <i>Judaism</i> and <i>heathenism</i> were full of expectations of a <i>future teacher</i> and <i>deliverer</i>; and to this person, especially among the Jews, the Spirit in all the prophets gave witness. This was the <i>Anointed One</i>, the <i>Messiah</i> who was manifested in the person of Jesus of Nazareth; and him the Jews rejected, though he proved his Divine mission both by his <i>doctrines</i> and his <i>miracles</i>. But as he did not come as they fancied he would-as a mighty secular conqueror, they not only rejected but blasphemed him; and persons among them professing to be <i>spiritual</i> men, and under the <i>influence</i> of the <i>Spirit</i> of God, did so. But as the Holy Spirit, through all the law and the prophets gave Testimony to the Messiah, and as Jesus proved himself to be the <i>Christ</i> both by his <i>miracles</i> and <i>doctrines</i>, no man under the <i>inspiration</i> of the Divine Spirit could say to him <i>anethema</i>-thou art a deceiver, and a person worthy of <i>death</i>, c., as the Jews did: therefore the Jews were no longer under the inspiration of the Spirit of God. This appears to be the meaning of the apostle in this place. <i>No man speaking by the</i> <i>Spirit</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i><b>And</b></i><b> that </b><i><b>no man can say that Jesus is the Lord</b></i> — Nor can we demonstrate this person to be the Messiah and the Saviour of men, but by the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, enabling us to speak with <i>divers tongues</i>, to <i>work miracles</i> he attesting the truth of our doctrines to them that hear, by <i>enlightening</i> their <i>minds, changing</i> their <i>hearts</i>, and <i>filling</i> them with the <i>peace</i> and <i>love</i> of <i>God</i>.</p>
