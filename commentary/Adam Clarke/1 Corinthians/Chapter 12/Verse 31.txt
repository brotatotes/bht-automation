<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>. <i><b>But covet earnestly</b></i> — To <i>covet</i> signifies to <i>desire</i> <i>earnestly</i>. This disposition towards <i>heavenly</i> things is <i>highly</i> <i>laudable</i>; towards <i>earthly</i> things, is <i>deeply criminal</i>. A man may possess the best of all these gifts, and yet be deficient in what is essentially necessary to his salvation, for he may be without that love or charity which the apostle here calls the more <i>excellent way</i>, and which he proceeds in the next chapter to describe.</p>
<p>Some think that this verse should be read <i>affirmatively, Ye</i> <i>earnestly contend about the best gifts; but I show unto you a more</i> <i>excellent way</i>; i.e. get your hearts filled with <i>love to God</i> and <i>man</i>-love, which is the <i>principle of obedience</i>, which <i>works no ill</i> <i>to its neighbour</i>, and which is the <i>fulfilling of the law</i>. This is a likely reading, for there were certainly more contentions in the Church of Corinth about the <i>gifts</i> than about the <i>graces</i> of the Spirit.</p>
<p>1. AFTER all that has been said on the different offices mentioned by the apostle in the preceding chapter, there are some of them which perhaps are not understood. I confess I scarcely know what to make of those which we translate <i>helps</i> and <i>governments</i>. Bishop Pearce, who could neither see <i>Church</i> <i>government</i> nor <i>state government</i> in these words, expresses himself thus: "These two words, after all that the commentators say about them, I do not understand; and in no other part of the New Testament is either of them, in any sense, mentioned as the <i>gift</i> <i>of the Spirit</i>; especially it is observable that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:29">1 Corinthians 12:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:30">1 Corinthians 12:30</span>, where the gifts of the Spirit are again enumerated, no notice is taken of any thing like them, while all the other several parts are exactly enumerated. Perhaps these words were put in the margin to explain δυναμεις, <i>miracles</i> or <i>powers</i>; some taking the meaning to be <i>helps, assistances</i>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:9">2 Corinthians 12:9</span>; others to be κυβερνησεις, <i>governments</i>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38">Romans 8:38</span>; and from being marginal explanations, they might have been at last incorporated with the text." It must, however, be acknowledged that the omission of these words is not countenanced by any MS. or <i>version</i>. One thing we may fully know, that there are some men who are peculiarly qualified for <i>governing</i> by either providence or grace; and that there are others who can neither <i>govern</i> nor <i>direct</i>, but are good <i>helpers</i>. These characters I have often seen in different places in the Church of God.</p>
<p>2. In three several places in this chapter the apostle sums up the gifts of the Spirit. Dr. Lightfoot thinks they answer to each other in the following order, which the reader will take on <i>his</i> authority. </p>
<p>3. It is strange that in this enumeration only <i>three</i> distinct officers in the Church should be mentioned; viz. <i>apostles,</i> <i>prophets</i>, and <i>teachers</i>. We do not know that <i>miracles, gifts of</i> <i>healing, helps, governments</i>, and <i>diversity</i> of <i>tongues</i>, were <i>exclusive</i> offices; for it is probable that <i>apostles, prophets</i>, and <i>teachers</i> wrought miracles occasionally, and spoke with divers tongues. However, in all this enumeration, where the <i>apostle</i> gives us <i>all the officers</i> and <i>gifts</i> necessary for the <i>constitution</i> of a <i>Church</i>, we find not one word of <i>bishops, presbyters</i>, or <i>deacons</i>; much less of the various officers and offices which the Christian Church at present exhibits. Perhaps the <i>bishops</i> are included under the <i>apostles</i>, the <i>presbyters</i> under the <i>prophets</i>, and the <i>deacons</i> under the <i>teachers</i>. As to the other ecclesiastical officers with which the <i>Romish</i> Church teems, they may seek them who are determined to find them, any where <i>out</i> of the New Testament.</p>
<p>4. Mr. <i>Quesnel</i> observes on these passages that there are <i>three</i> sorts of <i>gifts</i> necessary to the forming Christ's mystical body. 1. Gifts of <i>power</i>, for the working of miracles, in reference to the <i>Father</i>. 2. Gifts of <i>labour</i> and <i>ministry</i>, for the exercise of <i>government</i> and other <i>offices</i>, with respect to the <i>Son</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="so+3:0">Song of Solomon 3:0</span>. Gifts of <i>knowledge</i>, for the <i>instruction</i> of the people, with relation to the <i>Holy Ghost</i>.</p>
<p>The FATHER is the <i>principle</i> and <i>end</i> of all created power; let us then ultimately <i>refer</i> all things to <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>The SON is the <i>Institutor</i> and <i>Head</i> of all the hierarchical ministries; let us <i>depend</i> upon <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>The HOLY GHOST is the <i>fountain</i> and <i>fulness</i> of all spiritual graces; let us <i>desire</i> and <i>use</i> them only <i>in</i> and <i>by</i> him.</p>
<p>There is nothing good, nothing profitable to salvation, unless it be done in the <i>power</i> of God <i>communicated</i> by Christ Jesus, and in that <i>holiness</i> of heart which is produced by his SPIRIT. Pastors are only the <i>instruments</i> of <i>God</i>, the <i>depositaries</i> of the <i>authority</i> of <i>Christ</i>, and the <i>channels</i> by whom the love and graces of the <i>Spirit</i> are conveyed. Let these act as receiving all from God by Christ, through the Holy Ghost; and let the Church receive them as the ambassadors of the <i>Almighty</i>.</p>
