<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:7">1 Corinthians 12:7</span>. <i><b>The manifestation of the Spirit</b></i> — φανερωσις του πνευματος. This is variably understood by the fathers; some of them rendering φανερωσις by <i>illumination</i>, others <i>demonstration</i>, and others <i>operation</i>. The apostle's meaning seems to be this: Whatever gifts God has bestowed, or in what various ways soever the Spirit of God may have manifested himself, it is all for the <i>common benefit</i> of the Church. God has given no gift to any man for his <i>own private</i> advantage, or exclusive profit. He has it for the benefit of others as well as for his own salvation.</p>
