<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>. <i><b>Word of wisdom</b></i> — In all these places I consider that the proper translation of λογος is <i>doctrine</i>, as in many other places of the New Testament. It is very difficult to say what is intended here by the different kinds of gifts mentioned by the apostle: they were probably all <i>supernatural</i>, and were necessary at that time only for the benefit of the Church. On the 8th, 9th, and 10th verses, much may be seen in <i>Lightfoot, Whitby, Pearce</i>, and others. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8-10">1 Corinthians 12:8-10</span></p>
<p>By <i><b>doctrine of wisdom</b></i> we may understand, as Bp. Pearce and Dr. Whitby observe, the mystery of our <i>redemption</i>, in which the <i>wisdom</i> of God was most eminently conspicuous: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>; and which is called the <i>manifold wisdom of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>. Christ, the great teacher of it, is called the <i>wisdom of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>; and in him are said to be contained <i>all the treasures of wisdom and</i> <i>knowledge</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3">Colossians 2:3</span>. The apostles to whom this doctrine was committed are called σοφοι, <i>wise men</i>; (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34">Matthew 23:34</span>;) and they are said to teach this Gospel according to the <i>wisdom given them</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:15">2 Peter 3:15</span>.</p>
<p>2. By <i><b>the doctrine of knowledge</b></i> we may understand either a knowledge of the <i>types</i>, c., in the <i>Old Testament</i> or what are termed <i>mysteries</i>; the <i>calling of the Gentiles</i>, the <i>recalling</i> of the <i>Jews</i>, the <i>mystery</i> of <i>iniquity</i>, of the <i>beast</i>, c., and especially the <i>mystical sense</i> or <i>meaning</i> of the Old Testament, with all its types, rites, ceremonies, c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>3. By <i><b>faith</b></i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:9">1 Corinthians 12:9</span>, we are to understand that miraculous faith by which they could remove mountains, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:2">1 Corinthians 13:2</span> or a peculiar impulse, as Dr: Whitby calls it, that came upon the apostles when any difficult matter was to be performed, which inwardly assured them that God's power would assist them in the performance of it. Others think that justifying faith, received by means of Gospel <i>teaching</i>, is what is intended.</p>
<p>4. <i><b>Gifts of healing</b></i> simply refers to the power which at particular times the apostles received from the Holy Spirit to cure diseases; a power which was not always resident in them; for Paul could not cure Timothy, nor remove his own thorn in the flesh; because it was given only on extraordinary occasions, though perhaps more <i>generally</i> than many others.</p>
<p>5. <i><b>The working of miracles</b></i>, ενεργηματα δυναμεων, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>. This seems to refer to the same class as the <i>operations</i>, ενεργηματων, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:6">1 Corinthians 12:6</span>, as the words are the same; and to signify those powers by which they were enabled at particular times to work miraculously on others; ejecting demons, inflicting punishments or judgments, as in the cases mentioned under <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:6">1 Corinthians 12:6</span>. It is a hendyadis for mighty operations.</p>
<p>6. <i><b>Prophecy</b></i>. This seems to import two things: 1st, the <i>predicting future events</i>, such as then particularly concerned the state of the Church and the apostles; as the <i>dearth</i> foretold by <i>Agabus</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>; and the <i>binding of St. Paul</i>, and <i>delivering him to the Romans</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:10">Acts 21:10</span>, c. and St. Paul's <i>foretelling</i> his <i>own shipwreck on Malta</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:25">Acts 27:25</span>, c. And 2dly, as implying the faculty of <i>teaching</i> or <i>expounding</i> the Scriptures, which is also a common acceptation of the word.</p>
<p>7. <i><b>Discerning of spirits</b></i>. A gift by which the person so privileged could discern a <i>false miracle</i> from a <i>true</i> one or a <i>pretender</i> to <i>inspiration</i> from him who was made <i>really</i> partaker of the Holy Ghost. It probably extended also to the discernment of <i>false professors</i> from <i>true ones</i>, as appears in Peter in the case of Ananias and his wife.</p>
<p>8. <b>Divers </b><i><b>kinds of tongues</b></i>. γενη γλωσσων, <i>Different languages</i>, which they had never learned, and which God gave them for the immediate instruction of people of different countries who attended their ministry.</p>
<p>9. <i><b>Interpretation of tongues</b></i>. It was necessary that while one was speaking the deep things of God in a company where several were present who did not <i>understand</i>, though the <i>majority</i> did, there should be a person who could immediately interpret what was said to that part of the congregation that did not understand the language. This power to interpret was also an immediate gift of God's Spirit, and is classed here among the miracles.</p>
