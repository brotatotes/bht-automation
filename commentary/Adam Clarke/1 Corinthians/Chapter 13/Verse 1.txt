<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</span>. <i><b>Though I speak</b></i>, c.] At the conclusion of the preceding chapter the apostle promised to show the Corinthians a <i>more excellent way</i> than that in which they were now proceeding. They were so distracted with contentions, divided by parties, and envious of each other's gifts, that <i>unity</i> was nearly destroyed. This was a full proof that <i>love to God</i> and <i>man</i> was wanting and that without this, their numerous <i>gifts</i> and other <i>graces</i> were nothing in the eyes of God; for it was evident that they did not love one another, which is a proof that they did not love God; and consequently, that they had not true religion. Having, by his advices and directions, corrected many abuses, and having shown them how in outward things they should walk so as to please God, he now shows them the <i>spirit, temper</i>, and <i>disposition</i> in which this should be done, and without which all the rest must be ineffectual.</p>
<p>Before I proceed to the consideration of the different parts of this chapter, it may be necessary to examine whether the word αγαπη be best translated by <i>charity</i> or <i>love</i>. Wiclif, translating from the <i>Vulgate</i>, has the word <i>charity</i>; and him our authorized version follows. But <i>Coverdale, Matthews, Cranmer</i>, and the <i>Geneva Bible</i>, have <i>love</i>; which is adopted by recent translators and commentators in general; among whom the chief are Dodd, Pearce, Purver, Wakefield, and Wesley; all these strenuously contend that the word <i>charity</i>, which is now confined to <i>almsgiving</i>, is utterly improper; and that the word <i>love</i>, alone expresses the apostle's sense. As the word <i>charity</i> seems now to express little else than almsgiving, which, performed even to the uttermost of a man's power, is <i>nothing</i> if he lack what the apostle terms αγαπη, and which we here translate <i>charity</i>; it is best to omit the use of a word in this place which, taken in its ordinary signification, makes the apostle contradict himself; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:3">1 Corinthians 13:3</span>: <i>Though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and have not charity,</i> <i>it profiteth me nothing</i>. That is: "Though I have the utmost charity, and act in every respect according to its dictates, yet, if I have <i>not charity</i>, my utmost <i>charity</i> is unprofitable." Therefore, to shun this contradiction, and the probable misapplication of the term, LOVE had better be substituted for CHARITY!</p>
<p>The word αγαπη, <i>love</i>, I have already considered at large in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:37">Matthew 22:37</span><i>"</i>; and to that place I beg leave to refer the reader for its derivation and import. Our English word <i>love</i> we have from the Teutonic <i>leben</i> to <i>live</i>, because love is the means, dispenser, and preserver of <i>life</i>; and without it life would have nothing <i>desirable</i>, nor indeed any thing even <i>supportable</i>: or it may be taken immediately from the Anglo-Saxon [A.S.] and [A.S.] <i>love</i>, from [A.S.] and [A.S.], to <i>desire</i>, to <i>love</i>, to <i>favour</i>. It would be ridiculous to look to the Greek verb φιλειν for its derivation.</p>
<p>Having said so much about the word <i>love</i>, we should say something of the word <i>charity</i>, which is supposed to be improper in this place. <i>Charity</i> comes to us immediately from the French <i>charite</i>, who borrowed it from the Latin <i>charitas</i>, which is probably borrowed from the Greek χαρις, signifying <i>grace</i> or <i>favour</i>, or χαρα, <i>joy</i>, as a benefit bestowed is a <i>favour</i> that inspires him who receives it with <i>joy</i>; and so far contributes to his <i>happiness</i>. The proper meaning of the word CHARUS, is <i>dear,</i> <i>costly</i>; and CRARITAS, is <i>dearth, scarcity</i>, a <i>high price</i>, or <i>dearness</i>. Hence, as in times of dearth or scarcity, many, especially the poor, must be in want, and the benevolent will be excited to relieve them; the term which expressed the <i>cause</i> of this <i>want</i> was applied to the <i>disposition</i> which was excited in behalf of the sufferer. Now, as he who relieves a person in distress, and preserves his life by communicating a portion of his property to him, will feel a sort of <i>interest</i> in the person thus preserved; Hence he is said to be <i>dear</i> to him: i.e. he has <i>cost</i> him something; and he <i>values</i> him in proportion to the trouble or <i>expense</i> he has <i>cost</i> him. Thus <i>charity</i> properly expresses that <i>affectionate attachment</i> we may feel to a person whose <i>wants</i> we have been enabled to relieve; but originally it signified that <i>want</i> of the necessaries of life which produced <i>dearth</i> or <i>dearness</i> of those necessaries; and brought the poor man into that state in which he stood so much in need of the active benevolence of his richer neighbour. If the word be applied to God's benevolence towards man, it comes in with all propriety and force: we are <i>dear</i> to God, for we have not been purchased with <i>silver</i> or <i>gold</i>, but with the <i>precious</i> (τιμιωαιματι, <i>costly</i>) blood of Christ, who so loved us as to give his life a ransom for ours.</p>
<p>As Christians in general acknowledge that this chapter is the most important in the whole New Testament, I shall give here the <i>first translation</i> of it into the <i>English</i> language which is known to exist, extracted from an ancient and noble MS. in my own possession, which seems to exhibit both a <i>text</i> and <i>language</i>, if not prior to the time of Wiclif, yet certainly not posterior to his days. The reader will please to observe that there are no <i>divisions</i> of <i>verses</i> in the MS.</p>
<p>The XIII. Chapter of I. Corinthians, from an ancient MS.</p>
<p>Gyf I speke with tungis of men and aungels sotheli I have not charitee: I am maad as brasse sounynge, or a symbale tynking. And gif I schal habe prophecie and habe knowen alle mysteries and alle hunynge <u>or science.</u> and gif I schal have al feith so that I oder bere hills fro oo place to an other. forsothe gif I schal not have charite: I am nought. And gif I schal deperte al my goodid into metis of pore men. And gif I schal bitake my body so that I brenne forsothe gif I schal not have charite it profitith to me no thing. Charite is pacient <u>or suffering.</u> It is benyngne <u>or of</u> <u>good wille.</u> Charite envyeth not. It doth not gyle it is not inblowen with pride it is not ambyciouse or coveitouse of wirschippis. It seeketh not the thingis that ben her owne. It is not stirid to wrath it thinkith not yvil. it joyeth not on wickidnesse forsothe it joyeth to gydre to treuthe. It suffreth all thingis. it bileeveth alle thingis. it hopith alle thingis it susteeneth alle things. Charite fallith not doun. Whether prophecies schuln be bolde eyther langagis schuln ceese: eyther science schul be distruyed. Forsothe of the party we ban knowen: and of partye prophecien. Forsothe whenne that schal cum to that is perfit: that thing that is of partye schal be avoydid. Whenne I was a litil chiilde: I spake as a litil chiilde. I understode as a litil chiilde: I thougte as a litil chiild. Forsothe whenne I was a maad a mam: I avoydid tho thingis that weren of a litil chiild. Forsothe we seen now bi a moror in dercness: thanne forsothe face to face. Nowe I know of partye: thanne forsothe I schal know and as I am knowen. Nowe forsothe dwellen feith hoope charite. These three: forsothe the more of hem is charite.</p>
<p>This is the whole of the chapter as it exists in the MS., with all its peculiar <i>orthography, points</i>, and <i>lines</i>. The words with lines under may be considered the translator's marginal readings; for, though incorporated with the text, they are distinguished from it by those lines.</p>
<p>I had thought once of giving a literal translation of the whole chapter from all the ancient versions. This would be both curious and useful; but the reader might think it would take up too much of <i>his</i> time, and the writer has none to spare.</p>
<p><i><b>The tongues of men</b></i> — All human languages, with all the eloquence of the most accomplished orator.</p>
<p><i><b>And of angels</b></i> — <i>i.e.</i> Though a man knew the language of the eternal world so well that he could hold conversation with its inhabitants, and find out the secrets of their kingdom. Or, probably, the apostle refers to a notion that was common among the Jews, that there was a language by which angels might be invoked, adjured, collected, and dispersed; and by the means of which many secrets might be found out, and curious arts and sciences known.</p>
<p>There is much of this kind to be found in their cabalistical books, and in the books of many called Christians. <i>Cornelius</i> <i>Agrippa's</i> occult philosophy abounds in this; and it was the main object of Dr. <i>Dee's</i> actions with spirits to get a complete vocabulary of this language. See what has been published of his work by Dr. Casaubon; and the remaining manuscript parts in the <i>Sloane library</i>, in the British museum.</p>
<p>In <i>Bava Bathra</i>, fol. 134, mention is made of a famous rabbin, <i>Jochanan ben Zaccai</i>, who understood the language of <i>devils, trees</i>, and <i>angels</i>.</p>
<p>Some think that the apostle means only the most splendid eloquence; as we sometimes apply the word <i>angelic</i> to signify any thing <i>sublime, grand, beautiful</i>, c. but it is more likely that he speaks here after the manner of his countrymen, who imagined that there was an angelic language which was the key to many mysteries; a language which might be acquired, and which, they say, had been learned by several.</p>
<p><i><b>Sounding brass</b></i> — χαλκος ηχων. That is, like a <i>trumpet</i> made of <i>brass</i>; for although; χαλκος signifies <i>brass</i>, and <i>aes</i> signifies the same, yet we know the latter is often employed to signify the <i>trumpet</i>, because generally made of this metal. Thus Virgil, when he represents Misenus endeavouring to fright away the <i>harpies</i> with the sound of his trumpet:- </p>
<p><i><b>Tinkling cymbal.</b></i> — "The cymbal was a concavo-convex plate of brass, the concave side of which being struck against another plate of the same kind produced a tinkling, inharmonious sound." We may understand the apostle thus: "Though I possessed the knowledge of all languages, and could deliver even the <i>truth of</i> <i>God</i> in them in the most eloquent manner, and had not a heart full of love to God and man, producing <i>piety</i> and <i>obedience</i> to the ONE, and <i>benevolence</i> and <i>beneficence</i> to the <i>other</i>, doing unto all as I would wish them to do to me were our situations reversed, my religion is no more to my salvation than the sounds emitted by the brazen trumpet, or the jingling of the <i>cymbals</i> could contribute intellectual pleasure to the instruments which produce them; and, in the sight of God, I am of no more moral worth than those <i>sounds</i> are. I have, it is true, a profession; but, destitute of a heart filled with love to God and man, producing meekness, gentleness, long-suffering, c., I am without the soul and essence of religion."</p>
<p>I have quoted several passages from heathens of the most cultivated minds in <i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i> to illustrate passages of the sacred writers. I shall now quote one from an <i>illiterate collier</i> of <i>Paulton</i>, in <i>Somerset</i> and, as I have named <i>Homer, Horace,</i> <i>Virgil</i>, and others, I will quote <i>Josiah Gregory</i>, whose mind might be compared to a diamond of the first water, whose native splendour broke in various places through its incrustations, but whose brilliancy was not <i>brought out</i> for want of the hand of the lapidary. Among various energetic sayings of this great, unlettered man, I remember to have heard the following: "People of <i>little religion</i> are always <i>noisy</i>; he who has not the love of God and man filling his heart is like an <i>empty wagon</i> coming <i>violently</i> down a <i>hill</i>: it makes a <i>great noise</i>, because there is <i>nothing in</i> <i>it</i>."</p>
