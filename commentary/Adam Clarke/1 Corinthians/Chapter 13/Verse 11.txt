<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:11">1 Corinthians 13:11</span>. <i><b>When I was a child</b></i> â€” This future state of blessedness is as far beyond the utmost perfection that can be attained in this world, as our adult state of Christianity is above our state of natural infancy, in which we understand only as children understand; speak only a few broken articulate words, and reason only as children reason; having few ideas, little knowledge but what may be called mere instinct, and that much less perfect than the instinct of the brute creation; and having no experience. But when we became <i>men</i>-adults, having gained much knowledge of men and things, we spoke and reasoned more correctly, having left off all the manners and habits of our childhood.</p>
