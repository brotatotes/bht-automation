<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>. <i><b>Now we see through a glass, darkly</b></i> — δι εσοπτρου εν αινιγματι. Of these words some <i>literal</i> explanation is necessary. The word εσοπτρον which we translate a <i>glass</i>, literally signifies a mirror or reflector, from εις, <i>into</i>, and οπτομαι, <i>I look</i>; and among the ancients mirrors were certainly made of fine polished <i>metal</i>. The word here may signify any thing by which the image of a person is reflected, as in our <i>looking</i>, or <i>look in glass</i>. The word is not used for a glass to <i>look through</i>; nor would such an image have suited with the apostle's design.</p>
<p>The εσοπτρον or <i>mirror</i>, is mentioned by some of the most ancient Greek writers; so <i>Anacreon</i>, Ode xi. ver. 1:- </p>
<p>In the Greek version the word εσοπτρον is not found but twice, and that in the apocryphal books.</p>
<p>In the book of the Wisdom of Solomon, chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>, speaking of <i>wisdom</i> the author says: "She is the brightness of the everlasting light, και εσοπτρον ακηλιδωτον, and the <i>unspotted mirror</i> of the power of God, and the image of his goodness."</p>
<p>In Ecclus. xii. 11, exhorting to put no trust in an <i>enemy</i>, he says: "Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him, ως εκμεμαχως εσοπτρον, as if thou hadst wiped a <i>looking glass</i>, (mirror,) and thou shalt know that his <i>rust</i> hath not altogether been wiped away." All these passages must be understood of <i>polished metal</i>, not of <i>glass</i>, which, though it existed among the Romans and others, yet was brought to very little perfection; and as to <i>grinding</i> and <i>silvering</i> of <i>glass</i>, they are modern inventions.</p>
<p>Some have thought that the apostle refers to something of the <i>telescopic</i> kind, by which <i>distant</i> and <i>small</i> objects become visible, although their surfaces become <i>dim</i> in proportion to the quantum of the <i>magnifying</i> power; but this is too refined; he appears simply to refer to a <i>mirror</i> by which images were <i>rejected</i>, and not to any <i>diaphanous</i> and <i>magnifying</i> powers, <i>through</i> which objects were perceived.</p>
<p>Possibly the true meaning of the words δι εσοπτρου εν αινιγματι, <i>through a glass darkly</i>, may be found among the Jewish writers, who use a similar term to express nearly the same thing to which the apostle refers. A revelation of the will of God, in <i>clear</i> and <i>express</i> terms, is called by them אספקלריא מאירה <i>aspecularia maira</i>, a <i>clear</i> or <i>lucid glass</i>, or <i>specular</i> in reference, <i>specularibus lapidibus</i>, to the <i>diaphanous polished</i> <i>stones</i>, used by the ancients for <i>windows</i> instead of <i>glass</i>. An <i>obscure</i> prophecy they termed אספקלריא דלא נהריא <i>aspecularia dela</i> <i>naharia</i>, "a specular which is not clear."</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:6">Numbers 12:6</span>: <i>If there be a prophet-I the Lord will make myself known unto him</i> <i>in a vision, and I will speak unto him in a dream</i>; Rab. Tanchum thus explains: "My Shechinah shall not be revealed to him, באספקלריא מאירה <i>beaspecularia maira</i>, in a <i>lucid specular</i>, but only in a dream and a vision."</p>
<p>On <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:4">Ezekiel 1:4</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:5">Ezekiel 1:5</span> : <i>And I looked, and behold a whirlwind-a great cloud, and a fire</i> <i>unfolding itself</i>, c. <i>Sohar Chadash</i>, fol. 33, says: "This is a vision באספקלריא דלא נהרא <i>beaspecularia dela nahara</i>, by an obscure or dark specular."</p>
<p>From a great variety of examples produced by Schoettgen it appears that the rabbins make a great deal of difference between seeing through the <i>lucid glass</i> or <i>specular</i>, and seeing through the <i>obscure one</i>. The first is attributed only to Moses, who conversed with God <i>face to face</i>, i.e. through the <i>lucid specular</i>; and between the other prophets, who saw him in <i>dreams</i> and <i>visions</i>, i.e. through the <i>obscure specular</i>. In these distinctions and sayings of the ancient Jews we must seek for that to which the apostle alludes. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>The word αινιγματι, which we render <i>darkly</i>, will help us to the true meaning of the place. The following is Mr. <i>Parkhurst's</i> definition of the <i>term</i> and of the <i>thing</i>: "αινιγμα, from ηνιγμαι, the <i>perfect passive</i> of ισυιττω, to <i>hint, intimate</i>, <i>signify with some degree of obscurity</i>; an <i>enigma</i>, in which one thing <i>answers</i> or stands in <i>correspondence</i> to, or as the <i>representative</i> of, another, which is in <i>some respects</i> similar to it; occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>: <i>Now</i>-in this life, <i>we see by means of a mirror</i> reflecting the images of heavenly and spiritual things, εν αινιγματι, <i>in an</i> <i>enigmatical manner</i>, invisible things being represented by visible, spiritual by natural, eternal by temporal; <i>but then</i>-in the eternal world, <i>face to face</i>, every thing being seen in itself, and not by means of a representative or similitude."</p>
<p><i><b>Now I know in part</b></i> — Though I have an immediate revelation from God concerning his great design in the dispensation of the Gospel, yet there are lengths, breadths, depths, and heights of this design, which even that revelation has not discovered; nor can they be known and apprehended in the present imperfect state. Eternity alone can unfold the whole scheme of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>As - I am known.</b></i> — In the same manner in which disembodied spirits know and understand.</p>
