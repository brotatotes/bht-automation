<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:13">1 Corinthians 13:13</span>. <i><b>And now</b></i><b> [in this present life] </b><i><b>abideth faith, hope,</b></i><b> </b><i><b>charity</b></i> — These three supply the place of that <i>direct vision</i> which no human <i>embodied</i> spirit can have; these <i>abide</i> or <i>remain</i> for the present state. <i>Faith</i>, by which we apprehend spiritual blessings, and walk with God. <i>Hope</i>, by which we view and expect eternal blessedness, and pass through things temporal so as not to lose those which are eternal. <i>Charity</i> or <i>love</i>, by which we show forth the virtues of the grace which we receive by faith in living a life of obedience to God, and of good will and usefulness to man.</p>
<p><i><b>But the greatest of these is charity.</b></i> — Without <i>faith</i> it is impossible to please God; and without it, we can not partake of the grace of our Lord Jesus: without <i>hope</i> we could not <i>endure</i>, as seeing him who is invisible; nor have any adequate notion of the eternal world; nor <i>bear up</i> under the afflictions and difficulties of life: but great and useful and indispensably necessary as these are, yet <i>charity</i> or <i>love</i> is <i>greater</i>: LOVE is <i>the fulfilling of</i> <i>the law</i>; but this is never said of <i>faith</i> or <i>hope</i>.</p>
<p>IT may be necessary to enter more particularly into a consideration of the <i>conclusion</i> of this very important chapter.</p>
<p>1. <i>Love</i> is properly the <i>image of God</i> in the soul; for <i>God is</i> LOVE. By <i>faith</i> we <i>receive</i> from our Maker; by <i>hope</i> we <i>expect</i> a future and eternal good; but by <i>love</i> we <i>resemble God</i>; and by it alone are we <i>qualified</i> to <i>enjoy</i> heaven, and be one with him throughout eternity. <i>Faith</i>, says one, is the <i>foundation</i> of the Christian life, and of good works; <i>hope</i> rears the <i>superstructure</i>; but <i>love finishes, completes</i>, and <i>crowns</i> it in a blessed eternity. <i>Faith</i> and <i>hope</i> respect <i>ourselves</i> alone; <i>love</i> takes in both GOD and MAN. <i>Faith</i> helps, and <i>hope</i> sustains us; but love to God and man makes us <i>obedient</i> and <i>useful</i>. This one consideration is sufficient to show that <i>love</i> is <i>greater</i> than either <i>faith</i> or <i>hope</i>.</p>
<p>2. Some say <i>love</i> is the <i>greatest</i> because it <i>remains</i> throughout eternity, whereas <i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i> proceed only through <i>life</i>; hence we say that <i>there faith</i> is lost in <i>sight</i>, and <i>hope</i> in <i>fruition.</i> But does the apostle say so? Or does any man <i>inspired</i> by God say so? I believe not. <i>Faith</i> and <i>hope</i> will as necessarily enter into eternal glory as <i>love</i> will. The perfections of God are absolute in their nature, infinite in number, and eternal in their duration. However high, glorious, or sublime the soul may be in that eternal state, it will ever, in respect to God, be <i>limited</i> in its powers, and must be <i>improved</i> and <i>expanded</i> by the <i>communications</i> of the supreme Being. Hence it will have infinite glories in the nature of God to <i>apprehend</i> by <i>faith</i>, to <i>anticipate</i> by <i>hope</i>, and <i>enjoy</i> by <i>love</i>.</p>
<p>3. From the nature of the Divine perfections there must be infinite glories in them which must be objects of <i>faith</i> to disembodied spirits; because it is impossible that they should be <i>experimentally</i> or <i>possessively known</i> by any creature. Even in the heaven of heavens we shall, in reference to the infinite and eternal excellences of God, <i>walk by faith</i>, and <i>not by sight</i>. We shall <i>credit</i> the existence of infinite and illimitable glories in him, which, from their <i>absolute</i> and <i>infinite</i> nature, must be incommunicable. And as the very nature of the soul shows it to be capable of eternal <i>growth</i> and <i>improvement</i>; so the communications from the Deity, which are to produce this growth, and effect this improvement, must be objects of <i>faith</i> to the pure spirit; and, if objects of <i>faith</i>, consequently <i>objects</i> of <i>hope</i>; for as <i>hope</i> is "the expectation of future good," it is inseparable from the nature of the soul, to <i>know</i> of the existence of any attainable good without making it immediately the object of <i>desire</i> or <i>hope</i>. And is it not this that shall constitute the eternal and progressive happiness of the immortal spirit; viz. knowing, from what it has received, that there is infinitely more to be received; and desiring to be put in possession of every communicable good which it knows to exist?</p>
<p>4. As <i>faith</i> goes forward to <i>view</i>, so <i>hope</i> goes forward to <i>desire</i>; and God continues to <i>communicate</i>, every communication making way for another, by preparing the soul for greater enjoyment, and this enjoyment must produce <i>love</i>. To say that the soul can have neither <i>faith</i> nor <i>hope</i> in a future state is to say that, as soon as it enters heaven, it is as happy as it can possibly be; and this goes to exclude all <i>growth</i> in the eternal state, and all <i>progressive manifestations</i> and <i>communications</i> of God; and consequently to fix a spirit, which is a composition of infinite desires, in a state of eternal <i>sameness</i>, in which it must be greatly changed in its constitution to find endless gratification.</p>
<p>5. To sum up the reasoning on this subject I think it necessary to observe, 1. That the term <i>faith</i> is here to be taken in the general sense of the word, for that belief which a soul has of the infinite sufficiency and goodness of God, in consequence of the discoveries he has made of himself and his designs, either by <i>revelation</i>, or immediately by his <i>Spirit</i>. Now we know that God has revealed himself not only in reference to <i>this world</i>, but in reference to <i>eternity</i>; and much of our <i>faith</i> is employed in things pertaining to the <i>eternal world</i>, and the <i>enjoyments</i> in that state. 2. That <i>hope</i> is to be taken in its common acceptation, <i>the</i> <i>expectation of future good</i>; which expectation is necessarily founded on <i>faith</i>, as faith is founded on knowledge. God gives a revelation which concerns both worlds, containing exceeding great and precious promises relative to <i>both</i>. We <i>believe</i> what he has said on his own <i>veracity</i>; and we hope to enjoy the promised blessings in both worlds, because he is <i>faithful</i> who has promised. 3. As the promises stand in reference to both worlds, so also must the <i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i> to which these promises stand as objects. 4. The enjoyments in the eternal world are all spiritual, and must proceed immediately from God himself. 5. God, in the plenitude of his excellences, is as incomprehensible to a glorified spirit, as he is to a spirit resident in flesh and blood. 6. Every created, intellectual nature is capable of eternal improvement. 7. If seeing God as he is be essential to the eternal happiness of beatified spirits, then the discoveries which he makes of himself must be <i>gradual</i>; forasmuch as it is impossible that an infinite, eternal nature can be manifested to a created and limited nature in any other way. 8. As the perfections of God are infinite, they are capable of being eternally <i>manifested</i>, and, after all manifestations, there must be an infinitude of perfections still to be brought to view. 9. As every soul that has any just notion of God must know that he is possessed of all possible perfections, so these perfections, being objects of <i>knowledge</i>, must be objects of <i>faith</i>. 10. Every holy spirit feels itself possessed of <i>unlimited desires</i> for the enjoyment of spiritual good, and <i>faith</i> in the infinite goodness of God necessarily implies that he will satisfy every desire he has excited. 11. The <i>power</i> to <i>gratify</i>, in the Divine Being, and the <i>capacity</i> to be <i>gratified</i>, in the immortal spirit, will necessarily excite continual <i>desires</i>, which desires, on the evidence of <i>faith</i>, will as necessarily produce <i>hope</i>, which is the <i>expectation of future good</i>. 12. All possible perfections in God are the objects of <i>faith</i>; and the communication of all possible blessedness, the object of <i>hope</i>. 13. Faith goes forward to <i>apprehend</i>, and hope to <i>anticipate</i>, as God continues to <i>discover</i> his unbounded glories and perfections. 14. Thus discovered and desired, their influences become communicated, love <i>possesses</i> them, and is <i>excited</i> and <i>increased</i> by the communication. 15. With respect to those which are communicated, <i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i> cease, and go forward to <i>new apprehensions</i> and <i>anticipations</i>, while <i>love</i> continues to <i>retain</i> and <i>enjoy</i> the <i>whole</i>. 16. Thus an eternal interest is kept up, and infinite blessings, in endless succession, <i>apprehended, anticipated</i> and <i>enjoyed</i>.</p>
<p>6. My opinion that <i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i>, as well as <i>love</i>, will continue in a future state, will no doubt appear singular to many who have generally considered the two former as necessarily terminating in this lower world; but this arises from an improper notion of the beatified state, and from inattention to the state and capacity of the soul. If it have the same faculties <i>there</i> which it has <i>here</i>, howsoever improved they may be, it must acquire its happiness from the supreme Being in the way of <i>communication</i>, and this communication must necessarily be <i>gradual</i> for the reasons already alleged; and if gradual, then there must be (if in that state we have any <i>knowledge</i> at all of the Divine nature) <i>faith</i> that such things exist, and may be communicated; <i>desire</i> to possess them because they are good; and <i>hope</i> that these good things shall be communicated.</p>
<p>7. I conclude, therefore, from these and a multitude of other reasonings which might be brought to bear on this subject, that <i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i> will exist in the eternal world as well as <i>love</i>; and that <i>there</i>, as well as <i>here</i>, it may endlessly be said, the greatest of these is love. With great propriety therefore does the apostle exhort, <i>Follow after love</i>, it being so essential to our comfort and happiness here, and to our beatification in the eternal world; and how necessary faith and hope are to the same end we have already seen.</p>
