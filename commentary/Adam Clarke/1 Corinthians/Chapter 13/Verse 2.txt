<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:2">1 Corinthians 13:2</span>. <i><b>And though I have</b></i><b> the gift of </b><i><b>prophecy</b></i> — Though I should have received from God the knowledge of future events, so that I could correctly foretell what is coming to pass in the world and in the Church:-</p>
<p><i><b>And understand all mysteries</b></i> — The meaning of all the types and figures in the Old Testament, and all the unexplored secrets of nature; <i>and all knowledge</i>-every human art and science; and <i>though</i> <i>I have all faith</i>-such miraculous faith as would enable me even to remove mountains; or had such powerful discernment in sacred things that I could solve the greatest difficulties, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span>, <i>and have not charity</i>-this love to God and man, as the principle and motive of all my conduct, the characteristics of which are given in the following verses; <i>I am nothing</i>-nothing in <i>myself</i>, nothing in the sight of <i>God</i>, nothing in the <i>Church</i>, and good for nothing to <i>mankind</i>. Balaam, and several others not under the influence of this love of God, <i>prophesied</i>; and we daily see many men, who are profound <i>scholars</i>, and well skilled in <i>arts</i> and <i>sciences</i>, and yet not only careless about religion but downright infidels! It does not require the tongue of the <i>inspired</i> to say that these men, in the sight of God, are <i>nothing</i>; nor can their literary or scientific acquisitions give them a passport to glory.</p>
