Verse 1 Corinthians 13:2. And though I have the gift of prophecy — Though I should have received from God the knowledge of future events, so that I could correctly foretell what is coming to pass in the world and in the Church:-And understand all mysteries — The meaning of all the types and figures in the Old Testament, and all the unexplored secrets of nature; and all knowledge-every human art and science; and though I have all faith-such miraculous faith as would enable me even to remove mountains; or had such powerful discernment in sacred things that I could solve the greatest difficulties, Matthew 21:21, and have not charity-this love to God and man, as the principle and motive of all my conduct, the characteristics of which are given in the following verses; I am nothing-nothing in myself, nothing in the sight of God, nothing in the Church, and good for nothing to mankind. Balaam, and several others not under the influence of this love of God, prophesied; and we daily see many men, who are profound scholars, and well skilled in arts and sciences, and yet not only careless about religion but downright infidels! It does not require the tongue of the inspired to say that these men, in the sight of God, are nothing; nor can their literary or scientific acquisitions give them a passport to glory.
