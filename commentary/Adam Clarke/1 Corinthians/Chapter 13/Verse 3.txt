<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:3">1 Corinthians 13:3</span>. <i><b>And though I bestow all my goods to feed</b></i><b> the poor</b>] This is a proof that <i>charity</i>, in <i>our sense of the word</i>, is not what the apostle means; for surely almsgiving can go no farther than to give up <i>all</i> that a man possesses in order to relieve the wants of others. The word ψωμιζω, which we translate <i>to feed the</i> <i>poor</i>, signifies to <i>divide into morsels, and put into the mouth</i>; which implies <i>carefulness</i> and <i>tenderness</i> in applying the bounty thus freely given.</p>
<p><i><b>And though I give my body to be burned</b></i> — ινακαυθησομαι. Mr. Wakefield renders this clause thus:</p>
<p>1. <i>And though I give up my body</i> <i>so as to have cause of boasting</i>: in vindication of which he, first, refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+3:28">Daniel 3:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:26">Acts 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32">Romans 8:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</span>.</p>
<p>2. He says that there is no such word as καυθησωμαι.</p>
<p>3. That καυχησωμαι, <i>that I may boast</i>, is the reading of the <i>AEthiopic</i> and <i>Coptic</i>, and he might have added of the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>; several <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> MSS. referred to by St. <i>Jerome</i>; of <i>Ephraim</i>; and of St. <i>Jerome</i> himself, who translates the passage thus: <i>Si tradidero corpus meum ut glorier</i>: i.e. "If I deliver up my body that I may <i>glory</i>, or have cause of <i>boasting</i>."</p>
<p>4. He adds that <i>burning</i>, though a common punishment in after times, was not prevalent when this <i>epistle</i> was written.</p>
<p>Some of the foreign critics, particularly <i>Schulzius</i>, translate it thus: <i>Si traderem corpus, ut mihi stigma inureretur</i>: "If I should deliver up my body to receive a stigma with a hot iron;" which may mean, If I should, in order to redeem another, willingly give up myself to <i>slavery</i>, and receive the <i>mark</i> of my owner, by having my flesh stamped with a hot iron, and have not <i>love</i>, as before specified, it profits me nothing. This gives a good sense; but will the passage bear it? In the MSS. there are several various readings, which plainly show the original copyists scarcely knew what to make of the word καυθησωμαι, which they found in the text generally. The various readings are, καυθησομαι, which Griesbach seems to prefer; καυθησεται; and καυθη; all of which give little variation of meaning. Which should be preferred I can scarcely venture to say. If we take the commonly received word, it states a possible case; a man may be so obstinately wedded to a particular opinion, demonstrably false in itself, as to give up his body to be burned in its defence, as was literally the case with <i>Vanini</i>, who, for his obstinate atheism, was burnt alive at Paris, February l9th, A. D. 1619. In such a cause, his <i>giving his body to be burned</i> certainly <i>profited him</i> <i>nothing</i>.</p>
<p>"We may observe," says Dr. Lightfoot, "in those instances which are compared with <i>charity</i>, and are as good as nothing if charity be absent, that the apostle mentions those which were of the noblest esteem in the Jewish nation; and also that the most precious things that could be named by them were compared with this more precious, and were of no account in comparison of it.</p>
<p>"1. To <i>speak with the tongues of men</i>, among the Jewish interpreters, means, to speak the languages of the <i>seventy</i> nations. To the praise of <i>Mordecai</i>, they say that he understood all those languages; and they require that the fathers of the Sanhedrin should be skilled in many languages that they may not be obliged to hear any thing by an interpreter. Maim. in Sanh., c. 2.</p>
<p>"2. To <i>speak with the tongues of angels</i>, they thought to be not only an excellent gift, but to be possible; and highly extol <i>Jochanan ben Zaccai</i> because he understood them: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</span>.</p>
<p>"3. To <i>know all mysteries and all knowledge</i> was not only prized but affected by them. Of Hillel, the elder, they say he had <i>eighty</i> disciples: <i>thirty</i> who were worthy to have the Holy Spirit dwell upon them, as it did upon Moses; <i>thirty</i> who were worthy that the sun should stop his course for them, as it did for Joshua; and there were <i>twenty</i> between both. The greatest of all was <i>Jonathan</i> <i>ben Uzziel</i>; the least was <i>Jochanan ben Zaccai</i>. He omitted not (i.e. perfectly understood) the Scripture, the Mishna, the Gemara, the idiotisms of the law, and the scribes, traditions, illustrations, comparisons, equalities, gematries, parables, c.</p>
<p>"4. The <i>moving</i> or <i>rooting up of mountains</i>, which among them signified the removing of the <i>greatest difficulties</i>, especially from the sacred text, they considered also a high and glorious attainment: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span>. And of his salvation, who had it, they could not have formed the slightest doubt. But the apostle says, a man might have and enjoy all those gifts, c., and be nothing in himself, and be nothing profited by them."</p>
<p>The reader will consider that the <i>charity</i> or <i>love</i>, concerning which the apostle speaks, is that which is described from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:4-7">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</span>, inclusive: it is not left to the conjectures of men to find it out. What the apostle means is generally allowed to be <i>true religion</i> but if he had not described it, this true religion would have been as <i>various</i> as the parties are who suppose they have it. Let the reader also observe that, not only the things which are in the highest repute among the Jews, but the things which are in the highest repute among Christians and Gentiles are those which the apostle shows to be of no use, if the <i>love</i> hereafter described be wanting. And yet, who can suppose that the man already described can be destitute of true religion, as he must be under an especial influence of God; else, how,</p>
<p>1st, could he speak all the <i>languages of men</i>? for this was allowed to be one of the extraordinary gifts of God's Spirit.</p>
<p>2. He must have Divine teaching to know the <i>language of angels</i>, and thus to get acquainted with the economy of the invisible world.</p>
<p>3. Without immediate influence from God he could not be a <i>prophet</i>, and predict future events.</p>
<p>4. Without this he could not <i>understand</i> all the <i>mysteries</i> of the Divine word, nor those of Providence.</p>
<p>5. All <i>knowledge</i>, suppose this to be confined to human arts and sciences, could not be acquired without especial assistance.</p>
<p>6. And without the most powerful and extraordinary assistance, he could not have a faith that could remove mountains, or miraculous faith of any kind: and the apostle supposes that a man might have all these <i>six</i> things, and not possess that religion which could save his soul! And may we not say that, if all these could not avail for salvation, a thousand times less surely cannot. How blindly, therefore, are multitudes of persons trusting in that which is almost <i>infinitely</i> less than that which the apostle says <i>would profit them nothing</i>!</p>
<p>The charity or love which God recommends, the apostle describes in sixteen particulars, which are the following:-</p>
