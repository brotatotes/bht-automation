<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:5">1 Corinthians 13:5</span>.</p>
<p>(6.) <i><b>Doth not behave itself unseemly</b></i> — ουκ ασχημονει, from α, <i>negative</i>, and σχημα, <i>figure, mein</i>; love never acts out of its place or character; observes due decorum and good manners; is never <i>rude, bearish</i>, or <i>brutish</i>; and is ever willing to become all things to all men, that it may please them for their good to edification. No ill-bred man, or what is termed <i>rude</i> or <i>unmannerly</i>, is a Christian. A man may have a natural bluntness, or be a clown, and yet there be nothing <i>boorish</i> or <i>hoggish</i> in his manner. I must apologize for using such words; they best express the evil against which I wish both powerfully and successfully to declaim. I never wish to meet with those who <i>affect</i> to be called "blunt, honest men;" who feel themselves above all the forms of respect and civility, and care not how many they put to pain, or how many they displease. But let me not be misunderstood; I do not contend for <i>ridiculous ceremonies</i>, and <i>hollow compliments</i>; there is surely a <i>medium</i>: and a sensible Christian man will not be long at a loss to find it out. Even <i>that people</i> who profess to be above all worldly forms, and are generally <i>stiff</i> enough, yet are rarely found to be <i>rude, uncivil</i>, or <i>ill-bred</i>.</p>
<p>(7.) <i><b>Seeketh not her own</b></i> — ου ζητει τα εαυτης. Is not desirous of her own spiritual welfare only, but of her neighbour's also: for the writers of the Old and New Testament do, almost every where, agreeably to their Hebrew idiom, express a <i>preference</i> given to one thing before another by an <i>affirmation</i> of that which is <i>preferred</i>, and a <i>negative</i> of that which is <i>contrary</i> to it. See Bishop Pearce, and see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:24">1 Corinthians 10:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:33">1 Corinthians 10:33</span>. Love is never satisfied but in the welfare, comfort, and salvation of <i>all</i>. That man is no Christian who is solicitous for his own happiness alone; and cares not how the world goes, so that himself be comfortable.</p>
<p>(8.) <i><b>Is not easily provoked</b></i> — ου παροξυνεται. <i>Is not provoked,</i> <i>is not irritated, is not made sour</i> or <i>bitter</i>. How the word <i>easily</i> got into our translation it is hard to say; but, however it got in, it is utterly improper, and has nothing in the original to countenance it. By the transcript from my old MS., which certainly contains the <i>first translation</i> ever made in English, we find that the word did not exist there, the conscientious translator rendering it thus:-<i>It is not stirid to wrath</i>.</p>
<p>The New Testament, printed in 1547, 4to., the first year of Edward VI., in English and Latin, has simply, <i>is not provokeed to</i> <i>angre</i>. The edition published in English in the following year, 1548, has the same rendering, but the orthography better: <i>is not</i> <i>provoked to anger</i>. The Bible in folio, with notes, published the next year, 1549, by <i>Edmund Becke</i>, preserves nearly the same reading, <i>is not provoketh to anger</i>. The large folio printed by <i>Richard Cardmarden</i>, at Rouen, 1566, has the same reading. The translation made and printed by the command of King James I., fol., 1611, c. departs from all these, and improperly inserts the word <i>easily</i>, which might have been his majesty's own and yet this translation was not followed by some subsequent editions; for the 4to. Bible printed at London four years after, 1615, not only retains this original and correct reading, <i>it is not provoked to</i> <i>anger</i>, but has the word <i>love</i> every where in this chapter instead of <i>charity</i>, in which all the preceding versions and editions agree. In short, this is the reading of <i>Coverdale, Matthews,</i> <i>Cranmer</i>, the <i>Geneva</i>, and others; and our own authorized version is the only one which I have seen where this <i>false</i> reading appears.</p>
<p>As to the ancient versions, they all, Vulgate, Syriac, Arabic, AEthiopic, Coptic, and Itala, strictly follow the Greek text; and supply no word that tends to abate the signification of the apostle's ουπαροξυνεται, is not provoked; nor is there a <i>various</i> <i>reading</i> here in all the numerous MSS. It is of importance to make these observations, because the common version of this place destroys the meaning of the apostle, and makes him speak very improperly. If <i>love</i> is <i>provoked</i> at all; it then ceases to be <i>love</i>; and if it be not <i>easily</i> provoked, this grants, as almost all the commentators say, that in special cases it <i>may</i> be <i>provoked</i>; and this they instance in the case of Paul and Barnabas, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:39">Acts 15:39</span>; but I have sufficiently vindicated this passage in my note on that place, and given at large the meaning of the word παροξυνω; and to that place I beg leave to refer the reader. The apostle's own words in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7">1 Corinthians 13:7</span>, are a sufficient proof that the love of which he speaks can <i>never</i> be <i>provoked</i>. When the man who possesses this love gives way to provocation, he <i>loses</i> the balance of his soul, and grieves the Spirit of God. In that instant he ceases from loving God with all his soul, mind, and strength; and surely if he get <i>embittered</i> against his neighbour, he does not <i>love</i> him as himself. It is generally said that, though a man may feel himself highly <i>irritated</i> against the <i>sin</i>, he may feel tender concern for the <i>sinner</i>. <i>Irritation</i> of any kind is inconsistent with self-government, and consequently with internal peace and communion with God. However favourably we may think of our own state, and however industrious we may be to find out excuses for sallies of passion, c., still the testimony of God is, <i>Love is not provoked</i> and if I have not such a love, whatever else I may possess, <i>it profiteth me nothing</i>.</p>
<p>(9.) <i><b>Thinketh no evil</b></i> — ουλογιζεται το κακον. "Believes no evil where no evil seems." Never supposes that a good action may have a bad motive; gives every man credit for his profession of religion, uprightness, godly zeal, c., while nothing is seen in his <i>conduct</i> or in his <i>spirit</i> inconsistent with this profession. His heart is so governed and influenced by the love of God, that he cannot think of evil but where it appears. The original implies that he does not <i>invent</i> or <i>devise</i> any evil or, does not <i>reason</i> on any particular act or word so as to <i>infer</i> evil from it; for this would destroy his love to his brother; it would be ruinous to <i>charity</i> and benevolence.</p>
