<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:6">1 Corinthians 13:6</span>. (10.) <i><b>Rejoiceth not in iniquity</b></i> — ου χαιρει επι τη αδικια. <i>Rejoiceth not in falsehood</i>, but on the contrary, <i>rejoiceth in the truth</i>: this meaning αδικια has in different parts of the Scriptures. At first view, this character of love seems to say but little in its favour; for who can rejoice in unrighteousness or falsity? But is it not a frequent case that persons, who have received any kind of injury, and have forborne to avenge themselves, but perhaps have left it to God; when evil falls upon the sinner do console themselves with what appears to them an evidence that God has <i>avenged their quarrels</i>; and do at least secretly rejoice that the man is suffering for his misdeeds? Is not this, in some sort, rejoicing in iniquity? Again: is it not common for interested persons to rejoice in the successes of an unjust and sanguinary war, in the sackage and burning of cities and towns; and is not the joy always in proportion to the slaughter that has been made of the enemy? And do these call themselves <i>Christians</i>? Then we may expect that Moloch and his sub-devils are not so far behind this description of Christians as to render their case utterly desperate. If such Christians can be saved, demons need not despair!</p>
<p>(11.) <i><b>But rejoiceth in the truth</b></i> — αληθεια. Every thing that is opposite to falsehood and irreligion. Those who are filled with the love of God and man rejoice in the propagation and extension of Divine truth-in the spread of true religion, by which alone peace and good will can be diffused throughout the earth. And because they rejoice in the truth, therefore they do not persecute nor hinder true religion, but help it forward with all their might and power.</p>
