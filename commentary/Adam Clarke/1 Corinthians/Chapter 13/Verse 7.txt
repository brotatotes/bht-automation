<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7">1 Corinthians 13:7</span>. (12.) <i><b>Beareth all things</b></i> — παντα στεγει, This word is also variously interpreted: to <i>endure, bear, sustain, cover,</i> <i>conceal, contain</i>. Bishop Pearce contends that it should be translated <i>covereth all things</i>, and produces several plausible reasons for this translation; the most forcible of which is, that the common translation confounds it with <i>endureth all things</i>, in the same verse. We well know that it is a grand and distinguishing property of <i>love</i> to <i>cover</i> and <i>conceal</i> the <i>fault</i> of another; and it is certainly better to consider the passage in this light than in that which our common version holds out; and this perfectly agrees with what St. Peter says of charity, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:8">1 Peter 4:8</span>: <i>It shall cover the multitude of sins</i>; but there is not sufficient evidence that the original will fully bear this sense; and perhaps it would be better to take it in the sense of <i>contain, keep in</i>, as a vessel does liquor; thus Plato compared the souls of foolish men to a <i>sieve</i>, and <i>not able</i>, στεγειν δια απιστιαν τε και ληθην, <i>to</i> <i>contain any thing through unfaithfulness and forgetfulness</i>. See <i>Parkhurst</i> and <i>Wetstein</i>. Some of the <i>versions</i> have στεργει, <i>loveth</i>, or is <i>warmly affectioned</i> to all things or persons. But the true import must be found either in <i>cover</i> or <i>contain. Love</i> <i>conceals</i> every thing that should be concealed; betrays no secret; <i>retains</i> the grace given; and goes on to continual increase. A person under the influence of this love never makes the sins, follies, faults, or imperfections of any man, the subject either of censure or conversation. He <i>covers</i> them as far as he <i>can</i>; and if alone privy to them, he <i>retains</i> the knowledge of them in his own bosom as far as he <i>ought</i>.</p>
<p>(13.) <i><b>Believeth all things</b></i> — παντα πιστευει. Is ever ready to believe the <i>best</i> of every person, and will credit no evil of any but on the most positive evidence; gladly receives whatever may tend to the <i>advantage</i> of any person whose character may have suffered from obloquy and detraction; or even <i>justly</i>, because of his <i>misconduct</i>.</p>
<p>(14.) <i><b>Hopeth all things.</b></i> — παντα ελπιζει. When there is no place left for <i>believing good</i> of a person, then love comes in with its <i>hope</i>, where it could not <i>work</i> by its <i>faith</i>; and begins immediately to make allowances and excuses, as far as a good conscience can permit; and farther, anticipates the <i>repentance</i> of the transgressor, and his restoration to the good opinion of society and his place in the Church of God, from which he had fallen.</p>
<p>(15.) <i><b>Endureth all things.</b></i> — παντα υπομενει. Bears up under all persecutions and mal-treatment from open enemies and professed friends; bears adversities with an even mind, as it submits with perfect resignation to every dispensation of the providence of God; and never says of any trial, affliction, or insult, <i>this</i> <i>cannot be endured</i>.</p>
