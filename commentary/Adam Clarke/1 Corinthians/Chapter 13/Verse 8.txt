<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:8">1 Corinthians 13:8</span>. (16.) <i><b>Charity never faileth</b></i> — Ἡ αγαπη ουδεποτε εκπιπτει· <i>This love never falleth off</i>, because it <i>bears,</i> <i>believes, hopes</i>, and <i>endures</i> all things; and while it does so it cannot <i>fail</i>; it is the means of <i>preserving</i> all other graces; indeed, properly speaking, it includes them all; and all receive their perfection from it. Love to God and man can never be dispensed with. It is essential to social and religious life; without it no communion can be kept up with God; nor can any man have a preparation for eternal glory whose heart and soul are not deeply imbued with it. Without it there never was true religion, nor ever can be; and it not only is necessary through life, but will exist throughout eternity. What were a state of blessedness if it did not comprehend love to God and human spirits in the most exquisite, refined, and perfect degrees?</p>
<p><i><b>Prophecies - shall fail</b></i> — Whether the word imply <i>predicting</i> future events, or <i>teaching</i> the truths of religion to men, all such shall soon be rendered useless. Though the accurate prophet and the eloquent, persuasive preacher be useful in their day, they shall not be always so; nor shall their gifts fit them for glory; nothing short of the love above described can fit a soul for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Tongues - shall cease</b></i> — The miraculous gift of different languages, that soon shall cease, as being unnecessary.</p>
<p><i><b>Knowledge - shall vanish away.</b></i> — All human arts and sciences, as being utterly useless in the eternal world, though so highly extolled and useful here.</p>
