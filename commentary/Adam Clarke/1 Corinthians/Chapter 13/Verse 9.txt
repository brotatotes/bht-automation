<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:9">1 Corinthians 13:9</span>. <i><b>For we know in part</b></i> — We have here but little knowledge even of <i>earthly</i>, and much less of <i>heavenly</i>, things. He that knows most knows little in comparison of what is known by angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect. And as we <i>know</i> so very little, how deficient must we be if we have not much <i>love</i>! Angels may wonder at the imperfection of our knowledge; and separate spirits may wonder at the perfection of their own, having obtained so much more in consequence of being separated from the body, than they could conceive to be possible while in that body. When Sir Isaac Newton had made such astonishing discoveries in the laws of nature, far surpassing any thing that had been done by all his predecessors in science from the days of Solomon; one of our poets, considering the scantiness of human knowledge when compared with that which is possessed by the inhabitants of heaven, reduced his meditations on the subject to the following nervous and expressive epigram:-- </p>
<p><i><b>We prophesy in part</b></i> — Even the sublimest <i>prophets</i> have been able to say but little of the heavenly state; and the best <i>preachers</i> have left the <i>Spirit</i> of God very much to supply. And had we no more religious knowledge than we can derive from men and books, and had we no farther instruction in the knowledge of God and ourselves than we derive from preaching, our religious experience would be low indeed. Yet it is our duty to acquire all the knowledge we possibly can; and as preaching is the <i>ordinary</i> <i>means</i> by which God is pleased to instruct and convert the soul, we should diligently and thankfully use it. For we have neither reason nor Scripture to suppose that God will give us that immediately from himself which he has promised to convey only by the use of <i>means</i>. Even this his blessing makes effectual; and, after all, his <i>Spirit</i> supplies much that <i>man</i> cannot teach. Every preacher should take care to inculcate this on the hearts of his hearers. When you have learned all you can from your ministers, remember you have much to learn from God; and for this you should diligently wait on him by the reading of his word, and by incessant prayer.</p>
