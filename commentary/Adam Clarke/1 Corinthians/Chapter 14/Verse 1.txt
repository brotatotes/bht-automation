It may be difficult to acquire, and difficult to retain this blessed state, but it is essential to your present peace and eternal happiness. This clause belongs to the preceding chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>Desire spiritual</b></i><b> gifts</b>] Ye are very intent on getting those <i>splendid</i> gifts which may add to your worldly consequence, and please your carnal minds-but labour rather to get the gifts of God's Spirit, by which ye may grow in grace, and be useful to others-and particularly desire that <i>ye may prophesy</i>-that ye may be able to <i>teach</i> and <i>instruct</i> others in the things of their salvation.</p>
