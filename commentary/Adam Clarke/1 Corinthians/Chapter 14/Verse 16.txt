<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:16">1 Corinthians 14:16</span>. <i><b>He that occupieth the room of the unlearned</b></i> — One who is not acquainted with the language in which you speak, sing, or pray.</p>
<p><i><b>Say Amen</b></i> — Give his assent and ratification to what he does not understand. It was very frequent in primitive times to express their approbation in the public assemblies by <i>Amen</i>. This practice, soberly and piously conducted, might still be of great use in the Church of Christ.</p>
<p>This response was of the highest authority and merit among the Jews; they even promised the remission of all sins, the annihilation of the sentence of damnation, and the opening of the gates of paradise, to those who fervently say <i>Amen</i>. And it is one of their maxims that "<i>greater</i> is he who says <i>Amen</i> than he who <i>prays</i>." See many testimonies of this kind in <i>Schoettgen</i>. Now, allowing that this was of so much consequence in tho time of St. Paul, it was a very serious matter for a person to be in a congregation where prayer was offered, who could not say <i>Amen</i>, because the prayers were in a language which he did not understand.</p>
