<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Yet in the church</b></i> — As the grand object of public worship is the edification of those who attend, <i>five words</i> spoken so as to convey edification, were of much more consequence than <i>ten thousand</i> which, not being understood, could convey none. By the word γλωσση, <i>tongue</i>, to which we add <i>unknown</i>, I suppose the apostle always means the <i>Hebrew</i>, for the reasons offered in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p>One of the greatest difficulties, says Bishop Pearce, in this epistle is contained in the words πνευμα and νους, <i>spirit</i> and <i>understanding</i>, which are frequently used in this chapter; and fixing the true meaning of these words will solve the difficulty. In this verse the apostle explains λαλειν τῳ νοΐ, <i>to speak with</i> <i>the understanding</i>, by ινα αλλους κατηχησω, <i>that I might teach</i> <i>others</i>; so that the sense of νους, <i>understanding</i>, seems to be, <i>that understanding which the hearer has of what is said</i>; and this sense will agree well with, <i>I will sing with the spirit</i>, and <i>with</i> <i>the understanding</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:15">1 Corinthians 14:15</span>.</p>
<p>He observes also that πνευμα <i>spirit</i>, and νους, <i>understanding,</i> have a sense opposite to each other; so that if νους is rightly rendered, the <i>understanding which another has of what is said</i>; then πνευμα will signify a <i>man's own mind</i>, i.e. <i>his own</i> <i>understanding of what he himself speaks</i>; and this sense agrees well with <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>: <i>In the spirit he speaketh mysteries</i>.</p>
