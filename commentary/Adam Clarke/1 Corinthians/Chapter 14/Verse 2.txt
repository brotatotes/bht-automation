<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>. <i><b>For he that speaketh in an</b></i><b> unknown </b><i><b>tongue</b></i> — This chapter is crowded with difficulties. It is not likely that the Holy Spirit should, in the church, suddenly inspire a man with the knowledge of some foreign language, which none in the church understood but himself; and lead him to treat the mysteries of Christianity in <i>that</i> language, though none in the place could profit by his teaching.</p>
<p>Dr. Lightfoot's mode of reconciling these difficulties is the most likely I have met with. He supposes that by the unknown <i>tongue</i> the <i>Hebrew</i> is meant, and that God restored the true knowledge of this language when he gave the apostles the gift of tongues. As the Scriptures of the Old Testament were contained in this language, and it has beauties, energies, and depths in it which no verbal translation can reach, it was necessary, for the proper elucidation of the prophecies concerning the Messiah, and the establishment of the Christian religion, that the full meaning of the words of this sacred language should be properly understood. And it is possible that the Hebrew Scriptures were sometimes read in the Christian congregations as they were in the Jewish synagogues; and if the person who read and understood them had not the power and faculty of explaining them to others, in vain did he read and understand them himself. And we know that it is possible for a man to understand a language, the force, phraseology, and idioms of which he is incapable of explaining even in his mother tongue. We shall see, in the course of these notes, how this view of the subject will apply to the illustration of the apostle's words throughout the chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>Speaketh not unto men, but unto God</b></i> — None present understanding the language, God alone knowing the truth and import of what he says:-</p>
<p><i><b>In the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</b></i> — Though his <i>own mind</i> (for so πνευματι is understood here by many eminent critics) apprehends the mysteries contained in the words which he reads or utters; but if, by the <i>spirit</i>, we understand the Spirit of God, it only shows that it is by that Spirit that he is enabled to speak and apprehend these mysteries.
