Verse 20. Be not children in understanding — There are three words here to which we must endeavour to affix the proper sense.1. παιδια signifies children in general, but particularly such as are grown up, so as to be fit to send to school in order to receive instruction;2. νηπιος, from νη, not, and ειπω, I speak, signifies an infant; one that cannot yet speak, and is in the lowest stage of infancy;3. τελειοι, from τελεω, I complete or perfect, signifies those who are arrived at perfect maturity, both of growth and understanding. We shall now see the apostle's meaning: Brethren, be not, παιδια, as little children, just beginning to go to school, in order to learn the first elements of their mother tongue, and with an understanding only sufficient to apprehend those elements.In malice — κακια, In wickedness, νηπιαζετε, be ye as infants, who neither speak, do, nor purpose evil.But in understanding — τελειοι γινεσθε, Be ye perfect men, whose vigour of body, and energy of mind show a complete growth, and a well cultivated understanding.
