<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Be not children in understanding</b></i> — There are <i>three</i> words here to which we must endeavour to affix the proper sense.</p>
<p>1. παιδια signifies <i>children</i> in general, but particularly such as are grown up, so as to be fit to send to <i>school</i> in order to receive instruction;</p>
<p>2. νηπιος, from νη, not, and ειπω, <i>I speak</i>, signifies an <i>infant</i>; one that <i>cannot yet speak</i>, and is in the lowest stage of infancy;</p>
<p>3. τελειοι, from τελεω, <i>I complete</i> or perfect, signifies those who are arrived at <i>perfect maturity</i>, both of <i>growth</i> and <i>understanding</i>. We shall now see the apostle's meaning: <i>Brethren, be not</i>, παιδια, as <i>little children</i>, just beginning to go <i>to school</i>, in order to learn the first elements of their mother tongue, and with an understanding only sufficient to apprehend those elements.</p>
<p><i><b>In malice</b></i> — κακια, <i>In wickedness</i>, νηπιαζετε, <i>be ye as</i> <i>infants</i>, who neither <i>speak, do</i>, nor <i>purpose</i> evil.</p>
<p><i><b>But in understanding</b></i> — τελειοι γινεσθε, <i>Be ye perfect men</i>, whose <i>vigour</i> of <i>body</i>, and <i>energy</i> of <i>mind</i> show a complete growth, and a well cultivated understanding.</p>
