<p>Verse 21. <i><b>In the law it is written</b></i> — But the passage quoted is in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:11">Isaiah 28:11</span>. Here is no contradiction, for the term <i>torah</i>, LAW, was frequently used by the Jews to express the whole <i>Scriptures</i>, law, prophets, and hagiographia; and they used it to distinguish these sacred writings from the words of the <i>scribes</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>With</b></i><b> men of </b><i><b>other tongues</b></i> — Bishop Pearce paraphrases this verse as follows: "With the tongues of foreigners and with the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people; and yet, for all that, will they not hear me, saith the Lord." To enter into the <i>apostle's</i> meaning we must enter into that of the <i>prophet</i>. The Jewish people were under the <i>teaching</i> of the prophets who were sent from God; these <i>instructed, reproved</i>, and <i>corrected</i> them by this Divine authority. They however became so refractory and disobedient that God purposed to cast them off, and abandon them to the Babylonians: then, they had a people to <i>teach, correct</i>, and <i>reprove</i> them, whose language they did not understand. The <i>discipline</i> that they received in this way was widely different from that which they received while under the teaching of the prophets and the government of God; and yet for all this they did not humble themselves before their Maker that this affliction might be removed from them.</p>
