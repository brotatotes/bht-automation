<p>Verse 26. <i><b>How is it - every one of you hath a psalm</b></i>, c.] Dr. Lightfoot understands this in the following manner: When the congregation came together, some were for spending the time in <i>psalmody</i> others in <i>explaining</i> particular <i>doctrines</i>; others in reading, praying, or speaking in the <i>Hebrew</i> tongue; others were curious to hear of farther <i>revelations</i>; and others wished to spend the time in the <i>interpretation</i> of what had already been spoken. This may be specious, but to me it is not satisfactory. It seems more likely that, when the whole Church came together, among whom there were many persons with extraordinary gifts, each of them wished to put himself forward, and occupy the time and attention of the congregation: hence confusion must necessarily take place, and perhaps not a little contention. This was contrary to that edifying which was the intention of these gifts.</p>
