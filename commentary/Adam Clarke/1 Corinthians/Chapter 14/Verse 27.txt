<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Speak in an</b></i><b> unknown </b><i><b>tongue</b></i> â€” The <i>Hebrew</i>, as has already been conjectured.</p>
<p>Let it be <i><b>by two; or at the most</b></i> by <i>three, and</i> that <i>by course</i>] Let only two or three in one assembly act in this way, that too much time may not be taken up with one exercise; and let this be done <i>by course</i>, the one after the other, that two may not be speaking at the same time: <i>and let one interpret</i> for all that shall thus speak.</p>
