<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Let the prophets</b></i> — Those who have the gift of speaking to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Two or three</b></i> — As <i>prophesying</i> implied psalmody, teaching, and exhortation, Dr. Lightfoot thinks that the meaning of the place is this: Let one <i>sing</i> who has a <i>psalm</i>; let another <i>teach</i> who has a <i>doctrine</i>; and let a third <i>exhort</i>, or <i>comfort</i>, who has a gift of that kind.</p>
<p><i><b>And let the other judge.</b></i> — The other prophets, or qualified persons, judge of the propriety of what had been spoken; or let them <i>discern</i>, διακριντωσαν, how the revelation under the new covenant confirmed and illustrated the revelation granted under the Old Testament. It appears to have been taken for granted, that a man might <i>pretend</i> to this spirit of prophecy who was not sent of God; and therefore it was the duty of the accredited teachers to examine whether what he spoke was according to <i>truth</i>, and the <i>analogy of faith</i>. For <i>the spirits of the prophets are</i> <i>subject to the prophets</i>; every man's gift was to be judged of by those whose age, experience, and wisdom, gave them a right to decide. Besides, though the person who did speak might do it from an impulse of God, yet, if he was not <i>sufficiently known</i>, his testimony ought to be received with caution; and therefore the aged prophets should judge of his gift, lest false doctrines should slide into the Church.</p>
<p>But all these provisions, as <i>Schoettgen</i> justly observes, were in imitation of the practice in the Jewish synagogues; for there it was customary for them to <i>object, interrogate, judge, refute</i>, &amp;c.</p>
