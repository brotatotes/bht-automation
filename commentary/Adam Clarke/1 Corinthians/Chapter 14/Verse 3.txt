<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>. <i><b>But he that prophesieth</b></i> â€” The person who has the gift of <i>teaching</i> is much more useful to the Church than he is who has only the gift of <i>tongues</i>, because he speaks to the profit of men: viz. to their <i>edification</i>, by the Scriptures he expounds; to their <i>exhortation</i>, by what he teaches; and to their <i>comfort</i>, by his revelation.-<i>Whitby</i>. I must here refer to my sermon on this text, intitled, "The Christian Prophet and his Work," in which I have endeavoured to consider the whole of this subject at large.</p>
