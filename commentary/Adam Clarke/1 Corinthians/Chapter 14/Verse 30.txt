<p>Verse 30. <i><b>Be revealed to another that sitteth by</b></i> â€” Probably those who were teachers sat on a particular seat, or place, from which they might most readily address the people; and this may be the meaning of <i>sitting by</i>. If such a person could say, I have just received a particular revelation from God, then let him have the liberty immediately to speak it; as it might possibly relate to the circumstances of that time and place.</p>
