<p>Verse 33. <i><b>For God is not</b></i><b> the author </b><i><b>of confusion</b></i> — Let not the persons who act in the congregation in this disorderly manner, say, that they are under the influence of God; for he is not the author of confusion; but two, three, or more, praying or teaching in the same place, at the same time, is <i>confusion</i>; and God is not the author of such work; and let men beware how they attribute such disorder to the God of order and peace. The apostle calls such conduct ακαταστασια, <i>tumult, sedition</i>; and such it is in the sight of God, and in the sight of all good men. How often is a work of God marred and discredited by the folly of men! for <i>nature</i> will always, and <i>Satan</i> too, mingle themselves as far as they can in the genuine work of the Spirit, in order to discredit and destroy it. Nevertheless, in great revivals of religion it is almost impossible to prevent wild-fire from getting in amongst the true fire; but it is the duty of the ministers of God to watch against and prudently check this; but if themselves encourage it, then there will be confusion and every evil work.</p>
