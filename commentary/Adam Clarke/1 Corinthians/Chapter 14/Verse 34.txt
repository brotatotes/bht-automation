<p>Verse 34. <i><b>Let your women keep silence in the churches</b></i> — This was a Jewish ordinance; women were not permitted to <i>teach</i> in the assemblies, or even to <i>ask questions</i>. The rabbins taught that "a woman should know nothing but the use of her distaff." And the sayings of Rabbi Eliezer, as delivered, <i>Bammidbar Rabba</i>, sec. 9, fol. 204, are both worthy of remark and of execration; they are these: ישרפו דברי תורה ואל ימסרו לנשים <i>yisrephu dibrey torah veal</i> <i>yimsaru lenashim</i>, "Let the words of the law be burned, rather than that they should be delivered to women."</p>
<p>This was their condition till the time of the Gospel, when, according to the prediction of Joel, the Spirit of God was to be poured out on the <i>women</i> as well as the <i>men</i>, that they might <i>prophesy</i>, i.e. <i>teach</i>. And that they did <i>prophesy</i> or <i>teach</i> is evident from what the apostle says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:5">1 Corinthians 11:5</span>, where he lays down rules to regulate this part of their conduct while ministering in the church.</p>
<p>But does not what the apostle says here contradict that statement, and show that the words in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:0">1 Corinthians 11:0</span> should be understood in another sense? For, here it is expressly said that they should <i>keep silence in the church</i>; for it <i>was not permitted</i> <i>to a woman to speak</i>. Both places seem perfectly consistent. It is evident from the context that the apostle refers here to <i>asking</i> <i>questions</i>, and what we call <i>dictating</i> in the assemblies. It was permitted to any <i>man</i> to <i>ask questions</i>, to <i>object, altercate,</i> <i>attempt</i> to <i>refute</i>, c., in the synagogue but this liberty was not allowed to any woman. St. Paul confirms this in reference also to the Christian Church; he orders them to <i>keep silence</i>; and, if they wished to <i>learn any thing, let them inquire of their husbands at</i> <i>home</i>; because it was perfectly indecorous for <i>women</i> to be contending with <i>men</i> in public assemblies, on points of doctrine, cases of conscience, c. But this by no means intimated that when a woman received any particular <i>influence from God</i> to enable her to teach, that she was not to obey that influence on the contrary, she was to obey it, and the apostle lays down directions in chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:0">1 Corinthians 11:0</span> for regulating her <i>personal appearance</i> when thus employed. All that the apostle opposes here is their <i>questioning,</i> <i>finding fault, disputing</i>, c., in the Christian Church, as the Jewish men were permitted to do in their synagogues together with the attempts to usurp any authority over the man, by setting up their judgment in <i>opposition</i> to them; for the apostle has in view, especially, acts of <i>disobedience, arrogance</i>, c., of which no woman would be guilty who was under the influence of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p><i><b>But-to be under obedience, as also saith the law.</b></i> — This is a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:16">Genesis 3:16</span>: <i>Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee</i>. From this it is evident that it was the <i>disorderly</i> and <i>disobedient</i> that the apostle had in view and not any of those on whom God had poured out his Spirit.</p>
