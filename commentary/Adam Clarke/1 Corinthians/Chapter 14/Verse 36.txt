Verse 36. Came the word of God out from you? — Was it from you that other Churches received the Gospel? Are you the mother Church? that you should have rules, and orders, and customs, different from all others; and set yourselves up for a model to be copied by all the Churches of Christ?Or came it unto you only? — Are you the only Church of God? Are there not many others founded before you that have no such customs, and permit no such disorders?
