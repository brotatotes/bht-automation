<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Came the word of God out from you?</b></i> — Was it from you that other Churches received the Gospel? Are you the <i>mother</i> <i>Church</i>? that you should have rules, and orders, and customs, different from all others; and set yourselves up for a model to be copied by all the Churches of Christ?</p>
<p><i><b>Or came it unto you only?</b></i> — Are you the only Church of God? Are there not many others founded before you that have no such customs, and permit no such disorders?</p>
