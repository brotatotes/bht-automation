<p>Verse 37. <i><b>If any man think himself to be a prophet</b></i>, c.] He who is really a <i>spiritual</i> man, under the influence of the Spirit of God, and capable of <i>teaching</i> the Divine will, he will acknowledge that what I now say is from the same Spirit and that the things which I now write are the <i>commandments</i> of God, and must be obeyed on pain of his displeasure.</p>
