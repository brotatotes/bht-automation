Verse 37. If any man think himself to be a prophet, c.] He who is really a spiritual man, under the influence of the Spirit of God, and capable of teaching the Divine will, he will acknowledge that what I now say is from the same Spirit and that the things which I now write are the commandments of God, and must be obeyed on pain of his displeasure.
