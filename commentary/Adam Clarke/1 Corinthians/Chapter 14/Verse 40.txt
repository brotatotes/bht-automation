<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:40">1 Corinthians 14:40</span>. <i><b>Let all things be done decently</b></i> — ευσξημονως. In their <i>proper forms</i>; with becoming reverence; according to their dignity and importance, Every thing in the Church of God should be conducted with gravity and composure, suitable to the importance of the things, the infinite dignity of the object of worship, and the necessity of the souls in behalf of which those religious ordinances are instituted.</p>
<p><i><b>And in order.</b></i> — κατα ταξιν. Every thing in its <i>place</i>, every thing in its <i>time</i>, and every thing <i>suitably</i>.</p>
<p><i>Let all things be done decently and in order</i>, is a direction of infinite moment in all the concerns of religion, and of no small consequence in all the concerns of life. How much pain, confusion, and loss would be prevented, were this rule followed! There is scarcely an embarrassment in <i>civil</i> or <i>domestic</i> life that does not originate in a neglect of this precept. No <i>business,</i> <i>trade, art</i>, or <i>science</i>, can be carried on to any advantage or comfort, unless peculiar attention be paid to it. And as to <i>religion</i>, there can be absolutely none without it. Where <i>decency</i> and <i>order</i> are not observed in every part of the worship of God, no spiritual worship can be performed. The <i>manner</i> of doing a thing is always of as much consequence as the <i>act</i> itself. And often the <i>act</i> derives all its consequence and utility from the manner in which it is performed.</p>
