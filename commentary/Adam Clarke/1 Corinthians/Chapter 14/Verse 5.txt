<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span>. <i><b>I would that ye all spake with tongues</b></i> — The word θελω does not so much imply a <i>wish or desire</i>, as a <i>command</i> or <i>permission</i>. As if he had said: I do not restrain you to <i>prophesying</i> or <i>teaching</i> though I prefer that; but I give you full permission to speak in <i>Hebrew</i> whenever it is proper, and when one is present who can interpret for the edification of the Church, provided yourselves have not that gift, though you understand the language. The apostle said <i>tongue</i>, in the singular number, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:4">1 Corinthians 14:4</span>, because he spoke of a <i>single man</i>; now he says <i>tongues</i>, in the plural number, because he speaks of <i>many</i> speaking; but he has the same meaning in both places.-<i>Lightfoot</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Greater</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>he that prophesieth</b></i> — A useful, zealous preacher, though unskilled in learned languages, is much <i>greater</i> in the sight of God, and in the eye of sound common sense, than he who has the gift of those learned tongues; <i>except he interpret</i>: and we seldom find great <i>scholars good preachers</i>. This should humble the scholar, who is too apt to be proud of his attainments, and despise his less learned but more useful brother. This judgment of St. Paul is too little regarded.</p>
