<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6">1 Corinthians 14:6</span>. <i><b>Speaking with tongues</b></i> — Without interpreting.</p>
<p><i><b>What shall I profit you?</b></i> — i.e. I shall not profit you;</p>
<p><i><b>Except I shall speak to you either by revelation</b></i> — Of some secret thing; <i>or by knowledge</i>, of some mystery; <i>or by prophesying</i>, foretelling some future event; <i>or by doctrine</i>, instructing you what to believe and practise.-See <i>Whitby</i>. These <i>four</i> words are taken in different acceptations by learned men. The general sense of the terms is that given above: but the peculiar meaning of the apostle is perhaps not easily discerned.</p>
