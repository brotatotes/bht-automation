<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:7">1 Corinthians 14:7</span>. <i><b>And even things without life</b></i> â€” I may, as if he had said, illustrate this farther by referring to a <i>pipe</i> or <i>harp</i>; if these were to utter mere <i>sounds</i> without order, harmony, or melody, though every tone of music might be in the sounds, surely no person could discern a tune in such sounds, nor receive pleasure from such discords: even so is the person who speaks in an unknown tongue, but does not interpret. His speech tends no more to edification than those discordant and unmeaning sounds do to pleasure and delight.</p>
