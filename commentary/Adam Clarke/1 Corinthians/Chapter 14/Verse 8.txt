<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:8">1 Corinthians 14:8</span>. <i><b>If the trumpet give an uncertain sound</b></i> â€” If, when the soldier should prepare himself for the battle, the trumpet should give a different sound to that which is ordinarily used on such occasions, the soldier is not informed of what he should do, and therefore does not arm himself; consequently, that vague, unintelligible sound of the trumpet, is of no use.</p>
