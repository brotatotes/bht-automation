<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:9">1 Corinthians 14:9</span>. <i><b>Likewise ye</b></i> â€” If ye do not speak in the Church so as to be understood, your labour is useless; <i>ye shall speak into the</i> <i>air</i>-your speech will be lost and dissipated in the air, without conveying any meaning to any person: there will be a noise or sound, but nothing else. Gifts of that kind, thus used, are good for nothing.</p>
