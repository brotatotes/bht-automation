It appears from this chapter that there were some false apostles at Corinth, who denied the resurrection, see 1 Corinthians 15:12; in consequence of which St. Paul discusses three questions in this chapter:-  1. Whether there be a resurrection of the dead? 1 Corinthians 15:1-35. 2. What will be the nature of the resurrection bodies? 1 Corinthians 15:35-51. 3. What should become of those who should be found alive in the day of judgment? 1 Corinthians 15:51-57.  I. The resurrection he proves, 1. From Scripture, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. 2. From eye witnesses, 1 Corinthians 15:5-12.  II. He proves the resurrection by showing the absurdity of the contrary doctrine:- 1. If the dead rise not, Christ is not risen, 1 Corinthians 15:13. 2. It would be absurd to have faith in Him, according to the preaching of the Gospel, if he be not risen, 1 Corinthians 15:14. 3. The apostles must be false witnesses who attest this resurrection, 1 Corinthians 15:15. 4. The faith of the Corinthians must be vain who believe it, 1 Corinthians 15:16; 1 Corinthians 15:17. 5. All the believers who have died in the faith of Christ have perished, if Christ be not risen, 1 Corinthians 15:18. 6. Believers in Christ are in a more miserable state than any others, if there be no resurrection, 1 Corinthians 15:19. 7. Those who were baptized in the faith that Christ died for them and rose again, are deceived, 1 Corinthians 15:29. 8. The apostles, and Christians in general, who suffer persecution on the ground that, after suffering awhile here they shall have a glorious resurrection, are acting a foolish and unprofitable part, 1 Corinthians 15:30-32.  Verse 1 Corinthians 15:1. The Gospel which I preached unto you â€” This Gospel is contained in Christ dying for our sins, being buried, and rising again the third day. See the following verses.
