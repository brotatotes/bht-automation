Verse 1 Corinthians 15:10. But, by the grace of God I am what I am — God, by his mere grace and good will, has called me to be an apostle, and has denominated me such.And his grace, c.] Nor have I been unfaithful to the Divine call I used the grace which he gave me; and when my labours, travels, and sufferings are considered, it will be evident that I have laboured more abundantly than the whole twelve. This was most literally true.Yet not I, but the grace of God — It was not through my own power or wisdom that I performed these things, but through the Divine influence which accompanied me.
