<p><i><b>And his grace</b></i>, c.] Nor have I been unfaithful to the Divine call I used the grace which he gave me; and when my labours, travels, and sufferings are considered, it will be evident that <i>I have laboured more abundantly than the whole twelve</i>. This was most <i>literally</i> true.</p>
<p><i><b>Yet not I, but the grace of God</b></i> — It was not through my own power or wisdom that I performed these things, but through the Divine influence which accompanied me.</p>
