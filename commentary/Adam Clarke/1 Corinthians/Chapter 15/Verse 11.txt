<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:11">1 Corinthians 15:11</span>. <i><b>Whether</b></i><b> it were </b><i><b>I or they</b></i> â€” All the apostles of Christ agree in the same doctrines; we all preach <i>one</i> and the <i>same</i> <i>thing</i>; and, as we preached, so ye believed; having received from us the true apostolical faith, that Jesus died for our sins, and rose again for our justification; and that <i>his resurrection</i> is the <i>pledge</i> and <i>proof</i> of <i>ours</i>. Whoever teaches contrary to this does not preach the true apostolic doctrine.</p>
<p>Paul was the last of the <i>primitive</i> apostles. The <i>primitive</i> apostles were those who had <i>seen</i> Christ, and got their call to the apostolate immediately from <i>himself</i>. There were many apostles after this time, but they were all <i>secondary</i>; they had a Divine call, but it was <i>internal</i>, and never accompanied by any <i>vision</i> or <i>external</i> demonstration of that Christ who had been manifested in the flesh.</p>
