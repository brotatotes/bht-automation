<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:13">1 Corinthians 15:13</span>. <i><b>If there be no resurrection of the dead</b></i> â€” As Christ was partaker of the same <i>flesh</i> and <i>blood</i> with us, and he promised to raise mankind from the dead through his resurrection, <i>if the</i> <i>dead rise not</i> then Christ has had no resurrection. There seem to have been some at Corinth who, though they denied the resurrection of the dead, admitted that Christ had risen again: the apostle's argument goes therefore to state that, if <i>Christ</i> was raised from the dead, <i>mankind</i> may be raised; if <i>mankind</i> cannot be raised from the dead, then the body of Christ was never raised.</p>
