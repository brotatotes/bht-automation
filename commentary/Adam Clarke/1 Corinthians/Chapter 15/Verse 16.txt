<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:16">1 Corinthians 15:16</span>. <i><b>False witnesses</b></i> — As having testified the fact of Christ's resurrection, as a matter which ourselves had witnessed, when we knew that we bore testimony to a falsehood. But could five hundred persons agree in this imposition? And if they did, is it possible that some one would not <i>discover</i> the cheat, when he could have <i>no interest</i> in keeping the secret, and might greatly promote his secular interest by making the discovery? Such a case never occurred, and never can occur. The testimony, therefore, concerning the resurrection of Christ, is incontrovertibly true.</p>
<p><i><b>If so be that the dead rise not.</b></i> — This clause is wanting in DE, <i>Syriac</i>, some of the <i>Slavonian</i>, and <i>Itala</i>; several also of the primitive <i>fathers</i> omit it. Its great <i>similarity</i> to the following words might be the cause of its omission by some copyists.</p>
