<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Ye are yet in your sins.</b></i> â€” If Christ has not risen from the dead, there is no proof that he has not been <i>justly</i> put to death. If <i>he</i> were a <i>malefactor</i>, God would not work a miracle to raise him from the dead. If he has not been raised from the dead, there is a presumption that he has been put to death <i>justly</i>; and, if so, consequently he has made no <i>atonement</i>; and <i>ye are yet</i> <i>in your sins</i>-under the power, guilt, and condemnation of them. All this reasoning of the apostle goes to prove that at Corinth, even among those false teachers, the <i>innocency</i> of our Lord was allowed, and the <i>reality</i> of his resurrection not questioned.</p>
