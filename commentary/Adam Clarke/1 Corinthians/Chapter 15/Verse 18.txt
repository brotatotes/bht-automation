<p>Verse 18. <i><b>They also which are fallen asleep</b></i> â€” All those who, either by <i>martyrdom</i> or <i>natural death</i>, have departed in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <i>are perished</i>; their hope was without <i>foundation</i>, and their faith had not <i>reason</i> and <i>truth</i> for its object. Their bodies are dissolved in the earth, finally decomposed and destroyed, notwithstanding the promise of Christ to such, that he would raise them up at the last day.
