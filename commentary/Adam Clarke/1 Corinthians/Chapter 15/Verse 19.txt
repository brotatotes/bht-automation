<p>Verse 19. <i><b>If in this life only we have hope</b></i> â€” It would be better to translate and <i>point</i> this verse as follows:-</p>
<p><i>And, if in this life we have hoped in Christ only, we are more</i> <i>to be pitied than all men</i>. If, in this life, we have no other hope and confidence but in Christ, (and if he be still <i>dead</i>, and not yet risen,) we are more to be pitied than any other men; we are sadly deceived; we have denied ourselves, and been denied by others; have mortified ourselves, and been persecuted by our fellow creatures on account of our belief and hope in One who is not existing, and therefore can neither succour us here, nor reward us hereafter. Bishop <i>Pearce</i>.</p>
