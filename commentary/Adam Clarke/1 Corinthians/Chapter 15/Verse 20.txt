<p>Verse 20. <i><b>But now is Christ risen</b></i> â€” On the contrary, Christ is raised from the dead, and is become the <i>first fruits of them that</i> <i>slept</i>. His resurrection has been <i>demonstrated</i>, and our resurrection necessarily follows; as sure as the <i>first fruits</i> are the proof that there is a <i>harvest</i>, so surely the resurrection of Christ is a <i>proof</i> of <i>ours</i>. The <i>Judaizing</i> teacher at Corinth would feel the force of this observation much sooner than we can, who are not much acquainted with Jewish customs. "Although," says Dr. Lightfoot, "the resurrection of Christ, compared with some <i>first fruits</i>, has very good harmony with them; yet especially it agrees with the offering of the <i>sheaf</i>, commonly called <i>omer</i>, not only as the <i>thing</i> itself, but also as to the circumstances of the <i>time</i>. For first there was the <i>passover</i>, and the day following was a <i>Sabbatic</i> day, and on the day <i>following</i> that the first fruits were offered. So Christ, our <i>passover</i>, was crucified: the day following his crucifixion was the <i>Sabbath</i>, and the day following <i>that</i>, He, the <i>first fruits of them that slept</i>, rose again. All who died before Christ, and were raised again to life, died afterwards; but Christ is the first fruits of all who shall be raised from the dead to die no more."</p>
