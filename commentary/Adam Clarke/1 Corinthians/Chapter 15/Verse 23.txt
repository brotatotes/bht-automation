<p>Verse 23. <i><b>But every man in his own order</b></i> â€” The apostle mentions <i>three</i> orders here:</p>
<p>1. Christ, who rose from the dead by his own power.</p>
<p>2. Them that are Christ's; all his apostles, martyrs, confessors, and faithful followers.</p>
<p>3. Then cometh the <i>end</i>, when the whole mass shall be raised.</p>
<p>Whether this <i>order</i> be exactly what the apostle intends, I shall not assert. Of the <i>first</i>, Christ's own resurrection, there can be no question. The <i>second</i>, the resurrection of his followers, <i>before</i> that of the common dead, is thought by some very reasonable. "They had here a resurrection from a <i>death of sin</i> to a <i>life of righteousness</i>, which the others had not, because they <i>would</i> not be saved in Christ's way. That they should have the privilege of being raised <i>first</i>, to behold the astonishing <i>changes</i> and <i>revolutions</i> which shall then take place, has nothing in it contrary to propriety and fitness;" but it seems contrary to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span>, in which <i>all the dead</i> are said to rise in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. "And, <i>thirdly</i>, that all the other mass of mankind should be raised last, just to come forward and receive their doom, is equally reasonable:" but it is apparently inconsistent with the manner in which God chooses to act; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:53">1 Corinthians 15:53</span>. Some think that by <i>them that are Christ's at his coming</i>, "we are to understand Christ's coming to <i>reign on earth a thousand years</i> <i>with his saints</i>, previously to the general judgment;" but I must confess I find nothing in the sacred writings distinctly enough marked to support this opinion of the <i>millennium</i>, or <i>thousand</i> <i>years'</i> reign; nor can I conceive any important end that can be answered by this procedure.</p>
<p>We should be very cautious how we make a <i>figurative</i> expression, used in the most <i>figurative book</i> in the Bible, the foundation of a very important <i>literal system</i> that is to occupy a measure of the <i>faith</i>, and no small portion of the <i>hope</i>, of Christians. The strange conjectures formed on this very uncertain basis have not been very creditable either to reason or religion.</p>
