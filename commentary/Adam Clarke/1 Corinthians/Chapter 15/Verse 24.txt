<p>Verse 24. <i><b>When he shall have delivered up the kingdom</b></i> — The <i>mediatorial</i> kingdom, which comprehends all the displays of his grace in saving sinners, and all his spiritual influence in governing the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>All rule, and all authority and power.</b></i> — Αρχην - εξουσιαν - και δυναμιν. As the apostle is here speaking of the <i>end</i> of the present system of the world, the rule, authority, and power, may refer to all earthly governments, emperors, kings, princes, c. though angels, principalities, and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world, and all spiritual wickedness in high places, may be also intended. Our Lord Jesus is represented here as administering the concerns of the kingdom of grace in this lower world during the time that this Divine economy lasts; and when the <i>end</i>-the time determined by the wisdom of God, comes, then, as there is no longer any need of this administration, the kingdom is delivered up unto the Father: an allusion to the case of <i>Roman viceroys</i> or <i>governors</i> of provinces, who, when their administration was ended, delivered up their <i>kingdom</i> or <i>government</i> into the hands of the emperor.</p>
<p>The apostle may refer, also, to an opinion of the ancient Jews, that there should be <i>ten kings</i> who should have the supreme government of the whole world: the <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> of which should be GOD himself; but the <i>ninth</i> should be the <i>Messiah</i>; after whose empire the kingdom should be delivered up into the hands of God for ever.
