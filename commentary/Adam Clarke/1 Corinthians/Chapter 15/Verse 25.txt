<p>Verse 25. <i><b>For he must reign</b></i>, c.] This is according to the promise, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span>: "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool." Therefore the kingdom cannot be given up till all rule and government be cast down. So that while the world lasts, Jesus, as the <i>Messiah</i> and <i>Mediator</i>, must reign and all human beings are properly his subjects, are under his government, and are accountable to <i>him</i>.</p>
