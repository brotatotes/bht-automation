<p>Verse 26. <i><b>The last enemy</b></i> — Death, shall be destroyed; καταργειται, shall be <i>counter-worked, subverted</i>, and finally <i>overturned</i>. But death cannot be destroyed by there being simply no farther death; death can only be destroyed and annihilated by a <i>general resurrection</i>; if there be no general resurrection, it is most evident that death will still retain his empire. Therefore, the fact that <i>death shall be destroyed</i> assures the fact that there shall be a <i>general resurrection</i>; and this is a proof, also, that after the resurrection there shall be <i>no more death</i>.</p>
