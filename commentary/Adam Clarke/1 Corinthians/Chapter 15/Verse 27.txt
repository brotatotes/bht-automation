<p>Verse 27. <i><b>For he hath put all things under his feet</b></i> — The Father hath put all things under the feet of Christ according to the prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1-7">Psalms 110:1-7</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>He is excepted</b></i> — i.e. The <i>Father</i>, who hath put all things under him, the <i>Son</i>. This observation seems to be introduced by the apostle to show that he does not mean that the Divine nature shall be subjected to the human nature. Christ, as Messiah, and Mediator between God and man, must ever be considered inferior to the Father: and his human nature, however dignified in consequence of its union with the Divine nature, must ever be inferior to God. The whole of this verse should be read in a <i>parenthesis</i>.</p>
