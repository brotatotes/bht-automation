<p>Verse 28. <i><b>The Son also himself be subject</b></i> â€” When the administration of the <i>kingdom of grace</i> is finally closed; when there shall be no longer any state of <i>probation</i>, and consequently no longer need of a distinction between the <i>kingdom of grace</i> and the <i>kingdom of glory</i>; then the Son, as being <i>man</i> and Messiah, shall cease to exercise any distinct dominion and <i>God be all in</i> <i>all</i>: there remaining no longer any distinction in the persons of the glorious Trinity, as acting any <i>distinct</i> or <i>separate</i> parts in either the kingdom of grace, or the kingdom of glory, and so the one infinite essence shall appear undivided and eternal. And yet, as there appears to be a <i>personality</i> essentially in the infinite Godhead, that personality must exist eternally; but <i>how</i> this shall be we can neither tell nor know till that time comes in which <i>we</i> <i>shall</i> SEE HIM AS HE IS. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>.</p>
