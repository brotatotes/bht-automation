<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>dead</b></i> — This is certainly the most difficult verse in the New Testament; for, notwithstanding the greatest and wisest men have laboured to explain it, there are to this day nearly as many different interpretations of it as there are interpreters. I shall not employ my time, nor that of my reader, with a vast number of discordant and conflicting opinions; I shall make a few remarks:</p>
<p>1. The doctrine of the resurrection of our Lord was a grand doctrine among the apostles; they considered and preached this as the <i>demonstration</i> of the <i>truth</i> of the <i>Gospel</i>.</p>
<p>2. The multitudes who embraced Christianity became converts on the <i>evidence</i> of this resurrection.</p>
<p>3. This resurrection was considered the <i>pledge</i> and <i>proof</i> of the resurrection of all believers in Christ to the possession of the same glory into which he had entered.</p>
<p>4. The baptism which they received they considered as an emblem of their <i>natural death</i> and resurrection. This doctrine St. Paul most pointedly preaches, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3-5">Romans 6:3-5</span>: <i>Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ,</i> <i>were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him</i> <i>by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the</i> <i>dead, even so we also should walk in newness of life: for, if we</i> <i>have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall</i> <i>be also in his resurrection</i>.</p>
<p>5. It is evident from this that all who died in the faith of Christ died in the faith of the <i>resurrection</i>; and therefore cheerfully gave up their lives to death, as they <i>took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing</i> <i>in themselves that they had in heaven a better and an enduring</i> <i>substance</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:34">Hebrews 10:34</span>.</p>
<p>6. As is the <i>body</i>, so are the <i>members</i>; those who were properly instructed, and embraced Christianity, believed that as all who had died in the faith of Christ should <i>rise again</i>, so they were baptized in the same faith.</p>
<p>7. As so many of the primitive followers of Christ sealed the truth with their <i>blood</i>, and Satan and his followers continued unchanged, every man who took on him the profession of Christianity, which was done by receiving <i>baptism</i>, considered himself as <i>exposing his life</i> to the most imminent hazard, and offering his life with those who had already offered and laid down theirs.</p>
<p>8. He was therefore <i>baptized</i> in reference to this <i>martyrdom</i>; and, having a regard to those dead, he cheerfully received baptism, that, whether he were taken off by a <i>natural</i> or <i>violent death</i>, he might be raised in the likeness of Jesus Christ's resurrection, and that of his illustrious martyrs.</p>
<p>9. As <i>martyrdom</i> and <i>baptism</i> were thus so closely and intimately connected, βαπτιζεσθαι, <i>to be baptized</i>, was used to express <i>being</i> <i>put to a violent death</i> by the hands of persecutors. So <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:22">Matthew 20:22</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span> : "But Jesus answered and said, Are ye able to drink of the <i>cup</i> that I shall drink of? c." (Can ye go through my <i>sufferings</i>?) "They say unto him, We are able. He saith unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of my <i>cup</i>," (ye shall bear your part of the <i>afflictions</i> of the Gospel,) "and be <i>baptized</i> with the <i>baptism</i> that I am <i>baptized</i> with (that is, ye shall suffer <i>martyrdom</i>.) See also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:38">Mark 10:38</span>. So <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:50">Luke 12:50</span> "I have a <i>baptism</i> to be <i>baptized</i> with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!" That is, I must <i>die a violent death</i> for the salvation of men.</p>
<p>10. The sum of the apostle's meaning appears to be this: If there be no resurrection of the dead, those who, in becoming Christians, expose themselves to all manner of privations, crosses, severe sufferings, and a violent death, can have no compensation, nor any motive sufficient to induce them to expose themselves to such miseries. But as they receive baptism as an emblem of <i>death</i> in voluntarily going under the water, so they receive it as an emblem of the <i>resurrection</i> unto eternal <i>life</i>, in coming up out of the water; thus they are <i>baptized for</i> <i>the dead</i>, in perfect faith of the resurrection. The three following verses seem to confirm this sense.</p>
