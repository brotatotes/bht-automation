<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span>. <i><b>For I delivered unto you first of all</b></i> — εν προτοις. As the <i>chief things</i>, or matters of the greatest importance; fundamental truths.</p>
<p><i><b>That which I - received</b></i> — By revelations from God himself, and not from man.</p>
<p><i><b>That Christ died for our sins</b></i> — The death of Jesus Christ, as a vicarious sacrifice for sin, is ενπρωτοις; among the <i>things</i> that are of <i>chief importance</i>, and is essential to the Gospel scheme of salvation.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the Scriptures</b></i> — It is not said any where in the Scriptures, in express terms, that Christ should rise on the <i>third</i> day; but it is fully implied in his <i>types</i>, as in the case of <i>Jonah</i>, who came out of the belly of the fish on the <i>third day</i>; but particularly in the case of <i>Isaac</i>, who was a very expressive <i>type</i> of Christ; for, as his being brought to the Mount Moriah, bound and laid on the wood, in order to be <i>sacrificed</i>, pointed out the <i>death</i> of Christ; so his being brought <i>alive</i> on the <i>third day</i> from the mount was a figure of Christ's resurrection. Bishop <i>Pearce</i> and others refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:40">Matthew 12:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:22">Luke 9:22</span>; "which two Gospels, having been written at the time when Paul wrote this epistle, were properly called by the name of the Sacred <i>Scriptures</i>." It might be so; but I do not know of one proof in the New Testament where its <i>writings</i>, or any <i>part of them</i>, are called the <i>Scriptures</i>.</p>
