Verse 1 Corinthians 15:3. For I delivered unto you first of all — εν προτοις. As the chief things, or matters of the greatest importance; fundamental truths.That which I - received — By revelations from God himself, and not from man.That Christ died for our sins — The death of Jesus Christ, as a vicarious sacrifice for sin, is ενπρωτοις; among the things that are of chief importance, and is essential to the Gospel scheme of salvation.According to the Scriptures — It is not said any where in the Scriptures, in express terms, that Christ should rise on the third day; but it is fully implied in his types, as in the case of Jonah, who came out of the belly of the fish on the third day; but particularly in the case of Isaac, who was a very expressive type of Christ; for, as his being brought to the Mount Moriah, bound and laid on the wood, in order to be sacrificed, pointed out the death of Christ; so his being brought alive on the third day from the mount was a figure of Christ's resurrection. Bishop Pearce and others refer to Matthew 12:40; Matthew 16:21; and Luke 9:22; "which two Gospels, having been written at the time when Paul wrote this epistle, were properly called by the name of the Sacred Scriptures." It might be so; but I do not know of one proof in the New Testament where its writings, or any part of them, are called the Scriptures.
