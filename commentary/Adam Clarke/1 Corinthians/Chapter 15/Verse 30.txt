<p>Verse 30. <i><b>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</b></i> â€” Is there any reason why we should voluntarily <i>submit</i> to so many <i>sufferings</i>, and every hour be in danger of losing our lives, if the dead rise not? On the conviction of the possibility and certainty of the resurrection, we are thus baptized for the dead. We have counted the cost, despise sufferings, and exult at the prospect of death, because we know we shall have a resurrection unto eternal life.</p>
