<p>Verse 31. <i><b>I protest by your rejoicing</b></i> — Νη την ὑμετεραν καυχησιν· <i>By your exaltation</i> or <i>boasting</i>. Dr. Lightfoot understands this of "the <i>boasting</i> of the Corinthians <i>against</i> the apostle; that he considered himself continually trampled on by them; rejected and exposed to infamy and contempt; but that he took this as a part of the reproach of Christ; and was happy in the prospect of death and a glorious resurrection, when all those troubles and wrongs would terminate for ever." Instead of υμετεραν, YOUR <i>exultation</i> or <i>boasting</i>, ημετεραν, OUR <i>exultation</i>, is the reading of the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, and several others, with the <i>AEthiopic, Origen</i>, and <i>Theophylact</i>. This will lead to an easier sense: I declare by the exultation which I have in Christ Jesus, as having died for my offences, and risen again for my justification, that I neither fear sufferings nor death; and am daily ready to be offered up, and feel myself continually exposed to death. But the common reading is probably to be preferred; for <i>your glorying</i> is the same as <i>glorying on your</i> <i>account</i>: I profess by the glorying or exultation which I have on <i>account of your salvation</i>, that I anticipate with pleasure the end of my earthly race.</p>
<p><i><b>I die daily.</b></i> — A form of speech for, I am continually exposed to death. The following passages will illustrate this. So <i>Philo</i>, p. 990. <i>Flaccus</i>, who was in continual fear of death, says: καθ' ἑκαστην ἡμεραν, μαλλον δε ὡραν, προαποθνησκω, πολλους θανατους ὑπομενων ανθ' ἑνος του τελευταιου· "Every day, rather every hour, I anticipate death; enduring many deaths before that last one comes." So <i>Libanius</i>, speaking of his own miseries and those of the people of Antioch, epist. 1320, page 615, says: ετι ζωντες τεθνηκαμεν· "Though living, we are dead." <i>Livy</i> has a similar form of expression to signify <i>continual danger</i>, xxix. 17: <i>Quotidie</i> <i>capitur urbs nostra, quotidie diripitur</i>. "Daily is our city taken, daily is it pillaged."</p>
