<p>Verse 32. <i><b>If, after the manner of men</b></i>, c.] Much learned criticism has been employed on this verse, to ascertain whether it is to be understood <i>literally</i> or <i>metaphorically</i>. Does the apostle mean to say that he had <i>literally</i> fought with wild beasts at Ephesus? or, that he had met with brutish, savage men, from whom he was in danger of his life? That St. Paul <i>did not</i> fight with wild beasts at Ephesus, may be argued,</p>
<p>1. From his own silence on this subject, when enumerating his various sufferings, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>, c.</p>
<p>2. From the silence of his <i>historian</i>, Luke, who, in the acts of this apostle, gives no intimation of this kind and it certainly was too <i>remarkable</i> a <i>circumstance</i> to be passed over, either by Paul in the catalogue of his own sufferings, or by Luke in his history.</p>
<p>3. From similar modes of speech, which are employed metaphorically, and are so understood.</p>
<p>4. From the improbability that a Roman citizen, as Paul was, should be condemned to such a punishment, when in other cases, by pleading his privilege, he was exempted from being scourged, c. And,</p>
<p>5. From the positive testimony of Tertullian and Chrysostom, who deny the <i>literal</i> interpretation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is strongly argued that the apostle is to be <i>literally</i> understood and that he did, at some particular time, contend with wild beasts at Ephesus, from which he was miraculously delivered.</p>
<p>1. That the phrase κατα ανθρωπον signifies <i>as men used to do</i>, and never means <i>according to the</i> <i>manner of men</i>, as implying their <i>purpose</i>, or, <i>to use their forms</i> <i>of speech</i>, c.</p>
<p>2. From the circumstances of the <i>case</i> in Ephesus usually referred to, viz. the insurrection by Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen where, though Paul would have been in danger had he gone into the theatre, he was in little or none, as he did not adventure himself.</p>
<p>3. From his having endured much greater conflicts at <i>Lystra</i> and at <i>Philippi</i> than at Ephesus, at the former of which he was <i>stoned to death</i>, and again miraculously raised to life: <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span>, c. And yet he calls not those greater dangers by this name.</p>
<p>4. That it cannot refer to the insurrection of Demetrius and his fellows, for St. Paul had no contention with them, and was scarcely in any danger, though <i>Gaius</i> and <i>Aristarchus</i> were: see the whole of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:0">Acts 19:0</span>. And,</p>
<p>5. As we do not read of any other imminent danger to which he was exposed at Ephesus, and that already mentioned is not sufficient to justify the expression, <i>I have fought with beasts at Ephesus</i>, therefore we must conclude that he was at some time, not directly mentioned by his historian or himself, actually exposed to wild beasts at Ephesus.</p>
<p>6. That this is the case he refers to, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:8-10">2 Corinthians 1:8-10</span>: <i>For we would not, brethren, have you if ignorant of our trouble</i> <i>which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure,</i> <i>above strength</i>, καθυπερβοληνεβαρηθημενυπερδυναμις, <i>insomuch</i> <i>that we despaired even of life. But we had the sentence of death</i> <i>in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God</i> <i>which raiseth the dead who delivered us from so great a death</i>: for these expressions refer to some excessive and unprecedented danger, from which nothing less than a miraculous interference could have saved him; and that it might have been an actual exposure to wild beasts, or any other danger equally great, or even greater.</p>
<p><i><b>What advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?</b></i> — I believe the common method of pointing this verse is erroneous; I propose to read it thus: <i>If, after the manner of men, I have fought with</i> <i>beasts at Ephesus, what doth it advantage me? If the dead rise</i> <i>not, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die</i>.</p>
<p>What the apostle says here is a regular and legitimate conclusion from the doctrine, <i>that there is no resurrection</i>: For if there be no <i>resurrection</i>, then there can be no <i>judgment </i>- no <i>future state</i> of <i>rewards</i> and <i>punishments</i>; why, therefore, should we bear crosses, and keep ourselves under continual discipline? Let us eat and drink, take all the pleasure we can, for tomorrow we die; and there is an <i>end</i> of us for ever. The words, <i>Let us eat</i> <i>and drink, for to-morrow we die</i>, are taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+22:13">Isaiah 22:13</span>, as they stand now in the <i>Septuagint</i>; and are a pretty smooth proverbial saying, which might be paralleled from the writings of several epicurean heathens,φαγωμεν και πιωμεν· αυριον γαρ αποθνησκομεν. The words of Isaiah are אכול ושתו כי מחר נמות <i>akol</i> <i>reshatho, ki machar namuth</i>: "In eating and drinking, for to-morrow we die ;" i.e. Let us spend our time in eating and drinking, &amp;c. See a similar speech by <i>Trimalchio</i> in <i>Petronius Arbiter</i>, Satiric. cap. xxxvii:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>Ergo vivamus, dum licet esse bene.</i> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>Alas! alas! what wretches we are! all mankind are a worthless pack: thus shall we all be, after death hath taken us away. Therefore, while we may, let us enjoy life.</p>
