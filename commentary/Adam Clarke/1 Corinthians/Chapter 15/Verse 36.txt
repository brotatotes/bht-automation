<p>Verse 36. <b>Thou </b><i><b>fool</b></i> — αφρον. If this be addressed, as it probably is, to the <i>false apostle</i>, there is a peculiar propriety in it; as this man seems to have magnified his own wisdom, and set it up against both God and man; and none but a <i>fool</i> could act so. At the same time, it is folly in <i>any</i> to assert the impossibility of a thing because <i>he</i> cannot comprehend it.</p>
<p><i><b>That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die</b></i> — I have shown the propriety of this simile of the apostle in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:24">John 12:24</span>, to which I must refer the reader. A grain of wheat, c., is composed of the <i>body</i> or <i>lobes</i>, and the <i>germ</i>. The latter forms an inconsiderable part of the mass of the grain the <i>body,</i> <i>lobes</i>, or <i>farinaceous</i> part, forms nearly the whole. This body dies-becomes decomposed, and forms a fine earth, from which the germ derives its first nourishment; by the nourishment thus derived the germ is <i>quickened</i>, receives its first vegetable life, and through this means is rendered capable of deriving the rest of its nourishment and support from the grosser earth in which the grain was deposited. Whether the apostle would intimate here that there is a certain <i>germ</i> in the present body, which shall become the <i>seed</i> of the resurrection body, this is not the place to inquire; and on this point I can with pleasure refer to Mr. Drew's work on the "Resurrection of the Human Body;" where this subject, as well as every other subject connected with this momentous question, is considered in a very luminous and cogently argumentative point of view.</p>
