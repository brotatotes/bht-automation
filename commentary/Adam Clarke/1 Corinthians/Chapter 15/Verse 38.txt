<p>Verse 38. <i><b>But God giveth it a body</b></i> â€” And is there any other way of accounting for it but by the miraculous working of God's power? For out of that one bare grain is produced a system of <i>roots</i>, a tall and vigorous <i>stalk</i>, with all its appendages of <i>leaves</i>, c., besides the full corn in the ear the whole making several hundred times the quantum of what was originally deposited. There are no proofs that what some call <i>nature</i> can effect this: it will ever be a philosophical as well as a Scriptural truth, that <i>God giveth it a body as it pleaseth him</i>; and so doth he manage the whole of the work, that every seed shall have its <i>own body</i>: that the <i>wheat</i> germ shall never produce <i>barley;</i> nor the <i>rye, oats</i>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:12">Genesis 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:12">Genesis 1:12</span></span>.</p>
