<p>Verse 39. <i><b>All flesh is not the same flesh</b></i> — Though the organization of all animals is, in its general principles, the same, yet there are no <i>two</i> different kinds of <i>animals</i> that have flesh of the same flavour, whether the animal be <i>beast, fowl</i>, or <i>fish</i>. And this is precisely the same with <i>vegetables</i>.</p>
<p>In opposition to this general assertion of St. Paul, there are certain people who tell us that <i>fish</i> is not <i>flesh</i>; and while their religion prohibits, at one time of the year, the flesh of <i>quadrupeds</i> and <i>fowls</i>, it allows them to eat <i>fish</i>, fondly supposing that <i>fish</i> is not <i>flesh</i>: they might as well tell us that a <i>lily</i> is not a <i>vegetable</i>, because it is not a <i>cabbage</i>. There is a Jewish canon pronounced by <i>Schoettgen</i> which my readers may not be displeased to find inserted here: <i>Nedarim</i>, fol. 40:</p>
<p>הנודר מן הבשר יהא אסור בבור רגים והגים</p>
<p><i>He who is bound by a vow</i> <i>to abstain from flesh, is bound to abstain from the flesh of fish</i> <i>and of locusts</i>.</p>
<p>From this it appears that they acknowledged that there was one flesh of beasts and another of fishes, and that he was religiously bound to abstain from the one, who was bound to abstain from the other.</p>
