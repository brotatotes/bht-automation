<p>Verse 40. <b>There are </b><i><b>also celestial bodies, and bodies</b></i> <i>terrestrial</i>] The apostle certainly does not speak of <i>celestial</i> and <i>terrestrial bodies</i> in the sense in which we use those terms: we invariably mean by the former the <i>sun, moon, planets</i>, and <i>stars</i>; by the latter, masses of <i>inanimate matter</i>. But the apostle speaks of <i>human beings</i>, some of which were clothed with <i>celestial</i>, others with <i>terrestrial</i> bodies. It is very likely, therefore, that he means by the <i>celestial bodies</i> such as those refined human bodies with which <i>Enoch, Elijah</i>, and <i>Christ</i> himself, appear in the realms of glory: to which we may add the bodies of those <i>saints</i> which arose after our Lord's resurrection; and, after having <i>appeared to many</i>, doubtless were taken up to paradise. By <i>terrestrial</i> bodies we may understand those in which the saints now live.</p>
<p><i><b>But the glory of the celestial</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>one</b></i> â€” The <i>glory</i> - the excellence, beauty, and perfection. Even the present <i>frail human</i> <i>body</i> possesses an indescribable degree of contrivance, art, economy, order, beauty, and excellence; but the <i>celestial</i> body, that in which Christ now appears, and according to which ours shall be raised, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>,) will exceed the excellence of this beyond all comparison. A <i>glory</i> or <i>splendour</i> will belong to that which does not belong to this: <i>here</i> there is a <i>glory</i> of excellence; there, there will be a <i>glory</i> of <i>light</i> and effulgence; for the bodies of the saints shall shine like the <i>sun</i> in the kingdom of their Father.
