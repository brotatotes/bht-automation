<p>Verse 41. <b>There is </b><i><b>one glory of the sun</b></i> â€” As if he had said: This may be illustrated by the present <i>appearance</i> of the celestial bodies which belong to our system. The <i>sun</i> has a greater degree of splendour than the <i>moon</i>; the moon than the <i>planets</i>; and the planets than the <i>stars</i>. And even in the fixed stars, one has a <i>greater degree</i> of <i>splendour</i> than another, which may proceed either from their different <i>magnitudes</i>, or from the comparative <i>proximity</i> of some of them to our earth; but from which of these causes, or from what other cause unknown, we cannot tell, as it is impossible to ascertain the distance of any of the fixed stars; even the nearest of them being too remote to afford any sensible <i>parallax</i>, without which their distances cannot be measured. See the concluding observations.</p>
