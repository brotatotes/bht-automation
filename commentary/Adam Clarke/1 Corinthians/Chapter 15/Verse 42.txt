<p>Verse 42. <i><b>So also is the resurrection of the dead.</b></i> — That is, the bodies of the dead, though all immortal, shall possess different degrees of <i>splendour</i> and <i>glory</i>, according to the state of holiness in which their respective souls were found. The rabbins have some crude notions concerning different <i>degrees</i> of glory, which the righteous shall possess in the kingdom of heaven. They make out <i>seven</i> degrees:-</p>
<p>"The <i>first</i> of which is possessed by צדיקים <i>tsaddi kim</i>, the just, who observe the covenant of the holy, blessed God, and subjugate all evil affections."</p>
<p>"The <i>second</i> is possessed by those who are ישרים <i>yesharim</i>, the upright; whose delight it is to walk in the ways of God and please him."</p>
<p>"The <i>third</i> is for תמימים <i>temimim</i>, the perfect: those who, with integrity, walk in the ways of God, and do not curiously <i>pry</i> into his dispensations."</p>
<p>"The <i>fourth</i> is for קדושים <i>kedoshim</i>, the holy ones; those who are the excellent of the earth, in whom is all God's delight." <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:3">Psalms 16:3</span>.</p>
<p>"The <i>fifth</i> is for בעלי תשובה <i>baaley teshubah</i>, the chief of the penitents; who have broken through the brazen doors, and returned to the Lord."</p>
<p>"The <i>sixth</i> is for תינוקות של בית רבן <i>tinukoth shel beith raban</i>, the scholars and tender ones; who have not transgressed."</p>
<p>"The <i>seventh</i> is for חסידים <i>chasidim</i>, the godly: and this is the innermost of all the departments." These seven degrees require a comment by themselves.</p>
<p>There is a saying among the rabbins very like that of the apostle in this and the preceding verse <i>Siphri</i>, in <i>Yalcut Simeoni</i>, page 2, fol. 10: "The faces of the righteous shall be, in the world to come, like suns, moons, the heaven, stars, lightnings: and like the lilies and candlesticks of the temple."</p>
<p><i><b>It is sown in corruption</b></i> — The body is <i>buried</i> in a state of degradation, decay, and corruption. The apostle uses the word <i>sown</i> to intimate that the body shall rise again, as a seed springs up that has been sown in the earth.</p>
<p><i><b>It is raised in incorruption</b></i> — Being no more subject to corruption, dissolution, and death.</p>
