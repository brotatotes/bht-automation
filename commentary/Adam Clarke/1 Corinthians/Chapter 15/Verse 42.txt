Verse 42. So also is the resurrection of the dead. — That is, the bodies of the dead, though all immortal, shall possess different degrees of splendour and glory, according to the state of holiness in which their respective souls were found. The rabbins have some crude notions concerning different degrees of glory, which the righteous shall possess in the kingdom of heaven. They make out seven degrees:-"The first of which is possessed by צדיקים tsaddi kim, the just, who observe the covenant of the holy, blessed God, and subjugate all evil affections.""The second is possessed by those who are ישרים yesharim, the upright; whose delight it is to walk in the ways of God and please him.""The third is for תמימים temimim, the perfect: those who, with integrity, walk in the ways of God, and do not curiously pry into his dispensations.""The fourth is for קדושים kedoshim, the holy ones; those who are the excellent of the earth, in whom is all God's delight." Psalms 16:3."The fifth is for בעלי תשובה baaley teshubah, the chief of the penitents; who have broken through the brazen doors, and returned to the Lord.""The sixth is for תינוקות של בית רבן tinukoth shel beith raban, the scholars and tender ones; who have not transgressed.""The seventh is for חסידים chasidim, the godly: and this is the innermost of all the departments." These seven degrees require a comment by themselves.There is a saying among the rabbins very like that of the apostle in this and the preceding verse Siphri, in Yalcut Simeoni, page 2, fol. 10: "The faces of the righteous shall be, in the world to come, like suns, moons, the heaven, stars, lightnings: and like the lilies and candlesticks of the temple."It is sown in corruption — The body is buried in a state of degradation, decay, and corruption. The apostle uses the word sown to intimate that the body shall rise again, as a seed springs up that has been sown in the earth.It is raised in incorruption — Being no more subject to corruption, dissolution, and death.
