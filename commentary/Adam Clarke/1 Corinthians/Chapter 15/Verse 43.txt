<p>Verse 43. <i><b>It is sown in dishonour</b></i> — Being now stripped of all the glory it had as a machine, fearfully and wonderfully made by the hands of God; and also consigned to death and destruction <i>because of sin</i>. This is the most <i>dishonourable</i> circumstance.</p>
<p><i><b>It is raised in glory</b></i> — It is raised a glorious body, because immortal, and for ever redeemed from the empire of death.</p>
<p><i><b>It is sown in weakness</b></i> — The principles of dissolution, corruption, and decay, have prevailed over it; disease undermined it; and death made it his prey.</p>
<p><i><b>It is raised in power</b></i> — To be no more liable to weakness, through labour; decay, by age; wasting, by disease; and dissolution, by death.</p>
