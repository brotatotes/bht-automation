<p>Verse 44. <i><b>It is sown a natural body</b></i> — σωμα ψυχικον. An <i>animal</i> <i>body</i>, having a multiplicity of <i>solids</i> and <i>fluids</i> of different kinds, with different functions; composed of muscles, fibres, tendons, cartilages, bones, arteries, veins, nerves, blood, and various juices, requiring continual support from aliment; and hence the necessity of <i>labour</i> to provide food, and <i>skill</i> to prepare it; which food must be masticated, digested, and refined; what is proper for nourishment secreted, brought into the circulation, farther elaborated, and prepared to enter into the composition of every part; hence <i>growth</i> and <i>nutrition</i>; without which no organized body can possibly exist.</p>
<p><i><b>It is raised a spiritual body.</b></i> — One perfect in all its parts; no longer dependent on natural productions for its support; being built up on indestructible principles, and existing in a region where there shall be no more <i>death</i>; no more causes of <i>decay</i> leading to dissolution; and consequently, no more necessity for food, <i>nutrition</i>, c. The body is spiritual, and has a spiritual existence and spiritual support.</p>
<p>What the apostle says here is quite consistent with the views his countrymen had on this subject.</p>
<p>In <i>Sohar Chadash</i>, fol. 43, it is said: "So shall it be in the resurrection of the dead only, the old uncleanness shall not be found."</p>
<p><i>R. Bechai</i>, on the law, fol. 14, says: "When the godly shall arise, their bodies shall be pure and innocent; obedient to the instinct of the soul: there shall be no adversary, nor any evil disease."</p>
<p><i>Rab. Pinchas</i> says: "The holy blessed God shall make the bodies of the righteous as beautiful as the body of Adam was when he entered into paradise."</p>
<p><i>Rab. Levi</i> says: "When the soul is in heaven, it is clothed with celestial light; when it returns to the body, it shall have the same light; and then the body shall shine like the splendour of the firmament of heaven. Then shall men gain the knowledge of what is perfect." <i>Sohar. Gen</i>., fol. 69.</p>
<p>The Jews have an opinion that the <i>os coxendicis</i>, the lower joint of the backbone, <i>survives</i> the corruption of the body; and that it is out of this bone that the resurrection body is formed. In the place last quoted, fol. 70, we have the following teachings on this subject: "Let us borrow an example from what relates to the purifying of silver. <i>First</i>, the ore is cast into the burning furnace, that it may be separated from its earthly impurities; it is then <i>silver</i>, but not <i>perfect silver</i>. They put it into the furnace a <i>second</i> time, and then all its scoriae are separated from it, and it becomes <i>perfect silver</i>, without any adulteration. Thus does the holy blessed God: he <i>first</i> buries our bodies under the earth, where they putrefy and corrupt, that nothing remains but that <i>one bone</i>: from this a new body is produced, which is indeed a <i>body</i>, but not a <i>perfect body</i>. But in that great day, when all bodies are hidden in the earth, and the soul departs, then even that bone decays, and the body which was formed out of it remains, and is as the <i>light of the sun</i>, and the <i>splendour of heaven</i>. Thus, as the silver was purified, so is the body: and no imperfect mixture remains." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>These things must not be treated as rabbinical dotages; the different <i>similes</i> used for the apostle have the same spirit and design: as the seed which is sown in the earth rots, and out of the germ contained in it God in his providence produces a root, stalk, leaves, ear, and a great numerical increase of grains; is it not likely that God, out of some <i>essential</i> parts of the body that now is, will produce the resurrection body; and will then give the soul a body as it pleaseth him; and so completely preserve the <i>individuality</i> of every human being, as he does of every <i>grain</i>; giving to each its own body? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:38">1 Corinthians 15:38</span>. So that as surely as the <i>grain of wheat</i> shall produce <i>wheat</i> after it is cast in the earth, corrupts, and dies; so surely shall our <i>bodies</i> produce the <i>same bodies</i> as to their <i>essential</i> individuality. As the germination of seeds is produced by his <i>wisdom</i> and <i>power</i>, so shall the pure and perfect human body be in the resurrection. Hence he does not say the body is <i>buried</i>, but the body is sown; it is <i>sown</i> in <i>weakness</i>, it is <i>sown</i> in <i>dishonour</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p><i><b>There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</b></i> — This very saying is found in so many words, in <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 126: "There are different kinds of men." </p>
