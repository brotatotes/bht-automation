<p>Verse 45. <i><b>The first man Adam was made a living soul</b></i> — These forms of expression are also common among the Jews: hence we find אדם הראשון <i>Adam harishon</i>, "Adam the first;" and אדם קדמאי <i>Adam</i> <i>kadmai</i>, " Adam the last." They assert that there are two Adams: 1. The <i>mystical</i> heavenly Adam; and 2. The mystical earthly Adam. See <i>Sohar Exod</i>., fol. 29; and the several examples in <i>Schoettgen</i>. The apostle says this is written: <i>The first man Adam was made a</i> <i>living soul</i>: this is found <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:7">Genesis 2:7</span>, in the words נשמת חיים <i>nishmath chaiyim</i>, the <i>breath of lives</i>; which the apostle translates ψυχην ζωσαν, a <i>living soul</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The last Adam - a quickening spirit.</b></i> — This is also said to be <i>written</i>; but <i>where</i>, says Dr. Lightfoot, is this <i>written</i> in the whole sacred book? <i>Schoettgen</i> replies, In the very same verse, and in these words: ויהי האדם לנפש חיה <i>vayehi ha-Adam le-nephesh</i> <i>chaiyah</i>, and Adam became a living soul; which the apostle translates πνευμα ζωοποιουν, a <i>quickening</i>, or life-giving <i>spirit</i>. Among the cabalistic Jews נפש <i>nephesh</i> is considered as implying greater <i>dignity</i> than נשמה <i>nishma</i>. The former may be considered as pointing out the <i>rational</i>, the latter the <i>sensitive</i> soul. All these references to Jewish opinions and forms of speech the apostle uses to convince them that the thing was possible; and that the resurrection of the body was generally credited by all their wise and learned men. The Jews, as Dr. Lightfoot observes, speak frequently of the <i>Spirit of the Messiah</i>; and they allow that it was this Spirit that <i>moved on the face of the waters</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:2">Genesis 1:2</span>. And they assert that <i>the Messiah shall quicken those who dwell in</i> <i>the dust</i>.</p>
<p>"It ought not to be passed by," says the same author, "that Adam, receiving from God the promise of Christ-<i>The seed of the</i> <i>woman shall bruise the head of the serpent</i>, and believing it, named his wife <i>Chauvah</i>, that is, <i>life</i>; so the <i>Septuagint</i>, και εκαλεσεν Αδαμ το ονονα της γυναικος αυτου Ζωη· <i>And Adam</i> <i>called the name of his wife, Life</i>. What! Is she called <i>Life</i> that brought <i>death</i> into the world? But Adam perceived τον εσχατον Αδαμ, the last Adam exhibited to him in the promise, to be πνευμα ζωο, ποιουν, a <i>quickening</i> or <i>life-giving spirit</i>; and had brought in a <i>better life</i> of the <i>soul</i>; and should at last bring in a <i>better life</i> of the <i>body</i>. Hence is that saying, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>: Εν αυτῳ ζωη ην, In HIM was LIFE."</p>
<p>Some contend that the <i>first Adam</i> and the <i>last Adam</i> mean the same person in <i>two</i> different states: the first man with the body of his <i>creation</i>; the same person with the body of his <i>resurrection</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:49">1 Corinthians 15:49</span>.</p>
