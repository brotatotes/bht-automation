<p>Verse 47. <i><b>The first man</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>of the earth</b></i> — That is: Adam's body was made out of the <i>dust of the earth</i>; and hence the apostle says he was χοικος, <i>of the dust</i>; for the body was made עפר מן האדמה <i>aphar min ha-adamah, dust from the ground</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:7">Genesis 2:7</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>The second man</b></i><b> is - </b><i><b>from heaven.</b></i> — <i>Heavenly</i>, ουρανιος, as several good MSS. and versions read. The resurrection body shall be of a <i>heavenly</i> nature, and not subject to decay or death. What is formed of <i>earth</i> must live after an <i>earthly manner</i>; must be <i>nourished</i> and supported by the earth: what is from <i>heaven</i> is of a <i>spiritual</i> nature; and shall have no farther connection with, nor dependence upon, earth. I conceive both these clauses to relate to <i>man</i>; and to point out the difference between the <i>animal</i> body and the <i>spiritual</i> body, or between the bodies which we <i>now</i> have and the bodies which we shall have in the resurrection. But can this be the meaning of the clause, <i>the second man</i> is <i>the Lord from</i> <i>heaven</i>? In the quotation I have omitted οκυριος, the Lord, on the following authorities: MANUSCRIPTS - BCD*EFG, and two others. VERSIONS - <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i> in the margin, <i>Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>. FATHERS - <i>Origen</i>, who quotes it once and omits it once; <i>Athanasius, Basil</i>, the two <i>Gregories, Nyssen</i> and <i>Nazianzen;</i> <i>Isidore, Cyril, Tertullian, Cyprian, Hilary, Zeno, Ambrose,</i> <i>Augustine, Jerome, Ambrosiaster, Philaster, Leo, Pacianus,</i> <i>Primasius, Sedulius, Bede</i>, and <i>others</i>. See these authorities more at large in <i>Wetstein</i>. Some of the most eminent of modern critics leave out the word, and Tertullian says that it was put in by the heretic Marcion. I do think that the word is not legitimate in this place. The verse is read by the MSS., versions, and fathers referred to, thus: <i>The first man is of the earth, earthy; the</i> <i>second man is of heaven, heavenly</i>; κυριος being <i>omitted</i> and ουρανιος <i>added</i>. The <i>first man</i> and the <i>second man</i> of this verse are the same as the <i>first Adam</i> and the <i>second Adam</i> of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>, and it is not clear that <i>Christ</i> is meant in either place. Some suppose that there is a reference here to what <i>Eve</i> said when she brought forth Cain: <i>I have gotten a man from the Lord</i>, קניתי איש את יהוה kanithi ish eth Yehovah, <i>I have possessed</i> or <i>obtained</i> a <i>man, the Lord</i>; that is, as Dr. Lightfoot explains it, that the Lord himself should become man: and he thinks that Eve had respect to the promise of Christ when she named her <i>son</i>; as Adam had when he named his <i>wife</i>. If Eve had this in view, we can only say she was sadly mistaken: indeed the conjecture is too refined.</p>
<p>The terms <i>first man of the earth</i>, and <i>second man from heaven</i>, are frequent among the Jews: אדם לעילא the <i>superior</i> Adam; and אדם תתאה <i>Adam the inferior</i>; that is, the <i>earthly</i> and the <i>heavenly</i> Adam: Adam <i>before</i> the resurrection, and Adam <i>after</i> it.</p>
