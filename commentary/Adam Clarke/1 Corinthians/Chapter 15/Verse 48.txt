<p>Verse 48. <i><b>As</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the earthy</b></i><b>, c.</b>] As Adam was, who was formed from the earth, so are all his descendants frail, decaying, and subject to death.</p>
<p><i><b>As</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the heavenly</b></i> â€” As is the heavenly state of Adam and all glorified beings, so shall be the state of all those who, at the resurrection, are found fit for glory.</p>
