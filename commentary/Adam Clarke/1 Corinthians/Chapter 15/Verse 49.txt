<p>Verse 49. <i><b>And as we have borne the image of the earthy</b></i> — As being descendants from Adam we have all been born in his likeness, and subject to the same kind of corruption, disgrace, and death; we shall also be raised to a life immortal, such as he now enjoys in the kingdom of God. This interpretation proceeds on the ground that what is here spoken belongs to <i>Adam</i> in his <i>twofold</i> state: viz. of <i>mortality</i> and <i>immortality</i>; of disgrace and honour; of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>But by many commentators the words are understood to refer to <i>Adam</i> and <i>Christ</i>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:46-49">1 Corinthians 15:46-49</span>. By <i>these</i>, Christ is called the <i>second Adam</i>, the <i>quickening Spirit,</i> the <i>second man</i>, and the <i>heavenly</i>; whose <i>image</i> of righteousness and true holiness we are <i>to bear</i>.</p>
<p>But when I consider, 1st. How all these terms are used and applied in the <i>Jewish writings</i>, it appears to me that as this was not their import among <i>them</i>, so it was not the design of Paul; and it would be very difficult to find any place where Jesus Christ is called the <i>second Adam</i> in either Old or New Testament. The discourse of the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14-19">Romans 5:14-19</span>, will not prove it, though in those verses there is a <i>comparison</i> drawn between Adam and Christ; but that comparison refers to the extent of the <i>sin</i> and <i>condemnation</i> brought upon all men by the transgression of the <i>first</i>; and the <i>redemption</i> purchased for all men by the sacrifice of the <i>last</i>; and the superabundant grace procured by that sacrifice. But here, the comparison most evidently is between the state of man in <i>this mortal</i> life, and his state after the resurrection. <i>Here</i>, all men are corrupt and mortal, and <i>here</i>, all men die. <i>There</i>, all men shall be incorrupt and immortal, and, whether holy or unholy, shall be eternally immortal.</p>
<p>Of the <i>image of Adam</i>, in his <i>heavenly</i> or paradisaical <i>state</i>, the rabbins talk largely: they say that "God created Adam with a double image, earthly and heavenly; that he was the most perfect of all beings; that his <i>splendour</i> shone from one extremity of the earth to the other; that all feared before him; that he knew all wisdom, both <i>earthly</i> and <i>heavenly</i>; but when he sinned, his glory was diminished, and his wisdom departed from him." <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 10.</p>
<p>They add farther, that "in the time in which Adam received the בדיוקנה עילאה <i>heavenly image</i>, all creatures came to him, and acknowledged him king of the earth." Ibid., fol. 21.</p>
<p>2. From all this, and much more might be produced on the subject, (see <i>Schoettgen</i>,) it appears that the apostle follows, as far as it could comport with his design, the sentiments of his countrymen, and that he adopts their very <i>phraseology</i>; and that it is through the medium of these sentiments and this phraseology that he is to be understood and interpreted. Others may understand all these passages differently; and still consider them as a parallel between <i>Adam</i> and <i>Christ</i>, which is the general view of interpreters. The view which I have taken of them appears to me to be much more consistent with the nature of the discourse, and the scope and design of the apostle. The common opinion is <i>orthodox</i>: what I here propose is no <i>heresy</i>. There are many difficulties in the chapter, and not a few in the verses immediately under consideration.</p>
