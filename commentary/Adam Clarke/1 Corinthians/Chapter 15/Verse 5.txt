Verse 1 Corinthians 15:5. That he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve — This refers to the journey to Emmaus, Luke 24:13, Luke 24:34; and to what is related Mark 16:14.Then of the twelve — Instead of δωδεκα, twelve, ενδεκα, eleven, is the reading of D*EFG, Syriac in the margin, some of the Slavonic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala, and several of the fathers; and this reading is supported by Mark 16:14. Perhaps the term twelve is used here merely to point out the society of the apostles, who, though at this time they were only eleven, were still called the twelve, because this was their original number, and a number which was afterward filled up. See John 20:24.
