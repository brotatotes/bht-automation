<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:5">1 Corinthians 15:5</span>. <i><b>That he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve</b></i> — This refers to the journey to Emmaus, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13">Luke 24:13</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:34">Luke 24:34</span>; and to what is related <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Then of the twelve</b></i> — Instead of δωδεκα, <i>twelve</i>, ενδεκα, <i>eleven</i>, is the reading of D*EFG, <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, some of the <i>Slavonic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala</i>, and several of the <i>fathers</i>; and this reading is supported by <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span>. Perhaps the term <i>twelve</i> is used here <i>merely</i> to point out the <i>society of the</i> <i>apostles</i>, who, though at this time they were only <i>eleven</i>, were still called the <i>twelve</i>, because this was their <i>original number</i>, and a number which was afterward <i>filled</i> up. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:24">John 20:24</span>.</p>
