<p>Verse 50. <i><b>Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom</b></i> â€” This is a <i>Hebrew</i> periphrasis for <i>man</i>, and <i>man</i> in his present state of <i>infirmity</i> and <i>decay</i>. Man, in his present state, cannot inherit the kingdom of God; his nature is not suited to that place; he could not, in his present <i>weak state</i>, endure an <i>exceeding great</i> <i>and eternal weight of glory</i>. Therefore, it is necessary that he should <i>die</i>, or be <i>changed</i>; that he should have a <i>celestial body</i> suited to the celestial <i>state</i>. The apostle is certainly not speaking of <i>flesh and blood</i> in a <i>moral</i> sense, to signify corruption of mind and heart; but in a <i>natural</i> sense; as such, <i>flesh</i> and <i>blood</i> cannot inherit glory, for the reasons already assigned.</p>
