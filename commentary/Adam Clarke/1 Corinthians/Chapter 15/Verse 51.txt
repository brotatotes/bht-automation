<p>Verse 51. <i><b>I show you a mystery</b></i> â€” That is, a thing which you have never known before. But what is this <i>mystery</i>? Why, that <i>we</i> <i>shall not all sleep</i>; we shall not all <i>die</i>; but we shall all be <i>changed</i>: of this the Jews had not <i>distinct</i> notions. For, as flesh and blood cannot inherit glory, and all shall not be found <i>dead</i> at the day of judgment, then all must be <i>changed</i>-undergo such a change that their bodies may become <i>spiritual</i>, like the bodies of those who shall be raised from the dead.</p>
