<p>Verse 52. <i><b>In a moment</b></i> — ενατομω. <i>In an atom</i>; that is, an <i>indivisible</i> point of time. <i>In the twinkling of an eye</i>; as soon as a man can <i>wink</i>; which expressions show that this mighty work is to be done by the almighty power of God, as he does all his works, He <i>calls</i>, and it is <i>done</i>. The resurrection of <i>all</i> the <i>dead</i>, from the foundation of the world to that time, and the change of all the <i>living</i> then upon earth, shall be the work of a <i>single</i> <i>moment</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>At the last trump</b></i> — This, as well as all the rest of the peculiar phraseology of this chapter, is merely <i>Jewish</i>, and we must go to the Jewish writers to know what is intended. On this subject, the <i>rabbins</i> use the very same expression. Thus <i>Rabbi</i> <i>Akiba</i>: "How shall the holy blessed God raise the dead? We are taught that God has a <i>trumpet</i> a thousand ells long, according to the ell of God: this <i>trumpet</i> he shall <i>blow</i>, so that the sound of it shall extend from one extremity of the earth to the other. At the <i>first</i> blast the <i>earth</i> shall be shaken; at the <i>second</i>, the <i>dust</i> shall be separated; at the <i>third</i>, the <i>bones</i> shall be gathered together; at the <i>fourth</i>, the <i>members</i> shall <i>wax warm</i>; at the <i>fifth</i>, the <i>heads</i> shall be covered with <i>skin</i>; at the <i>sixth,</i> the <i>souls</i> shall be <i>rejoined</i> to their <i>bodies</i>; at the <i>seventh</i>, all shall <i>revive</i> and stand <i>clothed</i>." See <i>Wetstein</i>. This tradition shows us what we are to understand by the <i>last trump</i> of the apostle; it is the <i>seventh</i> of Rab. <i>Akiba</i>, when the dead shall be all raised, and, being <i>clothed upon</i> with their eternal vehicles, they shall be ready to appear before the judgment seat of God.</p>
<p><i><b>For the trumpet shall sound</b></i> — By this the apostle confirms the <i>substance</i> of the tradition, there shall be the <i>sound of a trumpet</i> on this great day; and this other scriptures teach: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:14">Zechariah 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>, in which latter place, the apostle treats this subject among the Thessalonians, as he does here among the Corinthians. See the notes there.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall be raised incorruptible</b></i> — Fully clothed with a new body, to die no more.</p>
<p><i><b>We shall be changed.</b></i> — That is, those who shall then be found <i>alive</i>.</p>
