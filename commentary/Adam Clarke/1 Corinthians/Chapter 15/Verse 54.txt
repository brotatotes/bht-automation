<p>Verse 54. <i><b>Death is swallowed up in victory.</b></i> — Κατεποθη ὁ θανατος εις νικος. These words are a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span>, where the Hebrew is בלע המות לנצח <i>billa hammaveth lanetsach: He</i> (God) <i>hath swallowed up death in victory</i>; or, <i>for ever</i>. These words in the <i>Septuagint</i> are thus translated: κατεπιεν ὁ θανατος ισχυσας· Death <i>having prevailed</i>, or <i>conquered, hath swallowed up.</i> But in the version of <i>Theodotion</i>, the words are the same with those of the apostle. The Hebrew לנצח <i>lanetsach</i> the <i>Septuagint</i> sometimes translate ειςνικος, <i>in victory</i>, but most commonly εις τελος, <i>for ever</i>; both, as Bishop Pearce observes, in such kind of phrases, signifying the same thing, because eternity conquers all things; and accordingly, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2sa+2:26">2 Samuel 2:26</span>, where the Septuagint have μη εις νικος καταφαγεται ἡ ῥομφαια, our English version has, <i>Shall the sword devour</i> FOR EVER? And the same may be seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+36:7">Job 36:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="la+5:20">Lamentations 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+1:11">Amos 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+8:7">Amos 8:7</span>; from which authority the bishop translates the clause here, <i>Death is swallowed up</i> FOR EVER.</p>
<p>Death is here personified and represented as a devouring being, swallowing up all the generations of men; and by the resurrection of the body and the destruction of the empire of death, God is represented as swallowing him up; or that <i>eternity</i> gulps him down; so that he is endlessly lost and absorbed in its illimitable waste. How glorious a time to the righteous, when the inhabitant shall no more say, I am sick; when God shall have wiped away all tears from off all faces, and when there shall be no more death. This time must come. Hallelujah! The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</p>
