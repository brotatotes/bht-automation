<p>Verse 55. <i><b>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy</b></i><b> </b><i><b>victory?</b></i> — Που σου, Θανατε, το κεντρον· που σου, ᾁδη, το νικος· These words are generally supposed to be taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:14">Hosea 13:14</span>, where the Hebrew text stands thus: אהי דבריך מות אהי קטבך שאול <i>ehi debareyca maueth; ehikatabca sheol</i>: which we translate, <i>O</i> <i>death! I will be thy plagues; O grave! I will be thy destruction</i>; and which the Septuagint translate very nearly as the apostle, που ἡ δικη σου, Θαντε; που το κεντρον σον, ᾁδη; O death, where is thy revenge, or <i>judicial process</i>? O grave, where is thy sting? And it may be remarked that almost all the MSS., <i>versions</i>, and many of the <i>fathers</i>, interchange the two members of this sentence as they appear in the Septuagint, attributing <i>victory</i> to <i>death</i>; and the <i>sting</i>, to <i>hades</i> or the <i>grave</i>; only the Septuagint, probably by mistake or corruption of copyists, have δικη, dike, <i>revenge</i> or a <i>judicial process</i>, for νικος, nikos, <i>victory</i>: a mistake which the similarity of the words, both in <i>letters</i> and <i>sound</i>, might readily produce. We may observe, also, that the אהי <i>ehi</i> (I will be) of the Hebrew text the Septuagint, and the apostle following them, have translated που, <i>where</i>, as if the word had been written איה <i>where</i>, the two last letters interchanged; but אהי <i>ehi</i>, is rendered <i>where</i> in other places; and our translators, in the 10th verse of this same chapter (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:10">Hosea 13:10</span>) render אהי מלך <i>ehi malca</i>, "I will be thy king," but have this note in the margin, "Rather, <i>where is thy king</i>? King Hoshea being then in prison." The apostle, therefore, and the Septuagint, are sufficiently vindicated by the use of the word elsewhere: and the best Jewish commentators allow this use of the word. The <i>Targum, Syriac,</i> <i>Arabic, Vulgate</i>, and some MSS. of <i>Kennicott</i> and <i>De Rossi</i>, confirm this reading.</p>
<p>Having vindicated the translation, it is necessary to inquire into the meaning of the apostle's expressions. Both <i>Death</i> and <i>Hades</i> are here personified: <i>Death</i> is represented as having a <i>sting, dagger</i>, or <i>goad</i>, by which, like the driver of oxen, he is continually irritating and urging on; (these irritations are the <i>diseases</i> by which men are urged on till they fall into <i>Hades</i>, the empire of Death;) to <i>Hades, victory</i> is attributed, having overcome and conquered all human life, and subdued all to its own empire. By the transposition of these two members of the sentence, the <i>victory</i> is given to <i>Death</i>, who has extinguished all human life; and the <i>sting</i> is given to <i>Hades</i>, as in his empire the <i>evil</i> of death is fully displayed by the extinction of all animal life, and the destruction of all human bodies. We have often seen a personification of death in ancient paintings-a skeleton crowned, with a dart in his hand; probably taken from the apostle's description. The Jews represent the angel of death as having a sword, from which deadly drops of gall fall into the mouths of all men.</p>
<p><i>Hades</i>, which we here translate <i>grave</i>, is generally understood to be the <i>place of separate spirits</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23">Matthew 11:23</span>.</p>
