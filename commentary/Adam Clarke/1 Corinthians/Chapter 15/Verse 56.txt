<p>Verse 56. <i><b>The sting of death</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>sin</b></i> — The apostle explains himself particularly here: death could not have entered into the world if sin had not entered <i>first</i>; it was <i>sin</i> that not only introduced <i>death</i>, but has armed him with all his <i>destroying</i> force; the <i>goad</i> or <i>dagger</i> of death is <i>sin</i>; by this both body and soul are slain.</p>
<p><i><b>The strength of sin</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>the law.</b></i> — The law of God forbids all transgression, and sentences those who commit it to temporal and eternal death. Sin has its controlling and <i>binding</i> power from the law. The law <i>curses</i> the transgressor, and provides no help for him; and if nothing else intervene, he must, through it, continue ever under the empire of death.</p>
