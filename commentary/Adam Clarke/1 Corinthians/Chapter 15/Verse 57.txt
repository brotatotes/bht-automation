<p>Verse 57. <i><b>But thanks</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>to God</b></i> â€” What the law could not do, because it is <i>law</i>, (and law cannot provide <i>pardon</i>,) is done by the <i>Gospel</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ: he has <i>died</i> to slay death; he has <i>risen</i> again to bring mankind from under the empire of <i>hades</i>. All this he has done through his mere unmerited <i>mercy</i>; and eternal <i>thanks</i> are due to God for this <i>unspeakable gift</i>. He has given us the <i>victory</i> over sin, Satan, death, the grave, and hell.</p>
