<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:58">1 Corinthians 15:58</span>. <b><i>Be ye steadfast</i></b>] εδραιοι, from εδρα, a <i>seat</i>; be settled; confide in the truth of this doctrine of the resurrection, and every thing that pertains to it, as confidently as a man <i>sits</i> down on a SEAT, which he knows to be solid, firm, and safe; and on which he has often <i>sat</i>.</p>
<p><b><i>Unmovable</i></b>] αμετακινητοι, from α, <i>negative</i>, and μετακινεω, <i>to move away</i>; let nothing <i>shake</i> your faith; let nothing <i>move you</i> <i>away</i> from this hope of the Gospel which is given unto you. What I tell you I receive from God; your false teachers cannot say so: in a declaration of God you may unshakingly confide.</p>
<p><b><i>Always abounding in the work of the Lord</i></b>] The <i>work of the Lord</i> <i>is obedience</i> to his holy word; every believer in Christ is a <i>workman</i> of God. He that <i>works</i> not, to bring glory to God and good to man, is not acknowledged as a <i>servant of Christ</i>; and if he be not a servant, he is not a <i>son</i>; and if not a son, then not an <i>heir</i>. And he must not only <i>work</i>, but <i>abound</i> in that work; ever exceeding his former self; and this, not for a <i>time</i>, but <i>always</i>; beginning, continuing, and ending every act of life to God's glory and the good of his fellows.</p>
<p><b><i>Your labour is not in vain</i></b>] <i>Your labour in the Lord is not in</i> <i>vain</i>; you must not only <i>work</i>, but you must <i>labour</i>-put forth all your strength; and you must work and labour <i>in the Lord</i>-under his <i>direction</i>, and by his <i>influence</i>; for without him ye can do nothing. And this labour cannot be <i>in vain</i>; you shall have a resurrection unto eternal life: not because you have <i>laboured</i>, but because Christ died and gave you grace to be faithful.</p>
<p>1. THE chapter through which the reader has passed is a chapter of great importance and difficulty; and on its difficulties much has been written in the preceding notes. Though I have used all the helps in my power to guide me in explaining it, I have, upon the whole, been obliged to think for myself, and claim only the praise of severe labour, ever directed by honest intention and an earnest desire to find out the truth.</p>
<p>2. There are many questions connected with the doctrine of the resurrection which I could not introduce here without writing a <i>book</i> instead of <i>short notes</i> on a very long chapter. On such subjects, I again beg leave to direct the reader to Mr. <i>Samuel</i> <i>Drew's</i> Essay on that subject.</p>
<p>3. One remark I cannot help making; the doctrine of the <i>resurrection</i> appears to have been thought of much more consequence among the primitive Christians than it is <i>now</i>! How is this? The apostles were continually insisting on it, and exciting the followers of God to diligence, obedience, and cheerfulness through it. And their successors in the present day seldom mention it! So apostles preached, and so primitive Christians believed; so we preach, and so our hearers believe. There is not a doctrine in the Gospel on which more stress is laid; and there is not a doctrine in the present system of preaching which is treated with more neglect!</p>
<p>4. Though all men shall rise again, yet it will be in widely different circumstances: some will rise to glory and honour; others to shame and everlasting contempt. Those alone who here received the salvation of God, and continued faithful unto death, shall have a resurrection to everlasting glory; not every <i>believer</i>, but every loving obedient believer, shall enter into the paradise of God, and have a body fashioned like unto his Lord's glorious body.</p>
<p>5. All glorified spirits will not have the same <i>degree</i> of glory. <i>Two</i> things will necessarily cause great difference: 1. The quantum of <i>mind</i>; and 2. The quantum of <i>grace</i>.</p>
<p>(1.) It is idle to suppose that God has made all human souls with the <i>same capacities</i>: he has not. There is an infinite diversity; he who has the greatest mind can <i>know</i> most, <i>do</i> most, <i>suffer</i> most, and <i>enjoy</i> most.</p>
<p>(2.) The quantum of <i>grace</i> will be another great cause of diversity and glory. He who received most of Christ here, and was most devoted to his service, shall have the nearest <i>approach</i> to him in his own kingdom. But all equally holy and equally faithful souls shall not have equal degrees of glory; for the glory will be according to the <i>capacity</i> of the <i>mind</i>, as well as the degree of <i>grace</i> and <i>improvement</i>. The greater the capacity, provided it be properly influenced by the grace of Christ, the greater will be the enjoyment.</p>
<p>6. That there will be great diversity in the states of glorified saints is the apostle's doctrine; and he illustrates it by the different degrees of <i>splendour</i> between the <i>sun, moon,</i> <i>planets</i>, and <i>stars</i>. This needs little application. There are some of the heavenly bodies that give <i>heat, light</i>, and <i>splendour</i>, as the SUN; and are of the utmost service to the world: some that give <i>light</i>, and comparative <i>splendour</i>, without <i>heat</i>, as the MOON; and yet are of very great use to mankind: others, again, which give a <i>steady</i> but not a <i>splendid light</i>, at the PLANETS; and are serviceable in their particular spheres: and lastly, others which <i>twinkle</i> in their respective systems, as the stars of different magnitudes.</p>
<p>7. <i>One star</i>, says the apostle, <i>differs from another in glory</i>, i.e. in <i>splendour</i>, according to what is called their different <i>magnitudes</i>. I will state a remarkable fact: The northern and southern hemispheres of the heavens have been divided into 102 <i>constellations</i>, and in these constellations Professor <i>Bode</i> has set down the places of 17,240 stars; <i>simple, nebulous, conglobate</i>, and <i>double</i>. The stars have been distinguished by their <i>apparent</i> <i>magnitudes</i> or rather <i>splendour</i>, into stars of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, c., magnitudes: of these 17,240, only <i>sixteen</i> are, by astronomers in general, agreed to be of the <i>first</i> magnitude, all of which are set down in the following catalogue, with some of those that are remarkable in the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth magnitudes. The reader will observe that the name of the <i>constellation</i> or <i>star</i> is first mentioned the Greek letters, c., are those by which they are distinguished on maps and globes and they are, by astronomers, referred to by these letters and numbers. My inferences follow the <i>table</i>. </p>
<p>A TABLE of the most remarkable FIXED STARS, from the FIRST to the SIXTH MAGNITUDE.</p>
<p><i>Observations on the preceding Table.</i></p>
<p>The <i>five</i> stars of the <i>second</i> magnitude in the above list, marked with an asterisk, are by some writers denominated of the <i>first</i> magnitude; and those named of the <i>third, fourth, fifth</i>, and <i>sixth</i> magnitudes, (the stars of the last-mentioned order being barely visible to the naked eye,) are such as the moon can occult, or make a near appulse to; except the last sixteen, in the column of stars of the <i>third</i> magnitude, and the last twenty-nine in that of the <i>sixth</i> magnitude, which never set in the latitude of London. The stars <i>Algol</i> and ο <i>Ceti</i> are set down according to their <i>brightest</i> appearance; the former varying from the second to the fourth magnitude every two days, 20 hours, 48 minutes, 58 seconds, 18 thirds, and 25 fourths; and the latter, from the second to the seventh, and sometimes to the tenth, every 331 days, 10 hours, and 19 minutes. The stars of the first magnitude, Capella and Lyra, never set in the latitude of London; Acharnar, Canopus, β in Argo, and α in the Cross and Centaur, never rise. Of the stars of the second magnitude in the preceding list, β in Medusa's head, or Algol, α in Perseus, the two Pointers, the Dragon's tail, and the Swan's tail, never set; the head of the Phoenix and the bright star in the Crane never rise. The stars marked with an asterisk in the third column are between the third and fourth magnitudes; and those in the last column with the same mark are between the fifth and sixth magnitudes. Stars fainter than those of the sixth magnitude cannot be discerned without the help of a glass, and are therefore called <i>telescopic</i>. The 2h, and 3h, in Aquarius, are of this last description, both of the <i>seventh</i> magnitude, and such as the moon can occult.</p>
<p>8. This subject, as far as it concerns the present place, admits of few remarks or reflections. It has already been observed, that, of all the stars which our best astronomers have been able to describe and lay down in tables and maps, only <i>sixteen</i> are of the <i>first</i> magnitude; i.e. appear more <i>luminous</i> than any other stars in the firmament: some, indeed, increase the number to twenty-one, by taking in <i>Castor</i> and <i>Pollux</i>, the <i>upper</i> <i>Pointer, Atteer</i>, or <i>Atair</i>, in the <i>Eagle</i>, and β in the ship Argo, which I have placed among those of the second magnitude, because astronomers are not agreed on the subject, some ranking them with stars of the <i>first</i> magnitude, others, with stars of the <i>second</i>.</p>
<p>The reader is probably amazed at the <i>paucity</i> of large stars in the whole firmament of heaven! Will he permit me to carry his mind a little farther, and either stand <i>astonished</i> at or <i>deplore</i> with me the fact, that, out of the <i>millions</i> of Christians in the vicinity and splendour of the <i>eternal Sun</i> of <i>righteousness</i>, how very few are found of the <i>first order</i>! How very few can stand examination by the <i>test</i> laid down in the 13th chapter of this epistle! How very few love God with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength; and their neighbour as themselves! How few <i>mature</i> Christians are found in the Church! How few are, in all things, living for eternity! How little <i>light</i>, how little <i>heat</i>, and how little <i>influence</i> and <i>activity</i> are to be found among them that bear the name of Christ! How few <i>stars</i> of the FIRST <i>magnitude</i> will the Son of God have to deck the crown of his glory! Few are striving to <i>excel</i> in righteousness; and it seems to be a principal concern with many to find out <i>how little grace they may have, and yet</i> <i>escape hell</i>; how little <i>conformity to the will of God</i> they may have, and yet get to heaven! In the fear of God I register this testimony, that I have perceived it to be the labour of many <i>to</i> <i>lower the standard of Christianity</i>, and to soften down, or explain away, those <i>promises</i> of God that himself has <i>linked with duties</i>; and because they know that they cannot be saved <i>by</i> their <i>good</i> <i>works</i>, they are contented to have <i>no good works at all</i>: and thus the necessity of Christian <i>obedience</i>, and Christian <i>holiness</i>, makes no prominent part of some modern creeds. Let all those who retain the <i>apostolic doctrine</i>, that <i>the blood of Christ cleanseth</i> <i>from all sin in this life</i>, press every believer to go on to <i>perfection</i>, and expect to be saved, <i>while here below</i>, into the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Jesus. To all such my soul says, Labour to show yourselves approved unto God; workmen that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth; and may the pleasure of the Lord prosper in your hands!-Amen.</p>
