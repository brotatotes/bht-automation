<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>. <i><b>And last of all - of me also</b></i> — It seems that it was essential to the character of a primitive <i>apostle</i> that he had <i>seen</i> and <i>conversed</i> with Christ; and it is evident, from the history of Saul's conversion, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:4-7">Acts 9:4-7</span>, where see the notes, that Jesus Christ did <i>appear</i> to him; and he pleaded this ever after as a <i>proof of his call to the apostleship</i>. And it does not appear that, after this time, Jesus ever did make any <i>personal discovery</i> of himself to any one.</p>
<p><i><b>As of one born out of due time.</b></i> — The apostle considers himself as coming <i>after</i> the time in which Jesus Christ personally conversed with his disciples; and that, therefore, to see him at all, he must see him in this <i>extraordinary</i> way. Some have entered into a very disgusting detail on the <i>figure</i> used here by the apostle. The words, ωσπερει τω εκτρωματι, signify not merely one <i>born out of due time</i>, but one born <i>before his time</i>; and consequently, not bidding fair for vigour, usefulness, or long life. But it is likely that the apostle had a different meaning; and that he refers to the original institution of the <i>twelve</i> apostles, in the <i>rank</i> of whom he never stood, being appointed not to <i>fill up a place</i> among the <i>twelve</i>, but as an <i>extra</i> and <i>additional</i> apostle. <i>Rosenmuller</i> says that those who were beyond the number of <i>twelve</i> senators were termed <i>abortivi</i>, abortives; and refers to <i>Suetonius</i> in <i>Octavio</i>, cap. 35. I have examined the place, but find no such epithet. According to <i>Suetonius</i>, in that place, they were called <i>orcini</i>-persons who had assumed the senatorial dignity <i>after the death</i> of Julius Caesar, pretending that they had derived that honour from <i>him</i>.</p>
