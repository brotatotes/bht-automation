<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span>. <i><b>I am the least of the apostles</b></i> — This was literally <i>true</i> in reference to his being chosen <i>last</i>, and chosen not in the <i>number</i> of the <i>twelve</i>, but as an <i>extra</i> apostle. How much pains do some men take to make the apostle <i>contradict</i> himself, by attempting to show that he was the very <i>greatest</i> of the apostles, though he calls himself the <i>least</i>! Taken as a <i>man</i> and a <i>minister</i> <i>of Christ</i>, he was greater than any of the <i>twelve</i>; taken as an <i>apostle</i> he was less than any of the <i>twelve</i>, because not originally in that body.</p>
<p><i><b>Am not meet to be called an apostle</b></i> — None of the <i>twelve</i> had ever <i>persecuted</i> Christ, nor withstood his doctrine: Saul of Tarsus had been, before his conversion, a <i>grievous persecutor</i>; and therefore he says, ουκειμιικανος, <i>I am not proper to be called</i> <i>an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God</i>, i.e. of Christ, which none of the <i>apostles</i> ever did.</p>
