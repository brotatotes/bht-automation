Verse 1 Corinthians 16:1. The collection for the saints — περι της λογιας, from λεγω, to gather, or collect translated by the Vulgate, de collectis, a contribution made by the rich for the relief of the poor. The Christians living at Jerusalem, we may naturally suppose, were greatly straitened; as the enmity of their countrymen to the Gospel of Christ led them to treat those who professed it with cruelty, and spoil them of their goods; (see Hebrews 10:34; and Romans 15:26; and Romans 15:27;) and the apostle hereby teaches that it was the duty of one Christian congregation to help another when in distress.
