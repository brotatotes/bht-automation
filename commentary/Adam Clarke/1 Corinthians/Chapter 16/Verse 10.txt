<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10">1 Corinthians 16:10</span>. <i><b>Now, if Timotheus come</b></i> — Of Timothy we have heard before, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:17">1 Corinthians 4:17</span>. And we learn, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>, that Paul sent him with <i>Erastus</i> from Ephesus to Macedonia. It is evident, therefore, in opposition to the very exceptionable <i>subscription</i> at the end of this epistle, that the epistle itself was <i>not</i> sent by Timothy, as there stated.</p>
<p><i><b>That he may be with you without fear</b></i> — That he may be treated well, and not perplexed and harassed with your divisions and jealousies; for <i>he worketh the work of the Lord</i>-he is Divinely appointed, as I also am.</p>
