Verse 1 Corinthians 16:11. Let no man - despise him — Let none pretend to say that he has not full authority from God to do the work of an evangelist.But conduct him forth in peace — I believe, with Bp. Pearce, that this clause should be translated and pointed thus: accompany him upon his journey, that he may come unto me in peace, (εν ειρηνη, in safety,) as the word is used in Mark 5:34; and Luke 7:50.For I look for him with the brethren. — Εκδεχομαι - αυτον μετα των αδελφων. This clause should not be understood as if Paul was expecting certain brethren with Timothy; but it was the brethren that were with Paul that were looking for him; I, with the brethren, am looking for him.
