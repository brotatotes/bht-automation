<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:11">1 Corinthians 16:11</span>. <i><b>Let no man - despise him</b></i> — Let none pretend to say that he has not full authority from God to do the work of an evangelist.</p>
<p><i><b>But conduct him forth in peace</b></i> — I believe, with Bp. Pearce, that this clause should be translated and pointed thus: <i>accompany</i> <i>him upon his journey, that he may come unto me in peace</i>, (εν ειρηνη, in safety,) as the word is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:34">Mark 5:34</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:50">Luke 7:50</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>For I look for him with the brethren.</b></i> — Εκδεχομαι - αυτον μετα των αδελφων. This clause should not be understood as if Paul was expecting <i>certain brethren with</i> Timothy; but it was the <i>brethren</i> that were <i>with Paul</i> that were looking for him; <i>I, with the</i> <i>brethren, am looking for him</i>.</p>
