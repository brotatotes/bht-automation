<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:13">1 Corinthians 16:13</span>. <i><b>Watch ye</b></i> — You have many enemies; be continually on your <i>guard</i>; be always <i>circumspect</i>:-</p>
<p>1. Watch against evil;</p>
<p>2. Watch for opportunities to <i>receive</i> good;</p>
<p>3. Watch for opportunities to <i>do</i> good;</p>
<p>4. Watch over each other in love;</p>
<p>5. Watch, that none may draw you aside from the belief and unity of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>Stand fast in the faith</b></i> — Hold in conscientious credence what you have already received as the truth of God; for it is the Gospel by which ye shall be saved, and by which ye are now put into a state of salvation: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:1">1 Corinthians 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:2">1 Corinthians 15:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Quit you like men</b></i> — Be not like <i>children tossed to and fro with</i> <i>every wind of doctrine</i>; let your <i>understanding</i> receive the truth; let your <i>judgment</i> determine on the absolute necessity of retaining it; and give up life rather than give up the testimony of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Be strong.</b></i> — Put forth all the <i>vigour</i> and <i>energy</i> which God has given you in maintaining and propagating the truth, and your spiritual strength will increase by usage. The terms in this verse are all <i>military: Watch ye</i>, γρηγορειτε, watch, and be continually on your guard, lest you be surprised by your enemies; keep your <i>scouts</i> out, and all your <i>sentinels</i> at their posts, lest your enemies <i>steal a march</i> upon you. See that the place you are in be properly defended; and that each be alert to perform his duty.</p>
<p><i><b>Stand fast in the faith</b></i> - Στηκετε εν τῃ πιστει·. Keep in your <i>ranks</i>; do not be <i>disorderly</i>; be determined to keep your ranks <i>unbroken</i>; keep <i>close together</i>. On your <i>unity</i> your preservation depends; if the enemy succeed in breaking your ranks, and dividing one part of this sacred army from another, your rout will be inevitable.</p>
<p><i><b>Quit yourselves like men</b></i> - Ανδριζεσθε· When you are attacked, do not <i>flinch</i>; maintain your <i>ground</i>; resist; press forward; strike home; keep compact; conquer.</p>
<p><i><b>Be strong</b></i> - Κραταιουαθε. If one company or division be opposed by too great a force of the enemy, strengthen that division, and maintain your position; if an attack is to be made on any part or intrenchment of the foe, summon up all your courage, sustain each other; fear not, for fear will enervate you. Your cause is good; it is <i>the faith</i>, the religion of Jesus; he is your <i>Captain</i> in the field; and, should you even die in the contest, the victory is yours.</p>
