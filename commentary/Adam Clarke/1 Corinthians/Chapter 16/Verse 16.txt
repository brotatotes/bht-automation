<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:16">1 Corinthians 16:16</span>. <i><b>That ye submit yourselves unto such</b></i> â€” That ye have <i>due regard</i> to them, and consider them as especial instruments in the hand of God for countenancing and carrying on his great work. The <i>submission</i> here recommended does not imply <i>obedience</i>, but <i>kind</i> and <i>courteous demeanour</i>. Kypke vindicates this sense of the word from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21">Ephesians 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:5">1 Peter 5:5</span>.</p>
