Verse 18. They have refreshed my spirit and yours — They have been a means of contributing greatly to my comfort; and what contributes to my comfort must increase yours. This is probably the meaning of the apostle.Therefore acknowledge ye them — Pay them particular respect, and let all be held in esteem in proportion to their work and usefulness. When this is made the rule of respect and esteem, then foolish and capricious attachments will have no place. A man will then be honoured in proportion to his merit; and his merit will be estimated by his usefulness among men.
