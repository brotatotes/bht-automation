<p>Verse 18. <i><b>They have refreshed my spirit and yours</b></i> — They have been a means of contributing greatly to my comfort; and what contributes to <i>my</i> comfort must increase <i>yours</i>. This is probably the meaning of the apostle.</p>
<p><i><b>Therefore acknowledge ye them</b></i> — Pay them particular respect, and let all be held in esteem in proportion to their work and usefulness. When this is made the <i>rule</i> of <i>respect</i> and <i>esteem</i>, then <i>foolish and capricious attachments</i> will have no place. A man will then be <i>honoured</i> in proportion to his <i>merit</i>; and his merit will be estimated by his <i>usefulness</i> among men.</p>
