<p>Verse 19. <i><b>The Churches of Asia salute you.</b></i> — i.e. The Churches in <i>Asia Minor</i>. Ephesus was in this Asia, and it is clear from this that the apostle was not at <i>Philippi</i>; had he been at Philippi, as the subscription states, he would have said, <i>The</i> <i>Churches of</i> MACEDONIA, <i>not the Churches of</i> ASIA, <i>salute you</i>. How these places lay, in reference to each other, the reader will at once perceive by consulting the <i>map</i> in Acts.</p>
<p><i><b>Aquila and Priscilla</b></i> — Of these eminent persons we have heard before: see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:26">Acts 18:26</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>With the Church that is in their house.</b></i> — That is, the <i>company</i> <i>of believers</i> who generally worshipped there. There were no <i>churches</i> or <i>chapels</i> at that time built; and the assemblies of Christians were necessarily held in private houses. It appears that <i>Aquila</i> and <i>Priscilla</i> devoted <i>their house</i> to this purpose. The house of <i>Philemon</i> was of the same kind; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span>. So was likewise the house of <i>Nymphas</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:15">Colossians 4:15</span>. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span></span>.</p>
