Verse 19. The Churches of Asia salute you. — i.e. The Churches in Asia Minor. Ephesus was in this Asia, and it is clear from this that the apostle was not at Philippi; had he been at Philippi, as the subscription states, he would have said, The Churches of MACEDONIA, not the Churches of ASIA, salute you. How these places lay, in reference to each other, the reader will at once perceive by consulting the map in Acts.Aquila and Priscilla — Of these eminent persons we have heard before: see Acts 18:2, Acts 18:18, Acts 18:26; and Romans 16:3.With the Church that is in their house. — That is, the company of believers who generally worshipped there. There were no churches or chapels at that time built; and the assemblies of Christians were necessarily held in private houses. It appears that Aquila and Priscilla devoted their house to this purpose. The house of Philemon was of the same kind; Philemon 1:2. So was likewise the house of Nymphas, Colossians 4:15. Romans 16:5; Romans 16:5.
