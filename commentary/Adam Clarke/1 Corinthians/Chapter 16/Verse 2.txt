<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span>. <i><b>Upon the first</b></i><b> day </b><i><b>of the week</b></i> — The apostle prescribes the most convenient and proper method of making this contribution.</p>
<p>1. Every man was to feel it his duty to succour his brethren in distress.</p>
<p>2. He was to do this according to the ability which God gave him.</p>
<p>3. He was to do this at the conclusion of the week, when he had cast up his weekly earnings, and had seen how much God had prospered his labour.</p>
<p>4. He was then to bring it on the <i>first day</i> of the week, as is most likely, to the church or assembly, that it might be put in the common treasury.</p>
<p>5. We learn from this that the weekly contribution could not be always the <i>same</i>, as each man was to lay by as <i>God had</i> <i>prospered him</i>: now, some weeks he would gain more; others, less.</p>
<p>6. It appears from the whole that the <i>first day</i> of <i>the week</i>, which is the Christian Sabbath, was the day on which their principal religious meetings were held in <i>Corinth</i> and the Churches of <i>Galatia</i>; and, consequently, in all other places where Christianity had prevailed. This is a strong argument for the keeping of the Christian Sabbath.</p>
<p>7. We may observe that the apostle follows here the <i>rule of the synagogue</i>; it was a regular custom among the Jews to make their collections for the poor on the <i>Sabbath day</i>, that they might not be without the necessaries of life, and might not be prevented from coming to the synagogue.</p>
<p>8. For the purpose of making this provision, they had a <i>purse</i>, which was called ארנקי של צדקה <i>Arneki shel tsedakah</i>, "The purse of the alms," or what we would term, <i>the poor's box</i>. This is what the apostle seems to mean when he says, <i>Let him lay by him in store</i>-let him put it in the <i>alms' purse</i>, or in the <i>poor's box</i>.</p>
<p>9. It was a maxim also with them that, if they <i>found</i> any money, they were not to put it in their <i>private</i> purse, but in that which belonged to the <i>poor</i>.</p>
<p>10. The pious Jews believed that as <i>salt</i> seasoned food, so did <i>alms</i>, riches; and that he who did not give alms of what he had, his riches should be dispersed. The <i>moth</i> would <i>corrupt</i> the <i>bags</i>, and the <i>canker corrode</i> the <i>money</i>, unless the mass was sanctified by giving a part to the poor.</p>
