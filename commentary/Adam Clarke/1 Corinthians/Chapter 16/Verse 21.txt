Verse 21. The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. — This should be rendered: "The salutation is written by the hand of me Paul;" γεγραπται, is written, being understood. It is very likely that the apostle wrote this and the following verses with his own hand. The rest, though dictated by him, was written by an amanuensis.
