<p>Verse 21. <i><b>The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.</b></i> — This should be rendered: "The salutation is written by the hand of me Paul;" γεγραπται, <i>is written</i>, being understood. It is very likely that the apostle wrote this and the following verses with his own hand. The rest, though <i>dictated</i> by him, was <i>written</i> by an amanuensis.</p>
