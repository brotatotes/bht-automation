<p>Verse 22. <i><b>If any man love not the Lord Jesus</b></i> — This is directed immediately against the <i>Jews</i>. From <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>, we find that the Jews, who pretended to be under the <i>Spirit</i> and <i>teaching</i> <i>of God</i>, called Jesus αναθεμα, or <i>accursed</i>; i.e. a person who should be devoted to destruction: see the note there. In this place the apostle <i>retorts</i> the whole upon <i>themselves</i>, and says: <i>If</i> <i>any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ</i>, let HIM be αναθεμα, <i>accursed</i>, and <i>devoted to destruction</i>. This is not said in the way of a <i>wish</i> or <i>imprecation</i>, but as a <i>prediction</i> of what would certainly come upon them if they did not repent, and of what <i>did</i> <i>come</i> on them because they did not repent; but continued to <i>hate</i> and <i>execrate</i> the Lord Jesus; and of what <i>still lies upon them</i>, because they continue to <i>hate</i> and <i>execrate</i> the Redeemer of the world.</p>
<p>It is generally allowed that the apostle refers here to some of the modes of <i>excommunication</i> among the Jews, of which there were <i>three</i>, viz.:-</p>
<p>1. <i>Niddui</i> נדוי, which signifies a simple <i>separation</i> or exclusion of a man from the synagogue, and from his wife and family, for THIRTY days.</p>
<p>2. <i>Cherem</i> חרם which was inflicted on him who had borne the <i>niddui</i>, and who had not, in the thirty days, made proper compensation, in order to be reconciled to the synagogue. This was inflicted with dire execrations, which he was informed must all come upon him if he did not <i>repent</i>; but the <i>cherem</i> always supposed <i>place for repentance</i>.</p>
<p>3. <i>Shammatha</i> שמתא: this was the <i>direst</i> of all, and cut off all <i>hope</i> of reconciliation and repentance; after which the man was neither reconcilable to the <i>synagogue</i>, nor acknowledged as belonging even to the <i>Jewish nation</i>. See these different forms in <i>Buxtorf's</i> Rabbinical and Talmudical <i>Lexicon</i>, under their respective words.</p>
<p>In the Lexicon just now quoted, Buxtorf gives a form of the <i>cherem</i>, which he says he copied from an ancient Hebrew MS. Of this awful piece I shall lay a translation before the reader.</p>
<p>"By the sentence of the Lord of lords, let P. the son of P. be anathematized in both houses of judgment; the superior and inferior. Let him be anathematized among the highest saints; let him be anathematized among the <i>seraphim</i> and <i>ophanim</i>; and finally, let him be anathematized by all the congregations of the great and the small! Let great and continued plagues rest upon him; with great and horrible diseases! Let his house be the habitation of dragons! and let his constellation be darkened in the clouds! Let him be for indignation, and wrath, and burning! Let his carcass be thrown to the wild beasts and serpents! Let his enemies and his adversaries triumph over him! Let his silver and gold be given to others! And let all his children be exposed at the doors of their enemies! And let posterity be astonished at his day! Let him be accursed by the mouth of <i>Addiriron</i> and <i>Achtariel</i>; by the mouth of <i>Sandalphon</i> and <i>Hadraniel</i>; by the mouth of <i>Ansisiel</i> and <i>Patchiel</i>; by the mouth of <i>Seraphiel</i> and <i>Sagansael</i>; by the mouth of <i>Michael</i> and <i>Gabriel</i>; by the mouth of <i>Raphael</i> and <i>Mesharetiel</i>! Let him be anathematized by the mouth of <i>Zaafzavif</i>, and by the mouth of <i>Hafhavif</i>, who is the great God; and by the mouth of the <i>seventy names</i> of the supreme King; and lastly, by the mouth of <i>Tsortak</i> the great chancellor.</p>
<p>"Let him he swallowed up like Korah and his companions! Let his soul depart with fear and terror! Let the chiding of the Lord slay him! Let him be confounded as Achitophel was in his counsel! Let the leprosy of Gehazi be his leprosy! and let there be no resurrection of his ruins! In the sepulchres of the children of Israel let him not be buried! Let his wife be given to another, and let others bow themselves upon her in his death! In this anathema, let P. the son of P. be; and let this be his inheritance! But upon me and upon all Israel may God extend his peace and blessing, Amen." To this is added the 18th, 19th, and 20th verses of <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+29:0">Deuteronomy 29:0</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+29:18-20">Deuteronomy 29:18-20</span> which the reader may read at his leisure. There are many things in this <i>cherem</i> which require a <i>comment</i>, but this is not the place.</p>
<p><i><b>Anathema, maran-atha.</b></i> — "Let him be accursed; our Lord cometh." I cannot see the reason why these words were left <i>untranslated</i>. The former is Greek, and has been already explained; the latter is Syriac [Syriac] maran-atha, <i>our Lord is coming</i>: i.e. to execute the judgment denounced. Does not the apostle refer to the last verse in the Bible? <i>Lest I come and smite the land</i> ( <i>cherem</i>) <i>with a curse</i>? And does he not intimate that the Lord was coming to smite the <i>Jewish land</i> with that curse? Which took place a very few years after, and continues on that gainsaying and rebellious people to the present day. What the apostle has said was <i>prophetic</i>, and <i>indicative</i> of what was about to happen to that people. God was then <i>coming</i> to inflict punishment upon them: he came, and they were broken and dispersed.</p>
