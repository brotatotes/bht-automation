<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span>. <i><b>Whomsoever ye shall approve by</b></i> your <i>letters</i>] Why should Paul require <i>letters</i> of approbation in behalf of certain persons, when he himself should be <i>among them</i>, and could have their characters <i>viva voce</i>? It is probable that he refers here to letters of recommendation which they <i>had</i> sent to him while he was away; and he now promises that when he should come to Corinth, he would appoint these persons, whom they had <i>recommended</i>, to carry the alms to Jerusalem. If δοκιμασητε, be read <i>ye shall have</i> <i>approved</i>, as Bishop Pearce does, the difficulty will vanish.</p>
<p>Some MSS. and several <i>versions</i> join διεπιστολων, <i>by letters</i>, to the following words, and read the verse thus: <i>When I come,</i> <i>those whom ye shall approve I will send with letters to bring your</i> <i>liberality to Jerusalem</i>. This seems most natural.</p>
