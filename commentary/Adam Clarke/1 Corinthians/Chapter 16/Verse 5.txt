<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>. <i><b>I will come unto you, when I shall pass through</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Macedonia</b></i> â€” St. Paul was now at <i>Ephesus</i>; for almost all allow, in opposition to the <i>subscription</i> at the end of this epistle that states it to have been written from <i>Philippi</i>, that it was written from <i>Ephesus</i>: and this is supported by many strong arguments; and the 8th verse here seems to put it past all question: <i>I will tarry</i> <i>at Ephesus</i>; i.e. I am in Ephesus, and here I purpose to remain until <i>pentecost</i>. Though Macedonia was not in the direct way from Ephesus to Corinth, yet the apostle intended to make it in his way. And it was because it was not in the direct road, but lay at the upper end of the AEgean Sea, and very far out of his direct line, that he says, <i>I do pass through Macedonia</i>-I have purposed to go thither before I go to Corinth.</p>
