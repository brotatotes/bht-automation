Verse 1 Corinthians 16:5. I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia â€” St. Paul was now at Ephesus; for almost all allow, in opposition to the subscription at the end of this epistle that states it to have been written from Philippi, that it was written from Ephesus: and this is supported by many strong arguments; and the 8th verse here seems to put it past all question: I will tarry at Ephesus; i.e. I am in Ephesus, and here I purpose to remain until pentecost. Though Macedonia was not in the direct way from Ephesus to Corinth, yet the apostle intended to make it in his way. And it was because it was not in the direct road, but lay at the upper end of the AEgean Sea, and very far out of his direct line, that he says, I do pass through Macedonia-I have purposed to go thither before I go to Corinth.
