Verse 1 Corinthians 16:6. Yea, and winter with you — He purposed to stay till pentecost at Ephesus; after that to go to Macedonia, and probably to spend the summer there; and come in the autumn to Corinth, and there spend the winter.That ye may bring me on my journey — That ye may furnish me with the means of travelling. It appears that, in most cases, the different Churches paid his expenses to other Churches; where this was not done, then he laboured at his business to acquire the means of travelling.
