<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>. <i><b>A great door and effectual is opened</b></i> — Θυοα γαρ μοι ανεωγε μεγαλη και ενεργης· <i>A great and energetic door is opened</i> <i>to me</i>; that is, God has made a grand opening to me in those parts, which I perceive will require <i>much labour</i>; and besides, I shall have <i>many adversaries</i> to oppose me. So Bp. Pearce understands the words ενεργης, not as signifying <i>effectual</i>, but as implying <i>full</i> <i>of labour</i>. <i>Door</i> often signifies <i>occasion</i> or <i>opportunity</i>; but here, the apostle may allude to the throwing open of the great doors of the <i>Circus Maximus</i> before the chariot races began; and the <i>many adversaries</i> may refer to the numerous <i>competitors</i> in those races.</p>
<p>God gave him a grand <i>opportunity</i> to preach the Gospel; but he was not to expect that either Satan or wicked men would leave him unmolested.</p>
