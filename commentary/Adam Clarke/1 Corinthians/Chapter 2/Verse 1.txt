<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>. <i><b>When I came to you</b></i> â€” Acting suitably to my mission, which was to preach the Gospel, but not with human eloquence, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span>. I declared to you the <i>testimony</i>, the Gospel, of <i>God,</i> <i>not with</i> <i>excellency of speech</i>, not with arts of rhetoric, used by your own philosophers, where the excellence of the speech recommends the matter, and compensates for the want of solidity and truth: on the contrary, the testimony concerning Christ and his salvation is so supremely excellent, as to dignify any kind of language by which it may be conveyed. See the Introduction, sect. ii.</p>
