<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>. <i><b>But God hath revealed them unto us</b></i> — A manifest proof that the apostle speaks here of the glories of the <i>Gospel</i>, and not of the glories of the <i>future</i> world.</p>
<p><i><b>For the Spirit searcheth all things</b></i> — This is the Spirit of God, which spoke by the prophets, and has now given to the apostles the <i>fulness</i> of that heavenly truth, of which He gave to the former only the <i>outlines</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Yea, the deep things of God.</b></i> — It is only the Spirit of God which can reveal the counsels of God: these are the purposes which have existed in His infinite wisdom and goodness from eternity; and particularly what refers to creation, providence, redemption, and eternal glory, as far as men and angels are concerned in these purposes. The apostles were so fully convinced that the scheme of redemption proclaimed by the Gospel was Divine, that they boldly asserted that these things infinitely surpassed the wisdom and comprehension of man. God was now in a certain way become <i>manifest</i>; many attributes of his, which to the heathen world would have for ever lain in obscurity, (for the world by wisdom knew not God,) were now not only brought to light as existing in him, but illustrated by the gracious displays which He had made of himself. It was the Spirit of God alone that could reveal these things; and it was the energy of that Spirit alone that could bring them all into effect-stamp and seal them as attributes and works of God for ever. The apostles were as truly conscious of their <i>own</i> <i>inspiration</i> as they were that they had consciousness at all; and what they spoke, they spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>
