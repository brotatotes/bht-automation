<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:11">1 Corinthians 2:11</span>. <i><b>For what man knoweth the things of a man</b></i> — The word ανθρωπων in the first clause is omitted by the <i>Codex</i> <i>Alexandrinus</i>, and one other; and by <i>Athanasius, Cyril</i>, and <i>Vigil</i> of Tapsus. Bishop <i>Pearce</i> contends strongly against the authenticity of the word, and reads the passage thus: "For what is there that knoweth the things of a man, except the spirit of a man that is in him?" "I leave out," says the learned bishop, "ανθρωπων, with the Alexandrian MS., and read τις γαρ οιδεν τα του ανθρωπου; because I conceive that the common reading is wide of St. Paul's meaning; for to say, <i>What man except the spirit of a</i> <i>man</i>, is (I think) to speak improperly, and to suppose that the spirit of a man is a man; but it is very proper to say, <i>What</i> <i>except the spirit of a man</i>: τις is feminine as well as masculine, and therefore may be supplied with ουσια, or some such word, as well as with ανθρωπος." Though the authority for omitting this word is comparatively slender, yet it must be owned that its omission renders the text much more intelligible. But even <i>one</i> MS. may preserve the true reading.</p>
<p>The spirit of a man knows the things of a man: that is, a man is conscious of all the schemes, plans, and purposes, that pass in his own mind; and no man can know these things but himself. So, the Spirit of God, He whom we call the <i>Third Person</i> of the glorious TRINITY, knows all the counsels and determinations of the Supreme Being. As the Spirit is here represented to live in God as the soul lives in the body of a man, and as this Spirit knows all the things of God, and had revealed those to the apostles which concern the salvation of the world, therefore what they spoke and preached was true, and men may implicitly depend upon it. The miracles which they did, in the name of Christ, were the proof that they had that Spirit, and spoke the truth of God.</p>
