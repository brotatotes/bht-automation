<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:12">1 Corinthians 2:12</span>. <i><b>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world</b></i> — We, who are the genuine apostles of Christ, have received this Spirit of God, by which we know the deep things of God; and, through the teaching of that Spirit, we preach Christ crucified. We have not therefore <i>received the spirit of the world</i>-of the <i>Jewish</i> teachers, who are all looking for a <i>worldly kingdom</i> and a <i>worldly Messiah</i>, and interpret all the scriptures of the Old Testament which relate to Him in a <i>carnal</i> and <i>worldly</i> sense.</p>
<p><i><b>That we might know the things</b></i> — We receive this teaching that we may know what those supereminently excellent things are which God has purposed <i>freely</i> to <i>give</i> to mankind. It is evident that, as the apostle means by <i>princes of the world</i> the rulers of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6-8">1 Corinthians 2:6-8</span>, so by <i>spirit of the world</i> he here means Jewish wisdom, or their carnal mode of interpreting the sacred oracles, and their carnal expectation of a worldly kingdom under the Messiah.</p>
