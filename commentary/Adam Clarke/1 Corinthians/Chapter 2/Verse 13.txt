<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:13">1 Corinthians 2:13</span>. <i><b>Which things also we speak</b></i> — We dare no more use the <i>language</i> of the Jews and the Gentiles in speaking of those glorious things, than we can indulge their <i>spirit</i>. The Greek orators affected a high and florid language, full of tropes and figures, which dazzled more than it enlightened. The rabbins affected <i>obscurity</i>, and were studious to find out <i>cabalistical</i> meanings, which had no tendency to make the people wise unto salvation. The apostles could not follow any of these; they spoke the <i>things</i> of God in the <i>words</i> of God; every thing was plain and intelligible; every word well placed, clear, and nervous. He who has a spiritual mind will easily comprehend an apostle's preaching.</p>
<p><i><b>Comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</b></i> — This is commonly understood to mean, comparing the spiritual things under the Old Testament with the spiritual things under the New: but this does not appear to be the apostle's meaning. The word συγκρινοντες, which we translate <i>comparing</i>, rather signifies <i>conferring,</i> <i>discussing</i>, or <i>explaining</i>; and the word πνευματικοις should be rendered <i>to spiritual men</i>, and not be referred to <i>spiritual</i> <i>things</i>. The passage therefore should be thus translated: <i>Explaining spiritual things to spiritual persons</i>. And this sense the following verse absolutely requires.</p>
