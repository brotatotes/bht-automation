<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>. <i><b>But the natural man</b></i> — ψυχικος, The <i>animal</i> man-the man who is in a mere state of nature, and lives under the influence of his animal passions; for the word ψυχη, which we often translate <i>soul</i>, means the lower and sensitive part of man, in opposition to νους, the <i>understanding</i> or <i>rational</i> part. The Latins use <i>anima</i> to signify these lower passions; and <i>animus</i> to signify the higher. The person in question is not only one who either has had no spiritual teaching, or has not profited by it; but one who lives for the present world, having no respect to spiritual or eternal things. This ψυχικος, or <i>animal man</i>, is opposed to the πνευματικος, or <i>spiritual man</i>: and, as this latter is one who is under the influence of the Spirit of God, so the former is one who is without that influence.</p>
<p>The apostle did speak of those high and sublime spiritual things to these <i>animal men</i>; but he <i>explained</i> them to those which were spiritual. He uses this word in this sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:1">1 Corinthians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:11">1 Corinthians 9:11</span>; and particularly in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:15">1 Corinthians 2:15</span> of the present chapter: <i>He that is</i> <i>spiritual judgeth all things</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:15">1 Corinthians 2:15</span></p>
<p>But the natural man-The apostle appears to give this-as a reason why he explained those deep spiritual things to spiritual men; because the <i>animal man</i>-the man who is in a state of nature, without the regenerating grace of the Spirit of God, <i>receiveth not</i> <i>the things of the Spirit</i>-neither apprehends nor comprehends them: he has no relish for them; he considers it the highest <i>wisdom</i> to live for <i>this world</i>. Therefore these spiritual things <i>are</i> <i>foolishness to him</i>; for while he is in his <i>animal</i> state he cannot see their excellency, <i>because they are spiritually discerned</i>, and he has no spiritual mind.</p>
