<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:15">1 Corinthians 2:15</span>. <i><b>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things</b></i> — He who has the mind of Christ discerns and judges of all things spiritual: yet he himself is not discerned by the mere animal man. Some suppose that the word ανακρινεται should be understood thus: He <i>examines, scrutinizes, convinces, reproves</i>, which it appears to mean in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span>; and they read the verse thus: <i>The spiritual man</i>-the well-taught Christian, convinces, i.e. can easily convict, all men, (παντα, accusing,) every animal man, of error and vice; yet he himself is convicted of no man; his mind is enlightened, and his life is holy; and therefore the animal man cannot convict him of sin. This is a good sense, but the first appears the most natural. See Pearce and Rosenmuller.</p>
