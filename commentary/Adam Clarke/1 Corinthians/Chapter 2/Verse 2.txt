<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:2">1 Corinthians 2:2</span>. <i><b>I determined not to know any thing among you</b></i> â€” Satisfied that the Gospel of God could alone make you wise unto salvation, I determined to cultivate no other knowledge, and to teach nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified, as the foundation of all true wisdom, piety, and happiness. No other doctrine shall I <i>proclaim</i> among you.</p>
