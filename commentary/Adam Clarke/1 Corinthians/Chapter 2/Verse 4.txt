<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span>. <i><b>And my speech</b></i> — ο λογος μου, My <i>doctrine</i>; the <i>matter</i> of my preaching.</p>
<p><i><b>And my preaching</b></i> — το κηρυγμα μου, My proclamation, my <i>manner</i> of recommending the grand but simple truths of the Gospel.</p>
<p><b>Was </b><i><b>not with enticing words of man's wisdom</b></i> — ενπειθοις ανθρωπινης σοφιας λογοις, <i>With persuasive doctrines of human</i> <i>wisdom</i>: in every case I left <i>man</i> out, that <i>God</i> might become the more evident. I used none of the means of which great orators avail themselves in order to become <i>popular</i>, and thereby to gain <i>fame</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But in demonstration of the Spirit</b></i> — αποδειξει, In the <i>manifestation</i>; or, as two ancient MSS. have it, αποκαλυψει, in the <i>revelation</i> of the Spirit. The doctrine that he preached was <i>revealed</i> by the Spirit: that it was a <i>revelation</i> of the Spirit, the holiness, purity, and usefulness of the doctrine rendered <i>manifest</i>: and the overthrow of idolatry, and the conversion of souls, by the <i>power</i> and energy of the preaching, were the <i>demonstration</i> that all was Divine. The greater part of the best MSS., <i>versions</i>, and <i>fathers</i>, leave out the adjective ανθρωπινης, <i>man's</i>, before σοφιας, <i>wisdom</i>: it is possible that the word may be a <i>gloss</i>, but it is necessarily implied in the clause. <i>Not with</i> <i>the persuasive discourses</i>, or <i>doctrines of wisdom</i>; i.e. of <i>human</i> philosophy.</p>
