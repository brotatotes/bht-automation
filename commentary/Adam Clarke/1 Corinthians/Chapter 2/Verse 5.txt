<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:5">1 Corinthians 2:5</span>. <i><b>That your faith should not stand</b></i> â€” That the illumination of your souls and your conversion to God might appear to have nothing <i>human</i> in it: your belief, therefore, of the truths which have been proposed to you is founded, not in <i>human wisdom</i>, but in <i>Divine power</i>: human <i>wisdom</i> was not employed; and human <i>power</i>, if it had been employed, could not have produced the change.</p>
