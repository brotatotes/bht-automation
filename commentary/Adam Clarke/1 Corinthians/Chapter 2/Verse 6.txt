<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>. <i><b>We speak wisdom among them that are perfect</b></i> — By the εν τοις τελειοις, <i>among those that are perfect</i>, we are to understand <i>Christians</i> of the highest knowledge and attainments- those who were <i>fully instructed</i> in the knowledge of God through Christ Jesus. Nothing, in the judgment of St. Paul, deserved the name of <i>wisdom</i> but this. And though he apologizes for his not coming to them with excellency of speech or wisdom, yet he means what was reputed wisdom among the Greeks, and which, in the sight of God, was mere <i>folly</i> when compared with that wisdom that came from above. Dr. Lightfoot thinks that the apostle mentions a <i>fourfold</i> wisdom.</p>
<p>1. <i>Heathen wisdom</i>, or that of the Gentile philosophers, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:22">1 Corinthians 1:22</span>, which was termed by the Jews חכמה יונית <i>chokmah yevanith</i>, Grecian wisdom; and which was so undervalued by them, that they joined these two under the same curse: <i>Cursed is</i> <i>he that breeds hogs; and cursed is he who teaches his son Grecian</i> <i>wisdom</i>. Bava Kama, fol. 82.</p>
<p>2. <i>Jewish wisdom</i>; that of the scribes and Pharisees, who crucified our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>.</p>
<p>3. The <i>Gospel</i>, which is called <i>the wisdom of God in a mystery</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>.</p>
<p>4. The <i>wisdom</i>, του αιωνος τουτου, <i>of this world</i>; that system of knowledge which the Jews made up out of the writings of their scribes and doctors. This state is called העולם הזה <i>haolam</i> <i>hazzeh</i>, this or the present world; to distinguish it from העולם הבא <i>haolam habba</i> the world to come; i.e. the days of the Messiah. Whether we understand the term, <i>this world</i>, as relating to the state of the Gentiles, cultivated to the uttermost in philosophical learning, or the then state of the Jews, who had made the word of God of no effect by their traditions, which contained a sort of learning of which they were very fond and very proud, yet, by this Grecian and Jewish wisdom, no soul ever could have arrived at any such knowledge or wisdom as that communicated by the revelation of Christ. This was <i>perfect wisdom</i>; and they who were thoroughly instructed in it, and had received the grace of the Gospel, were termed τελειοι, <i>the perfect</i>. This, says the apostle, is not <i>the wisdom of this world</i>, for that has not the <i>manifested</i> Messiah in it; nor the <i>wisdom of the rulers of this</i> <i>world</i>-the <i>chief</i> men, whether <i>philosophers</i> among the <i>Greeks</i>, or <i>rabbins</i> among the <i>Jews</i> (for those we are to understand as implied in the term <i>rulers</i>, used here by the apostle) these rulers <i>came to nought</i>; for they, their wisdom, and their government, were shortly afterwards overturned in the destruction of Jerusalem. This declaration of the apostle is <i>prophetic</i>. The ruin of the Grecian superstition soon followed.</p>
