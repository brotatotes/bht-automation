<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>. <i><b>The wisdom of God in a mystery</b></i> â€” The GOSPEL of Jesus Christ, which had been comparatively <i>hidden</i> from the <i>foundation of</i> <i>the world</i>, (the settling of the Jewish economy, as this phrase often means,) though appointed from the beginning to be <i>revealed</i> in the fulness of time. For, though this Gospel was, in a certain sense, announced by the prophets, and prefigured by the law, yet it is certain that even the most intelligent of the Jewish <i>rulers</i>, their <i>doctors, scribes</i>, and <i>Pharisees</i>, had no adequate knowledge of it; therefore it was still a mystery to them and others, till it was so gloriously revealed by the preaching of the apostles.</p>
