<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>. <i><b>Which none of the princes of this world knew</b></i> — Here it is evident that <i>this world</i> refers to the Jewish state, and to the degree of knowledge in that state: and the <i>rulers</i>, the <i>priests, rabbins</i>, c., who were principally concerned in the crucifixion of our Lord.</p>
<p><i><b>The Lord of glory.</b></i> — Or the <i>glorious Lord</i>, infinitely transcending all the <i>rulers</i> of the universe whose is <i>eternal</i> <i>glory</i>; who gave that <i>glorious</i> Gospel in which his followers may glory, as it affords them such cause of triumph as the heathens had not, who gloried in their <i>philosophers</i>. Here is a teacher who is come from God; who has taught the most <i>glorious</i> truths which it is possible for the soul of man to conceive; and has promised to lead all the followers of his crucified Master to that state of <i>glory</i> which is ineffable and eternal.</p>
