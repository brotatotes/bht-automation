Verse 1 Corinthians 2:8. Which none of the princes of this world knew — Here it is evident that this world refers to the Jewish state, and to the degree of knowledge in that state: and the rulers, the priests, rabbins, c., who were principally concerned in the crucifixion of our Lord.The Lord of glory. — Or the glorious Lord, infinitely transcending all the rulers of the universe whose is eternal glory; who gave that glorious Gospel in which his followers may glory, as it affords them such cause of triumph as the heathens had not, who gloried in their philosophers. Here is a teacher who is come from God; who has taught the most glorious truths which it is possible for the soul of man to conceive; and has promised to lead all the followers of his crucified Master to that state of glory which is ineffable and eternal.
