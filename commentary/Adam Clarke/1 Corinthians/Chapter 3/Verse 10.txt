<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span>. <i><b>As a wise master builder</b></i> — Ὡς σοφος αρχιτεκτων. The <i>design</i> or <i>plan</i> of the building is from God; all things must be done according to the <i>pattern</i> which he has exhibited; but the <i>execution</i> of this plan was entrusted chiefly to St. Paul; he was the <i>wise</i> or <i>experienced architect</i> which God used in order to lay the foundation; to ascertain the essential and immutable doctrines of the Gospel-those alone which came from God, and which alone he would bless to the salvation of mankind.</p>
<p><i><b>Let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</b></i> — Let him take care that the doctrines which he preaches be answerable to those which I have preached; let him also take heed that he enjoin no other practice than that which is suitable to the doctrine, and in every sense accords with it.</p>
