<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>. <i><b>Other foundation can no man lay</b></i> â€” I do not speak particularly concerning the <i>foundation</i> of this spiritual building; it can have no other foundation than Jesus Christ: there cannot be two opinions on this subject among the true apostles of our Lord. The only fear is, lest an improper use should be made of this heavenly doctrine; lest a bad superstructure should be raised on this foundation.</p>
