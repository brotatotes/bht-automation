<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:12">1 Corinthians 3:12</span>. <i><b>If any men build - gold, silver</b></i>, c.] Without entering into curious criticisms relative to these different expressions, it may be quite enough for the purpose of edification to say, that, by <i>gold, silver</i>, and <i>precious stones</i>, the apostle certainly means pure and wholesome doctrines: by <i>wood, hay</i>, and <i>stubble</i>, false doctrines such as at that time prevailed in the Corinthian Church; for instance, that there should be no resurrection of the body; that a man may, on his father's death, lawfully marry his step-mother; that it was necessary to incorporate much of the Mosaic law with the Gospel; and, perhaps, other matters, equally exceptionable, relative to marriage, concubinage, fornication, frequenting heathen festivals, and partaking of the flesh which had been offered in sacrifice to an idol; with many other things, which, with the above, are more or less hinted at by the apostle in these two letters.</p>
