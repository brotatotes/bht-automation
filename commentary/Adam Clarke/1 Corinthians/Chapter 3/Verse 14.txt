<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:14">1 Corinthians 3:14</span>. <i><b>If any man's work abide</b></i> — Perhaps there is here an allusion to the purifying of different sorts of vessels under the law. All that could stand the fire were to be purified by the fire; and those which could not resist the action of the <i>fire</i> were to be purified by <i>water</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:23">Numbers 31:23</span>. The <i>gold, silver</i>, and <i>precious stones</i>, could stand the fire; but the <i>wood, hay</i>, and <i>stubble</i>, must be necessarily consumed. So, in that great and terrible day of the Lord, all <i>false doctrine</i>, as well as the <i>system</i> that was to <i>pass away</i>, should be made sufficiently manifest; and God would then show that the <i>Gospel</i>, and that alone, was that system of doctrine which he should bless and protect, and none other.</p>
<p><i><b>He shall receive a reward.</b></i> — He has not only preached the <i>truth</i>, but he has <i>laboured</i> in the word and doctrine. And the <i>reward</i> is to be <i>according</i> to the <i>labour</i>. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:8">1 Corinthians 3:8</span>.</p>
