<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15">1 Corinthians 3:15</span>. <i><b>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer</b></i><b> </b><i><b>loss</b></i> — If he have preached the necessity of incorporating the <i>law</i> with the <i>Gospel</i>, or proclaimed as a doctrine of God any thing which did not proceed from heaven, <i>he shall suffer loss</i>-all his time and labour will be found to be uselessly employed and spent. Some refer the <i>loss</i> to the <i>work</i>, not to the <i>man</i>; and understand the passage thus: <i>If any man's work be burned</i>, IT <i>shall suffer</i> <i>loss</i>-much shall be taken away from it; nothing shall he left but the measure of truth and uprightness which it may have contained.</p>
<p><i><b>But he himself shall be saved</b></i> — If he have sincerely and conscientiously believed what he preached, and yet preached what was wrong, not through <i>malice</i> or <i>opposition</i> to the Gospel, but through mere <i>ignorance</i>, he <i>shall be saved</i>; God in his mercy will pass by his errors; and he shall not suffer punishment because he was <i>mistaken</i>. Yet, as in most erroneous teachings there is generally a portion of <i>wilful</i> and <i>obstinate</i> ignorance, the salvation of such erroneous teachers is very <i>rare</i>; and is expressed here, <i>yet so as by fire</i>, i.e. with great difficulty; a <i>mere escape</i>; a <i>hair's breadth deliverance</i>; he shall be like <i>a</i> <i>brand plucked out of the fire</i>.</p>
<p>The apostle obviously refers to the case of a man, who, having builded a house, and begun to dwell in it, the house happens to be set on fire, and he has warning of it just in time to escape with his life, losing at the same time his house, his goods, his labour, and <i>almost</i> his own life. So he who, while he holds the doctrine of Christ crucified as the only foundation on which a soul can rest its hopes of salvation, builds at the same time, on that foundation, <i>Antinomianism</i>, or any other erroneous or destructive doctrine, he shall lose all his labour, and his own soul scarcely escape everlasting perdition; nor even this unless sheer ignorance and inveterate prejudice, connected with much sincerity, be found in his case.</p>
<p>The popish writers have applied what is here spoken to the <i>fire</i> of <i>purgatory</i>; and they might with equal propriety have applied it to the discovery of the <i>longitude</i>, the <i>perpetual motion</i>, or the <i>philosopher's stone</i>; because it speaks just as much of the former as it does of any of the latter. The <i>fire</i> mentioned here is to try the man's <i>work</i>, not to purify his <i>soul</i>; but the dream of <i>purgatory</i> refers to the <i>purging</i> in another state what left this <i>impure</i>; not the <i>work</i> of the man, but the <i>man himself</i>; but here the <i>fire</i> is said to <i>try the work</i>: ergo, purgatory is not meant even if such a place as purgatory could be proved to exist; which remains yet to be demonstrated.</p>
