<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>. <i><b>Ye are the temple of God</b></i> â€” The apostle resumes here what he had asserted in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>: <i>Ye are God's building</i>. As the whole congregation of Israel were formerly considered as the <i>temple</i> and <i>habitation</i> of <i>God</i>, because God <i>dwelt among them</i>, so here the whole Church of Corinth is called the <i>temple of God</i>, because all genuine believers have the <i>Spirit</i> of God to dwell in them; and Christ has promised to be always in the midst even of two or three who are gathered together in his name. Therefore where God is, <i>there</i> is his temple.</p>
