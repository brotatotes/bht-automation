<p>Verse 17. <i><b>If any man defile the temple</b></i> — This clause is not consistently translated. Ει τις τον ναον του Θεου φθειρει, φθερει τουτον ὁ Θεος. <i>If any man destroy the temple of God, him will God</i> <i>destroy</i>. The verb is the same in both clauses. If any man injure, corrupt, or destroy the Church of God by false doctrine, God will destroy him-will take away his part out of the book of life. This refers to him who wilfully opposes the truth; the erring, mistaken man shall barely <i>escape</i>; but the obstinate opposer shall be destroyed. The former shall be treated <i>leniently</i>; the latter shall have judgment without <i>mercy</i>.</p>
