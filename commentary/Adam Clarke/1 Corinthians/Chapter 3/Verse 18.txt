<p>Verse 18. <i><b>If any man among you seemeth to be wise</b></i> — Ει τις δοκει σοφος ειναι· <i>If any pretend or affect to be wise</i>. This seems to refer to some <i>individual</i> in the Church of Corinth, who had been very troublesome to its peace and unity: probably <i>Diotrephes</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span> (note)) or some one of a similar spirit, who wished to have the <i>pre-eminence</i>, and thought himself wiser than seven men that could render a reason. Every Christian Church has less or more of these.</p>
<p><i><b>Let him become a fool</b></i> — Let him divest himself of his worldly wisdom, and be contented to be <i>called</i> a <i>fool</i>, and <i>esteemed</i> one, that he may become wise unto salvation, by renouncing his own wisdom, and seeking that which comes from God. But probably the apostle refers to him who, <i>pretending</i> to great wisdom and information, taught doctrines contrary to the Gospel; endeavouring to show reasons for them, and to support his own opinions with arguments which he thought unanswerable. This man brought his worldly wisdom to bear against the doctrines of Christ; and probably through such teaching many of the scandalous things which the apostle reprehends among the Corinthians originated.</p>
