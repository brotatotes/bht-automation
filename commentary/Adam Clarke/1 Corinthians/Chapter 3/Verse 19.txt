<p>Verse 19. <i><b>The wisdom of this world</b></i> — Whether it be the pretended deep and occult wisdom of the rabbins, or the wire-drawn speculations of the Grecian philosophers, <i>is foolishness with God</i>; for as folly consists in spending time, strength, and pains to no purpose, so these may be fitly termed <i>fools</i> who acquire no saving knowledge by their speculations. And is not this the case with the major part of all that is called <i>philosophy</i>, even in the present day? Has one soul been made wise unto salvation through it? Are our most eminent philosophers either pious or useful men? Who of them is meek, gentle, and humble! Who of them directs his researches so as to meliorate the moral condition of his fellow creatures? Pride, insolence, self-conceit, and complacency, with a general forgetfulness of God, contempt for his word, and despite for the poor, are their general characteristics.</p>
<p><i><b>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</b></i> — This is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+5:13">Job 5:13</span>, and powerfully shows what the wisdom of this world is: it is a sort of <i>craft</i>, a <i>subtle trade</i>, which they carry on to wrong others and benefit themselves; and they have generally too much <i>cunning</i> to be caught by <i>men</i>; but God often overthrows them with their own devisings. <i>Paganism</i> raised up <i>persecution</i> against the Church of Christ, in order to destroy it: this became the very means of quickly spreading it over the earth, and of destroying the whole pagan system. Thus the wise were taken in their own craftiness.</p>
