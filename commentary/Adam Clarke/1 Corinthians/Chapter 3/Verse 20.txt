<p>Verse 20. <i><b>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise</b></i> â€” They are always full of schemes and plans for earthly good; and God knows that all this is <i>vain, empty</i>, and unsatisfactory; and will stand them in no stead when he comes to take away their souls. This is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+94:11">Psalms 94:11</span>. What is here said of the vanity of human knowledge is true of every kind of wisdom that leads not immediately to God himself.</p>
