<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Whether Paul, or Apollos</b></i> — As if he had said: God designs to help you by all <i>things</i> and <i>persons</i>; every teacher sent from him will become a blessing to you, if you abide faithful to your calling. God will press every thing into the service of his followers. The <i>ministers</i> of the Church of Christ are appointed for the <i>hearers</i>, not the <i>hearers</i> for the <i>ministers</i>. In like manner, all the ordinances of grace and mercy are appointed for them, not they for the ordinances.</p>
<p><i><b>Or the world</b></i> — The word κοσμος, here, means rather the <i>inhabitants</i> of the world than what we commonly understand by the world itself; and this is its meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:31">John 14:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>. See particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:19">John 12:19</span>: Ὁ κοσμοσοπισω αυτου απηλθεν, <i>the</i> WORLD <i>is gone after him</i>-the great mass of the people believe on him. The Greek word has the same meaning, in a variety of places, both in the <i>sacred</i> and the <i>profane writers</i>, as <i>le monde</i>, the world, literally has in <i>French</i>, where it signifies, not only the <i>system</i> of <i>created things</i>, but, by metonomy, the people-<i>every body</i>, the <i>mass</i>, the <i>populace</i>. In the same sense it is often found in English. The apostle's meaning evidently is: Not only Paul, Apollos, and Kephas, are yours-appointed for and employed in your service; but <i>every person</i> besides with whom you may have any intercourse or connection, whether Jew or Greek, whether enemy or friend. God will cause every person, as well as every thing to work for your good, while you love, cleave to, and obey Him.</p>
<p><i><b>Or life</b></i> — With all its trials and advantages, every <i>hour</i> of It, every tribulation in it, the <i>whole course</i> of it, as the grand state of your probation, is a general blessing to you: and you have <i>life</i>, and that life preserved in order to prepare for an eternity of blessedness.</p>
<p><i><b>Or death</b></i> — That solemn hour, so dreadful to the wicked; and so hateful to those who live without God: <i>that</i> is <i>yours</i>. <i>Death</i> is your <i>servant</i>; he comes a special messenger from God for you; he comes to undo a knot that now connects body and soul, which it would be unlawful for yourselves to untie; he comes to take your souls to glory; and he cannot come <i>before</i> his due time to those who are waiting for the salvation of God. A saint wishes to live only to glorify God; and he who wishes to live longer than he can <i>get</i> and <i>do</i> good, is not worthy of life.</p>
<p><i><b>Or things present</b></i> — Every occurrence in <i>providence</i> in the <i>present life</i>; for God rules in <i>providence</i> as well as in <i>grace</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Or things to come</b></i> — The whole order and economy of the <i>eternal</i> <i>world</i>; all in <i>heaven</i> and all in <i>earth</i> are even now working together for your good.</p>
