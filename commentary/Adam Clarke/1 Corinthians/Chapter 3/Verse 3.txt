<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:3">1 Corinthians 3:3</span>. <b>There is </b><i><b>among you envying, and strife, and</b></i><b> </b><i><b>divisions</b></i> — ζηλος και ερις και διχοστασιαι. There are <i>three</i> things here worthy of note: these people were wrong in <i>thought,</i> <i>word</i>, and <i>deed</i>. ζηλος, <i>envying</i> refers to the state of their souls; they had inward grudgings and disaffection towards each other. ερις, <i>strife</i> or <i>contention</i>, refers to their <i>words</i>; they were continually <i>disputing</i> and <i>contending</i> whose party was the best, each endeavouring to prove that he and his party were alone in the right. διχοστασιαι, <i>divisions</i>, refers to their <i>conduct</i>; as they could not agree, they contended till they separated from each other, and thus rent the Church of Christ. Thus the <i>envying</i> and grudging led to <i>strife</i> and evil SPEAKING, and this led to <i>divisions</i> and fixed parties. In this state well might the apostle say, <i>Are ye not carnal, and walk as men</i>? Ye act just as the <i>people of the world</i>, and have no more of the <i>spirit</i> of religion than they.</p>
