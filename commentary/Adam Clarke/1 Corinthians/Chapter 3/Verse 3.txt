Verse 1 Corinthians 3:3. There is among you envying, and strife, and divisions — ζηλος και ερις και διχοστασιαι. There are three things here worthy of note: these people were wrong in thought, word, and deed. ζηλος, envying refers to the state of their souls; they had inward grudgings and disaffection towards each other. ερις, strife or contention, refers to their words; they were continually disputing and contending whose party was the best, each endeavouring to prove that he and his party were alone in the right. διχοστασιαι, divisions, refers to their conduct; as they could not agree, they contended till they separated from each other, and thus rent the Church of Christ. Thus the envying and grudging led to strife and evil SPEAKING, and this led to divisions and fixed parties. In this state well might the apostle say, Are ye not carnal, and walk as men? Ye act just as the people of the world, and have no more of the spirit of religion than they.
