<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>. <i><b>Ministers by whom ye believed</b></i> — The different apostles who have preached unto you the word of life are the <i>means</i> which God has used to bring you to the knowledge of Christ. No one of those has either preached or recommended <i>himself</i>; they all preach and recommend Christ Jesus the Lord.</p>
<p><i><b>Even as the Lord gave to every man?</b></i> — Whatever difference there may be in our talents, it is of God's making; and he who knows best what is best for his Church, has distributed both <i>gifts</i> and <i>graces</i> according to his own mind; and, as his judgment is infallible, all these dispensations must be right. Paul, therefore, is as necessary to the perfecting of the Church of Christ as Apollos; and Apollos, as Paul. Both, but with various gifts, point out the same Christ, building on one and the same foundation.</p>
