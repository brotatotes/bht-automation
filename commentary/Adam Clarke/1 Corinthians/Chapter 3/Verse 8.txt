<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:8">1 Corinthians 3:8</span>. <i><b>He that planteth and he that watereth are one</b></i> — Both Paul and Apollos have received the same doctrine, preach the same doctrine, and labour to promote the glory of God in the salvation of your souls. Why should you be divided with respect to Paul and Apollos, while these apostles are intimately ONE in <i>spirit,</i> <i>design</i>, and <i>operation</i>?</p>
<p><i><b>According to his own labour.</b></i> — God does not reward his servants according to the <i>success</i> of their labour, because that depends on himself; but he rewards them according to the <i>quantum</i> of faithful <i>labour</i> which they bestow on his work. In this sense none can say, I have laboured in vain, and spent my strength for nought.</p>
