<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>. <i><b>For we are labourers together with God</b></i> — We do nothing of ourselves, nor in reference to ourselves; we labour together in that work which God has given us to do, expect all our success from him, and refer the whole to his glory. It would perhaps be more correct to translate θεου γαρ εσμεν συνεργαι, <i>we</i> <i>are fellow labourers of God</i>; for, as the preposition συν may express the joint labour of the teachers one with another, and not with God, I had rather, with Bishop Pearce, translate as above: i.e. we labour together in the work of God. Far from being divided among ourselves, we <i>jointly</i> labour, as oxen in the same yoke, to promote the honour of our Master.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye are God's husbandry</b></i><b>, ye are </b><i><b>God's building.</b></i> — θεου γεωργιον θεου οικοδομη εστε. The word γεωργιον, which we translate husbandry, signifies properly an <i>arable field</i>; so <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+24:30">Proverbs 24:30</span>: <i>I went by the</i> FIELD, γεωργιον, <i>of the slothful</i>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+31:16">Proverbs 31:16</span>: <i>The wise woman considereth a</i> FIELD, γεωργιον, <i>and buyeth it</i>. It would be more literal to translate it, <i>Ye are God's farm</i>: γεωργιον in Greek answers to שדה <i>sadeh</i> in Hebrew, which signifies properly a <i>sown field</i>.</p>
<p>Ye are <i>God's building</i>.-Ye are not only the <i>field</i> which God cultivates, but ye are the house which God builds, and in which he intends to dwell. As no man in viewing a fine building extols the <i>quarryman</i> that dug up the stones, the <i>hewer</i> that cut and squared them, the <i>mason</i> that placed them in the wall, the <i>woodman</i> that hewed down the timber, the <i>carpenter</i> that squared and jointed it, c., but the <i>architect</i> who planned it, and under whose direction the whole work was accomplished so no man should consider <i>Paul</i>, or <i>Apollos</i>, or <i>Kephas</i>, any thing, but as persons employed by the great Architect to form a building which is to become a habitation of himself through the Spirit, and the <i>design</i> of which is entirely his own.</p>
