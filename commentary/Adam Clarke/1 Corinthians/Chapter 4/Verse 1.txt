<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:1">1 Corinthians 4:1</span>. <i><b>Let a man so account of us</b></i> — This is a continuation of the subject in the preceding chapter; and should not have been divided from it. The <i>fourth</i> chapter would have begun better at <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>, and the <i>third</i> should have ended with the fifth verse. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span></p>
<p><i><b>As of the ministers of Christ</b></i> — ως υπηρετας χριστου. The word υπηρετης means an <i>under-rower</i>, or one, who, in the <i>trireme,</i> <i>quadrireme</i>, or <i>quinquereme</i> galleys, rowed in one of the <i>undermost</i> benches; but it means also, as used by the Greek writers, any inferior officer or assistant. By the term here the apostle shows the Corinthians that, far from being <i>heads</i> and <i>chiefs</i>, he and his fellow apostles considered themselves only as inferior officers, employed under Christ from whom alone they received their appointment their work, and their recompense.</p>
<p><i><b>Stewards of the mysteries of God.</b></i> — και οικονομους μυστηριων θεου, <i>Economists</i> of the Divine mysteries. See the explanation of the word <i>steward</i> in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:45">Matthew 24:45</span><i>"</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>.</p>
<p>The <i>steward</i>, or <i>oikonomos</i>, was the master's deputy in regulating the concerns of the family, providing food for the household, seeing it served out at the proper times and seasons, and in proper quantities. He received all the cash, expended what was necessary for the support of the family, and kept exact accounts, which he was obliged at certain times to lay before the master. The <i>mysteries</i>, the <i>doctrines of God</i>, relative to the salvation of the world by the passion and death of Christ; and the inspiration, illumination, and purification of the soul by the Spirit of Christ, constituted a principal part of the Divine treasure intrusted to the hands of the stewards by their heavenly Master; as the <i>food</i> that was to be dispensed at proper times, seasons, and in proper proportions to the children and domestics of the <i>Church</i>, which is the <i>house of God</i>.</p>
