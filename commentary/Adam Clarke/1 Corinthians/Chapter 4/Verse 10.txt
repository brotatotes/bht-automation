<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:10">1 Corinthians 4:10</span>. <i><b>We</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>fools for Christ's sake</b></i> — Here he still carries on the allusion to the public spectacles among the Romans, where they were accustomed to hiss, hoot, mock, and variously insult the poor victims. To this <i>Philo</i> alludes, in his embassy to <i>Caius</i>, speaking of the treatment which the Jews received at Rome: ὡσπερ γαρ εν θεατρῳ κλωσμοσυριττοντων, καταμωκωμενων, αμετραχλευαζοντων· "For, as if exhibited upon a theatre, we are hissed, most outrageously hooted, and insulted beyond all bounds." Thus, says the apostle, we are fools on Christ's account; we walk in a conformity to his will, and we bear his cross: and did we walk according to the course of this world, or according to the <i>man-pleasing</i> conduct of some among you, we should have no such cross to bear.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>wise in Christ</b></i> — Surely all these expressions are meant <i>ironically</i>; the <i>apostles</i> were neither <i>fools</i>, nor <i>weak</i>, nor <i>contemptible</i>; nor were the <i>Corinthians</i>, morally speaking, <i>wise</i>, and <i>strong</i>, and <i>honourable</i>. Change the <i>persons</i>, and then the <i>epithets</i> will perfectly apply.</p>
