<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:13">1 Corinthians 4:13</span>. <i><b>Being defamed</b></i> — βλασφημουμενοι, Being <i>blasphemed</i>. I have already remarked that βλασφημειν signifies to <i>speak</i> <i>injuriously</i>, and may have reference either to God or to man. GOD is <i>blasphemed</i> when his attributes, doctrines, providence, or grace, are treated contemptuously, or any thing said of him that is contrary to his holiness, justice, goodness, or truth. <i>Man</i> is blasphemed when any thing injurious is spoken of his person, character, conduct, c. <i>Blaspheming</i> against men is any thing by which they are <i>injured</i> in their <i>persons, characters</i>, or <i>property</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>We are made as the filth of the earth-the offscouring of all</b></i><b> </b><i><b>things</b></i> — The Greek word which we render <i>filth</i>, is περικαθαρματα, a <i>purgation</i>, or <i>lustrative sacrifice</i> that which we translate <i>offscouring</i> is περιψημα, a <i>redemption sacrifice</i>. To understand the full force of these words, as applied by the apostle in this place, we must observe that he alludes to certain customs among the heathens, who, in the time of some public calamity, chose out some unhappy men of the most abject and despicable character to be a public <i>expiation</i> for them; these they maintained a whole year at the public expense; and then they led them out, crowned with flowers, as was customary in sacrifices; and, having heaped all the curses of the country upon their heads, and whipped them seven times, they burned them alive, and afterwards their ashes were thrown into the sea, while the people said these words: περιψημαἡμων γινου, <i>be thou our propitiation</i>. Sometimes the person thus chosen was thrown into the sea as a sacrifice to <i>Neptune</i>, the people saying the words as before. Hence <i>Origen</i> says that our Lord, in giving up himself as a propitiation for our sins, was much more than his apostles-περικαθαρματα του κοσμου, παντων περιψημα, <i>the lustration of the world, and the peculiar</i> <i>sacrifice for all men</i>. The apostle, therefore, means that he and his fellows were treated like those wretched beings who were judged to be fit for nothing but to be expiatory victims to the infernal gods, for the safety and redemption of others. Our words <i>filth</i> and <i>offscouring</i>, convey no legitimate sense of the original. See several useful remarks upon these terms in <i>Pearce, Whitby</i>, and <i>Parkhurst</i>.</p>
