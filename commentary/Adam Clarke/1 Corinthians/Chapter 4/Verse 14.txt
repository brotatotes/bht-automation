<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:14">1 Corinthians 4:14</span>. <i><b>I write not these things to shame you</b></i> â€” It is not by way of <i>finding fault</i> with you for not providing me with the necessaries of life that I write thus; but I do it to warn you to act differently for the time to come; and be not so ready to be drawn aside by every pretender to apostleship, to the neglect of those to whom, under God, you owe your salvation.</p>
