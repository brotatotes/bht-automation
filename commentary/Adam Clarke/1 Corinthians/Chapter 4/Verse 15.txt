<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:15">1 Corinthians 4:15</span>. <i><b>For though ye have ten thousand instructers</b></i> — μυριους παιδαγωγους, <i>Myriads of leaders</i>, that is, an indefinite multitude; for so the word is often used. The παιδαγωγος, from which we have our word <i>pedagogue</i>, which we improperly apply to a <i>school master</i>, was among the Greeks, the person or <i>servant</i> who attended a child, had the general care of him, and who <i>led him to</i> <i>school</i> for the purpose of being instructed by the διδασκαλος, or teacher. It seems there were many at Corinth who offered their services to instruct this people, and who were not well affected towards the apostle.</p>
<p><i><b>Not many fathers</b></i> — Many offer to instruct you who have no <i>parental</i> feeling for you; and how can they? you are not their spiritual children, you stand in this relation to <i>me</i> alone; for <i>in</i> <i>Christ Jesus</i>-by the power and unction of his Spirit, <i>I have</i> <i>begotten you</i>-I was the means of bringing you into a state of salvation, so that you have been born again: ye are my children alone in the Gospel. <i>Schoettgen</i> produces a good illustration of this from <i>Shemoth Rabba</i>, sect. 46, fol. 140. "A girl who had lost her parents was educated by a guardian, who was a good and faithful man, and took great care of her; when she was grown up, he purposed to bestow her in marriage; the scribe came, and beginning to write the contract, said, What is thy name? The maid answered, N. The scribe proceeded, What is the name of thy father? The maid was silent. Her guardian said, Why art thou silent? The maid replied, Because I know <i>no other father but thee</i>; for he who educates a child well, is more properly the father than he who begot it." This is the same kind of sentiment which I have already quoted from <i>Terence</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:13">Romans 16:13</span>. </p>
