<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:16">1 Corinthians 4:16</span>. <i><b>Wherefore, I beseech you, be ye followers of me.</b></i> — It should rather be translated, Be ye imitators of me; μιμηται, from which we have our word <i>mimic</i>, which, though now used only in a <i>bad</i> or <i>ludicrous</i> sense, simply signifies an <i>imitator</i> of another person, whether in <i>speech, manner, habit</i>, or otherwise. As children should imitate their <i>parents</i> in preference to all others, he calls on them to <i>imitate</i> him, as he claims them for his <i>children</i>. He lived for God and eternity, seeking not his own glory, emolument, or ease: those sowers of sedition among them were actuated by different motives. Here then the apostle compares himself with them: follow and imitate me, as I follow and imitate Christ: do not imitate them who, from their worldly pursuits, show themselves to be actuated with a worldly spirit.</p>
