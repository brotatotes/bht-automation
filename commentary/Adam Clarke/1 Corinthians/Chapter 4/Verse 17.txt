<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For this cause</b></i> — That you imitate me, and know in what this consists.</p>
<p><i><b>I sent unto you Timotheus</b></i> — The same person to whom he wrote the two epistles that are still extant under his name, and whom he calls here his <i>beloved son</i>, one of his most <i>intimate disciples</i>; and whom he had been the means of <i>bringing to God</i> through Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>My ways which be in Christ</b></i> — This person will also inform you of the <i>manner</i> in which I regulate all the Churches; and show to you, that what I require of you is no other than what I require of all the Churches of Christ which I have formed, as I follow the same plan of discipline in every place. See the <i>Introduction</i>, sect. iii.</p>
