<p>Verse 19. <i><b>But I will come to you shortly</b></i> â€” God being my helper, I fully purpose to visit you; and then I shall put those proud men to the proof, not of their <i>speech</i> - eloquence, or pretensions to great knowledge and influence, but of their <i>power</i> - the authority they profess to have from God, and the evidences of that authority in the works they have performed. See the <i>Introduction</i>, sect. xi.</p>
