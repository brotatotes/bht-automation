<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span>. <i><b>Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love</b></i> â€” Here he alludes to the case of the <i>teacher</i> and <i>father</i>, mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:15">1 Corinthians 4:15</span>. Shall I come to you with the <i>authority</i> of a <i>teacher</i>, and use the <i>rod</i> of <i>discipline</i>? or shall I come in the <i>tenderness</i> of a <i>father</i>, and entreat you to do what I have authority to enforce? Among the Jews, those who did not amend, after being faithfully admonished, were <i>whipped</i>, either publicly or privately, in the synagogue. If on this they did not amend, they were liable to be stoned. We see, from the cases of Ananias and Sapphira, Elymas the sorcerer, Hymenaeus and Alexander, c., that the apostles had sometimes the power to inflict the most awful punishments on transgressors. The Corinthians must have known this, and consequently have dreaded a visit from him in his <i>apostolical</i> <i>authority</i>. That there were many irregularities in this Church, which required both the presence and authority of the apostle, we shall see in the subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>1. IN the preceding chapter we find the ministers of God compared to STEWARDS, of whom the strictest <i>fidelity</i> is required.</p>
<p>(1.) <i>Fidelity</i> to GOD, in publishing his truth with <i>zeal</i>, defending it with <i>courage</i>, and recommending it with <i>prudence</i>.</p>
<p>(2.) <i>Fidelity</i> to CHRIST, whose representatives they are, in honestly and fully recommending his grace and salvation on the ground of his <i>passion</i> and <i>death</i>, and preaching his <i>maxims</i> in all their <i>force</i> and <i>purity</i>.</p>
<p>(3.) <i>Fidelity</i> to the CHURCH, in taking heed to keep up a godly discipline, admitting none into it but those who have abandoned their sins and permitting none to continue in it that do not continue to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour.</p>
<p>(4.) <i>Fidelity</i> to their own MINISTRY, walking so as to bring no blame on the Gospel; avoiding the extremes of <i>indolent tenderness</i> on one hand, and <i>austere severity</i> on the other. Considering the flock, not as <i>their</i> flock, but the flock of Jesus Christ; watching, ruling, and feeding it according to the order of their Divine Master.</p>
<p>2. A minister of God should act with great caution: every man, properly speaking, is placed between the secret judgment of God and the public censure of men. He should do nothing rashly, that he may not <i>justly</i> incur the censure of men; and he should do nothing but in the loving fear of God, that he may not incur the censure of his Maker. The man who scarcely ever allows himself to be <i>wrong</i>, is one of whom it may be safely said, he is seldom <i>right</i>. It is possible for a man to mistake his own will for the will of God, and his own obstinacy for inflexible adherence to his duty. With such persons it is dangerous to have any commerce. Reader, pray to God to save thee from an inflated and self-sufficient mind.</p>
<p>3. <i>Zeal</i> for God's truth is essentially necessary for every minister; and <i>prudence</i> is not less so. They should be wisely tempered together, but this is not always the case. <i>Zeal</i> without <i>prudence</i> is like a flambeau in the hands of a blind man; it may <i>enlighten</i> and <i>warm</i>, but it play also destroy the spiritual building. <i>Human prudence</i> should be avoided as well as <i>intemperate</i> <i>zeal</i>; this kind of prudence consists in a man's being careful not to bring himself into trouble, and not to hazard his reputation, credit, interest, or fortune, in the performance of his duty. <i>Evangelical wisdom</i> consists in our suffering and losing all things, rather than be wanting in the discharge of our obligations.</p>
<p>4. From St. Paul's account of himself we find him often suffering the severest hardships in the prosecution of his duty. He had for his patrimony, hunger, thirst, nakedness, stripes, c. and wandered about testifying the Gospel of the grace of God, without even a <i>cottage</i> that he could claim as his own. Let those who dwell in their elegant houses, who profess to be <i>apostolic</i> in their <i>order</i>, and <i>evangelic</i> in their <i>doctrines</i>, think of this. In their state of affluence they should have extraordinary degrees of <i>zeal</i>, humility, meekness, and charity, to recommend them to our notice as <i>apostolical men</i>. If God, in the course of his providence, has saved them from an apostle's hardships, let them devote their lives to the service of that Church in which they have their emoluments; and labour incessantly to build it up on its most holy faith. Let them not be <i>masters</i> to govern with rigour and imperiousness; but tender <i>fathers</i>, who feel every member in the Church as their own child, and labour to feed the heavenly family with the mysteries of God, of which they are stewards.</p>
<p>5. And while the people require much of their spiritual pastors, these pastors have equal right to require much of their people. The obligation is not all on one side; those who watch for our souls have a right not only to their own support, but to our reverence and confidence. Those who despise their ecclesiastical rulers, will soon despise the Church of Christ itself, neglect its ordinances, lose sight of its doctrines, and at last neglect their own salvation.</p>
