<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:3">1 Corinthians 4:3</span>. <i><b>It is a very small thing that I should be judged of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>you</b></i> — Those who preferred <i>Apollos</i> or <i>Kephas</i> before St. Paul, would of course give their reasons for this preference; and these might, in many instances, be very unfavourable to his character as a man, a Christian, or an apostle; of this he was regardless, as he sought not his own glory, but the glory of God in the salvation of their souls.</p>
<p><i><b>Or of man's judgment</b></i> — Η ὑπο ανθρωπινης ἡμερας, literally, <i>or of</i> <i>man's day</i>: but ανθρωπινη ημερα signifies any day set apart by a judge or magistrate to try a man on. This is the meaning of ημερα, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:13">Psalms 37:13</span>: <i>The Lord shall laugh</i> at <i>him: for he seeth that his</i> DAY, ηημερα αυτου, his <i>judgment is coming</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:17">Malachi 3:17</span>: <i>And they shall be mine in the</i> DAY, εις ημεραν, in the <i>judgment,</i> <i>when I make up my jewels</i>. It has the same meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>: <i>But the</i> DAY, the JUDGMENT, <i>of the Lord will come</i>. The word ανθρωπινος, <i>man's</i>, signifies <i>miserable, wretched, woful</i>; so <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:16">Jeremiah 17:16</span>: <i>Neither have I desired</i>, יום אנוש yom enosh, the day of man; but very properly translated in our version, the <i>woful day. God's</i> DAYS, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+24:1">Job 24:1</span>, certainly signify <i>God's</i> JUDGMENTS. And the DAY <i>of our Lord Jesus</i>, in this epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8">1 Corinthians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>, signifies the <i>day</i> in which Christ will <i>judge</i> the world; or rather the <i>judgment</i> itself.</p>
<p><i><b>I judge not mine own self.</b></i> — I leave myself entirely to God, whose I am, and whom I serve.</p>
