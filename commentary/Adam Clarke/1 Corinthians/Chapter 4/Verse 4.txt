<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:4">1 Corinthians 4:4</span>. <i><b>For I know nothing by myself</b></i> — Ουδεν γαρ εμαυτῳ συνοιδα· I am not <i>conscious</i> that I am <i>guilty</i> of any evil, or have neglected to fulfil faithfully the duty of a steward of Jesus Christ. The import of the verb συνειδειν is <i>to be conscious of</i> <i>guilt</i>; and <i>conscire</i> has the same meaning: so, in Horace, <i>Nil</i> CONSCIRE <i>sibi</i>, to <i>know nothing to one's self</i>, is the same as <i>nulla</i> <i>pellescere culpa, not</i> to <i>grow pale at being charged with a crime</i>, through a <i>consciousness</i> of guilt.</p>
<p><i><b>Yet am I not hereby justified</b></i> — I do not pretend to say that though I am not <i>conscious</i> of any offence towards God I must therefore be pronounced innocent; no: I leave those things to God; he shall pronounce in my favour, not I myself. By these words the apostle, in a very gentle yet effectual manner, censures those rash and precipitate judgments which the Corinthians were in the habit of pronouncing on both men and things-a conduct than which nothing is more reprehensible and dangerous.</p>
