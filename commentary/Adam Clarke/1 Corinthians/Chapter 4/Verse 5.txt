<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span>. <i><b>Judge nothing before the time</b></i> â€” God, the righteous Judge, will determine every thing shortly: it is his province alone to search the heart, and <i>bring to light the hidden things of</i> <i>darkness</i>. If you be so pure and upright in your conduct, if what you have been doing in these divisions, c., be right in his sight, then shall you have praise for the same if otherwise, yourselves are most concerned. Some refer the praise to St. Paul and his companions: <i>Then shall every one</i> of us apostles <i>have</i> <i>praise of God</i>.</p>
