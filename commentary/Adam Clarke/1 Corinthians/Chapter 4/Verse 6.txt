<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>. <i><b>These things</b></i> — Which I have written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>I have in a figure transferred to myself and: to Apollos</b></i> — I have written as if myself and Apollos were the authors of the sects which now prevail among you although <i>others</i>, without either our consent or knowledge, have proclaimed us <i>heads</i> of parties. Bishop Pearce paraphrases the verse thus: "I have made use of my own and Apollos' name in my arguments against your divisions, because I would spare to name those teachers among you who are guilty of making and heading parties; and because I would have you, by our example, not to value them above what I have said of teachers in general in this epistle; so that none of you ought to be puffed up for one against another." Doubtless there were persons at Corinth who, taking advantage of this spirit of innovation among that people, set themselves up also for teachers, and endeavoured to draw disciples after them. And perhaps some even of these were more valued by the fickle multitude than the very <i>apostles</i> by whom they had been brought out of heathenish darkness into the marvellous light of the Gospel. I have already supposed it possible that <i>Diotrephes</i> was one of the ringleaders in these schisms at Corinth. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>.</p>
