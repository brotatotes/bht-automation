<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:8">1 Corinthians 4:8</span>. <i><b>Now ye</b></i> â€” Corinthians <i>are full</i> of secular wisdom; <i>now</i> <i>ye are rich</i>, both in wealth and spiritual gifts; (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26">1 Corinthians 14:26</span>:) <i>ye have reigned as kings</i>, flourishing in the enjoyment of these things, in all tranquillity and honour; <i>without</i> any want of <i>us:</i> <i>and I would to God ye did reign</i>, in <i>deed</i>, and not in <i>conceit</i> only, <i>that we also</i>, poor, persecuted, and despised apostles, <i>might reign</i> <i>with you</i>.-Whitby.</p>
<p>Though this paraphrase appears natural, yet I am of opinion that the apostle here intends a strong <i>irony</i>; and one which, when taken in conjunction with what he had said before, must have stung them to the heart. It is not an unusual thing for many people to <i>forget</i>, if not <i>despise</i>, the men by whom they were brought to the knowledge of the truth; and take up with <i>others</i> to whom, in the things of God, they owe nothing. Reader, is this <i>thy</i> case?</p>
