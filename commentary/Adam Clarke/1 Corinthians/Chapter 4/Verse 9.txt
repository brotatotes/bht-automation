<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>. <i><b>God hath set forth us the apostles last</b></i> — This whole passage is well explained by Dr. Whitby. "Here the apostle seems to allude to the Roman spectacles, της των θηριομαχων, και μονομαχιας ανδροφονου, that of the <i>Bestiarii</i> and the <i>gladiators</i>, where in the <i>morning</i> men were brought upon the theatres to fight with <i>wild beasts</i>, and to them was allowed armour to defend themselves and smite the beasts that assailed them; but in the <i>meridian</i> or noon-day spectacles the gladiators were brought forth <i>naked</i>, and without any thing to defend themselves from the sword of the assailant; and he that then escaped was only kept for slaughter to another day, so that these men might well be called επιθανατιοι, <i>men appointed for death</i>; and this being the <i>last</i> appearance on the theatre for that day, they are said here to be set forth εσχατοι, <i>the last</i>." Of these two spectacles <i>Seneca</i> speaks thus, Epist. vii.: "In the <i>morning</i> men are exposed to lions and bears; at <i>mid-day</i> to their spectators; those that kill are exposed to one another; the victor is detained for another slaughter; the conclusion of the fight is <i>death</i>. The <i>former</i> fighting compared to this was mercy; now it is mere <i>butchery</i>: they have nothing to cover them; their whole body is exposed to every blow, and every stroke produces a wound," c.</p>
<p><i><b>We are made a spectacle</b></i> — Ὁτι θεατρον εγενηθημεν, We are exhibited on the <i>theatre</i> to the <i>world</i> we are lawful booty to all mankind, and particularly to the <i>men of the world</i>, who have their portion in this life. <i>Angels</i> are astonished at our treatment, and so are the more considerate part of <i>men</i>. Who at that time would have coveted the apostolate?</p>
