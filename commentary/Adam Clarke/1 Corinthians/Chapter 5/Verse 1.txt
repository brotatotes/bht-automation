<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>. There is <i><b>fornication among you</b></i> — The word πορνεια, which we translate <i>fornication</i> in this place, must be understood in its utmost latitude of meaning, as implying all kinds of impurity; for, that the Corinthians were notoriously guilty of every species of irregularity and debauch, we have already seen; and it is not likely that in speaking on this subject, in reference to a people so very notorious, he would refer to only one species of impurity, and that not the most flagitious.</p>
<p><i><b>That one should have his father's wife.</b></i> — Commentators and critics have found great difficulties in this statement. One part of the case is sufficiently clear, that a man who professed Christianity had illegal connections with his father's wife; but the principal question is, was his father <i>alive</i> or <i>dead</i>? Most think that the father was <i>alive</i>, and imagine that to this the apostle refers, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:12">2 Corinthians 7:12</span>, where, speaking of the person who <i>did</i> the wrong, he introduces also him who had <i>suffered</i> the wrong; which must mean the father and the father then <i>alive</i>. After all that has been said on this subject, I think it most natural to conclude that the person in question had married the wife of his <i>deceased</i> father, not his <i>own</i> mother, but <i>stepmother</i>, then a <i>widow</i>.</p>
<p>This was a crime which the text says <i>was not so much as named</i> <i>among the Gentiles</i>; the apostle must only mean that it was not <i>accredited</i> by them, for it certainly did often occur: but by their best writers who notice it, it was branded as superlatively infamous. Cicero styles it, <i>scelus incredibile et inauditum</i>, an incredible and unheard of wickedness; but it was <i>heard</i> of and <i>practised</i>; and there are several stories of this kind in heathen authors, but they <i>reprobate</i> not <i>commend</i> it. The word ονομαζεται, <i>named</i>, is wanting in almost every MS. and version of importance, and certainly makes no part of the text. The words should be read, <i>and such fornication as is not amongst the Gentiles</i>, i.e., not <i>allowed</i>. Some think that this woman might have been a proselyte to the Jewish religion from heathenism; and the rabbins taught that proselytism annulled all former relationship, and that a woman was at liberty in such a case to depart from an unbelieving husband, and to marry even with a believing <i>son</i>, i.e., of her husband by some former wife.</p>
