<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>. <i><b>But now I have written</b></i> â€” I not only write this, but I add more: if any one <i>who is called a brother</i>, i.e. professes the Christian religion, be a <i>fornicator, covetous, idolater,</i> <i>railer, drunkard</i>, or <i>extortioner</i>, not even to eat with such-have no communion with such a one, in things either <i>sacred</i> or <i>civil</i>. You may transact your worldly concerns with a person that knows not God, and makes no profession of Christianity, whatever his moral character may be; but ye must not even thus far acknowledge a man <i>professing Christianity</i>, who is scandalous in his conduct. Let him have this extra mark of your abhorrence of all sin; and let the world see that the Church of God does not tolerate iniquity.</p>
