<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:2">1 Corinthians 5:2</span>. <i><b>Ye are puffed up</b></i> — Ye are full of strife and contention relative to your parties and favourite teachers, and neglect the discipline of the Church. Had you considered the greatness of this crime, ye would have rather <i>mourned</i>, and have put away this flagrant transgressor from among you.</p>
<p><i><b>Taken away from among you.</b></i> — Ἱνα εξαρθη εκ μεσου υμων. This is supposed by some to refer to the punishment of <i>death</i>, by others to excommunication. The Christian Church was at this time too young to have those <i>forms of excommunication</i> which were practised in succeeding centuries. Probably no more is meant than a simple <i>disowning</i> of the person, accompanied with the refusal to admit him to the sacred ordinances, or to have any intercourse or connection with him.</p>
