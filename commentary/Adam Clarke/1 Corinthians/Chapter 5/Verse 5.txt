<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>. <i><b>To deliver such a one unto Satan</b></i> â€” There is no evidence that delivering to Satan was any <i>form</i> of excommunication known either among the Jews or the Christians. <i>Lightfoot, Selden</i>, and <i>Schoettgen</i>, who have searched all the Jewish records, have found nothing that answers to this: it was a species of punishment administered in extraordinary cases, in which the body and the mind of an incorrigible transgressor were delivered by the authority of God into the power of Satan, to be tortured with diseases and terrors as a warning to all; but while the body and mind were thus tormented, the immortal spirit was under the influence of the Divine mercy; and the affliction, in all probability, was in general only for a season; though sometimes it was evidently unto <i>death</i>, as the <i>destruction of the flesh</i> seems to imply. But the soul found mercy at the hand of God; for such a most extraordinary interference of God's power and justice, and of Satan's influence, could not fail to bring the person to a state of the deepest humiliation and contrition; and thus, while the <i>flesh</i> was <i>destroyed</i>, the <i>spirit was saved in the day of the Lord</i> <i>Jesus</i>. No such power as this remains in the Church of God; none such should be assumed; the pretensions to it are as <i>wicked</i> as they are <i>vain</i>. It was the same power by which <i>Ananias</i> and <i>Sapphira</i> were struck dead, and <i>Elymas</i> the sorcerer struck blind. <i>Apostles</i> alone were intrusted with it.</p>
