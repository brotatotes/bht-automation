<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6">1 Corinthians 5:6</span>. <i><b>Your glorying is not good.</b></i> — You are triumphing in your superior knowledge, and busily employed in setting up and supporting your respective teachers, while the Church is left under the most scandalous corruptions-corruptions which threaten its very existence if not purged away.</p>
<p><i><b>Know ye not</b></i> — With all your boasted wisdom, do you not know and acknowledge the truth of a common maxim, <i>a little leaven leaveneth</i> <i>the whole lump</i>? If this <i>leaven</i>-the incestuous person, be permitted to remain among you; if his conduct be not exposed by the most formidable censure; the flood-gates of impurity will be opened on the Church, and the whole state of Christianity ruined in Corinth.</p>
