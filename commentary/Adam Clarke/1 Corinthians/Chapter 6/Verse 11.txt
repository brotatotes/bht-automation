<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>. <i><b>And such were some of you</b></i> — It was not with the prospect of collecting <i>saints</i> that the apostles went about preaching the Gospel of the kingdom. None but <i>sinners</i> were to be found over the face of the earth; they preached that sinners might be converted unto God, made saints, and constituted into a Church; and this was the <i>effect</i> as well as the <i>object</i> of their preaching.</p>
<p><i><b>But ye are washed</b></i> — Several suppose that the <i>order</i> in which the operations of the grace of God take place in the soul is here inverted; but I am of a very different mind. Every thing will appear here in its order, when we understand the <i>terms</i> used by the apostle.</p>
<p><i>Ye are washed</i>, απελουσασθε; ye have been <i>baptized</i> into the Christian faith, and ye have promised in this baptism to put off all filthiness of the flesh and spirit: and the <i>washing</i> of your bodies is emblematical of the purification of your souls.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye are sanctified</b></i> — ηγιασθητε; from α, <i>privative</i>, and γη, <i>the earth</i>; ye are <i>separated</i> from <i>earthly</i> things to be <i>connected</i> with <i>spiritual</i>. Ye are <i>separated</i> from <i>time</i> to be <i>connected</i> with <i>eternity</i>. Ye are <i>separated</i> from <i>idols</i> to be <i>joined</i> to the <i>living God. Separation</i> from common, earthly, or sinful uses, to be wholly employed in the service of the true God, is the <i>ideal</i> meaning of this word, both in the Old and New Testaments. It was in consequence of their being separated from the world that they became a Church of God. Ye were formerly workers of iniquity, and <i>associated</i> with workers of iniquity; but now ye are separated from them, and united together to work out your salvation with fear and trembling before God.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye are justified</b></i> — εδικαιωθητε. Ye have been brought into a state of favour with God; your sins having been blotted out through Christ Jesus, the <i>Spirit of God</i> witnessing the same to your conscience, and carrying on by his energy the great work of regeneration in your hearts. The process here is plain and simple:-</p>
<p>1. Paul and his brother apostles preached the Gospel at Corinth, and besought the people to turn from darkness to light-from idol vanities to the living God, and to believe in the Lord Jesus for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>2. The people who heard were convinced of the Divine truths delivered by the apostle, and flocked to baptism.</p>
<p>3. They were baptized <i>in the name of the Lord</i> <i>Jesus</i>, and thus took upon them the public profession of the Gospel.</p>
<p>4. Being now baptized into the Christian faith, they were separated from idols and idolaters, and became incorporated with the Church of God.</p>
<p>5. As penitents, they were led to the Lord Jesus for <i>justification</i>, which they received through faith in his blood.</p>
<p>6. Being <i>justified</i> freely-having their <i>sins forgiven</i> through the redemption that is in Jesus, they received the <i>Spirit</i> <i>of God</i> to attest this glorious work of grace to their consciences; and thus became possessed of that principle of righteousness, that true leaven which was to leaven the whole lump, producing that universal holiness without which none can see the Lord.</p>
