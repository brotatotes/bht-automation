<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:12">1 Corinthians 6:12</span>. <i><b>All things are lawful unto me</b></i> — It is likely that some of the Corinthians had pleaded that the offence of the man who had his father's wife, as well as the eating the things offered to idols, was not contrary to the law, as it then stood. To this the apostle answers: Though such a thing be lawful, yet the case of fornication, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>, is not expedient, ου συμφερει-it is not agreeable to propriety, decency, order, and purity. It is contrary to the established usages of the best and most enlightened nations, and should not be tolerated in the Church of Christ.</p>
<p>They might also be led to argue in favour of their eating things offered to idols, and attending idol feasts, thus:-that an idol was nothing in the world; and as food was provided by the bounty of God, a man might partake of it any where without defiling his conscience, or committing sin against the Creator. This excuse also the apostle refers to. All these things are lawful, taken up merely in the light that none of your laws is against the first; and that, on the ground that an idol is nothing in the world, there can be no reason against the <i>last</i>;</p>
<p><i><b>But I will not be brought under the power of any.</b></i> — Allowing that they are all lawful, or at least that there is no law against them, yet they are not expedient; there is no necessity for them; and some of them are abominable, and forbidden by the law of God and nature, whether forbidden by yours or not; while others, such as eating meats offered to idols, will almost necessarily lead to bad moral consequences: and who, that is a Christian, would obey his appetite so far as to do these things for the sake of gratification? A man is <i>brought under the power of any thing</i> which he cannot give up. He is the <i>slave</i> of that thing, whatsoever it be, which he cannot relinquish; and then, to him, it is sin.</p>
