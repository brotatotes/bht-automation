<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>. <i><b>Meats for the belly</b></i> — I suppose that κοιλια means the animal <i>appetite</i>, or <i>propensity</i> to food, c., and we may conceive the apostle to reason thus: I acknowledge that God has provided different kinds of aliments for the appetite of man, and among others those which are generally offered to idols and he has adapted the <i>appetite</i> to these <i>aliments</i>, and the <i>aliments</i> to the <i>appetite: but God shall destroy both it and them</i>; none of these is eternal; all these <i>lower appetites</i> and <i>sensations</i> will be destroyed by death, and have no existence in the resurrection body; and the earth and its productions shall be burnt up.</p>
<p><i><b>Now the body</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>not for fornication</b></i> — Though God made an appetite for food, and provided food for that appetite, yet he has not made the <i>body</i> for any <i>uncleanness</i>, nor <i>indulgence</i> in sensuality; but he has made it for Christ; and Christ was provided to be a sacrifice for this body as well as for the soul, by taking our nature upon him; so that now, as <i>human</i> beings, we have an intimate relationship to the Lord; and our bodies are made not only for his <i>service</i>, but to be his <i>temples</i>.</p>
