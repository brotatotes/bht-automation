<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost</b></i> — What an astonishing saying is this! As truly as the living God dwelt in the Mosaic tabernacle, and in the temple of Solomon, so truly does the Holy Ghost dwell in the souls of genuine Christians; and as the <i>temple</i> and all its <i>utensils</i> were <i>holy, separated</i> from all common and profane uses, and dedicated alone to the service of God, so the bodies of genuine Christians are holy, and all their members should be employed in the service of God alone.</p>
<p><i><b>And ye are not your own?</b></i> — Ye have no right over yourselves, to dispose either of your body, or any of its members, as <i>you</i> may think proper or lawful; you are bound to God, and to him you are accountable.</p>
