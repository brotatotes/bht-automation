<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2">1 Corinthians 6:2</span>. <i><b>The saints shall judge the world?</b></i> — Nothing can be more evident than that the writers of the New Testament often use οκοσμος, <i>the world</i>, to signify the <i>Jewish people</i>; and sometimes the <i>Roman empire</i>, and the <i>Jewish state</i>; and in the former sense it is often used by our Lord. <i>When</i>, says he, t<i>he Son of man shall</i> <i>sit on the throne of his glory, then shall ye sit on twelve</i> <i>thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>. It is supposed that he refers to the same subject as that mentioned here-the saints judging the world; and that St. Paul has <i>his</i> words in view in what he says here to the Corinthians. By <i>judging the</i> <i>twelve tribes of Israel</i>, some have imagined that <i>having authority</i> <i>in the Church</i> is merely intended; but Dr. Lightfoot contends that the words referred to the coming of our Lord to execute judgment on the Jews, and to destroy their state; and that the <i>doctrine</i> of the apostles, not <i>themselves</i>, was to judge and condemn that most disobedient people. The place before us is generally understood to imply, that the redeemed of the Lord shall be, on the great day, <i>assessors</i> with him in judgment; and shall give their award in the determinations of his justice. On reviewing this subject, I am fully of opinion that this cannot be the meaning of the words, and that no such <i>assessorship</i> as is contended for ever will take place; and that the interpretation is clogged with a multitude of absurdities.</p>
<p>1. The <i>saints</i> themselves are to appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and shall be judged by him, after which they shall <i>reign with him</i>; but it is never said in Scripture that they shall <i>judge with him</i>.</p>
<p>2. It would be absurd to suppose that <i>thrones</i> should be erected for the purpose of saints sitting on them to give their <i>approbation</i> in the condemnation of the wicked; of what use can such an approbation be? is it necessary to the validity of Christ's decision? and will not even the damned themselves, without this, acknowledge the justice of their doom? I therefore think with Dr. Lightfoot, that these words of the apostle refer to the prediction of Daniel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:18">Daniel 7:18</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="da+7:27">Daniel 7:27</span>, and such like prophecies, where the <i>kingdoms of the earth</i> are promised to <i>the saints of the</i> <i>Most High</i>; that is, that a time shall come when Christianity shall so far prevail that the civil government of the world shall be administered by <i>Christians</i>, which, at that time, was administered by <i>heathens</i>. And this is even now true of all those parts of the earth which may be considered of the greatest political consequence. They profess Christianity, and the kings and other governors are <i>Christians</i> in this general sense of the term.</p>
