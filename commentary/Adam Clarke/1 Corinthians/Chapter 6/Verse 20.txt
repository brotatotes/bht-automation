<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>. <i><b>Ye are bought with a price</b></i> — As the <i>slave</i> who is purchased by his master for a sum of money is the sole property of that master, so ye, being bought with the price of the blood of Christ, are not <i>your own</i>, you are his <i>property</i>. As the slave is bound to use all his skill and diligence for the emolument of his master, so you should employ body, soul, and spirit in the service of your Lord; promoting, by every means in your power, the honour and glory of your God, whom you must also consider as your <i>Lord</i> and <i>Master</i>.</p>
<p>There are strange discordances in MSS., <i>versions</i>, and <i>fathers</i>, on the conclusion of this verse; and the clauses και εν τῳ πνευματι ὑμων, ἁτινα εστι του Θεου, <i>and in your spirit, which is</i> <i>God's</i>, is wanting in ABC*D*EFG, some others, <i>Coptic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, and in several of the primitive <i>fathers</i>. Almost every critic of note considers them to be spurious. Whether retained or expunged the sense is the same. Instead of <i>price</i> simply, the Vulgate and some of the Latin fathers, read, <i>pretio magno</i>, with a <i>great</i> price; and instead of <i>glorify</i>, simply, they read <i>glorificate et portate</i>, glorify and <i>carry</i> God in your bodies. These readings appear to be glosses intended to explain the text. Litigious Christians, who will have recourse to law for every little difference, as well as the impure, may read this chapter either to their conviction or confusion.</p>
