<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span>. <i><b>Know ye not that we shall judge angels?</b></i> â€” Dr. Lightfoot observes that "the apostle does not say here, as he said before, the <i>saints</i> shall judge the angels, but WE shall judge them. By <i>angels</i>, all confess that <i>demons</i> are intended; but certainly all <i>saints</i>, according to the latitude with which that word is understood, i.e. all who profess Christianity, shall not judge angels. Nor is this judging of angels to be understood of the <i>last day</i>; but the apostle speaks of the ministers of the Gospel, himself and others, who, by the preaching of the Gospel, through the power of Christ, should spoil the devils of their oracles and their idols, should deprive them of their worship, should drive them out of their seats, and strip them of their dominion. Thus would God subdue the whole world under the Christian power, so that Christian <i>magistrates</i> should judge men, and Christian <i>ministers</i> judge <i>devils</i>."</p>
