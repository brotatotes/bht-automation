<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:6">1 Corinthians 6:6</span>. <i><b>Brother goeth to law with brother</b></i> â€” One Christian sues another at law! This is almost as great a scandal as can exist in a Christian society. Those in a religious community who <i>will</i> not submit to a proper arbitration, made by persons among themselves, should be expelled from the Church of God.</p>
