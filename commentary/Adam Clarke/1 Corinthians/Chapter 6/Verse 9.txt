<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:9">1 Corinthians 6:9</span>. <i><b>The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom</b></i> — The unrighteous, αδικοι, those who act <i>contrary</i> to <i>right</i>, cannot <i>inherit</i>, for the inheritance is by <i>right</i>. He who is not a <i>child</i> <i>of God</i> has no <i>right</i> to the family inheritance, for that inheritance is for the <i>children</i>. If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>. There are here <i>ten</i> classes of transgressors which the apostle excludes from the kingdom of God; and any man who is guilty of any one of the evils mentioned above is thereby excluded from this kingdom, whether it imply the <i>Church of Christ</i> here below, or the <i>state of glory</i> hereafter.</p>
<p>Several of the evils here enumerated will not bear to be particularly explained; they are, however, sufficiently plain of themselves, and show us what abominations were commonly practised among the Corinthians.</p>
