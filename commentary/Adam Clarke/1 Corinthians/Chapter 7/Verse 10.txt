<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:10">1 Corinthians 7:10</span>. <i><b>I command, yet not I, but the Lord</b></i> â€” I do not give my own private opinion or judgment in this case; for the Lord Jesus commands that man shall not put asunder them whom God hath joined, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:6">Matthew 19:6</span>. And God has said the same, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span>. The following extracts will prove that the law among the Jews was very loose relative to the firmness of the marriage bond:-</p>
<p>A woman might put away or depart from her husband by giving this simple reason to the elders, who would give the following certificate. "In ____ day of ____ week, of ____ year, A., daughter of B., put away before us and said: My mother, or my brethren, deceived me, and wedded me or betrothed me, when I was a very young maid, to C., son of D.; but I now reveal my mind before you, that I will not have him."</p>
<p>Sometimes they parted with mutual consent, and this also was considered legal, as was also the marriage of the separated parties to others. Witness the following story: "A good man had a good wife; but because they had no children, they mutually put away each other. The good man married a bad (a heathen) wife, and she made him bad (a heathen;) the good woman married a bad (a heathen) husband, and she made him good."</p>
<p>Divorces were easily obtained among them, and they considered them the dissolving of the marriage bond; and, in consequence of these, the parties might remarry with others. This was contrary to the original institution of marriage, and is opposed both by our Lord and the apostle.</p>
