Verse 1 Corinthians 7:11. But, and if she depart — He puts the case as probable, because it was frequent, but lays it under restrictions.Let her remain unmarried — She departs at her own peril; but she must not marry another: she must either continue unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband.And let not the husband put away his wife. — Divorces cannot be allowed but in the case of fornication: an act of this kind dissolves the marriage vow; but nothing else can. It is a fact that, among the Jews, the wife had just as much right to put away her husband as the husband had to put away his wife. As divorces were granted, it was right that each should have an equal power; for this served as a mutual check.
