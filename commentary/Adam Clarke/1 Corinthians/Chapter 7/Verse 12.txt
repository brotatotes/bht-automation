Verse 1 Corinthians 7:12. But to the rest speak I, not the Lord — As if he had said: For what I have already spoken I have the testimony of the Lord by Moses, and of my own Lord and Master, Christ; but for the directions which I am now about to give there is no written testimony, and I deliver them now for the first time.
