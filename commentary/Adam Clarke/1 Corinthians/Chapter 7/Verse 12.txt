<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:12">1 Corinthians 7:12</span>. <i><b>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord</b></i> — As if he had said: For what I have already spoken I have the testimony of the Lord by Moses, and of my own Lord and Master, Christ; but for the directions which I am now about to give there is no <i>written</i> <i>testimony</i>, and I deliver them now for the first time. These words do not intimate that the apostle was not now under the influences of the Divine Spirit; but, that there was nothing in the sacred writings which bore directly on this point.</p>
<p><i><b>If any brother</b></i> — A Christian man, <i>have a wife that believeth</i> <i>not</i>, i.e. who is a heathen, not yet converted to the Christian <i>faith, and she be pleased to dwell with him</i>, notwithstanding his turning Christian <i>since</i> their marriage, <i>let him not put her away</i> because she still continues in her heathen superstition.</p>
