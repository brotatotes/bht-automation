<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:14">1 Corinthians 7:14</span>. <i><b>The unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife</b></i> — Or rather, is to be <i>reputed</i> as sanctified on account of his wife; she being a <i>Christian</i> woman, and he, though a <i>heathen</i>, being by marriage <i>one flesh</i> with her: her sanctity, as far as it refers to outward things, may be considered as imputed to him so as to render their connection not <i>unlawful</i>. The case is the same when the wife is a <i>heathen</i> and the husband a <i>Christian</i>. The word sanctification here is to be applied much more to the <i>Christian</i> state than to any moral change in the persons; for αγιοι, <i>saints</i>, is a common term for Christians-those who were baptized into the faith of Christ; and as its corresponding term קדושים <i>kedoshim</i> signified all the Jews who were in the covenant of God by circumcision, the <i>heathens</i> in question were considered to be in this holy state by means of their connection with those who were by their Christian profession <i>saints</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Else were your children unclean</b></i> — If this kind of relative sanctification were not allowed, the children of these persons could not be received into the Christian Church, nor enjoy any rights, or privileges as <i>Christians</i>; but the Church of God never scrupled to admit such children as members, just as well as she did those who had sprung from parents both of whom were Christians.</p>
<p>The Jews considered a child as born <i>out of holiness</i> whose parents were not proselytes at the time of the birth, though afterwards they became proselytes. On the other hand, they considered the children of heathens born <i>in holiness</i>, provided the parents became proselytes <i>before</i> the birth. All the children of the heathens were reputed <i>unclean</i> by the Jews; and all their own children <i>holy</i>.-See Dr. Lightfoot. This shows clearly what the apostle's meaning is.</p>
<p>If we consider the apostle as speaking of the children of <i>heathens</i>, we shall get a remarkable comment on this passage from <i>Tertullian</i>, who, in his treatise <i>De Carne Christi</i>, chaps. 37, 39, gives us a melancholy account of the height to which superstition and idolatry had arrived in his time among the Romans. "A child," says he, "from its very conception, was dedicated to the idols and demons they worshipped. While pregnant, the mother had her body swathed round with bandages, prepared with <i>idolatrous rites</i>. The embryo they conceived to be under the inspection of the goddess <i>Alemona</i>, who nourished it in the womb. <i>Nona</i> and <i>Decima</i> took care that it should be born in the <i>ninth</i> or <i>tenth</i> month. <i>Partula</i> adjusted every thing relative to the <i>labour</i>; and <i>Lucina</i> ushered it into the <i>light</i>. During the week preceding the birth a table was spread for <i>Juno</i>; and on the last day certain persons were called together to mark the <i>moment</i> on which the <i>Parcae</i>, or <i>Fates</i>, had fixed its <i>destiny</i>. The first step the child set on the earth was consecrated to the goddess <i>Statina</i>; and, finally, some of the hair was cut off, or the whole head shaven, and the hair offered to some god or goddess through some public or private motive of devotion." He adds that "no child among the heathens was born in a state of purity; and it is not to be wondered at," says he, "that demons possess them from their youth, seeing they were thus early dedicated to their service." In reference to this, he thinks, St. Paul speaks in the verse before us: <i>The unbelieving</i> <i>husband is sanctified by the wife-else were your children unclean;</i> <i>but now are they holy</i>; i.e. "As the parents were converted to the Christian faith, the child comes into the world without these impure and unhallowed rites; and is from its infancy consecrated to the true God."</p>
