<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:15">1 Corinthians 7:15</span>. <i><b>But if the unbelieving, depart</b></i> — Whether husband or wife: if such <i>obstinately</i> depart and utterly refuse all cohabitation, <i>a brother or a sister</i>-a Christian man or woman, <i>is</i> <i>not under bondage</i> to any particular laws, so as to be prevented from <i>remarrying</i>. Such, probably, the law stood then; but it is not so <i>now</i>; for the marriage can only be dissolved by <i>death</i>, or by the <i>ecclesiastical court</i>. Even <i>fornication</i> or <i>adultery</i> does not dissolve the marriage contract; nor will the obstinate <i>separation</i> of any of the parties, however long continued, give the party abandoned authority to remarry. If the person have been beyond sea, and not heard of for seven years, it is presumed he may be dead; and marriage has been connived at in such cases. If there be no person to <i>complain</i>, it may be presumed that there is none <i>injured</i>. But I have known instances where even a marriage after <i>seven</i> years' absence has been very unfortunate; the husband returning at the end of ten or twelve years, and to his utter distress finding his wife married to another man, and with issue of that marriage! There can be no safety in this case, unless there be absolute certainty of the <i>death</i> of the party in question.</p>
<p><i><b>God hath called us to peace.</b></i> — The refractory and disagreeing party should not be <i>compelled</i> to fulfil such matrimonial engagements as would produce continual <i>jarring</i> and <i>discord</i>. At the same time each should take care that he give no cause for disagreements and separations, for the author of the Christian religion is the author of <i>peace</i>, and has <i>called</i> us to it.</p>
