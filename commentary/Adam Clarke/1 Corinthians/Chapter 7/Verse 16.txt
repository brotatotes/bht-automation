<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:16">1 Corinthians 7:16</span>. <i><b>For what knowest thou, O wife</b></i> â€” You that are <i>Christians</i>, and who have <i>heathen</i> partners, do not give them up because they are such, for you may become the means of saving them unto eternal life. Bear your cross, and look up to God, and he may give your unbelieving husband or wife to your prayers.</p>
