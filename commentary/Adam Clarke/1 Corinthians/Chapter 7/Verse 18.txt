<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Is any man called being circumcised?</b></i> — Is any man who was formerly a <i>Jew</i> converted to Christianity?</p>
<p><i><b>Let him not become circumcised.</b></i> — Let him not endeavour to abolish the sign of the old covenant, which he bears in his flesh. The Greek words μη επισπασθω, let him not <i>draw over</i>, are evidently an elliptical expression: the word την ακροβυστιαν, <i>the fore-skin</i>, being understood; which, indeed, is added by the <i>Armenian</i> and the <i>Itala</i>, and several of the Latin <i>fathers</i>. It is a fact that it was possible by the assistance of <i>art</i> to do this; and <i>Celsus</i> himself prescribes the mode, <i>De Medic</i>. vii. 25. By frequent stretching, the circumcised skin could be again <i>so drawn over</i>, as to prevent the ancient sign of circumcision from appearing. Some in their zeal against Judaism endeavoured to abolish this sign of it in their flesh: it is most evidently against this that the apostle speaks. Many false Jews made use of this practice, that they might pass through heathen countries unobserved; otherwise, in frequenting the baths they would have been detected.</p>
<p><i><b>Let him not be circumcised.</b></i> — Let no man who, being a Gentile, has been converted to the Christian faith, submit to circumcision as something necessary to his salvation.</p>
