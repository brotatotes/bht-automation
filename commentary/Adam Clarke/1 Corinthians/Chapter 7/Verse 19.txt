<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Circumcision is nothing</b></i> â€” Circumcision itself, though commanded of God, is nothing <i>of itself</i>, it being only a sign of the justification which should be afterwards received by faith. At present, neither it nor its opposite either <i>hinders</i> or <i>furthers</i> the work of grace; and <i>keeping the commandments of God</i>, from his love shed abroad in a believing heart, is the sum and substance of religion.</p>
