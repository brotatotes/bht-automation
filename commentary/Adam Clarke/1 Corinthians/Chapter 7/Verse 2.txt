<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:2">1 Corinthians 7:2</span>. <i><b>To avoid fornication</b></i> — Δια τας πορνειας· verto, <i>propter exercendam libidinem</i>, vel <i>ut libidinem licite exercere</i> <i>liceat</i>. Probo hanc notionem ex Hebraeo, ibi זנה, <i>zanah</i>, est <i>libidinem exercere</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+4:10">Hosea 4:10</span>: <i>For they shall eat and not have enough; they shall commit</i> <i>whoredom</i>, תזנו, libidinem exercebunt, and shall not increase. Here the prophet certainly does not speak of <i>whoredom</i> in our sense of the word; for the persons he mentions expected to <i>have</i> <i>children</i>, which cannot be said of those who are addicted to improper connections: the prophet speaks concerning <i>married</i> persons, whom he threatens with a privation of children, notwithstanding <i>libidinem exercebant</i> in order to have numerous families. See <i>Schoettgen</i>. The following verse shows that this is the apostle's meaning.</p>
<p><i><b>Let every man have his own wife</b></i> — Let every man have <i>one</i> woman, <i>his own</i>; and every woman <i>one</i> man, <i>her own</i>. Here, <i>plurality</i> of wives and husbands is most strictly forbidden; and they are commanded to marry for the purpose of procreating children.</p>
<p>In the Jewish constitutions there are some things not only curious, but useful, respecting marriage. "There are <i>four</i> causes which induce men to marry:</p>
<p>1. <i>Impure desire</i>;</p>
<p>2. To get <i>riches</i>;</p>
<p>3. To become <i>honourable</i>;</p>
<p>4. For the <i>glory of God</i>.</p>
<p>Those who marry through the first motive beget <i>wicked</i> and <i>rebellious</i> children. Those who marry for the sake of riches have the <i>curse</i> of <i>leaving</i> <i>them to others</i>. Those who marry for the sake of <i>aggrandizing</i> their family, their families shall be <i>diminished</i>. Those who marry to promote the <i>glory of God</i>, their children shall be <i>holy</i>, and by them shall the true Church be increased."</p>
