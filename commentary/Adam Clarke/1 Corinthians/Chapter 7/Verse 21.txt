<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Art thou called being a servant?</b></i> — δουλος εκληθης, Art thou converted to Christ while thou art a <i>slave</i>-the property of another person, and bought with his money? <i>care not for it</i>-this will not injure thy Christian condition, but if thou canst obtain thy liberty-<i>use it rather</i>-prefer this state for the sake of <i>freedom</i>, and the temporal advantages connected with it.</p>
