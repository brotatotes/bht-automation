<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Ye are bought with a price</b></i> â€” As truly as your bodies have become the property of your masters, in consequence of his paying down a price for you; so sure you are now the Lord's property, in consequence of your being purchased by the blood of Christ.</p>
<p>Some render this verse interrogatively: <i>Are ye bought with a</i> <i>price</i> from your slavery? <i>Do not</i> again <i>become slaves of men</i>. Never <i>sell yourselves</i>; prefer and retain your liberty now that ye have acquired it.</p>
<p>In these verses the apostle shows that the Christian religion does not abolish our <i>civil</i> connections; in reference to <i>them</i>, where it finds us, there it leaves us. In whatever relation we stood before our embracing Christianity, there we stand still; our secular condition being no farther changed than as it may be affected by the amelioration of our moral character. But <i>slavery</i>, and all buying and selling of the bodies and souls of men, no matter what colour or complexion, is a high offence against the holy and just God, and a gross and unprincipled attack on the liberty and rights of our fellow creatures.</p>
