<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Let every man - abide with God.</b></i> â€” Let him live to God in whatsoever station he is placed by Providence. If he be a slave, God will be with him even in his <i>slavery</i>, if he be faithful to the grace which he has received. It is very likely that some of the slaves at Corinth, who had been converted to Christianity, had been led to think that their Christian privileges absolved them from the necessity of continuing slaves; or, at least, brought them on a level with their Christian masters. A spirit of this kind might have soon led to confusion and insubordination, and brought scandals into the Church. It was therefore a very proper subject for the apostle to interfere in; and to his authority, the persons concerned would doubtless respectfully bow.</p>
