Verse 25. Now concerning virgins — This was another subject on which the Church at Corinth had asked the advice of the apostle. The word παρθενος, virgin, we take to signify a pure, unmarried young woman; but it is evident that the word in this place means young unmarried persons of either sex, as appears from 1 Corinthians 7:26; 1 Corinthians 7:27; 1 Corinthians 7:32-34, and from Revelation 14:4. The word παρθενος, virgin, is frequently applied to men as well as to women. See Suidas, under the word αβελ. ουτοςπαρθενοςκαι δικαιοςυπηρχε, He (Abel) was a virgin, and a righteous man. In 1 Corinthians 7:36 the word is supposed to mean the state of virginity or celibacy, and very probable reasons are assigned for it; and it is evident that persons of either sex in a state of celibacy are the persons intended.I have no commandment of the Lord — There is nothing in the sacred writings that directly touches this point.Yet I give my judgment — As every way equal to such commandments had there been any, seeing I have received the teaching of his own Spirit, and have obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful to this heavenly gift, so that it abides with me to lead me into all truth. In this way I think the apostle's words may be safely understood.
