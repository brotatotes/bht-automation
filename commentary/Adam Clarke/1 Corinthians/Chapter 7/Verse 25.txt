<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Now concerning virgins</b></i> — This was another subject on which the Church at Corinth had asked the advice of the apostle. The word παρθενος, <i>virgin</i>, we take to signify a <i>pure, unmarried</i> <i>young woman</i>; but it is evident that the word in this place means young unmarried persons of either sex, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:27">1 Corinthians 7:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:32-34">1 Corinthians 7:32-34</span>, and from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span>. The word παρθενος, <i>virgin</i>, is frequently applied to <i>men</i> as well as to women. See <i>Suidas</i>, under the word αβελ. ουτοςπαρθενοςκαι δικαιοςυπηρχε, <i>He</i> (Abel) <i>was a virgin, and a righteous man</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:36">1 Corinthians 7:36</span> the word is supposed to mean the <i>state</i> of <i>virginity</i> or <i>celibacy</i>, and very probable reasons are assigned for it; and it is evident that persons of either sex in a state of celibacy are the persons intended.</p>
<p><i><b>I have no commandment of the Lord</b></i> — There is nothing in the sacred writings that directly touches this point.</p>
<p><i><b>Yet I give my judgment</b></i> — As every way equal to such commandments had there been any, seeing I have received the teaching of his own Spirit, and have obtained <i>mercy of the Lord to</i> <i>be faithful</i> to this heavenly gift, so that it abides with me to lead me into all truth. In this way I think the apostle's words may be safely understood.</p>
