<p>Verse 26. <i><b>This is good for the present distress</b></i> — There was no period in the heathen times when the Church was not under persecutions and afflictions; on some occasions these were more oppressive than at others.</p>
<p>The word αναγκη signifies, <i>necessity, distress, tribulation</i>, and <i>calamity</i>; as it does in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:23">Luke 21:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4">2 Corinthians 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>. In such times, when the people of God had no certain dwelling-place, when they were lying at the mercy of their enemies without any protection from the state-the <i>state</i> itself often among the <i>persecutors</i>-he who had a <i>family</i> to care for, would find himself in very embarrassed circumstances, as it would be much more easy to provide for his <i>personal</i> safety than to have the care of a wife and children. On this account it was much better for unmarried persons to continue for the <i>present</i> in their celibacy.</p>
