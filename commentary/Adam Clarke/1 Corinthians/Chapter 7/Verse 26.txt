Verse 26. This is good for the present distress — There was no period in the heathen times when the Church was not under persecutions and afflictions; on some occasions these were more oppressive than at others.The word αναγκη signifies, necessity, distress, tribulation, and calamity; as it does in Luke 21:23; 2 Corinthians 6:4; 2 Corinthians 12:10. In such times, when the people of God had no certain dwelling-place, when they were lying at the mercy of their enemies without any protection from the state-the state itself often among the persecutors-he who had a family to care for, would find himself in very embarrassed circumstances, as it would be much more easy to provide for his personal safety than to have the care of a wife and children. On this account it was much better for unmarried persons to continue for the present in their celibacy.
