<p>Verse 27. <i><b>Art thou bound unto a wife?</b></i> — i e. <i>Married</i>; for the marriage contract was considered in the light of a <i>bond</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Seek not to be loosed.</b></i> — Neither regret your circumstances, notwithstanding the present distress, nor seek on this account for a dissolution of the marriage contract. But if thou art under no matrimonial engagements, do not for the present enter into any.</p>
