<p>Verse 28. <i><b>But, and if thou marry</b></i> — As there is no law against this, even in the <i>present distress</i>, thou hast not sinned, because there is no law against this; and it is only on account of prudential reasons that I give this advice.</p>
<p><i><b>And if a virgin marry</b></i> — Both the man and the woman have equal privileges in this case; either of them may marry without sin. It is probable, as there were many sects and parties in Corinth, that there were among them those who <i>forbade to marry</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>, and who might have maintained other <i>doctrines of devils</i> besides. These persons, or such doctrines, the apostle has in view when he says, <i>They may marry and yet not sin</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Trouble in the flesh</b></i> — From the simple circumstance of the incumbrance of a family while under persecution; because of the difficulty of providing for its comfort and safety while flying before the face of persecution.</p>
<p><i><b>But I spare you.</b></i> — The evil is coming; but I will not press upon you the observance of a prudential caution, which you might deem too heavy a cross.</p>
