<p>Verse 29. <i><b>The time is short</b></i> — These persecutions and distresses are at the door, and life itself will soon be run out. Even <i>then</i> Nero was plotting those grievous persecutions with which he not only afflicted, but devastated the Church of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>They that have wives</b></i> — Let none begin to think of any comfortable settlement for his family, let him sit loose to all earthly concerns, and stand ready prepared to escape for his life, or meet death, as the providence of God may permit. The husband will be dragged from the side of his wife to appear before the magistrates, and be required either to abjure Christ or die. </p>
