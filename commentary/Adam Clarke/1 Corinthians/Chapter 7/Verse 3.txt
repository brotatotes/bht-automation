<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:3">1 Corinthians 7:3</span>. <i><b>Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence</b></i> — την οφειλομενην ευνοιαν. Though our version is no translation of the original, yet few persons are at a loss for the meaning, and the context is sufficiently plain. Some have rendered the words, not unaptly, the <i>matrimonial debt</i>, or <i>conjugal duty</i>-that which a wife owes to her husband, and the husband to his wife; and which they must take care <i>mutually</i> to render, else alienation of affection will be the infallible consequence, and this in numberless instances has led to adulterous connections. In such cases the <i>wife</i> has to blame herself for the infidelity of her husband, and the <i>husband</i> for that of his wife. What miserable work has been made in the peace of families by a wife or a husband pretending to be wiser than the apostle, and too holy and spiritual to keep the commandments of God!</p>
