<p>Verse 31. <i><b>And they that use this world</b></i> — Let them who have earthly property or employments discharge conscientiously their duties, from a conviction of the instability of earthly things. Make a <i>right use</i> of every thing, and <i>pervert</i> nothing from its <i>use.</i> To <i>use</i> a thing is to employ it properly in order to accomplish the end to which it refers. To <i>abuse</i> a thing signifies to <i>pervert</i> it <i>from</i> that <i>use</i>. Pass through things <i>temporal</i>, so as not to lose those which are eternal.</p>
<p><i><b>For the fashion of this world</b></i> — Το σχημα του κοσμον τουτου signifies properly the <i>present state</i> or constitution of things; the <i>frame of the world</i>, that is, the <i>world</i> itself. But often the term κοσμος, <i>world</i>, is taken to signify the <i>Jewish state</i> and <i>polity</i>; the destruction of this was then at hand, and this the Holy Spirit might then signify to the apostle.</p>
