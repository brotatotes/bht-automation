<p>Verse 33. <i><b>But he that is married</b></i> â€” He has a <i>family</i> to provide for, and his wife to please, as well as to fulfil his duty to God, and attend to the concerns of his own soul. The <i>single</i> man has nothing to attend to but what concerns his own salvation: the <i>married man</i> has all this to attend to, and besides to provide for his wife and family, and take care of their eternal interests also. The <i>single man</i> has very little trouble comparatively; the <i>married man</i> has a great deal. The <i>single man</i> is an <i>atom</i> in society; the <i>married man</i> is a <i>small community</i> in himself. The <i>former</i> is the <i>centre</i> of his <i>own existence</i>, and lives for <i>himself</i> alone; the <i>latter</i> is <i>diffused abroad</i>, makes a much more important part of the body social, and provides both for its support and continuance. The <i>single man</i> lives for and does good to <i>himself</i> only; the <i>married</i> man lives both for <i>himself</i> and the <i>public</i>. Both the <i>state</i> and the <i>Church</i> of Christ are dependent on the <i>married</i> man, as from him under God the one has <i>subjects</i>, the other <i>members</i>; while the <i>single man</i> is but an individual in either, and by and by will cease from both, and having no <i>posterity is lost to the public for ever</i>. The <i>married man</i>, therefore, far from being in a state of <i>inferiority</i> to the <i>single</i> <i>man</i>, is <i>beyond</i> him out of the limits of comparison. He can do all the good the other can do, though perhaps sometimes in a different way; and he can do ten thousand goods that the other cannot possibly do. And therefore both himself and his <i>state</i> are to be preferred infinitely before those of the other. Nor could the apostle have meant any thing less; only for the <i>present distress</i> he gave his opinion that it was best for those who were <i>single</i> to continue <i>so</i>. And who does not see the propriety of the advice?</p>
