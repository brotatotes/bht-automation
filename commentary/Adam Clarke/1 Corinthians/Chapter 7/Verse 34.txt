<p>Verse 34. <i><b>There is a difference also between a wife and a</b></i><b> </b><i><b>virgin.</b></i> â€” That is: There is this difference between a <i>married</i> and an <i>unmarried</i> woman. <i>The unmarried careth</i> (only) <i>for the things of</i> <i>the Lord</i>, having no domestic duties to perform. <i>That she may be</i> <i>holy</i>-separated to Divine employments, both in <i>body and spirit</i>. Whereas <i>she that is married careth</i> (also) <i>for the things of the</i> <i>world, how she may please her husband</i>, having many domestic duties to fulfil, her husband being obliged to leave to her the care of the family, and all other domestic concerns.</p>
<p>On this verse there is a profusion of various readings in MSS., <i>versions</i>, and <i>fathers</i>, for which I must refer to <i>Griesbach</i>, as it would be impossible to introduce them here so as to make them look like sense.</p>
