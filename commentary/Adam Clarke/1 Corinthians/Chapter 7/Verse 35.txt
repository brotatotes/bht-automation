<p>Verse 35. <i><b>This I speak for your own profit</b></i> — The advices belong to yourselves <i>alone</i>, because of the peculiar circumstances in which you are placed. Nothing spoken here was ever designed to be of <i>general</i> application; it concerned the Church at Corinth alone, or Churches in similar circumstances.</p>
<p><i><b>Not that I may cast a snare upon you</b></i> — Ουχ ἱνα βροχον ὑμιν επιβαλω - Here is a manifest allusion to the <i>Retiarius</i> among the <i>Romans</i>, who carried a small <i>casting net</i>, which he endeavoured to throw over the head of his adversary and thus entangle him. Or to a similar custom among the <i>Persians</i>, who made use of a noose called the [Arabic] <i>camand</i>; which they employed in the same way. One of these lies before me; it is a strong silken cord, one end of which is a loop to be held in the hand, and the rest is in the form of a <i>common snare</i> or <i>noose</i>, which, catching hold of any thing, <i>tightens</i> in proportion as it is pulled by the hand that holds the loop.</p>
<p>The apostle, therefore, intimates that what he says was not intended absolutely to <i>bind</i> them, but to show them the propriety of following an advice which in the present case would be helpful to them in their religious connections, that they might <i>attend</i> <i>upon the Lord without distraction</i>, which they could not do in times of persecution, when, in addition to their own personal safety, they had a wife and children to care for.</p>
<p><i><b>For that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord</b></i> <i>without distraction,</i>] The original αλλα προς το ευσχημον και ευπροσεδρον τῳ Κυριῳ απερισπαστως, of which our version is only a <i>paraphrase</i>, is thus translated by Bishop Pearson: <i>But for the sake</i> <i>of decency, and of attending more easily upon the Lord without</i> <i>distraction</i>. This is much more literal than ours.</p>
