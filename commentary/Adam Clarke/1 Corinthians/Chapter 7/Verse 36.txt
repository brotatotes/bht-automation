<p>Verse 36. <i><b>Uncomely towards his virgin</b></i> — Different meanings have been assigned to this verse; I shall mention <i>three</i> of the principal.</p>
<p>1. "In those early times, both among the Hebrews and Christians, the <i>daughters</i> were wholly in the power of the <i>father</i>, so that he might give or not give them in marriage as he chose; and might bind them to perpetual celibacy if he thought proper; and to this case the apostle alludes. If the father had devoted his daughter to perpetual virginity, and he afterwards found that she had fixed her affections upon a person whom she was strongly inclined to marry, and was now <i>getting past the prime of life</i>; he, seeing from his daughter's circumstances that it would be <i>wrong</i> to <i>force</i> her to continue in her state of celibacy; though he had determined before to keep her single, yet he might in this case alter his purpose without sin, and let her and her suitor marry."</p>
<p>2. "The whole verse and its context speaks of young women dedicated to the service of God, who were called παρθενοι, <i>virgins</i>, in the primitive Church. And a case is put here, 'that circumstances might occur to render the breach of even a <i>vow</i> of this kind <i>necessary</i>, and so no sin be committed.'"</p>
<p>3. "The apostle by παρθενος, does not mean a <i>virgin</i>, but the <i>state</i> of <i>virginity</i> or <i>celibacy</i>, whether in <i>man</i> or <i>woman</i>." Both Mr. Locke and Dr. Whitby are of this opinion, and the <i>latter</i> reasons on it thus:-</p>
<p>It is generally supposed that these three verses relate to virgins under the power of parents and guardians and the usual inference is, that children are to be disposed of in marriage by the parents, guardians, c. Now this may be true, but it has no foundation in the text, for τηρειν την ἑαυτου παρθενον is not to keep his <i>daughter's</i>, but his own <i>virginity</i>, or rather his <i>purpose</i> of <i>virginity</i> for, as <i>Phavorinus</i> says, <i>He is called a virgin who</i> <i>freely gives himself up to the Lord, renouncing matrimony, and</i> <i>preferring a life spent in continency</i>. And that this must be the true import of these words appears from this consideration, that this depends upon the purpose of his own heart, and the power he has over his <i>own will</i>, and the <i>no necessity</i> arising from himself to change this purpose. Whereas the keeping a daughter unmarried depends not on these <i>conditions</i> on her <i>father's</i> part but on her <i>own</i>; for, let her have <i>a necessity</i>, and surely the apostle would not advise the father to keep her a virgin, because <i>he had</i> <i>determined so to do</i>; nor could there be any doubt whether the father <i>had power over his own will</i> or not, when <i>no necessity</i> lay upon <i>him</i> to betroth his virgin. The Greek runs to this sense: <i>if</i> <i>he had stood already firm in his heart, finding no necessity</i>, viz. to change his purpose; and hath <i>power over his own will</i>, not to marry; finding himself able to persist in the resolution he had made to <i>keep his virginity</i>, he <i>does well</i> to continue a virgin: and then the phrase, <i>if any man think he behaves himself unseemly</i> <i>towards his virgin, if it be over-aged</i>, and thinks he ought rather to join in marriage, refers to the opinions both of <i>Jews</i> and <i>Gentiles</i> that <i>all ought to marry</i>. The Jews say that the time of marriage is from 16 or 17 to 20; while some of the Gentiles specify from 30 to 35. <i>If any think thus</i>, says the apostle, <i>let</i> <i>them do what they will, they sin not: let them marry</i>. And then he concludes with those words applied to both cases: <i>so then, both he</i> <i>that marries doeth well, and he that marries not, doeth better</i>.</p>
<p>This last opinion seems to be the true sense of the apostle.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to make a few general observations on these verses, summing up what has been said.</p>
<p>1. παρθενος here should be considered as implying not a <i>virgin</i>, but the <i>state</i> of <i>virginity</i> or <i>celibacy</i>.</p>
<p>2. υπερακμος, <i>over-aged</i>, must refer to the passing of that time in which both the laws and customs of Jews and Gentiles required men to marry. See above, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:6">1 Corinthians 7:6</span>.</p>
<p>3. και ουτως οφειλει γινεσθαι, <i>And need so require</i>; or, if <i>there</i> <i>appear to be a necessity</i>; is to be understood of any particular change in his circumstances or in his feelings; or, that he finds, from the <i>law</i> and <i>custom</i> in the case, that it is a <i>scandal</i> for him not to marry; then let him <i>do what he wills</i> or <i>purposes</i>.</p>
<p>4. Instead of γαμειτωσαν, <i>let</i> THEM <i>marry</i>, I think γαμειτω, <i>let</i> HIM <i>marry</i>, is the true reading, and agrees best with the context. This reading is supported by D*EFG, <i>Syriac</i>, in the <i>Arabic, Slavonic</i>, one of the <i>Itala</i>, and <i>St. Augustine</i>. <i>Si</i> <i>nubat, if he marry</i>, is the reading of the <i>Vulgate</i>, several copies of the <i>Itala, Ambrose, Jerome, Ambrosiaster, Sedulius</i>, and <i>Bede</i>. This reading is nearly of the same import with the other: <i>Let him</i> <i>do what he willeth, he sinneth not, let him marry</i>; or, <i>he sinneth</i> <i>not if he marry</i>.</p>
<p>5. The whole of the 37th verse relates to the <i>purpose</i> that the man has formed; and the <i>strength</i> that he has to keep his purpose of perpetual celibacy, being under no <i>necessity</i> to change that purpose.</p>
<p>6. Instead of ο εκγαμιζων, <i>he who giveth</i> her <i>in marriage</i>, I purpose to read ο γαμιζων, <i>he who marrieth</i>, which is the reading of the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, the <i>Codex Vaticanus</i>, No. 1209, and of some others: with <i>Clement, Methodius</i>, and <i>Basil</i>. την εαυτου παρθενον, <i>his own virgin</i>, is added after the above, by several very ancient and reputable MSS, as also by the <i>Syriac, Armenian,</i> <i>Vulgate, AEthiopic, Clement, Basil, Optatus</i>, and others; but it seems so much like a <i>gloss</i>, that Griesbach has not made it even a candidate for a place in the text. <i>He then who marrieth</i>, though previously intending <i>perpetual virginity, doeth well</i>; as this is agreeable to laws both Divine and human: and he <i>who marrieth not,</i> <i>doeth better</i>, because of the <i>present distress</i>.
