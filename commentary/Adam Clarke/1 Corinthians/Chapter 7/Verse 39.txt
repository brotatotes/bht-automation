<p>Verse 39. <i><b>The wife is bound by the law</b></i> â€” This seems to be spoken in answer to some other question of the Corinthians to this effect: "May a woman <i>remarry</i> whose husband is dead, or who has abandoned her?" To which he replies, in general, That as long as her husband is living the law binds her to <i>him</i> alone; but, if the husband die, she is free to remarry, <i>but only in the Lord</i>; that is she must not marry a <i>heathen</i> nor an <i>irreligious</i> man; and she should not only marry a genuine Christian, but one of her own religious sentiments; for, in reference to <i>domestic peace</i>, much depends on this.</p>
