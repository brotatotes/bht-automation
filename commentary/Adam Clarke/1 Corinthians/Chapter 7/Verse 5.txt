<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:5">1 Corinthians 7:5</span>. <i><b>Defraud ye not one the other</b></i> — What ye owe thus to each other never refuse paying, unless by mutual consent; and let that be only for a certain <i>time</i>, when prudence dictates the temporary separation, or when some extraordinary spiritual occasion may render it mutually agreeable, in order that ye may <i>fast</i> and <i>pray</i>, and derive the greatest possible benefit from these duties by being enabled to wait on the Lord without distraction.</p>
<p><i><b>That Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</b></i> — It is most evident that the separations <i>permitted</i> by the Apostle, for he <i>enjoins</i> none, are only for a <i>season</i>, on extraordinary occasions; and that the persons may come <i>together again</i>, lest Satan, taking advantage of their matrimonial abstinence, might tempt either party to illicit commerce.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of rules prescribed in such cases by the <i>rabbins</i>, and indeed even by <i>heathen</i> writers; for this was a matter in which common sense could always judge; and under the direction of experience, <i>heathens</i>, as well as those favoured with Divine revelation, could see what was proper in all such cases.</p>
<p><i>Incontinence</i>, εικρασια, <i>want of strength</i> to regulate one's desires or appetites; from α, <i>negative</i>, and κρατος, <i>strength</i>. It is remarkable that the apostle supposes that even this <i>temporary continence</i> might produce <i>incontinence</i>; and universal observation confirms the supposition.</p>
