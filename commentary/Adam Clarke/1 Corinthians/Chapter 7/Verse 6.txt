<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:6">1 Corinthians 7:6</span>. <i><b>I speak this by permission</b></i>, c.] It was a constant custom of the more conscientious rabbins, to make a difference between the things which they enjoined on their <i>own judgment</i>, and those which they built on the authority of the <i>law</i>. Thus Rabbi <i>Tancum</i>: "The washing of hands <i>before</i> meat is <i>in our own power</i> washing <i>after</i> meat is <i>commanded</i>." In relation to this point Dr. Lightfoot produces some examples from the Jewish writers: "The man is commanded concerning begetting and multiplying, but not the woman. And when does the man come under this command? From the age of <i>sixteen</i> or <i>seventeen</i> years; but, if he exceeds <i>twenty</i> years without marrying, behold he violates and renders an affirmative precept vain. The <i>Gemara</i> says: It is forbidden a man to be without a wife; because it is written, <i>It is not good for</i> <i>man to be alone</i>. And whosoever gives not himself to generation and multiplying is all one with a murderer: he is as though he diminished from the image of God, c." We may understand the apostle here as saying that the directions already given were from his <i>own judgment</i>, and not from any Divine inspiration and we may take it for granted that where he does not make this observation he is writing under the immediate afflatus of the Holy Spirit.</p>
