Verse 1 Corinthians 7:7. For I would that all men, c.] He wished that all that were then in the Church were, like him self, unmarried but this was in reference to the necessities of the Church, or what he calls, 1 Corinthians 7:26, the present distress: for it never could be his wish that marriage should cease among men, and that human beings should no longer be propagated upon earth; nor could he wish that the Church of Christ should always be composed of single persons; this would have been equally absurd; but as the Church was then in straits and difficulties, it was much better for its single members not to encumber themselves with domestic embarrassments.Every man hath his proper gift of God â€” Continence is a state that cannot be acquired by human art or industry; a man has it from God, or not at all: and if he have it from God, he has it from him as the author of his nature; for where it does not exist naturally, it never can exist, but either by miraculous interference, which should never be expected, or by chirurgical operation, which is a shocking abomination in the sight of God. Matthew 19:12.
