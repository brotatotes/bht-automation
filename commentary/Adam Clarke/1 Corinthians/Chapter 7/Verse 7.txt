<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:7">1 Corinthians 7:7</span>. <i><b>For I would that all men</b></i>, c.] He wished that all that were then in the Church were, like him self, <i>unmarried</i> but this was in reference to the <i>necessities</i> of the Church, or what he calls, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>, the <i>present distress</i>: for it never could be his wish that marriage should cease among men, and that human beings should no longer be propagated upon earth; nor could he wish that the Church of Christ should always be composed of <i>single persons</i>; this would have been equally absurd; but as the Church was <i>then</i> in <i>straits</i> and <i>difficulties</i>, it was much better for its single members not to encumber themselves with domestic embarrassments.</p>
<p><i><b>Every man hath his proper gift of God</b></i> â€” Continence is a <i>state</i> that cannot be acquired by human art or industry; a man has it from God, or not at all: and if he have it from God, he has it from him as the author of his nature; for where it does not exist <i>naturally</i>, it never can exist, but either by <i>miraculous</i> interference, which should never be expected, or by <i>chirurgical</i> <i>operation</i>, which is a shocking abomination in the sight of God. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:12">Matthew 19:12</span>.</p>
