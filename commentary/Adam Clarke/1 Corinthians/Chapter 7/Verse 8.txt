Verse 1 Corinthians 7:8. The unmarried and widows — It is supposed that the apostle speaks here of men who had been married, in the word αγαμοι, but were now widowers; as he does of women who had been married, in the word χηραι, but were now widows. And when he says ωςκαγω, even as I, he means that he himself was a widower; for several of the ancients rank Paul among the married apostles.
