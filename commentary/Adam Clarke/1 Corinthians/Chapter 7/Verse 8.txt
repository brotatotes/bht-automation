<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:8">1 Corinthians 7:8</span>. <i><b>The unmarried and widows</b></i> — It is supposed that the apostle speaks here of men who <i>had been married</i>, in the word αγαμοι, but were now <i>widowers</i>; as he does of women who had been married, in the word χηραι, but were now <i>widows</i>. And when he says ωςκαγω, <i>even as I</i>, he means that he himself was a <i>widower</i>; for several of the ancients rank Paul among the <i>married</i> apostles.</p>
