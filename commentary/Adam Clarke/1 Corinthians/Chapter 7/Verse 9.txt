<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:9">1 Corinthians 7:9</span>. <i><b>But if they cannot contain</b></i> — If they find it inconvenient and uncomfortable to continue as widowers and widows, let them remarry.</p>
<p><i><b>It is better to marry than to burn.</b></i> — Bishop Pearce translates the original thus: <i>For it is better to marry than to be made</i> <i>uneasy</i>. πυρουσθαι, says he, "signifies primarily <i>to burn</i>; but in a metaphorical sense, to be <i>troubled, vexed</i>, or <i>made uneasy</i>. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:29">2 Corinthians 11:29</span>: <i>Who is offended and I burn not</i>, και ουκ εγω πυρουμαι, <i>and I am not</i> <i>troubled</i>. So in <i>Terence, Uro hominem</i>, is <i>I vex him</i>." It would be well to <i>soften</i> the sense of this word in reference to the subject of which the apostle speaks. He cannot mean <i>burning with</i> <i>lust</i>, no more than Virgil means so when he says, AEn. iv. ver. 68: <i>Uritur infelix Dido</i>, the unfortunate Dido is <i>tormented</i>; and in Eccl. ii. 68: <i>Me tamen urit amor, love torments me</i>. All this may be said with the strictest truth in such cases where the <i>impure</i> <i>fire</i> referred to above has no existence.</p>
<p>A curious story, which certainly casts light on the <i><b>phraseology</b></i> of this place, is related by Dr. Lightfoot, from the tract <i>Kiddushin</i>, fol. 81. "Some captive women were brought to Nehardea, and disposed in the house and the upper room of Rabbi Amram. They took away the ladder [that the women might not get down, but stay there till they were ransomed.] As one of these captives passed by the window, the light of her great beauty shined into the house. Amram [captivated] set up the ladder; and when he was got to the middle of the steps [checked by his conscience] he stopped short, and with a loud voice cried out FIRE! FIRE! <i>in the house of</i> <i>Amram</i>! [This he did that, the neighbours flocking in, he might be <i>obliged</i> to desist from the evil affection which now prevailed in him.] The rabbins ran to him, and [seeing no fire] they said, <i>Thou hast disgraced us</i>. To which he replied: <i>It is better that ye</i> <i>be disgraced in the house of Amram in this world, then that ye be</i> <i>disgraced by me in the world to come</i>. He then adjured that evil affection to go out of him, and it went out as a <i>pillar</i> of FIRE. Amram said: <i>Thou art</i> FIRE, <i>and I am</i> FLESH; <i>yet for all that I have</i> <i>prevailed against thee</i>." From this story much instruction may be derived.</p>
