<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>. <i><b>As touching things offered unto idols</b></i> — This was another subject on which the Corinthians had asked the apostle's advice, and we shall understand the whole of this chapter the better when we consider one fact, viz. That there had long subsisted a controversy between the <i>Karaites</i> and the <i>Traditionites</i>, how far it was lawful to derive any benefit or advantage from things used by the Gentiles. The <i>Karaites</i> were a sect of the Jews who scrupulously held to the <i>letter</i> of the sacred writings, taking this alone for their directory. The <i>Traditionists</i> were those who followed the voice of the <i>elders</i>, interpreting the Divine testimonies by their decisions. From a work of the <i>Karaites</i>, entitled <i>Addereth Eliyahu</i>, Triglandus has extracted the following decisions, which will throw light upon this subject. "It is unlawful to receive any benefit from any kind of heathen worship, or from any thing that has been offered to an idol." - "It is unlawful to buy or sell an idol, and if, by accident, any such thing shall come into thy power, thou shalt derive no emolument from it." - "The animals that are destined and prepared for the worship of idols are universally prohibited; and particularly those which bear the mark of the idol. This should be maintained against the opinion of the <i>Traditionists</i>, who think they may lawfully use these kinds of animals, provided they be not marked with the sign of the idol." Thus far the <i>Karaites</i>; and here we see one strong point of difference between these two sects. The <i>Karaites totally</i> objected to every thing used in idolatrous services: the <i>Traditionists</i>, as the Talmud shows, did <i>generally</i> the same; but it appears that they scrupled not to use any animal employed in idolatrous worship, provided they did not see the sign of the idol on it. Now the sign of the idol must be that placed on the animal previously to its being sacrificed, such as <i>gilded horns</i> and <i>hoofs, consecrated fillets, garlands</i>, c. And as, after it had been sacrificed, and its flesh exposed for sale in the shambles, it could bear none of these signs, we may take it for granted that the Jews might think it lawful to buy and eat this flesh: this the <i>Karaite</i> would most solemnly scruple. It may be just necessary to state here, that it was customary, after the blood and life of an animal had been offered in sacrifice to an idol, to sell the flesh in the market indiscriminately with that of other animals which had not been <i>sacrificed</i>, but merely <i>killed</i> <i>for common use</i>. Even the less scrupulous Jews, <i>knowing</i> that any particular flesh had been thus offered, would abhor the use of it and as those who lived among the Gentiles, as the Jews at Corinth, must know that this was a common case, hence they would be generally scrupulous; and those of them that were converted to Christianity would have their scruples increased, and be as rigid on this point as the <i>Karaites</i> themselves. On the other hand, those of the Gentiles who had received the faith of Christ, knowing that an <i>idol was nothing in the world</i>, nor was even a representation of any thing, (for the beings represented by idol images were purely <i>imaginary</i>,) made no scruple to buy and eat the flesh as they used to do, though not with the same <i>intention</i>; for when, in their heathen state, they ate the flesh offered to idols, they ate it as a <i>feast with the idol</i>, and were thus supposed to have <i>communion</i> with the idol; which was the grossest idolatry.</p>
<p>From these observations it will at once appear that much misunderstanding and offence must have existed in the Corinthian Church; the converted Jews abominating every thing that they knew had been used in the heathen worship, while the converted Gentiles, for the reasons above assigned, would feel no scruple on the account.</p>
<p><i><b>We know that we all have knowledge.</b></i> — I am inclined to think that these are not St. Paul's words, but a quotation from the letter of the Corinthians to him, and a proof of what the apostle says below, <i>knowledge puffeth up</i>; but however the words may be understood as to their origin, they contain a general truth, as they relate to Christians of those times, and may be thus paraphrased; "All we who are converted to God by Christ have sufficient knowledge concerning idols and idol worship; and we know also the liberty which we have through the Gospel, not being bound by Jewish laws, rites, ceremonies, c. but many carry their knowledge in this liberty too far, and do what is neither seemly nor convenient, and thus give offence to others."</p>
<p><i><b>Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</b></i> — This knowledge is very nearly allied to pride; it <i>puffeth up</i> the mind with vain conceit, makes those who have it bold and rash, and renders them careless of the consciences of others. And this knowledge, boasted of by the Corinthians, led them to <i>contemn</i> others; for so the word φυσιοι is understood by some eminent critics.</p>
