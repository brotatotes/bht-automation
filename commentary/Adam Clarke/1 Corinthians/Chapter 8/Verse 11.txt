<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:11">1 Corinthians 8:11</span>. <i><b>Shall the weak brother perish</b></i> — Being first taught by thy conduct that there was no harm in thus eating, he grieves the Spirit of God; becomes again darkened and hardened; and, sliding back into idolatry, dies in it, and so finally perishes.</p>
<p><i><b>For whom Christ died?</b></i> — So we learn that a man may <i>perish</i> for whom Christ died: this admits of no quibble. If a man <i>for whom</i> <i>Christ died</i>, apostatizing from <i>Christianity</i>, (for he is called a <i>brother</i> though <i>weak</i>,) return again to and die in idolatry, cannot go to heaven; then a man for whom Christ died may perish everlastingly. And if it were possible for a believer, whether strong or weak, to retrace his steps back to idolatry and die in it, surely it is possible for a man, who had escaped the pollutions that are in the world, to return to it, live and die in its spirit, and perish everlastingly also. Let him that readeth understand.</p>
