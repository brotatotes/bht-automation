<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:12">1 Corinthians 8:12</span>. <i><b>But when ye sin so against the brethren</b></i> — Against <i>Christians</i>, who are called by the Gospel to abhor and detest all such abominations.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye sin against Christ.</b></i> — By sending to perdition, through your bad example, a soul for whom he shed his blood; and so far defeating the gracious intentions of his sacrificial death. This is a farther intimation, that a person for whom Christ died may perish; and this is the drift of the apostle's argument.</p>
