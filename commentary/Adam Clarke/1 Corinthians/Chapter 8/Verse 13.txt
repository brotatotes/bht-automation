<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span>. <i><b>Wherefore</b></i>, c.] Rather than give any occasion to a Christian to sin against and so to harden his conscience that he should return to idolatry and perish, I would not only abstain from all <i>meats offered to idols</i>, but I would eat <i>no flesh</i>, should I exist through the <i>whole course of time</i>, but live on the herbs of the field, rather than cause my brother to stumble, and thus fall into idolatry and final ruin.</p>
<p>The following words of Origen contain a very solemn lesson and warning: "If we did more diligently attend to these things, we should avoid sinning against our brethren and wounding their weak conscience, that we might not <i>sin against Christ</i> our brethren that are among us, for whom Christ died, often perishing, not only by our <i>knowledge</i>, but by many other <i>ways</i>, and <i>things</i>, in which things we, <i>sinning against Christ</i>, shall suffer punishment; the souls of them that perish by us being required of and avenged upon us." See <i>Whitby</i> on this place.</p>
<p>1. THE greater our reputation for knowledge and sanctity, the greater mischief we shall do by our influence and example if we turn aside from the holy commandment delivered unto us. Every man should walk so as either to <i>light</i> or <i>lead</i> his brother to heaven.</p>
<p>2. It is the duty of every Christian to watch against <i>apostasy</i> in his own case, and to prevent it as much as possible in that of others. That a person for whom Christ died may <i>finally perish</i> is strongly argued, says Dr. Whitby, from this place, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>; for here the apostle dissuades the Corinthians from scandalizing their weak brethren, by an argument taken from the irreparable mischiefs they may do them, the <i>eternal ruin</i> they may bring upon them by this scandal; whereas if it be, as some assert, that <i>all</i> <i>things, even the sins of the elect, shall work together for their</i> <i>good, and that they shall never perish</i>; if the apostle knew and taught this doctrine to them, why does he endeavour to affright them from this scandal, by telling them that it might have that effect which he had before told them was impossible? If you interpret his words thus: <i>So shall he perish, for whom in charity</i> <i>ye ought to judge Christ died</i>; it is certain, from this doctrine, that they must be assured that this judgment of <i>charity</i> must be <i>false</i>, or that their brother could <i>not</i> perish. In the <i>first</i> place, they could not be obliged to act by it, and in the <i>second</i>, they could not rationally be moved by it to abstain from giving scandal on that impossible supposition.</p>
<p>If you interpret the apostle thus: <i>So shalt thou do that which,</i> <i>in its nature, tends to make thy brother perish; and might have</i> <i>that effect, had not God determined to preserve all from</i> <i>perishing, for whom</i> Christ <i>died</i>; since this determination renders it sure to me, who know it, that they cannot actually perish, it must assure me that there can be no cause of abstinency from this scandal, lest they should perish by it.</p>
<p>Moreover, by thus offending, saith the apostle, <i>ye sin against</i> <i>Christ</i>; viz. by sinning against him whom he has purchased by his blood; and destroying them for whose salvation he has suffered. If this intent of Christ's death be denied, how can we show in what Christ has demonstrated his great love to them that perish? Is it possible that they can sin against redeeming love? and how, by thus offending them who neither <i>do</i> nor <i>can</i> belong to him as members of his mystical body, are we injurious to Christ? See <i>Whitby</i> on this place.</p>
<p>3. It is natural for man to <i>wish</i> and <i>affect</i> to be <i>wise</i>; and when this desire is cultivated in reference to <i>lawful</i> objects, it will be an indescribable good; but when, like <i>Eve</i>, we see, in a <i>prohibition, something to be desired to make one wise</i>, we are then, like <i>her</i>, on the verge of our <i>fall</i>. Though extensive knowledge is not given <i>to</i> all, yet it is given <i>for</i> all; and is the public property of the Church. He who does not use it for general edification robs the public of its right. For the misuse and misapplication of this talent we shall give account to God, as well as of other gifts and graces.</p>
<p>4. Persons of an <i>over tender</i> and <i>scrupulous</i> conscience may be very troublesome in a Christian society; but as this excessive scrupulosity comes from want of more <i>light</i>, more <i>experience</i>, or more <i>judgment</i>, we should bear with them. Though such should often run into ridiculous extremes, yet we must take care that we do not attempt to cure them either with <i>ridicule</i> or <i>wrath</i>. Extremes generally beget extremes; and such persons require the most judicious treatment, else they will soon be stumbled and turned out of the way. We should be very careful lest in using what is called <i>Christian liberty</i> we occasion their fall; and for our own sake we must take heed that we do not denominate <i>sinful</i> <i>indulgences, Christian</i> liberties.</p>
<p>5. Though we are bound to take heed that we put not a stumbling block in the way of a weak brother, yet if such a brother be stumbled at any part of our conduct which is not blamable in itself, but of which he may have taken a wrong view, we are not answerable for the consequences. We are called to walk by the testimony of God; not according to the measure of any man's conscience, how sincere soever he may be.</p>
<p>6. Many persons cover a spirit of envy and uncharitableness with the name of godly zeal and tender concern for the salvation of others; they find fault with all; their spirit is a spirit of universal censoriousness; none can please them; and every one suffers by them. These destroy more souls by tithing mint and cummin, than others do by neglecting the weightier matters of the law. Such persons have what is termed, and very properly too, <i>sour godliness</i>. Both are extremes, and he who would avoid perdition must avoid <i>them</i>.</p>
