<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4">1 Corinthians 8:4</span>. <i><b>Things that are offered in sacrifice</b></i> — See on the first verse. See on the first verse, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span></p>
<p><i><b>An idol</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>nothing in the world</b></i> — Dr. Lightfoot translates this, <i>We know that there is no idol in the world</i>; which he explains thus: ειδωλον, idol, is ὁμοιωμα, εικων, σημειον, χαρακτηριον, σκιοειδες, a <i>likeness</i>, an <i>image</i>, a <i>sign</i>, a <i>character</i>, a <i>shadow</i>: now ουδεν ειδωλον signifies <i>there is no</i> <i>idol</i>, no <i>representation</i> of GOD, in the world. <i>Images</i> there are of stone, wood and metal; but none of these is any representation of the infinite Spirit. But I prefer the meaning given in the note on verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span> as the expression, <i>an idol is nothing in the world</i>, was common in the Old Testament, and among the Jews; and was understood by them in this way: they are not אלהים <i>Elohim</i>, the <i>true</i> GOD; but they are אלילים, <i>nothings</i>, and הבלים <i>habalim</i>, VANITY.</p>
