Verse 1 Corinthians 8:4. Things that are offered in sacrifice — See on the first verse. See on the first verse, 1 Corinthians 8:1An idol is nothing in the world — Dr. Lightfoot translates this, We know that there is no idol in the world; which he explains thus: ειδωλον, idol, is ὁμοιωμα, εικων, σημειον, χαρακτηριον, σκιοειδες, a likeness, an image, a sign, a character, a shadow: now ουδεν ειδωλον signifies there is no idol, no representation of GOD, in the world. Images there are of stone, wood and metal; but none of these is any representation of the infinite Spirit. But I prefer the meaning given in the note on verse 1 Corinthians 8:1; 1 Corinthians 8:1 as the expression, an idol is nothing in the world, was common in the Old Testament, and among the Jews; and was understood by them in this way: they are not אלהים Elohim, the true GOD; but they are אלילים, nothings, and הבלים habalim, VANITY.
