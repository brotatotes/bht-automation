<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:5">1 Corinthians 8:5</span>. <i><b>There be that are called gods</b></i> — There are many <i>images</i> that are supposed to be <i>representations</i> of divinities: but these divinities are nothing, the figments of mere fancy; and these images have no corresponding realities.</p>
<p><i><b>Whether in heaven or in earth</b></i> — As the <i>sun, moon, planets,</i> <i>stars</i>, the <i>ocean, rivers, trees</i>, &amp;c. And thus there are, nominally, <i>gods many</i>, and <i>lords many</i>.</p>
