<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span>. <i><b>But to us</b></i><b> there </b><i><b>is but one God, the Father</b></i> — Who produced all things, himself uncreated and unoriginated. <i>And we</i> <i>in him</i>, καιημειςειςαυτον, <i>and we</i> FOR <i>him</i>; all intelligent beings having been created for the purpose of manifesting his glory, by receiving and reflecting his <i>wisdom, goodness</i>, and <i>truth</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And one Lord Jesus</b></i> — Only one visible <i>Governor</i> of the world and the Church, <i>by whom</i> are <i>all things</i>: who was the <i>Creator</i>, as he is the <i>Upholder</i> of the universe. <i>And we by him</i>, being brought to the knowledge of the true God, by the revelation of Jesus Christ; for it is the only begotten Son alone that can reveal the Father. The <i>gods</i> of whom the apostle speaks were their <i>divinities</i>, or objects of religious worship; the <i>lords</i> were the <i>rulers</i> of the world, such <i>emperors</i>, who were considered next to gods, and some of them were deified. In opposition to those <i>gods</i> he places GOD <i>the Father</i>, the fountain of plenitude and being; and in opposition to the <i>lords</i> he places <i>Jesus Christ</i>, who made and who governs all things. We, as <i>creatures</i>, live in <i>reference</i>, ειςαυτον, <i>to him</i>, God the Father, who is the fountain of our being: and, as <i>Christians</i>, we live δι αυτου, <i>by</i> or <i>through him</i>, Jesus Christ; by whom we are bought, enlightened, pardoned, and saved.</p>
