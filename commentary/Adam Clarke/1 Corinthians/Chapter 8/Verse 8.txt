<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span>. <i><b>Meat commendeth us not to God</b></i> â€” No such feasts as these can be a recommendation of our souls or persons to the Supreme Being. As to the <i>thing</i>, considered in <i>itself</i>, the <i>eating</i> gives us no spiritual advantage; and the <i>eating not</i> is no spiritual loss.</p>
