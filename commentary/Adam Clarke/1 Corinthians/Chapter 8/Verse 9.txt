<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:9">1 Corinthians 8:9</span>. <i><b>But take heed</b></i> â€” Lest by frequenting such feasts and eating things offered to idols, under the conviction that <i>an idol</i> <i>is nothing</i>, and that you may eat those things innocently, this liberty of yours should become a means of grievously offending a weak brother who has not your knowledge, or inducing one who respects you for your superior knowledge to partake of these things with the conscience, the persuasion and belief, that an idol is <i>something</i>, and to conclude, that as you partake of such things, so he may also, and with safety. He is not possessed of your superior information on this point, and he eats <i>to the idol</i> what you take as a <i>common meal</i>.</p>
