<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>. <i><b>Am I not an apostle?</b></i> — It is sufficiently evident that there were persons at Corinth who questioned the apostleship of St. Paul; and he was obliged to walk very circumspectly that they might not find any occasion against him. It appears also that he had given them all his apostolical labours gratis; and even this, which was the highest proof of his disinterested benevolence, was produced by his opposers as an argument against him. "Prophets, and all divinely commissioned men, have a right to their secular support; you take nothing: - is not this from a conviction that you have no apostolical <i>right</i>?" On this point the apostle immediately enters on his own defence.</p>
<p><i><b>Am I not an apostle? Am I not free?</b></i> — These questions are all designed as assertions of the affirmative: <i>I am an apostle</i>; and <i>I</i> <i>am free</i> - possessed of all the rights and privileges of an apostle.</p>
<p><i><b>Have I not seen Jesus Christ</b></i> — From whom in his <i>personal</i> <i>appearance</i> to me, I have received my apostolic commission. This was judged essentially necessary to constitute an apostle. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:15">Acts 22:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Are not ye my work</b></i> — Your conversion from heathenism is the proof that I have preached with the Divine unction and authority.</p>
<p>Several good MSS. and versions transpose the two first questions in this verse, thus: <i>Am I not free? am I not an apostle?</i> But I cannot see that either perspicuity or sense gains any thing by this arrangement. On the contrary, it appears to me that his being an <i>apostle</i> gave him the <i>freedom</i> or <i>rights</i> to which he refers, and therefore the common arrangement I judge to be the best.</p>
