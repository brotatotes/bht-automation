<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:10">1 Corinthians 9:10</span>. <i><b>And he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of</b></i><b> </b><i><b>his hope.</b></i> — Instead of ὁ αλοων της ελπιδος αυτου μετεχειν, επ' ελπιδι, many of the best MSS. and versions read the passage thus: ὁ αλοων επ' ελπιδι του μετεχειν· <i>And he who thresheth in hope</i> <i>of partaking</i>. "The words της ελπιδος, which are omitted by the above, are," says Bp. Pearce, "superfluous, if not wrong; for men do not live <i>in hope</i> to partake of <i>their hope</i>, but to partake of what was the <i>object</i> and <i>end</i> of their <i>hope</i>. When these words are left out, the former and latter sentence will be both of a piece, and more resembling each other: for μετεχειν may be understood after the first επ ελπιδι, as well as after the last." Griesbach has left the words in question out of the text.</p>
