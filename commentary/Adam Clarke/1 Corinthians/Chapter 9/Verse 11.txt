<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:11">1 Corinthians 9:11</span>. <i><b>If we have sown unto you spiritual things</b></i> â€” If we have been the means of bringing you into a state of salvation by the Divine doctrines which we have preached unto you, is it too much for us to expect a temporal support then we give ourselves up entirely to this work? Every man who preaches the Gospel has a right to his own support and that of his family while thus employed.</p>
