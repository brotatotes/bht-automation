<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:12">1 Corinthians 9:12</span>. <i><b>If others be partakers of this power</b></i> — If those who in any matter serve you have a <i>right</i> to a recompense for that service, surely we who have served you in the most essential matters have a right to our support while thus employed in your service.</p>
<p><i><b>We have not used this power</b></i> — Though we had this <i>right</i>, we have not availed ourselves of it, but have worked with our hands to bear our own charges, lest any of you should think that we preached the Gospel merely to procure a temporal support, and so be prejudiced against us, and thus prevent our success in the salvation of your souls.</p>
