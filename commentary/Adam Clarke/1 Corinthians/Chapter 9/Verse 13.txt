<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:13">1 Corinthians 9:13</span>. <i><b>They which minister about holy things</b></i> â€” All the officers about the temple, whether priests, Levites, Nethinim, c., had a right to their support while employed in its service. The priests partook of the sacrifices the others had their maintenance from tithes, first fruits, and offerings made to the temple; for it was not lawful for them to live on the sacrifices. Hence the apostle makes the distinction between those who <i>minister</i> <i>about holy things</i> and those who <i>wait at the altar</i>.</p>
