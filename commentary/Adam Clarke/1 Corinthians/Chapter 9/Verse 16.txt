<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:16">1 Corinthians 9:16</span>. <i><b>For though I preach the Gospel</b></i> â€” I have cause of glorying that I preach the Gospel free of all charges to you; but I cannot <i>glory</i> in being a preacher of the Gospel, because I am not such either by my own skill or power. I have received both the <i>office</i>, and the grace by which I execute the office, from God. I have not only his authority to preach, but that authority <i>obliges</i> me to preach; and if I did not, I should endanger my salvation: <i>yea, wo is unto me, if I preach not the Gospel</i>. As every genuine preacher receives his commission from God alone, it is God alone who can take it away. Wo to that man who runs when God has not sent him; and wo to him who <i>refuses</i> to run, or who <i>ceases</i> to run, when God has sent him.</p>
