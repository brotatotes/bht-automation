<p>Verse 17. <i><b>For if I do this thing willingly</b></i> â€” If I be a cordial co-operator with God, <i>I have a reward</i>, an incorruptible crown, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>. Or, if I freely preach this Gospel without being burthensome to any, I have a special reward; but if I do not, I have simply an office to fulfil, into which God has put me, and may fulfil it conscientiously, and claim my privileges at the same time; but then I lose that special reward which I have in view by preaching the Gospel without charge to any.</p>
<p>This and the 18th verse have been variously translated: Sir <i>Norton Knatchhull</i> and, after him, Mr. <i>Wakefield</i> translate the two passages thus: <i>For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if</i> <i>I am intrusted with an office without my consent? what is my</i> <i>reward then? to make the Gospel of Christ, whilst I preach it,</i> <i>without charge, in not using to the utmost my privileges in the</i> <i>Gospel</i>.</p>
<p>Others render the passage thus: <i>But if I do it merely because I</i> <i>am obliged to it, I only discharge an office that is committed to</i> <i>me</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:18">1 Corinthians 9:18</span>. <i>For what then shall I be rewarded? It is for this, that,</i> <i>preaching the Gospel of Christ, I preach it freely, and do not</i> <i>insist on a claim which the Gospel itself gives me</i>.</p>
