<p>Verse 18. <i><b>That I abuse not my power</b></i> — I am inclined to think that καταχρησασθαι is to be understood here, not in the sense of <i>abusing</i>, but of <i>using to the uttermost</i> - exacting every thing that a man can claim by law. How many proofs have we of this in preachers of different denominations, who insist so strongly and so frequently on their <i>privileges</i>, as they term them, that the people are tempted to believe they seek not their <i>souls'</i> interests, but their secular <i>goods</i>. Such preachers can do the people no good. But the people who are most liable to think thus of their ministers, are those who are unwilling to grant the common necessaries of life to those who watch over them in the Lord. For there are such people even in the Christian Church! If the preachers of the Gospel were as parsimonious of the bread of life as some congregations and Christian societies are of the bread that perisheth, and if the preacher gave them a spiritual nourishment as base, as mean, and as scanty as the temporal support which they afford him, their souls must without doubt have nearly a famine of the bread of life.</p>
