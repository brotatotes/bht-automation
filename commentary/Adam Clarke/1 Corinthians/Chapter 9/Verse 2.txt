<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2">1 Corinthians 9:2</span>. <i><b>If I be not an apostle unto others</b></i> — If there be other Churches which have been founded by other apostles; yet it is not so with you.</p>
<p><i><b>The seal of mine apostleship are ye</b></i> — Your conversion to Christianity is God's <i>seal</i> to my apostleship. Had not God sent me, I could not have profited your souls.</p>
<p>The σφραγις or <i>seal</i>, was a figure cut in a <i>stone</i>, and that set in a <i>ring</i>, by which letters of credence and authority were stamped. The ancients, particularly the Greeks, excelled in this kind of engraving. The cabinets of the curious give ample proof of this; and the moderns contend in vain to rival the perfection of those ancient <i>masters</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>In the Lord.</b></i> — The apostle shows that it was by the grace and influence of God alone that he was an apostle, and that <i>they</i> were converted to Christianity.</p>
