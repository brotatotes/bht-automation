<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Unto the Jews I became as a Jew</b></i> — In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>, we find that for the sake of the unconverted Jews he circumcised Timothy. See the note there.</p>
<p><i><b>To them that are under the law</b></i> — To those who considered themselves still under obligation to observe its rites and ceremonies, though they had in the main embraced the Gospel, he became as if under the same obligations; and therefore purified himself in the temple, as we find related, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span>, where also see the notes.</p>
<p>After the first clause, <i>to them that are under the law as under</i> <i>the law</i>, the following words, μη ων αυτος ὑπο νομον, <i>not being</i> <i>myself under the law</i>, are added by ABCDEFG, several others; the later <i>Syriac, Sahidic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and all the <i>Itala;</i> <i>Cyril, Chrysostom, Damascenus</i>, and others; and on this evidence <i>Griesbach</i> has received them into the text.</p>
