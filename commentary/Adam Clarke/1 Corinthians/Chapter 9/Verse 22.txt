<p>Verse 22. <i><b>To the weak became I as weak</b></i> — Those who were conscientiously <i>scrupulous</i>, even in respect to lawful things.</p>
<p><i><b>I am made all things to all men</b></i> — I assumed every shape and form consistent with innocency and perfect integrity; giving up my own will, my own way, my own ease, my own pleasure, and my own profit, that I might save the souls of all. Let those who plead for the system of <i>accommodation</i> on the example of St. Paul, attend to the <i>end</i> he had in view, and the <i>manner</i> in which he pursued that <i>end</i>. It was not to <i>get money, influence</i>, or <i>honour</i>, but to <i>save</i> SOULS! It was not to get <i>ease</i> but to increase his <i>labours</i>. It was not to <i>save his life</i>, but rather that it should be a <i>sacrifice</i> for the good of <i>immortal souls</i>!</p>
<p>A parallel saying to this of St. Paul has been quoted from Achilles Tatius, lib. v., cap. xix., where Clitophon says, on having received a letter from Leucippe: Τουτοις εντυχων παντα εγινομην ὁμου, ανεφλεγομην, ωχριων, εθαυμαζον, ηπιστουν, εχαιρον, ηχθομην· "When I read the contents, I <i>became all things</i> <i>at once</i>; I was inflamed, I grew pale, I was struck with wonder; I doubted, I rejoiced, became sad." The same form of speech is frequent among Greek writers. I think this casts some light on the apostle's meaning.</p>
<p><i><b>That I might by all means save some.</b></i> — On this clause there are some very important readings found in the MSS. and versions. Instead of παντως τινας σωσω, <i>that I might by all means save some</i>; παντας σωσω, <i>that I might save all</i>, is the reading of DEFG, <i>Syriac, Vulgate, AEthiopic</i>, all the <i>Itala</i>, and several of the <i>fathers</i>. This reading Bishop <i>Pearce</i> prefers, because it is more agreeable to St. Paul's meaning here, and exactly agrees with what he says, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:33">1 Corinthians 10:33</span>, and makes his design more extensive and noble. <i>Wakefield</i> also prefers this reading.</p>
