<p>Verse 23. <i><b>And this I do for the Gospel's sake</b></i> — Instead of τουτο, <i>this</i>, παντα, <i>all things</i>, (I do all things for the Gospel's sake,) is the reading of ABCDEFG, several others, the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Vulgate, Itala, Armenian</i>, and <i>Sahidic</i>; the two latter reading ταυτα παντα, <i>all these things</i>.</p>
<p>Several of the fathers have the same reading, and there is much reason to believe it to be <i>genuine</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That I might be partaker thereof with you.</b></i> — That I might attain to the <i>reward</i> of eternal life which it sets before me; and this is in all probability the meaning of το ευαγγελιον, which we translate <i>the Gospel</i>, and which should be rendered here <i>prize</i> or <i>reward</i>; this is a frequent meaning of the original word, as may be seen in my preface to St. Matthew: <i>I do all this for the sake of</i> <i>the prize, that I may partake of it</i> with you.</p>
