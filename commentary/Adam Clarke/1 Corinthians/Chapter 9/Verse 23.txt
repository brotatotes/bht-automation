Verse 23. And this I do for the Gospel's sake — Instead of τουτο, this, παντα, all things, (I do all things for the Gospel's sake,) is the reading of ABCDEFG, several others, the Coptic, AEthiopic, Vulgate, Itala, Armenian, and Sahidic; the two latter reading ταυτα παντα, all these things.Several of the fathers have the same reading, and there is much reason to believe it to be genuine.That I might be partaker thereof with you. — That I might attain to the reward of eternal life which it sets before me; and this is in all probability the meaning of το ευαγγελιον, which we translate the Gospel, and which should be rendered here prize or reward; this is a frequent meaning of the original word, as may be seen in my preface to St. Matthew: I do all this for the sake of the prize, that I may partake of it with you.
