<p>Verse 24. <i><b>They which run in a race run all</b></i> — It is sufficiently evident that the apostle alludes to the athletic exercises in the games which were celebrated every fifth year on the isthmus, or narrow neck of land, which joins the Peloponnesus, or Morea, to the main land; and were thence termed the <i>Isthmian</i> <i>games</i>. The exercises were <i>running, wrestling, boxing, throwing</i> the <i>discus</i> or <i>quoit</i>, c. to the three first of these the apostle especially alludes.</p>
<p><i><b>But one receiveth the prize?</b></i> — The apostle places the Christian race in contrast to the Isthmian games; in them, only one received the prize, though all ran; in this, if all run, all will receive the prize; therefore he says, <i>So run that ye may obtain</i>. Be as much in earnest to get to heaven as others are to gain their prize; and, although only one of <i>them</i> can win, <i>all</i> of <i>you</i> may obtain.</p>
