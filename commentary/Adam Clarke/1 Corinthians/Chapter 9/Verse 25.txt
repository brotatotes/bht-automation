<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Is temperate in all things</b></i> — All those who contended in these exercises went through a long state and series of painful preparations. To this exact discipline <i>Epictetus</i> refers, cap. 35: Θελεις Ολυμπια νικησαι; Δει σ' ευτακτειν, αναγκοτροφειν, απεχεσθαι, πεμματων, γυμναζεσθαι προς αναγκην εν ὡρα τεταγμενη, εν καυματι, εν ψυχει, μη ψυχρον πινειν, μη οινον ὡς ετυχεν· ἁπλως, ὡς ιατρῳ, παραδεδωκεναι σεαυτον τῳ επιστατη· ειτα εις τον αγωνα παρερχεσθαι· κ. τ. λ. "Do you wish to gain the prize at the Olympic games?-Consider the requisite preparations and the consequences: you must observe a strict regimen; must live on food which you dislike; you must abstain from all delicacies; must exercise yourself at the necessary and prescribed times both in heat and in cold; you must drink nothing cooling; take no wine as formerly; in a word, you must put yourself under the directions of a <i>pugilist</i>, as you would under those of a <i>physician</i>, and afterwards enter the lists. Here you may get your arm broken, your foot put out of joint, be obliged to swallow mouthfuls of dust, to receive many stripes, and after all be conquered." Thus we find that these suffered much hardships in order to conquer, and yet were <i>uncertain</i> of the <i>victory</i>. </p>
<p><i><b>They</b></i><b> do it </b><i><b>to obtain a corruptible crown</b></i> — The <i>crown</i> won by the victor in the <i>Olympian</i> games was made of the <i>wild olive</i>; in the <i>Pythian</i> games of <i>laurel</i>; in the <i>Nemean</i> games of <i>parsley</i>; and in the <i>Isthmian</i> games of the <i>pine</i>. These were all corruptible, for they began to <i>wither</i> as soon as they were separated from the trees, or plucked out of the earth. In opposition to these, the apostle says, he contended for an incorruptible crown, the heavenly inheritance. He sought not <i>worldly</i> honour; but that honour which comes from God.</p>
