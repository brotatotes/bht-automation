<p>Verse 26. <i><b>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly</b></i> — In the foot-course in those games, how many soever ran, only <i>one</i> could have the prize, however strenuously they might exert themselves; therefore, <i>all</i> ran uncertainly; but it was widely different in the Christian course, if every one ran as he ought, <i>each</i> would receive the prize.</p>
<p>The word αδηλως, which we translate <i>uncertainly</i>, has other meanings.</p>
<p>1. It signifies <i>ignorantly</i>; I do not run like one <i>ignorant</i> of what he is about, or of the <i>laws</i> of the <i>course</i>; I know that there is an eternal life; I <i>know</i> the <i>way</i> that leads to it; and I <i>know</i> and feel the <i>power</i> of it.</p>
<p>2. It signifies <i>without</i> <i>observation</i>; the eyes of all the spectators were fixed on those who ran in these races; and to gain the applause of the multitude, they stretched every nerve; the apostle knew that the eyes of all were fixed upon him.</p>
<p>1. His false brethren waited for his halting:</p>
<p>2. The persecuting Jews and Gentiles longed for his downfall:</p>
<p>3. The Church of Christ <i>looked</i> on him with anxiety:</p>
<p>4. And he acted in all things as under the immediate <i>eye</i> of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Not as one that beateth the air</b></i> — Kypke observes, that there are <i>three</i> ways in which persons were said, αεραδερειν, <i>to beat</i> <i>the air</i>.</p>
<p>1. When in practising for the combat they threw their arms and legs about in different ways, thus practising the attitudes of offence and defence. This was termed σκιαμαχια, <i>fighting with a shadow</i>. To this Virgil alludes when representing <i>Dares</i> swinging his arms about, when he rose to challenge a competitor in the <i>boxing</i> match:- </p>
<p>No man, who had not <i>seen</i> such a fight, could have given such a description as that above; and we may fairly presume that when Virgil was in Greece he saw such a contest at the Isthmian games, and therefore was enabled to paint from <i>nature</i>.</p>
<p><i>Homer</i> has the same image of missing the foe and <i>beating the</i> <i>air</i>, when describing Achilles attempting to kill Hector, who, by his <i>agility</i> and <i>skill</i>, (Poetice by <i>Apollo</i>,) eluded the blow:- </p>
