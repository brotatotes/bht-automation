<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:3">1 Corinthians 9:3</span>. <i><b>Mine answer to them</b></i> — Ἡ εμη απολογια τοις εμε ανακρινουσιν· This is my <i>defence</i> against those who examine me. The words are <i>forensic</i>; and the apostle considers himself as brought before a legal tribunal, and questioned so as to be obliged to answer as upon oath. His defence therefore was this, that they were converted to God by his means. This verse belongs to the two preceding verses.</p>
