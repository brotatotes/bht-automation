<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:4">1 Corinthians 9:4</span>. <i><b>Have we not power to eat and to drink?</b></i> — Have we not <i>authority</i>, or <i>right</i>, εξουσιαν, to expect sustenance, while we are labouring for your salvation? Meat and drink, the <i>necessaries</i>, not the superfluities, of life, were what those primitive messengers of Christ required; it was just that they who <i>laboured</i> in the Gospel should <i>live</i> by the Gospel; they did not wish to make a fortune, or accumulate wealth; a <i>living</i> was all they desired. It was probably in reference to the same moderate and reasonable desire that the provision made for the clergy in this country was called a <i>living</i>; and their work for which they got this <i>living</i> was called the <i>cure of souls</i>. Whether we derive the word <i>cure</i> from <i>cura</i>, care, as signifying that the <i>care</i> of all the souls in a particular parish or place devolves on the minister, who is to instruct them in the things of salvation, and lead them to heaven; or whether we consider the term as implying that the souls in that district are in a state of spiritual <i>disease</i>, and the minister is a spiritual <i>physician</i>, to whom the cure of these souls is intrusted; still we must consider that such a labourer is worthy of his hire; and he that preaches the Gospel should live by the Gospel.</p>
