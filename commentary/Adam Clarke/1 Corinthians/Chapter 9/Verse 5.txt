<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>. <i><b>Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife</b></i> — The word εξουσιαν is to be understood here, as above in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:4">1 Corinthians 9:4</span>, as implying authority or right; and authority, not merely derived from their office, but from Him who gave them that office; from the constitution of nature; and from universal propriety or the fitness of things.</p>
<p>When the apostle speaks of leading about a sister, a wife, he means <i>first</i>, that he and all other apostles, and consequently all ministers of the Gospel, had a <i>right</i> to marry. For it appears that our Lord's brethren <i>James</i> and <i>Jude</i> were married; and we have infallible evidence that Peter was a married man, not only from this verse, but from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span>, where his <i>mother-in-law</i> is mentioned as being cured by our Lord of a fever.</p>
<p>And <i>secondly</i>, we find that their wives were persons of the <i>same</i> <i>faith</i>; for less can never be implied in the word <i>sister</i>. This is a decisive proof against the papistical celibacy of the clergy: and as to their attempts to evade the force of this text by saying that the apostles had holy women who attended them, and ministered to them in their peregrinations, there is no proof of it; nor could they have suffered either young women or other men's wives to have accompanied them in this way without giving the most palpable occasion of scandal. And <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i> has particularly remarked that the apostles carried their <i>wives</i> about with them, "not as wives, but as <i>sisters</i>, that they might minister to those who were mistresses of families; that so the doctrine of the Lord might without reprehension or evil suspicion enter into the apartments of the women." And in giving his finished picture of his <i>Gnostic</i>, or perfect Christian, he says: εσθιει, και πινει, και γαμει - εικονας εχει τους Αποστολους, <i>He eats, and drinks, and</i> <i>marries - having the apostles for his example</i>. Vid. <i>Clem. Alex</i>. Strom., lib. vii., c. 12.</p>
<p>On the propriety and excellence of <i>marriage</i>, and its <i>superiority</i> to <i>celibacy</i>, see the notes on chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:0">1 Corinthians 7:0</span>.</p>
