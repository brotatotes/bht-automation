<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:6">1 Corinthians 9:6</span>. <i><b>Or I only and Barnabas</b></i> â€” Have we alone of all the apostles no right to be supported by our converts? It appears from this,</p>
<p>1. That the apostles did not generally support themselves by their own labour.</p>
<p>2. That Paul and Barnabas did thus support themselves.</p>
<p>Some of the others probably had not a business at which they could conveniently work; but Paul and Barnabas had a trade at which they could conveniently labour wherever they came.</p>
