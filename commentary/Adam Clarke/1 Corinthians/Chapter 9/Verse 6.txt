Verse 1 Corinthians 9:6. Or I only and Barnabas â€” Have we alone of all the apostles no right to be supported by our converts? It appears from this,1. That the apostles did not generally support themselves by their own labour.2. That Paul and Barnabas did thus support themselves.Some of the others probably had not a business at which they could conveniently work; but Paul and Barnabas had a trade at which they could conveniently labour wherever they came.
