<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>. <i><b>Who goeth a warfare - at his own charges?</b></i> — These questions, which are all supposed from the necessity and propriety of the cases to be answered in the <i>affirmative</i>, tend more forcibly to point out that the common sense of man joins with the providence of God in showing the propriety of every man living by the fruits of his labour. The first question applies particularly to the case of the apostle, τις στρατευεται ιδιοις οψωνιοις· Does a soldier provide his own <i>victuals</i>? οψωςιος is used to express the military pay or wages, by the Greek writers; for the Roman soldiers were paid not only in <i>money</i> but in <i>victuals</i>; and hence <i>corn</i> was usually distributed among them. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:14">Luke 3:14</span>.</p>
