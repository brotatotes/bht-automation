<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span>. <i><b>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox</b></i> — See this largely explained in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+25:4">Deuteronomy 25:4</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Doth God take care for oxen?</b></i> — This question is to be understood thus: Is it likely that God should be solicitous for the comfort of <i>oxen</i>, and be regardless of the welfare of <i>man</i>? In this Divine precept the kindness and providential care of God are very forcibly pointed out. He takes care of oxen; he <i>wills</i> them all that happiness of which their nature is susceptible; and can we suppose that he is <i>unwilling</i> that the human soul shall have that happiness which is suited to its spiritual and eternal nature? He could not reprobate an ox, because <i>the Lord careth for</i> <i>oxen</i>; and surely he cannot reprobate a <i>man</i>. It may be said the <i>man</i> has <i>sinned</i> but the <i>ox</i> cannot. I answer: The decree of reprobation is supposed to be from all <i>eternity</i>; and certainly a man can no more sin <i>before</i> he <i>exists</i>, than an ox can <i>when</i> he <i>exists</i>.</p>
