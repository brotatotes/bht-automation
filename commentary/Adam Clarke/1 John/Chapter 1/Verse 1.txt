<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>. <i><b>That which was from the beginning</b></i> — That glorious personage, JESUS CHRIST <i>the</i> LORD, who was from <i>eternity</i>; him, being <i>manifested in the flesh, we have heard</i> proclaim the <i>doctrine</i> <i>of eternal life</i>; with <i>our</i> own <i>eyes have we seen him</i>, not transiently, for we have <i>looked upon him</i> frequently; and <i>our hands</i> <i>have handled</i>-frequently touched, his person; and we have had every proof of the identity and reality of this glorious being that our senses of <i>hearing</i>, ὁ ακηκοαμεν, <i>seeing</i>, ὁ ἑωρακαμεν τοις οφθαλμοις ἡμων, and <i>feeling</i>, και αἱ χειρες ἡμων εψηλαφησαν could possibly require.</p>
