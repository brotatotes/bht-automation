<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span>. <i><b>For the Life was manifested</b></i> â€” The Lord Jesus, who is the creator of all things, and the <i>fountain of life</i> to all sentient and intellectual beings, and from whom <i>eternal life</i> and <i>happiness</i> come, <i>was manifested</i> in the flesh, and we <i>have seen him,</i> and in consequence <i>bear witness</i> to him as the fountain and author of eternal life; for he who <i>was from eternity with the Father was</i> <i>manifested unto us</i> his apostles, and to the whole of the Jewish nation, and preached that doctrine of eternal life which I have before delivered to the world in my gospel, and which I now farther confirm by this epistle.</p>
