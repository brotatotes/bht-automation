<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>. <i><b>That which we have seen and heard</b></i> — We deliver nothing by hearsay, nothing by tradition, nothing from conjecture; we have had the fullest certainty of all that we write and preach.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye also may have fellowship with us</b></i> — That ye may be preserved from all false doctrine, and have a real <i>participation</i> with us apostles of the grace, peace, love, and life of God, which communion we have <i>with God</i> the Father, who hath loved us, and given his Son Jesus Christ to redeem us; and <i>with his Son Jesus</i> <i>Christ</i>, who laid down his life for the life of the world and <i>through</i> whom, being God manifested in the flesh, we have union with God, are made partakers of the Divine nature and dwell in God, and God in us.</p>
