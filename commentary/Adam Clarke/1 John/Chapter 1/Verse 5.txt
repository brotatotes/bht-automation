<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>. <i><b>This then is the message</b></i> — This is the <i>grand</i> <i>principle</i> on which all depends, <i>which we have heard of</i> απαυτου, FROM <i>him</i>; for neither Moses nor the prophets ever gave that full instruction concerning God and communion with him which Jesus Christ has given, for the only-begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, has alone declared the fulness of the truth, and the extent of the blessings, which believers on him are to receive. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>God is light</b></i> — The source of wisdom, knowledge, holiness, and happiness; and <i>in him is no darkness at all</i>-no ignorance, no imperfection, no sinfulness, no misery. And from him wisdom, knowledge, holiness, and happiness are received by every believing soul. This is the grand message of the Gospel, the great principle on which the happiness of man depends. LIGHT implies every essential excellence, especially wisdom, holiness, and happiness. DARKNESS implies all imperfection, and principally <i>ignorance, sinfulness</i>, and <i>misery</i>. LIGHT is the purest, the most subtile, the most useful, and the most diffusive of all God's creatures; it is, therefore, a very proper emblem of the <i>purity</i>, <i>perfection</i>, and <i>goodness</i> of the Divine nature. God is to human soul, what the light is to the world; without the latter all would be dismal and uncomfortable, and terror and death would universally prevail: and without an indwelling God what is religion? Without his all-penetrating and diffusive light, what is the soul of man? Religion would be an empty science, a dead letter, a system unauthoritated and uninfluencing, and the soul a trackless wilderness, a howling waste, full of evil, of terror and dismay, and ever racked with realizing anticipations of future, successive, permanent, substantial, and endless misery. No wonder the apostle lays this down as a first and grand principle, stating it to be the essential message which he had received from Christ to deliver to the world.</p>
