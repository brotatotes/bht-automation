<p>Verse 6. <i><b>If we say that we have fellowship</b></i> — Having fellowship, κοινωνια, <i>communion</i>, with God, necessarily implies a <i>partaking of the Divine nature</i>. Now if a man profess to have such communion, and <i>walk in darkness</i>-live an irreligious and sinful life, <i>he lies</i>, in the profession which he makes, and <i>does not the</i> <i>truth</i>-does not walk according to the directions of the Gospel, on the grace of which he holds his relation to God, and his communion with him.</p>
<p>The <i>Gnostics</i>, against whose errors it is supposed this epistle was written, were great pretenders to <i>knowledge</i>, to the highest degrees of the Divine illumination, and the nearest communion with the fountain of holiness, while their manners were excessively corrupt.</p>
