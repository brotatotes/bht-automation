<p>Verse 11. <i><b>But he that hateth his brother is in darkness</b></i> â€” He is still in his heathen or unconverted state; and <i>walketh in</i> <i>darkness</i>, his conduct being a proof of that state; <i>and knoweth not</i> <i>whither he goeth </i>- having no proper knowledge of God or eternal things; and <i>cannot tell whether he is going to heaven or hell,</i> <i>because that darkness has blinded his eyes </i>- darkened his whole soul, mind, and heart.</p>
