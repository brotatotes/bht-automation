<p>Verse 12. <i><b>I write unto you, little children</b></i> — τεκνια. <i>Beloved</i> <i>children</i>, (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>) those who were probably the apostle's own converts, and members of the Church over which he presided. But it may be applied to young converts in general; those who can call God <i>Abba, Father</i>, by the Holy Spirit: therefore he says of them, <i>that their sins were forgiven them for his name's sake</i>: i.e. on account of <i>Jesus</i>, the <i>Saviour</i>, who had died for them, and was now their Mediator at the right hand of God.</p>
