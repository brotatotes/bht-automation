<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Love not the world</b></i> — Though these several classes were so well acquainted with Divine things, and had all tasted the powers of the world to come: yet so apt are men to be drawn aside by sensible things, that the Holy Spirit saw it necessary to caution these against the love of the world, the inordinate desire of earthly things. <i>Covetousness</i> is the predominant vice of old age: <i>Ye fathers, love not the world</i>. The things which are in the world, its profits, pleasures, and honours, have the strongest allurements for <i>youth</i>; therefore, ye <i>young men, little children</i>, and <i>babes</i>, love not the things of this world. Let those hearts abide faithful to God who have taken him for their portion.</p>
<p><i><b>The love of the Father is not in him.</b></i> — The love of God and the love of earthly things are incompatible. If you give place to the love of the world, the love of God cannot dwell in you; and if you have not his love, you can have no peace, no holiness, no heaven.</p>
