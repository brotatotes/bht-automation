<p>Verse 16. <i><b>For all that is in the world</b></i> — All that it can boast of, all that it can promise, is only sensual, transient gratification, and even this promise it cannot fulfil; so that its warmest votaries can complain loudest of their disappointment.</p>
<p><i><b>The lust of the flesh</b></i> — Sensual and impure desires which seek their gratification in women, strong drink, delicious viands, and the like.</p>
<p><i><b>Lust of the eyes</b></i> — Inordinate desires after <i>finery</i> of every kind, gaudy dress, splendid houses, superb furniture, expensive equipage, trappings, and decorations of all sorts.</p>
<p><i><b>Pride of life</b></i> — Hunting after honours, titles, and pedigrees; boasting of ancestry, family connections, great offices, honourable acquaintance, and the like.</p>
<p><i><b>Is not of the Father</b></i> — Nothing of these inordinate attachments either comes from or leads to God. They are of this world; here they begin, flourish, and end. They deprave the mind, divert it from Divine pursuits, and render it utterly incapable of spiritual enjoyments.</p>
