<p>Verse 17. <i><b>The world passeth away</b></i> — All these things are continually fading and perishing; and the very <i>state</i> in which they are possessed is changing perpetually, and the earth and its works will be shortly burnt up.</p>
<p><i><b>And the lust thereof</b></i> — The men of this world, their vain pursuits, and delusive pleasures, are passing away in their successive generations, and their very memory perishes; <i>but he</i> <i>that doeth the will of God</i>-that seeks the pleasure, profit, and honour that comes from above, shall abide for ever, always happy through time and eternity, because God, the unchangeable source of felicity, is his portion.</p>
