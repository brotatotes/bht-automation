<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Little children, it is the last time</b></i> — This place is variously understood. This is the <i>last dispensation</i> of grace and mercy to mankind; the <i>present age</i> is the <i>conclusion</i> of the Jewish state, as the temple and holy city are shortly to be destroyed. But as there are many who suppose that this epistle was written after the destruction of Jerusalem, consequently the words cannot, on that supposition, refer to this. Others think that εσχατηωρα should be translated, a most <i>difficult, perilous</i>, and <i>wretched</i> <i>time</i>; a time in which all kinds of vices, heresies, and pollutions shall have their full reign; that time which out Lord predicted, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15">Matthew 7:15</span>, when he said, <i>Beware of false prophets</i>. And <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:11">Matthew 24:11</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:12">Matthew 24:12</span>: <i>Many false prophets shall arise, and shall deceive many; and</i> <i>because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold</i>. And <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>: <i>There shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall</i> <i>show great signs and wonders</i>. And <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:25">Matthew 24:25</span>: <i>Behold, I have told you before</i>. Now the apostle may allude to these predictions of our Lord; but all these refer to a time antecedent to the destruction of Jerusalem. I am therefore inclined to think, whatever may be here the precise meaning of the <i>last time</i>, that the epistle before us was written while Jerusalem yet stood. See what is said in the preface on this head.</p>
<p><i><b>Antichrist shall come</b></i> — Who is this αντιχριστος antichrist? Is he the Emperor <i>Domitian</i>, the <i>Gnostics, Nicolaitans, Nazareans,</i> <i>Cerinthians, Romish pontiffs</i>, c., c.! Ans. Any <i>person, thing,</i> <i>doctrine, system of religion, polity</i>, &amp;c., which is <i>opposed</i> to <i>Christ</i>, and to the spirit and spread of his Gospel, is antichrist. We need not look for this imaginary being in any of the above exclusively. Even <i>Protestantism</i> may have its antichrist as well as <i>Popery</i>. Every <i>man</i> who opposes the spirit of the Gospel, and every <i>teacher</i> and <i>writer</i> who endeavours to lower the Gospel standard to the spirit and taste of the world, is a genuine <i>antichrist</i>, no matter <i>where</i> or <i>among whom</i> he is found. The heresies which sprang up in the days of St. John were the <i>antichrist</i> of that time. As there has been a succession of oppositions to Christianity in its spirit and spread through every age since its promulgation in the world, so there has been a succession of <i>antichrists</i>. We may bring this matter much lower every enemy of Christ, every one who opposes his reign in the world, in others, or in himself, is an <i>antichrist</i> and consequently every <i>wicked man</i> is an antichrist. But the name has been generally applied to whatever <i>person</i> or <i>thing systematically</i> opposes Christ and his religion.</p>
<p><i><b>Many antichrists</b></i> — Many false prophets, false Messiahs, heretics, and corrupters of the truth.</p>
<p><i><b>Whereby we know that it is the last time.</b></i> — That time which our Lord has predicted, and of which he has warned us.</p>
