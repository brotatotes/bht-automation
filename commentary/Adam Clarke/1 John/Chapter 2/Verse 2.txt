<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>. <i><b>And he is the propitiation</b></i> — 'Ἱλασμος· The <i>atoning</i> <i>sacrifice</i> for our sins. This is the proper sense of the word as used in the <i>Septuagint</i>, where it often occurs; and is the translation of אשם <i>asham</i>, an <i>oblation for sin</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="am+8:14">Amos 8:14</span>. חטאת chattath, a <i>sacrifice for sin</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eze+44:27">Ezekiel 44:27</span>. כפור kippur, an <i>atonement</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+5:8">Numbers 5:8</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>, and particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:13">Luke 18:13</span>. The word is used only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And not for ours only</b></i> — It is not for us <i>apostles</i> that he has died, nor exclusively for the <i>Jewish people</i>, but περι ὁλου του κοσμου, <i>for the whole world</i>, Gentiles as well as Jews, all the descendants of Adam. The apostle does not say that he died for any select <i>part</i> of the inhabitants of the earth, or for some out <i>of every nation, tribe</i>, or <i>kindred</i>; but for ALL MANKIND; and the attempt to limit this is a violent outrage against God and his word.</p>

<p>From these verses we learn that a poor backslider need not despair of again finding mercy; this passage holds out sufficient encouragement for his hope. There is scarcely another such in the Bible, and why? That sinners might not <i>presume</i> on the mercy of God. And why this <i>one</i>? That no backslider might utterly despair. Here, then, is a guard against presumption on the one hand, and despondency on the other.</p>
