<p>Verse 20. <i><b>But ye have an unction</b></i> — The word χρισμα signifies not an <i>unction</i>, but an <i>ointment</i>, the very thing itself by which <i>anointing</i> is effected; and so it was properly rendered in our former translations. Probably this is an allusion to the holy anointing oil of the law, and to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:7">Psalms 14:7</span>: <i>God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness</i>-he hath given thee the <i>plenitude of the Spirit</i>, which none of thy <i>fellows</i>-none of the prophets, ever received in such abundance. By this it is evident that not only the gifts of the Spirit, but the Holy Spirit himself, is intended. This Spirit dwelt at that time in a peculiar manner in the Church, to teach apostles, teachers, and all the primitive believers, every thing requisite for their salvation; and to make them the instruments of handing down to posterity that glorious system of truth which is contained in the New Testament. As <i>oil</i> was used among the Asiatics for the inauguration of persons into important offices, and this oil was acknowledged to be an emblem of the <i>gifts</i> and <i>graces of the Holy Spirit</i>, without which the duties of those offices could not be discharged; so it is put here for the Spirit himself, who presided in the Church, and from which all gifts and graces flowed. The χρισμα, <i>chrism</i> or <i>ointment</i> here mentioned is also an allusion to the <i>holy anointing ointment</i> prescribed by God himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:23-25">Exodus 30:23-25</span>, which was composed of fine <i>myrrh</i>, sweet <i>cinnamon</i>, sweet <i>calamus, cassia lignea</i>, and <i>olive oil</i>. This was an emblem of the gifts and graces of the Divine Spirit. See the notes on the above place. And for the <i>reason</i> of this anointing <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:7">Exodus 29:7</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye know all things.</b></i> — Every truth Of God necessary to your salvation and the salvation of man in general, and have no need of that knowledge of which the Gnostics boast.</p>
<p>But although the above is the sense in which this verse is generally understood, yet there is reason to doubt its accuracy. The adjective παντα, which we translate <i>all things</i>, is most probably in the accusative case singular, having ανθρωπον, <i>man</i>, or some such substantive, understood. The verse therefore should be translated: <i>Ye have an ointment from the Holy One, and ye know or</i> <i>discern</i> EVERY MAN. This interpretation appears to be confirmed by τωνπλανωντων in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:26">1 John 2:26</span>, <i>those who are deceiving</i> or <i>misleading you</i>; and in the same sense should παντων, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:27">1 John 2:27</span>, be understood: <i>But as the same anointing teacheth you</i> παντων, not <i>of all things</i>, but <i>of</i> ALL MEN. It is plain, from the whole tenor of the epistle, that St. John is guarding the Christians against seducers and deceivers, who were even then disturbing and striving to corrupt the Church. In consequence of this he desires them <i>to try the</i> <i>spirits whether they were of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>. But how were they to try them? Principally by that <i>anointing</i>-that <i>spiritual light</i> and <i>discernment</i> which they had received from God; and also by comparing the doctrine of these men with <i>what they had heard from</i> <i>the beginning</i>. The <i>anointing</i> here mentioned seems to mean the spirit of illumination, or great knowledge and discernment in spiritual things. By this they could readily distinguish the false apostles from the true.</p>
