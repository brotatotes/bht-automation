<p>Verse 21. <i><b>I have not written, c.</b></i> â€” It is not because ye are <i>ignorant</i> of these things that I write to you, but because you <i>know</i> <i>them</i>, and can by these judge of the doctrines of those false teachers, and clearly perceive that they are <i>liars</i> for they contradict the <i>truth</i> which ye have already received, and consequently their doctrine is a lie, and no lie can be of the truth, i.e. consistent with Christianity.</p>
