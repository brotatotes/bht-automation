<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the</b></i><b> </b><i><b>Christ?</b></i> — Here we see some of the false doctrines which were then propagated in the world. There were certain persons who, while they acknowledged Jesus to be a <i>Divine teacher</i>, denied him to be the <i>Christ</i>, i.e. the MESSIAH.</p>
<p><i><b>He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son,</b></i> — He is antichrist who denies the supernatural and miraculous birth of Jesus Christ, who denies Jesus to be the <i>Son of God</i>, and who denies God to be the Father of the Lord Jesus; thus he denies the <i>Father</i> and the Son. The Jews in general, and the Gnostics in particular, denied the <i>miraculous conception</i> of Jesus; with both he was accounted no more than a <i>common man</i>, the son of Joseph and Mary. But the Gnostics held that a Divine person, <i>AEon</i>, or angelical being, dwelt in him; but all things else relative to his miraculous generation and Divinity they rejected. These were antichrists, who denied <i>Jesus</i> to be the Christ.</p>
