<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Whosoever denieth the Son</b></i> — He who denies Jesus to be the Son of God, and consequently the Christ or Messiah, <i>he hath</i> <i>not the Father</i>-he can have no birth from above, he cannot be enrolled among the children of God, because none can be a child of God but by faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>He that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.</b></i> — This clause is printed by our translators in Italics to show it to be of doubtful authority, as it was probably wanting in the chief of those MSS. which they consulted, as it was in Coverdale's Bible, printed 1535; Tindall's Text, printed 1548; and in all the early printed editions (which I have seen) previously to 1566; the Bible of <i>Richard Cardmarden</i>, printed in English at Rouen, where this clause is inserted in a different letter between brackets. But that the clause is genuine, and should be restored to the text without any mark of spuriousness, as I have done in the text of this work, is evident from the authorities by which it is supported. It is found in ABC, and in between twenty and thirty others of the best authority; as also in both the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic, Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>. It is also quoted as a part of the text by <i>Origen, Meletius, Athanesius</i>, both the <i>Cyrils, Theophylact, Vigilius</i> of Tapsum, <i>Pelagius, Cerealis,</i> <i>Cassian</i>; and in substance by <i>Euthalius, Epiphanius, Cyprian,</i> <i>Hilary, Faustinus, Lucifer</i> of Cagliari, <i>Augustine</i>, and <i>Bede</i>. It is wanting in the <i>Arabic</i>, in the Polyglot, in a MSS. in the <i>Harleian</i> library, and in some few others. It is doubtless genuine, and Griesbach has with propriety restored it to the text, from which it never should have been separated.</p>
