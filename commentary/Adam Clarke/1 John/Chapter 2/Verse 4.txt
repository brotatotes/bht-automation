<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:4">1 John 2:4</span>. <i><b>He that saith, I know him</b></i> â€” This is a severe blow against those false teachers, and against all pretenders to religious knowledge, who live under the power of their sins; and against all Antinomians, and false boasters in the righteousness of Christ as a covering for their personal unholiness. They are all <i>liars</i>, and no <i>truth of God</i> is in them.</p>
