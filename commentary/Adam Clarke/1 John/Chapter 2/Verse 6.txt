<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Abideth in him</b></i> â€” He who not only professes to have known Christ, but also that he has communion with him, and abides in his favour, should prove the truth of his profession by walking as Christ walked; living a life of devotion and obedience to God, and of benevolence and beneficence to his neighbour. Thus Christ walked; and he has left us an example that we should follow his steps.</p>
<p>To <i>be in Christ</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:5">1 John 2:5</span>, is to be converted to the Christian faith, and to have received the remission of sins. To <i>abide in</i> <i>Christ</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:6">1 John 2:6</span>, is to <i>continue</i> in that state of salvation, growing in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
