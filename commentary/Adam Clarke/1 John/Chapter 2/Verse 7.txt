<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Brethren, I write no new commandment</b></i> — There seems a contradiction between this and the next verse. But the apostle appears to speak, not so much of any difference in the <i>essence</i> of the precept itself, as in reference to the <i>degrees</i> of light and grace belonging to the Mosaic and Christian dispensations. It was <i>ever</i> the command of God that men should receive his light, walk by that light, and love him and one another. But this commandment was <i>renewed</i> by Christ with much latitude and spirituality of meaning; and also with much additional <i>light</i> to see its extent, and <i>grace</i> to observe it. It may therefore be called the OLD <i>commandment</i>, which was from the beginning; and also a NEW <i>commandment</i> revealed afresh and illustrated by Christ, with the important addition to the meaning of <i>Thou shalt love thy neighbour</i> <i>as thyself</i>, ye shall love the brethren so as to lay down your lives for each other. <span class="_0000ff"><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span></span>.</p>
<p>Instead of αδελφοι, <i>brethren</i>, ABC, thirteen others, with both the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic, Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, Slavonic</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>, with several of the <i>fathers</i>, have αγαπητοι, <i>beloved</i>. This is without doubt the <i>true reading</i>.</p>
