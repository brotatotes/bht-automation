<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Which thing is true in him and in you</b></i> — It is true that Christ loved the world so well as to lay down his life for it; and it was true in them, in all his faithful followers at that time, who were ready to lay down their lives for the testimony of Jesus. There is a saying in <i>Synopsis</i> Sohar, p. 94, n. 51, that may cast some light on this passage: <i>That way in which the just</i> <i>have walked, although it be</i> OLD, <i>yet may be said to be</i> NEW <i>in the</i> <i>love of the righteous</i>. The love that the righteous bear to God and to each other is a <i>renewal</i> of the commandment.</p>
<p><i><b>The darkness is past</b></i> — The total thick darkness of the heathen world, and the comparative darkness of the Mosaic dispensation, are now <i>passing away</i>; and the pure and superior light of Christianity is now diffusing its beams everywhere. He does not say that the darkness was <i>all gone by</i>, but παραγεται, <i>it is</i> <i>passing away</i>; he does not say that the <i>fulness</i> of the <i>light had</i> <i>appeared</i>, but ηδηφαινει, it is <i>now shining</i> and will shine more and more to the perfect day; for the darkness passes away in proportion as the light shines and increases.</p>
