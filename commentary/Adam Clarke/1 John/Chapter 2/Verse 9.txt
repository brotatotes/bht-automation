<p>Verse 9. <i><b>He that saith he is in the light</b></i> â€” He that professes to be a convert to Christianity, even in the lowest degree; <i>and</i> <i>hateth his brother</i>-not only does not love him, but wills and does him evil, as the Jews did the Gentiles; <i>is in darkness</i>-has received no saving knowledge of the truth; and, whatever he may pretend, is in heathen ignorance, or even worse than heathen ignorance, to the present time, notwithstanding the clear shining of the light of the Gospel.</p>
