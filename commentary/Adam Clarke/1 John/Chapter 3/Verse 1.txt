<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:1">1 John 3:1</span>. <i><b>Behold, what manner of love</b></i> — Whole volumes might be written upon this and the two following verses, without exhausting the extraordinary subject contained in them, viz., <i>the love of God</i> <i>to man</i>. The apostle himself, though evidently filled with God, and walking in the fulness of his light, does not attempt to describe it; he calls on the world and the Church to <i>behold it</i>, to <i>look upon</i> it, to <i>contemplate</i> it, and <i>wonder</i> at it.</p>
<p><i>What manner of love</i>. - ποταπην αγαπην. <i>What great love</i>, both as to <i>quantity</i> and <i>quality</i>; for these ideas are included in the original term. The length, the breadth, the depth, the height, he does not attempt to describe.</p>
<p><i><b>The Father hath bestowed</b></i> — For we had neither <i>claim</i> nor <i>merit</i> <i>that we should be called</i>, that is, <i>constituted</i> or <i>made</i>, the <i>sons of God</i>, who were before children of the wicked one, animal, earthly, devilish; therefore, the love which brought us from such a depth of misery and degradation must appear the more extraordinary and impressive. After κληθωμεν, <i>that we might be</i> <i>called</i>, και εσμεν, <i>and we are</i>, is added by ABC, seventeen others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic, Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic,</i> <i>Slavonic</i>, and <i>Vulgate</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Therefore the world</b></i> — The Jews, and all who know not God, and are seeking their portion in this life; <i>knoweth us not</i> - do not <i>acknowledge, respect, love</i>, or <i>approve</i> of us. In this sense the word γενωσκειν is here to be understood. The <i>world</i> KNEW well enough that there were such persons; but they did not <i>approve</i> of them. We have often seen that this is a frequent use of the term <i>know</i>, both in <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>Greek</i>, in the Old Testament and also in the New.</p>
<p><i><b>Because it knew him not.</b></i> — The Jews did not <i>acknowledge</i> Jesus; they neither <i>approved</i> of him, his doctrine, nor his manner of life.</p>
