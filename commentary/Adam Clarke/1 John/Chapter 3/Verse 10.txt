<p>Verse 10. <i><b>In this the children of God are manifest</b></i> — Here is a fearful text. Who is a child of the devil? <i>He that commits sin</i>. Who is a child of God? <i>He that works righteousness</i>. By this text we shall stand or fall before God, whatever our particular <i>creed</i> may say to the contrary.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither he that loveth not his brother.</b></i> — No man is of God who is not ready on all emergencies to do any act of kindness for the comfort, relief, and support of any human being. For, as God made of one blood an the nations of men to dwell upon the face of the whole earth, so all are of <i>one family</i>; and consequently all are <i>brethren</i>, and should love as brethren.</p>
