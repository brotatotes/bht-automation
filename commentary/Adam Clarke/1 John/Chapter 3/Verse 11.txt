<p>Verse 11. <i><b>For this is the message</b></i> â€” See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>. From the <i>beginning</i> God hath taught men that they should <i>love one another</i>. How essentially necessary this is to the comfort and well-being of man in this state of trial and difficulty, every sensible man must see. All are dependent upon all; all upon each, and each upon all. Mutual love makes this dependence pleasant and doubly profitable. Nothing can be more pleasing to an ingenuous and generous mind than to communicate acts of kindness.</p>
