<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Not as Cain</b></i> — Men should not act to each other as Cain did to his brother Abel. He murdered him because he was better than himself. But who was Cain? εκτουπονηρουην, <i>he was</i> <i>of the devil</i>. And who are they who, through pride, lust of power, ambition, gain, c., murder each other in <i>wars</i> and political contentions? εκτουπονηρουεισι. To attempt to justify the <i>principle</i>, and excuse the <i>instigators, authors, abettors</i>, &amp;c., of such wars, is as vain as it is wicked. They are opposed to the <i>nature of God</i>, and to that <i>message</i> which he has sent to man from the beginning: <i>Love one another. Love your enemies</i>. Surely this does not mean, <i>Blow out their brains</i>, or, <i>Cut their throats</i>. O, how much of the spirit, temper, and letter of the Gospel have the nations of the world, and particularly the nations of Europe, to learn!</p>
<p><i><b>And wherefore slew he him?</b></i> — What could induce a brother to imbrue his hands in a brother's blood? Why, his brother was righteous, and he was wicked and the seed of the wicked one which was in him induced him to destroy his brother, because the seed of God-the Divine nature, was found in him.</p>
