<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Marvel not - if the world hate you.</b></i> â€” Expect no better treatment from unconverted Jews and Gentiles than Abel received from his wicked and cruel brother. This was a lesson to the Church, preparatory to <i>martyrdom</i>. Expect neither justice nor mercy from the men who are enemies of God. They are either full of malice and envy, hateful, hating one another, or they are specious, hollow, false, and deceitful.</p>
<p>"A <i>foe</i> to GOD was ne'er true <i>friend to</i> MAN."</p>
