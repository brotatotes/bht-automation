<p>Verse 14. <i><b>We know that we have passed from death unto life</b></i> — <i>Death</i> and <i>life</i> are represented here as two distinct <i>territories,</i> <i>states</i>, or <i>kingdoms</i>, to either of which the inhabitants of either may be removed. This is implied in the term μεταβεβηκαμεν, from μετα, denoting <i>change of place</i>, and βαινω, <i>I go</i>. It is the same figure which St. Paul uses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+1:13">Colossians 1:13</span>: <i>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and translated</i> <i>us into the kingdom of the Son of his love</i>. The believers to whom St. John writes had been once in the region and shadow of death, in the place where sin and death reigned, whose subjects they were; but they had left that kingdom of oppression, wretchedness, and wo, and had <i>come over</i> to the kingdom of <i>life</i>, whose king was the <i>Prince</i> and <i>Author of life</i>; where all was <i>liberty, prosperity</i>, and <i>happiness</i>; where <i>life</i> and <i>love</i> were universally prevalent, and <i>death</i> and <i>hatred</i> could not enter. We <i>know</i>, therefore, says the apostle, <i>that we are passed</i> over <i>from</i> the territory of <i>death</i> <i>to</i> the kingdom of <i>life, because we love the brethren</i>, which those who continue in the old kingdom-under the old covenant, can never do; for <i>he that loveth not his brother abideth in death</i>. He has never changed his original residence. He is still an unconverted, unrenewed sinner.</p>
