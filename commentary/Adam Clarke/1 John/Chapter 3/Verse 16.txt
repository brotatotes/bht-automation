<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Hereby perceive we the love of God</b></i> — This sixteenth verse of this third chapter of John's first epistle is, in the main, an exact counterpart of the sixteenth verse of the third chapter of St. John's gospel: <i>God so loved the world, that he gave</i> <i>his only-begotten Son</i>, c. Here the apostle says, We perceive, εγνωκαμεν, <i>we have known</i>, the love of God, because he laid down his life for us. <i>Of God</i> is not in the text, but it is preserved in one MS., and in two or three of the versions but though this does not establish its authenticity, yet τουθεου, <i>of God</i>, is necessarily understood, or τουχριστου, <i>of Christ</i>, as Erpen's <i>Arabic</i> has it; or αυτουειςημας, <i>his love to us</i>, as is found in the Syriac. A higher proof than this of his love Christ could not have possibly given to the children of men.</p>
<p><i><b>We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</b></i> — We should <i>risk</i> our life to save the lives of others; and we should be ready to lay down our lives to redeem their souls when this may appear to be a means of leading them to God.</p>
