Verse 17. But whoso hath this worlds good — Here is a test of this love; if we do not divide our bread with the hungry, we certainly would not lay down our life for him. Whatever love we may pretend to mankind, if we are not charitable and benevolent, we give the lie to our profession. If we have not bowels of compassion, we have not the love of God in us; if we shut up our bowels against the poor, we shut Christ out of our hearts, and ourselves out of heaven.This worlds good.-τουβιοντουκοσμου. The life of this world, i.e. the means of life; for so βιος is often used. See Mark 12:44; Luke 8:43; Luke 15:12; Luke 15:30; Luke 21:4, and other places.How dwelleth the love of God in him? — That is, it cannot possibly dwell in such a person. Hardheartedness and God's love never meet together, much less can they be associated.
