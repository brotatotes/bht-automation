<p>Verse 18. <i><b>My little children</b></i> — τεκνιαμου, <i>My beloved</i> <i>children, let us not love in word</i>-in merely <i>allowing</i> the general <i>doctrine</i> of love to God and man to be just and right;</p>
<p><i><b>Neither in tongue</b></i> — In making <i>professions</i> of love, and of a charitable and humane disposition, and resting there; <i>but in deed</i>- by humane and merciful acts;</p>
<p><i><b>And in truth.</b></i> — Feeling the disposition of which we speak. There is a good saying in <i>Yalcut Rubeni</i>, fol. 145, 4, on this point: "If love consisted in <i>word only</i>, then love ceaseth as soon as the word is pronounced. Such was the love between Balak and Balaam. But if love consisteth not in <i>word</i>, it cannot be <i>dissolved</i>; such was the love of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the rest of the patriarchs which were before them."</p>
