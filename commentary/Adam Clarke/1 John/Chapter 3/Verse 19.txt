<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Hereby we know that we are of the truth</b></i> â€” That we have the true religion of the Lord Jesus, <i>and shall assure our</i> <i>hearts</i>-be persuaded in our consciences, that we have the truth as it is in Jesus; as no man can <i>impose upon himself</i> by imagining he <i>loves</i> when he <i>does not</i>: he may make empty <i>professions</i> to <i>others</i>, but if he loves either God or man, he <i>knows</i> it because he <i>feels</i> it; and love <i>unfelt</i> is not love, it is <i>word</i> or <i>tongue</i>. This the apostle lays down as a <i>test</i> of a man's Christianity, and it is the strongest and most infallible test that can be given. He that loves <i>feels</i> that he does love; and he who <i>feels</i> that he loves God and man has true religion; and he who is careful to show the fruits of this love, in obedience to God and humane acts to man, gives <i>others</i> the fullest proof that he has the loving mind that was in Jesus.</p>
