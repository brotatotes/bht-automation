<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>. <i><b>Now are we the sons of God</b></i> — He speaks of those who are <i>begotten</i> of God, and who work righteousness. See the preceding chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>And it doth not yet appear what we shall be</b></i> — ουπω εφανερωθη. <i>It is not yet manifest</i>; though we <i>know</i> that we are the children of God, we do not know that state of glorious excellence to which, as such, we shall be raised.</p>
<p><i><b>When he shall appear</b></i> — εαν φανερωθη. <i>When he shall be</i> <i>manifested</i>; i.e., when he comes the second time, and shall be manifested in his glorified human nature to judge the world.</p>
<p><i><b>We shall be like him</b></i> — For our vile bodies shall be made like unto his glorious body; <i>we shall see him as he is</i>, in all the glory and majesty both of the Divine and human nature. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>: <i>Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me</i> <i>where I am, that they may behold my glory</i>. John had seen his glory on the mount when he was transfigured; and this we find was ineffably grand; but even this must have been partially obscured, in order to enable the disciples to bear the sight, for they were not then <i>like him</i>. But when they shall be like him, they shall see him <i>as he is</i>-in all the splendour of his infinite majesty.</p>
