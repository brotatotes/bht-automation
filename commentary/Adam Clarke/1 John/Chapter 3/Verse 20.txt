<p>Verse 20. <i><b>If our heart condemn us</b></i> â€” If we be <i>conscious</i> that our love is <i>feigned</i>, we shall feel inwardly condemned in professing to have what we have not. <i>And if our heart condemn us,</i> <i>God is greater than our heart</i>, for he knows every hypocritical winding and turning of the soul, he searches the heart, and tries the reins, and sees all the deceitfulness and desperate wickedness of the heart which we cannot see, and, if we could see them, could not comprehend them; and as he is the just Judge, he will condemn us more <i>strictly</i> and <i>extensively</i> than we can be by our own <i>conscience</i>.</p>
