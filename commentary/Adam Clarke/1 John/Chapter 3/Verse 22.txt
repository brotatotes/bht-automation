Verse 22. Whatsoever we ask — In such a spirit, we receive of him, for he delights to bless the humble, upright, and sincere soul.Because we keep his commandments — Viz., by loving him and loving our neighbour. These are the great commandments both of the old covenant and the new. And whoever is filled with this love to God and man will do those things which are pleasing to him; for love is the very soul and principle of obedience.The word heart is used in the preceding verses for conscience; and so the Greek fathers interpret it, particularly Origen, Nicephorus, and OEcumenius; but this is not an unfrequent meaning of the word in the sacred writings.
