<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Whatsoever we ask</b></i> — In such a spirit, <i>we receive of</i> <i>him</i>, for he delights to bless the humble, upright, and sincere soul.</p>
<p><i><b>Because we keep his commandments</b></i> — Viz., by loving him and loving our neighbour. These are the great commandments both of the old covenant and the new. And whoever is filled with this love to God and man will <i>do those things which are pleasing to</i> <i>him</i>; for <i>love</i> is the very soul and principle of obedience.</p>
<p>The word <i>heart</i> is used in the preceding verses for <i>conscience</i>; and so the Greek fathers interpret it, particularly Origen, Nicephorus, and OEcumenius; but this is not an unfrequent meaning of the word in the sacred writings.</p>
