<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>. <i><b>And ever man that hath this hope in him</b></i> — All who have the hope of seeing Christ as he is; that is, of <i>enjoying</i> him in his own glory; <i>purifieth himself</i>-abstains from all evil, and keeps himself from all that is in the world, viz., the lusts of the flesh, of the eye, and the pride of life. God having purified his heart, it is his business to <i>keep himself in the love of God,</i> <i>looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life</i>. The apostle does not here speak of any man purifying his own heart, because this is impossible; but of his <i>persevering</i> in the state of purity into which the Lord hath brought him. The words, however, may be understood of a man's anxiously using all the means that lead to purity; and imploring God for the sanctifying Spirit, to "cleanse the thoughts of his heart by its inspiration, that he may perfectly love him, and worthily magnify his name."</p>
<p><i><b>As he is pure.</b></i> — Till he is as completely saved from his sins as Christ was free from sin. Many tell us that "this never can be done, <i>for</i> no man can be saved from sin in this life." Will these persons permit us to ask, how much sin may we be saved from in this life? Something must be <i>ascertained</i> on this subject: 1. That the soul may have some <i>determinate object</i> in view; 2. That it may not lose its time, or employ its faith and energy, in praying for what is <i>impossible</i> to be attained. Now, as he was manifested to take away our sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>, to destroy the works of the devil, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:8">1 John 3:8</span>; and as his blood cleanseth from all sin and unrighteousness, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:9">1 John 1:9</span>; is it not evident that God means that believers in Christ shall be saved from all sin? For if his blood cleanses from all sin, if he destroys the works of the devil, (and sin is the work of the devil,) and if he who is born of God does not commit sin, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span>, then he must be cleansed from all sin; and, while he continues in that state he lives without sinning against God, <i>for the seed of God remaineth in him,</i> <i>and he cannot sin because he is born, or begotten, of God,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span>. How strangely warped and blinded by prejudice and system must men be who, in the face of such evidence as this, will still dare to maintain that no man can be saved from his sin in this life; but must daily commit sin, in thought, word, and deed, as the Westminster divines have asserted: that is, every man is laid under the <i>fatal necessity</i> of sinning as many ways against God as the devil does through his natural wickedness and malice; for even the devil himself can have no other way of sinning against God except by <i>thought, word</i>, and <i>deed</i>. And yet, according to these, and others of the same creed, "even the most regenerate sin thus against God as long as they live." It is a miserable salvo to say, they do not sin so much as they used to do; and they do not sin <i>habitually</i>, only occasionally. Alas for this system! Could not the grace that saved them <i>partially</i> save them <i>perfectly</i>? Could not that power of God that saved them from <i>habitual</i> sin, save them from <i>occasional</i> or accidental sin? Shall we suppose that sin, how potent soever it may be, is as potent as the Spirit and grace of Christ? And may we not ask, If it was for God's glory and their good that they were <i>partially saved</i>, would it not have been more for God's glory and their good if they had been <i>perfectly saved</i>? But the letter and spirit of God's word, and the design and end of Christ's coming, is to save his people <i>from</i> their sins. Dr. Macknight having stated that αγνιζει, <i>purifieth</i>, is in the <i>present</i> tense, most ridiculously draws this conclusion from it: "In this life no one can attain to perfect purity; by this text, therefore, as well as by <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:8">John 1:8</span>, those fanatics are condemned who imagine they are able to live without sin." Yes, doctor, the men you call <i>fanatics</i> do most religiously believe that, by the grace of Christ cleansing and strengthening them, they can love God with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength, and their neighbour as themselves; and live without grieving the Spirit of God, and without sinning against their heavenly Father. And they believe that, if they are not thus saved, it is <i>their own</i> <i>fault</i>. But a blind man must ever be a bad judge of colours.</p>
