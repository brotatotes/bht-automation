<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:4">1 John 3:4</span>. <i><b>Sin is the transgression of the law.</b></i> â€” The spirit of the law as well as of the Gospel is, that "we should love God with all our powers, and our neighbour as ourselves." All disobedience is contrary to love; therefore sin is the <i>transgression of the</i> <i>law</i>, whether the act refers immediately to God or to our neighbour.</p>
