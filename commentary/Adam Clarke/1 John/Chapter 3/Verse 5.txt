<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>. <i><b>And ye know that he was manifested to take away our</b></i><b> </b><i><b>sins</b></i> — He came into the world to destroy the power, pardon the guilt, and cleanse from the pollution of sin. This was the very <i>design</i> of his manifestation in the flesh. He was born, suffered, and died for this very purpose; and can it be supposed that he either <i>cannot</i> or <i>will not</i> accomplish the object of his own coming?</p>
<p><i><b>In him is no sin.</b></i> — And therefore he is properly qualified to be the atoning sacrifice for the sins of men.</p>
