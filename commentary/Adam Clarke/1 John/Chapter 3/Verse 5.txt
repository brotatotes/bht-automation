Verse 1 John 3:5. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins — He came into the world to destroy the power, pardon the guilt, and cleanse from the pollution of sin. This was the very design of his manifestation in the flesh. He was born, suffered, and died for this very purpose; and can it be supposed that he either cannot or will not accomplish the object of his own coming?In him is no sin. — And therefore he is properly qualified to be the atoning sacrifice for the sins of men.
