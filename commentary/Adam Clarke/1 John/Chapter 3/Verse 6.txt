<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Whosoever abideth in him</b></i> — By faith, love, and obedience.</p>
<p><i><b>Sinneth not</b></i> — Because his heart is purified by faith, and he is a worker together with God, and consequently does not receive the grace of God in vain. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Hath not seen him</b></i> — It is no unusual thing with this apostle, both in his gospel and in his epistles, to put occasionally the <i>past</i> for the <i>present</i>, and the <i>present</i> for the <i>past</i> tense. It is very likely that here he puts, after the manner of the Hebrew, the <i>preterite</i> for the <i>present</i>: He who sins against God <i>doth not</i> <i>see him, neither doth he know him</i>-the eye of his faith is darkened, so that he cannot see him as he formerly did; and he has no longer the experimental <i>knowledge</i> of God as his Father and portion.</p>
