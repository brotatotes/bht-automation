<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Let no man deceive you</b></i> — Either by asserting that "you cannot be saved from sin in this life," or "that sin will do you no harm and cannot alter your state, if you are adopted into the family of God; for sin cannot annul this adoption." Hear God, ye deceivers! <i>He that doeth righteousness is righteous</i>, according to his state, nature, and the extent of his moral powers.</p>
<p><i><b>Even as he is righteous.</b></i> — Allowing for the disparity that must necessarily exist between that which is <i>bounded</i>, and that which is <i>without limits</i>. As God, in the infinitude of his nature, is righteous; so they, being filled with him, are in their limited nature righteous.</p>
