<p>Verse 8. <i><b>He that committeth sin is of the devil</b></i> — Hear this, also, ye who plead for Baal, and cannot bear the thought of that doctrine that states believers are to be saved from all sin in this life! <i>He who committeth sin is</i> a child <i>of the devil</i>, and shows that he has still the nature of the devil in him; <i>for the</i> <i>devil sinneth from the beginning</i>-he was the father of sin, brought sin into the world, and maintains sin in the world by living in the hearts of his own children, and thus leading <i>them</i> to transgression; and persuading <i>others</i> that they cannot be saved from their sins in this life, that he may secure a continual residence in their heart. He knows that if he has a place there throughout life, he will probably have it at death; and, if so, throughout eternity.</p>
<p><i><b>For this purpose</b></i> — ειςτουτο. <i>For this very end</i>-with this <i>very design</i>, was Jesus manifested in the flesh, <i>that he might</i> <i>destroy</i>, ιναλυση, <i>that he might loose</i>, the bonds of sin, and <i>dissolve</i> the power, influence, and connection of sin.
