<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>. <i><b>Beloved, believe not every spirit</b></i> — Do not be forward to believe every teacher to be a man sent of God. As in those early times every teacher professed to be <i>inspired</i> by the Spirit of God, because all the prophets had come thus accredited, the term <i>spirit</i> was used to express the man who pretended to <i>be</i> and <i>teach</i> under the Spirit's influence. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:1-12">1 Corinthians 12:1-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Try the Spirits</b></i> — δοκιμαζετε τα πνευματα. Put these teachers to the proof. Try them by that testimony which is known to have come from the Spirit of God, the word of revelation already given.</p>
<p><i><b>Many false prophets</b></i> — Teachers not inspired by the Spirit of God, <i>are gone out into the world</i>-among the Jewish people particularly, and among them who are carnal and have not the Spirit.</p>
