<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Not that we loved God</b></i> â€” And that he was thereby induced to give his Son <i>to be a propitiation for our sins</i>. No: we were enemies to God, and yet Christ died for our ungodly souls. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6-11">Romans 5:6-11</span>, and the notes there.) So it was God's love, not our merit, that induced him to devise means that his banished might not be expelled from him.</p>
