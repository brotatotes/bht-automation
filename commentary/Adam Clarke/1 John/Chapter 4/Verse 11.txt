<p>Verse 11. <i><b>If God so loved us</b></i> â€” Without any reason or consideration on our part, and without any <i>desert</i> in us; <i>we ought</i> <i>also</i>, in like manner, <i>to love one another</i>, and not suspend our love to a fellow-creature, either on his <i>moral worth</i> or his <i>love</i> <i>to us</i>. We should love one another for <i>God's sake</i>; and then, no unkind carriage of a brother would induce us to withdraw our love from him; for if it have GOD for its <i>motive</i> and <i>model</i>, it will <i>never fail</i>.</p>
