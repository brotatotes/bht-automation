<p>Verse 12. <i><b>No man hath seen God at any time.</b></i> — The very words, with the change of εωρακε for τεθεαται, of this apostle in his gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>. We may <i>feel</i> him, though we cannot <i>see</i> him; and if we love one another he <i>dwelleth in us</i>, and <i>his love is perfected in us</i>-it has then its full <i>accomplishment</i>, having moulded us according to its own nature.</p>
