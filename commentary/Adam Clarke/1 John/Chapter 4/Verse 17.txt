<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Herein is our love made perfect</b></i> — By God dwelling in us, and we in him; having cast out all the carnal mind that was <i>enmity</i> against himself, and filled the whole heart with the spirit of love and purity. Thus the love is made perfect; when it thus fills the heart it has all its <i>degrees</i>; it is all in all; and all in every power, passion, and faculty of the soul.</p>
<p><i><b>May have boldness in the day of judgment</b></i> — παρρησιαν. <i>Freedom</i> <i>of speech</i>, and <i>liberty of access</i>; seeing in the person of our Judge, him who has died for us, regenerated our hearts, and who himself fills them.</p>
<p><i><b>As he is</b></i> — Pure, holy, and loving; <i>so are we in this world</i>; being saved from our sins, and made like to himself in righteousness and true holiness. No man can contemplate the <i>day</i> <i>of judgment</i> with any comfort or satisfaction but on this ground, that the blood of Christ hath cleansed him from all sin, and that he is kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation. This will give him boldness in the day of judgment.</p>
