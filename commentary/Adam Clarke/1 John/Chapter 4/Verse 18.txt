<p>Verse 18. <i><b>There is no fear in love</b></i> — The man who feels that he loves God with all his heart can never <i>dread</i> him as his <i>Judge</i>. As he is now made a partaker of his Spirit, and carries a sense of the Divine approbation in his conscience, he has nothing of that <i>fear</i> that produces <i>terror</i> or brings <i>torment</i>. The <i>perfect</i> <i>love</i>-that fulness of love, which he has received, <i>casteth out</i> <i>fear</i>-removes all terror relative to this day of judgment, for it is of this that the apostle particularly speaks. And as it is inconsistent with the gracious design of God to have his followers miserable, and as he cannot be unhappy whose heart is full of the love of his God, this love must necessarily exclude this fear or terror; because that brings <i>torment</i>, and hence is inconsistent with that happiness which a man must have who continually enjoys the approbation of his God.</p>
<p><i><b>He that feareth</b></i> — He who is still <i>uncertain</i> concerning his interest in Christ; who, although he has many heavenly drawings, and often sits with Christ some moments on a throne of love, yet feels from the evils of his heart a dread of the day of judgment; <i>is not made perfect in love</i>-has not yet received the abiding witness of the Spirit that he is begotten of God; nor that fulness of love to God and man which excludes the <i>enmity</i> of the <i>carnal</i> <i>mind</i>, and which it is his privilege to receive. But is the case of such a man <i>desperate</i>? No: it is neither <i>desperate</i> nor <i>deplorable</i>; he is in the way of salvation, and not far from the kingdom of heaven. Let such earnestly seek, and fervently believe on the Son of God; and he will soon give them another baptism of his Spirit, will purge out all the old leaven, and fill their whole souls with that love which is the fulfilling of the law. He who is not yet perfect in love may speedily become so, because God can say in a moment, <i>I will, be thou clean; and immediately his</i> <i>leprosy will depart</i>. Among men we find some that have neither love nor fear; others that have fear without love; others that have love and fear; and others that have love without fear.</p>
<p>1. Profligates, and worldly men in general, have neither the fear nor love of God.</p>
<p>2. Deeply awakened and distressed penitents have the fear or terror of God without his love.</p>
<p>3. Babes in Christ, or young converts, have often distressing fear mixed with their love.</p>
<p>4. Adult Christians have love without this fear; because fear hath torment, and they are ever happy, being filled with God. See Mr. <i>Wesley's</i> note on this place.</p>
<p>1. We must not suppose that the love of God shed abroad in the heart is ever <i>imperfect</i> in <i>itself</i>; it is only so in <i>degree</i>. There may be a <i>less</i> or <i>greater degree</i> of what is <i>perfect</i> in itself; so it is with respect to the love which the followers of God have; they may have <i>measures</i> or <i>degrees</i> of perfect love without its <i>fulness</i>. There is nothing <i>imperfect</i> in the love of God, whether it be considered as existing in himself, or as communicated to his followers.</p>
<p>2. We are not to suppose that the love of God casts out <i>every</i> <i>kind of fear</i> from the soul; it only casts out that which has <i>torment</i>. 1. A <i>filial fear</i> is consistent with the highest degrees of love; and even necessary to the preservation of that grace. This is properly its guardian; and, without this, love would soon degenerate into listlessness, or presumptive boldness. 2. Nor does it cast out that <i>fear</i> which is so necessary to the <i>preservation of life</i>; that fear which leads a man to <i>flee from</i> <i>danger</i> lest his life should be destroyed. 3. Nor does it cast out that <i>fear</i> which may be engendered by <i>sudden alarm</i>. All these are necessary to our well-being. But it destroys, 1. The fear of <i>want</i>; 2. The fear of <i>death</i>; and 3. The fear or terror of <i>judgment.</i> All these fears bring torment, and are inconsistent with this perfect love.</p>
