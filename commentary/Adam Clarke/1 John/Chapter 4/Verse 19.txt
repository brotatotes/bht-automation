<p>Verse 19. <i><b>We love him because he first loved us.</b></i> â€” This is the foundation of our love to God. 1. We love him because we find he has loved us. 2. We love him from a sense of obligation and gratitude. 3. We love him from the influence of his own love; from his love shed abroad in our hearts, our love to him proceeds. It is the seed whence our love springs. The verse might be rendered, <i>Let us therefore love him, because he first loved us</i>: thus the <i>Syriac</i> and <i>Vulgate</i>.</p>
