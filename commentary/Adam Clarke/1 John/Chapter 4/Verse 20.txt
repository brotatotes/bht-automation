<p>Verse 20. <i><b>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother</b></i> — This, as well as many other parts of this epistle, seems levelled against the Jews, who pretended much love to God while they hated the <i>Gentiles</i>; and even some of them who were brought into the Christian Church brought this leaven with them. It required a miracle to redeem St. Peter's mind from the influence of this principle. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:0">Acts 10:0</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Whom he hath seen</b></i> — We may have our love excited towards our brother, 1. By a consideration of his <i>excellences</i> or <i>amiable</i> <i>qualities</i>. 2. By a view of his <i>miseries</i> and <i>distresses</i>. The <i>first</i> will excite a love of <i>complacency</i> and <i>delight</i>; the <i>second</i>, a love of <i>compassion</i> and <i>pity</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Whom he hath not seen?</b></i> — If he love not his brother, it is a proof that the love of God is not in him; and if he have not the love of God, he cannot love God, for God can be loved only through the influence of his own love. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:19">1 John 4:19</span>. The man who hates his fellow does not love God. He who does not love God has not the love of God in him, and he who has not the love of God in him can neither love God nor man.</p>
