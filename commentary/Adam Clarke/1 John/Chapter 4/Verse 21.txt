<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:21">1 John 4:21</span>. <i><b>This commandment have we</b></i> â€” We should love one another, and love our neighbour as ourselves. The love of God and the love of man can never be separated; he who loves God will love his brother; he who loves his brother gives this proof that he loves God, because he loves with a measure of that love which, in its infinitude, dwells in God.</p>
