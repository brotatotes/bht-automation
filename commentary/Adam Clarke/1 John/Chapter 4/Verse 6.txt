<p>Verse 6. <i><b>We are of God</b></i> — We, apostles, have the Spirit of God, and speak and teach by that Spirit. <i>He that knoweth God</i>-who has a truly spiritual discernment, <i>heareth us</i>-acknowledges that our doctrine is from God; that it is spiritual, and leads from earth to heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>Hereby know we the Spirit of truth</b></i> — The <i>doctrine</i> and <i>teacher</i> most prized and followed by <i>worldly men</i>, and by the <i>gay, giddy</i>, and <i>garish multitude</i>, are not from God; they savour of the <i>flesh</i>, lay on no restraints, prescribe no cross-bearing, and leave every one in full possession of his heart's lusts and easily besetting sins. And by this, false doctrine and false teachers are easily discerned.</p>
