<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Beloved, let us love one another</b></i> — And ever be ready to promote each other's welfare, both spiritual and temporal.</p>
<p><i><b>For love is of God</b></i> — And ever acts like him; he loves man, and daily loads him with his benefits. <i>He that loveth most</i> has most of God in him; and he that loveth God and his neighbour, as before described and commanded, <i>is born of God</i>, εκτουθεουγεγεννηται, <i>is begotten of God</i>-is a true child of his heavenly Father, for he is made a partaker of the Divine nature; and this his love to God and man proves.</p>
