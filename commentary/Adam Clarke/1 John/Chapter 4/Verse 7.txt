Verse 7. Beloved, let us love one another — And ever be ready to promote each other's welfare, both spiritual and temporal.For love is of God — And ever acts like him; he loves man, and daily loads him with his benefits. He that loveth most has most of God in him; and he that loveth God and his neighbour, as before described and commanded, is born of God, εκτουθεουγεγεννηται, is begotten of God-is a true child of his heavenly Father, for he is made a partaker of the Divine nature; and this his love to God and man proves.
