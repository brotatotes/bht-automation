<p>Verse 8. <i><b>He that loveth not</b></i> — As already described, <i>knoweth</i> <i>not God</i>-has no experimental knowledge of him.</p>
<p><i><b>God is love.</b></i> — An infinite fountain of benevolence and beneficence to every human being. He hates no thing that he has made. He cannot <i>hate</i>, because he is <i>love</i>. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends his rain on the just and the unjust. He has made no human being for perdition, nor ever rendered it impossible, by any necessitating decree, for any fallen soul to find mercy. He has given the fullest proof of his love to the whole human race by the incarnation of his Son, who tasted death for every man. How can a <i>decree</i> of absolute, unconditional <i>reprobation</i>, of the greater part or any part of the human race, stand in the presence of such a text as this? It has been well observed that, although God is holy, just, righteous, &amp;c., he is never called <i>holiness, justice</i>, &amp;c., in the <i>abstract</i>, as he is here called LOVE. This seems to be the essence of the Divine nature, and all other attributes to be only modifications of this.</p>
