<p>Verse 9. <i><b>In this was manifested the love of God</b></i> — The mission of Jesus Christ was the fullest proof that God could give, or that man could receive, of his infinite love to the world.</p>
<p><i><b>That we might live through him.</b></i> — The whole world was sentenced to <i>death</i> because of sin; and every individual was <i>dead in</i> <i>trespasses</i> and sins; and Jesus came to die in the stead of the world, and to <i>quicken</i> every believer, that all might live to him who died for them and rose again. This is another strong allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>: <i>God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that</i> <i>whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting</i> <i>life</i>; where the reader is requested to see the note.</p>
