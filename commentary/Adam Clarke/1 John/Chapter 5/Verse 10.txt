<p>Verse 10. <i><b>He that believeth on the Son of God</b></i> â€” This is God's witness to a truth, the most important and interesting to mankind. God has witnessed that <i>whosoever believeth on his Son</i> shall be saved, and have <i>everlasting life</i>; and shall have the <i>witness</i> of it <i>in himself</i>, the Spirit bearing witness with his spirit that he is a child of God. To <i>know</i>, to <i>feel</i> his sin forgiven, to have the testimony of this in the heart from the Holy Spirit himself, is the privilege of every true believer in Christ.</p>
