<p>Verse 11. <i><b>This is the record</b></i> â€” The great truth to which the <i>Spirit</i>, the <i>water</i>, and the <i>blood</i> bear testimony. <i>God hath</i> <i>given us eternal life</i>-a <i>right</i> to endless glory, and a <i>meetness</i> for it. <i>And this life is in his Son</i>; it comes <i>by</i> and <i>through</i> him; he is its <i>author</i> and its <i>purchaser</i>; it is only <i>in</i> and <i>through</i> HIM. No other scheme of salvation can be effectual; God has provided none other, and in such a case a man's invention must be vain.</p>
