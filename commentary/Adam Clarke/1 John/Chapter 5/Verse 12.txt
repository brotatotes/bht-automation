<p>Verse 12. <i><b>He that hath the Son hath life</b></i> â€” As the eternal life is given IN the Son of God, it follows that it cannot be enjoyed without him. No man can have it without having Christ; therefore <i>he that hath the Son hath life</i>, and <i>he that hath not the Son hath</i> <i>not life</i>. It is in vain to expect eternal glory, if we have not Christ in our heart. The indwelling Christ gives both a title to it, and a meetness for it. This is God's record. Let no man deceive himself here. An <i>indwelling Christ</i> and GLORY; <i>no</i> <i>indwelling Christ</i>, NO <i>glory</i>. God's record must stand.</p>
