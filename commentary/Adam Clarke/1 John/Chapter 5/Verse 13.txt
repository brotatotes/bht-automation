<p>Verse 13. <i><b>That ye may know that ye have eternal life</b></i> — I write to show your privileges-to lead you into this holy of holies-to show what believing on the Son of God is, by the glorious effects it produces: it is not a blind reliance <i>for</i>, but an actual enjoyment <i>of</i>, salvation; Christ living, working, and reigning in the heart.</p>
<p><i><b>And that ye may believe</b></i> — That is, continue to believe: for Christ dwells in the heart <i>only by</i> FAITH, and <i>faith</i> lives only by LOVE, and <i>love</i> continues only by OBEDIENCE; he who BELIEVES <i>loves</i>, and he who LOVES <i>obeys</i>. He who <i>obeys</i> loves; he who <i>loves</i> <i>believes</i>; he who <i>believes has</i> the <i>witness in himself</i>: he who has this witness has Christ in his heart, the hope of glory; and he who believes, loves, and obeys, has Christ in his heart, and is a man of <i>prayer</i>.</p>
