<p>Verse 14. <i><b>This is the confidence</b></i> — παρρησια, The <i>liberty of</i> <i>access</i> and <i>speech, that if we ask any thing according to his will</i>, that is, which he has <i>promised</i> in his <i>word</i>. His word is a <i>revelation</i> of his <i>will</i>, in the things which concern the salvation of man. All that God has <i>promised</i> we are justified in expecting; and what he has <i>promised</i>, and we <i>expect</i>, we should <i>pray for</i>. Prayer is the language of the children of God. He who is begotten of God <i>speaks</i> this language. He calls God Abba, Father, in the true spirit of supplication. <i>Prayer</i> is the language of dependence on God; where the soul is <i>dumb</i>, there is neither life, love, nor faith. Faith and prayer are not boldly to advance <i>claims</i> upon God; we must take heed that what we <i>ask</i> and <i>believe for</i> is agreeable to the <i>revealed will</i> of God. What we find <i>promised</i>, that we may <i>plead</i>.</p>
