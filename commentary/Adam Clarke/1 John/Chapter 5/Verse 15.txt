<p>Verse 15. <i><b>And if we know that he hear us</b></i> â€” Seeing we are satisfied that he hears the prayer of faith, requesting the things which himself has promised; <i>we know</i>, consequently, <i>that we have</i> <i>the petitions</i>-the answer to the <i>petitions, that we desired of him</i>; for he cannot deny himself; and we may consider them <i>as sure as if</i> <i>we had them</i>; and we shall have them <i>as soon</i> as we plead for and need them. We are not to ask <i>to-day</i> for mercy that we <i>now</i> need, and not receive it till <i>to-morrow</i>, or some <i>future</i> time. God gives it to him who prays, <i>when</i> it is needful.</p>
