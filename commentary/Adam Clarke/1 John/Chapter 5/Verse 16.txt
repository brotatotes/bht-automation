<p>Verse 16. <i><b>A sin</b></i><b> which is </b><i><b>not unto death</b></i> — This is an extremely difficult passage, and has been variously interpreted. What is the <i>sin not unto death</i>, for which we <i>should ask</i>, and life shall be given to him that commits it? And what is the <i>sin unto death</i>, for which we <i>should not pray</i>?</p>
<p>I shall note three of the chief opinions on this subject: -</p>
<p>1. It is supposed that there is here an allusion to a distinction in the Jewish law, where there was למיתה חטאה <i>chattaah</i> <i>lemithah</i>, "a sin unto death;" and למיתה לא חטאה <i>chattaah lo</i> <i>lemithah</i>, "a sin not unto death;" that is, 1. A <i>sin</i>, or transgression, to which the law had assigned the punishment of <i>death</i>; such as idolatry, incest, blasphemy, breach of the Sabbath, and the like. And 2. A sin not unto death, i.e. transgressions of ignorance, inadvertence, c., and such is, in their own nature, appear to be comparatively light and trivial. That such distinctions did exist in the Jewish synagogue both <i>Schoettgen</i> and <i>Carpzovius</i> have proved.</p>
<p>2. By the <i>sin not unto death</i>, for which intercession might be made, and <i>unto death</i>, for which prayer might not be made, we are to understand transgressions of the <i>civil law</i> of a particular place, some of which must be punished with <i>death</i>, according to the <i>statutes</i>, the crime admitting of <i>no pardon</i>: others <i>might</i> be punished with death, but the magistrate had the power of commuting the punishments, i.e. of changing <i>death</i> into <i>banishment</i>, c., for reasons that might appear to him satisfactory, or at the <i>intercession</i> of powerful friends. To <i>intercede</i> in the <i>former case</i> would be useless, because the law would not relax, therefore they need <i>not pray for it</i> but <i>intercession</i> in the <i>latter</i> case <i>might</i> <i>be prevalent</i>, therefore they <i>might pray</i> and if they did not, the person might suffer the punishment of death. This opinion, which has been advanced by <i>Rosenmuller</i>, intimates that men should feel for each other's distresses, and use their influence in behalf of the wretched, nor ever abandon the unfortunate but where the case is utterly hopeless.</p>
<p>3. <i>The sin unto death</i> means a case of transgression, particularly of grievous backsliding from the life and power of godliness, which God determines to punish with <i>temporal death</i>, while at the same time he extends mercy to the penitent soul. The <i>disobedient prophet</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ki+13:1-32">1 Kings 13:1-32</span>, is, on this interpretation, a case in point: many others occur in the history of the Church, and of every religious community. The <i>sin not unto death</i> is any sin which God does not choose <i>thus</i> to punish. This view of the subject is that taken by the late Rev. <i>J. Wesley</i>, in a sermon entitled, <i>A Call to Backsliders</i>.-WORKS, vol ii. page 239.</p>
<p>I do not think the passage has any thing to do with what is termed <i>the sin against the Holy Ghost</i>; much less with the popish doctrine of <i>purgatory</i>; nor with sins committed <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> baptism, the <i>former</i> pardonable, the latter <i>unpardonable</i>, according to some of the fathers. Either of the last opinions (viz., 2 and 3) make a good sense; and the <i>first</i> (1) is not unlikely: the apostle may allude to some <i>maxim</i> or <i>custom</i> in the Jewish Church which is not now distinctly known. However, this we know, that any penitent may find mercy through Christ Jesus; for through him every kind of sin may be forgiven to man, except the sin against the Holy Ghost; which I have proved no man can now commit.
