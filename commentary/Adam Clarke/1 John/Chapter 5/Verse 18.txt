<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Whosoever is born of God sinneth not</b></i> — This is spoken of adult Christians; <i>they</i> are <i>cleansed from all</i> <i>unrighteousness</i>, consequently from all <i>sin</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7-9">1 John 1:7-9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Keepeth himself</b></i> — That is, <i>in the love of God</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:21">Jude 1:21</span>, by building up himself on his most holy faith, and praying in the Holy Ghost; <i>and that wicked one</i>-the devil, <i>toucheth him not</i>-finds nothing of his own nature in him on which he can work, Christ dwelling in his heart by faith.</p>
