<p>Verse 20. <i><b>We know that the Son of God is come</b></i> â€” In the flesh, and has made his soul an offering for sin; <i>and hath given us an</i> <i>understanding</i>-a more eminent degree of light than we ever enjoyed before; for as he lay in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him unto us; and he hath besides given us a spiritual understanding, that we may know him who is true, even the TRUE GOD, and get eternal life from him through his Son, IN whom we are by faith, as the branches in the vine, deriving all our knowledge, light, life, love, and fruitfulness from him. And it is through this revelation of Jesus that we know the ever blessed and glorious Trinity; and the Trinity, <i>Father, Word</i>, and <i>Holy Ghost</i>, in the eternal, undivided unity of the ineffable Godhead.</p>
