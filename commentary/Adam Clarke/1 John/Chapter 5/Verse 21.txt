<p><i><b>Keep yourselves from idols.</b></i> — Avoid the idolatry of the heathens; not only have no <i>false gods</i>, but have the <i>true God</i>. Have no idols in your <i>houses</i>, none in your <i>churches</i>, none in your <i>hearts</i>.

<p>That is a man's <i>idol</i> or <i>god</i> from which he seeks his <i>happiness</i>; no matter whether it be Jupiter, Juno, Apollo, Minerva, Venus, or Diana; or pleasure, wealth, fame, a fine house, superb furniture, splendid equipage, medals, curiosities, books, titles, human friendships, or any earthly or heavenly thing, God, the supreme good, only excepted. That is a man's idol which prevents him from seeking and finding his ALL in God.</p>
<p><i>Wiclif</i> ends his epistle thus: <i>My little sones, kepe ye you fro</i> <i>mawmitis</i>, i.e. <i>puppets, dolls</i>, and such like; for thus Wiclif esteemed all <i>images</i> employed in religious worship. They are the <i>dolls</i> of a spurious Christianity, and the drivellings of religion in <i>nonage</i> and <i>dotage</i>. <i>Protestants</i>, keep yourselves from such <i>mawmets</i>!</p>
