<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:3">1 John 5:3</span>. <i><b>For this is the love of God</b></i> — This the love of God necessarily produces. It is vain to pretend love to God while we live in opposition to his will.</p>
<p><i><b>His commandments</b></i> — To love him with all our heart, and our neighbour as ourselves, <i>are not grievous</i>-are not burdensome; for no man is burdened with the duties which his own <i>love</i> imposes. The old proverb explains the meaning of the apostle's words, <i>Love</i> <i>feels no loads</i>. Love to God brings <i>strength</i> from God; through his <i>love</i> and his <i>strength</i>, all his commandments are not only easy and light, but pleasant and delightful.</p>
<p>On the love of God, as being the foundation of all religious worship, there is a good saying in <i>Sohar Exod</i>., fol. 23, col. 91: "Rabbi Jesa said, how necessary is it that a man should love the holy blessed God! For he can bring no other worship to God than love; and whoever loves him, and worships him from a principle of love, him the holy blessed God calls his beloved."</p>
