<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>. <i><b>Whatsoever is born of God</b></i> — Παν το γεγεννημενον· <i>Whatsoever</i> (the neuter for the masculine) <i>is begotten of God:</i> <i>overcometh the world</i>. "I understand by this," says <i>Schoettgen</i>, "the <i>Jewish Church</i>, or <i>Judaism</i>, which is often termed הזה עולם <i>olam hazzeh</i>, this world. The reasons which induce me to think so are, 1. Because this κοσμος, <i>world</i>, denied that the Messiah was come; but the Gentiles did not oppose this principle. 2. Because he proves the truth of the Christian religion against the <i>Jews</i>, reasoning according to the <i>Jewish manner</i>; whence it is evident that he contends, not against the <i>Gentiles</i>, but against the <i>Jews</i>. The sense therefore is, he who possesses the true Christian faith can easily convict the Jewish religion of falsity." That is, He can show the vanity of their expectations, and the falsity of their glosses and prejudices. Suppose we understand by the world the <i>evil principles</i> and <i>practices</i> which are among men, and in the human heart; then the influence of God in the soul may be properly said to <i>overcome</i> this; and by faith in the Son of God a man is able to overcome all that is in the world, viz., <i>the desire of the</i> <i>flesh, the desire of the eye</i>, and <i>the pride of life</i>.</p>
