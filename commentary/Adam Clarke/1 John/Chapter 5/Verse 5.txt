<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:5">1 John 5:5</span>. <i><b>He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</b></i> â€” That he is the promised Messiah, that he came by a supernatural generation; and, although truly <i>man</i>, came not <i>by man</i>, but by the power of the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgin Mary. The person who believes this has the privilege of applying to the Lord for the benefits of the incarnation and passion of Jesus Christ, and receives the blessings which the Jews cannot have, because they believe not the Divine mission of Christ.</p>
