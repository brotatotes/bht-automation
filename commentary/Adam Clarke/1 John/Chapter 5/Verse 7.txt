<p>Verse 7. <i><b>There are three that bear record</b></i> — The FATHER, who bears testimony to his Son; the WORD or λογος, <i>Logos</i>, who bears testimony to the Father; and the HOLY GHOST, which bears testimony to the Father and the Son. And <i>these three</i> are one in essence, and <i>agree in</i> the <i>one</i> testimony, that Jesus came to die for, and give life to, the world.</p>
<p>But it is likely this verse is not genuine. It is wanting in every MS. of this epistle written <i>before</i> the invention of printing, one excepted, the <i>Codex Montfortii</i>, in Trinity College, Dublin: the others which omit this verse amount to <i>one hundred and</i> <i>twelve</i>.</p>
<p>It is wanting in both the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic, AEthiopic</i>, the <i>Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, Slavonian</i>, c., in a word, in all the ancient <i>versions</i> but the <i>Vulgate</i> and even of this version many of the most ancient and correct MSS. have it not. It is wanting also in all the ancient Greek fathers; and in most even of the Latin.</p>
<p>The words, as they exist in all the Greek MSS. with the exception of the Codex <i>Montfortii</i>, are the following:-</p>
<p>"<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:6">1 John 5:6</span>. This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness because the Spirit is truth.</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:7">1 John 5:7</span>. For there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one.</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:9">1 John 5:9</span>. If we receive the witness of man, the witness of God is greater, c."</p>
<p>The words that are omitted by all the MSS., the above excepted, and all the <i>versions</i>, the <i>Vulgate</i> excepted, are these:-</p>
<p>[ln heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one, and there are three which bear witness in earth.]</p>
<p>To make the whole more clear, that every reader may see what has been <i>added</i>, I shall set down these verses, with the <i>inserted</i> words in brackets.</p>
<p>"<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:6">1 John 5:6</span>. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:7">1 John 5:7</span>. For there are three that bear record [in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:8">1 John 5:8</span>. And there are three that bear witness in earth,] the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, and these three agree in one.</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:9">1 John 5:9</span>. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater, c."</p>
<p>Any man may see, on examining the <i>words</i>, that if those included in brackets, which are wanting in the MSS. and <i>versions</i>, be omitted, there is no want of <i>connection</i> and as to the <i>sense</i>, it is complete and perfect without them and, indeed much more so than with them. I shall conclude this part of the note by observing, with Dr. Dodd, "that there are some internal and accidental marks which may render the passage suspected; for the sense is complete, and indeed more clear and better preserved, without it. Besides, the Spirit is mentioned, both as a witness in heaven and on earth; so that the six witnesses are thereby reduced to five, and the equality of number, or antithesis between the witnesses in heaven and on earth, is quite taken away. Besides, what need of witnesses in <i>heaven</i>? No one there doubts that Jesus is the Messiah; and if it be said that Father, Son, and Spirit are witnesses on earth, then there are five witnesses on earth, and none in heaven; not to say that there is a little difficulty in interpreting how the Word or the Son can be a witness to himself."</p>
<p>It may be necessary to inquire how this verse stood in our earliest English Bibles. In COVERDALE'S Bible, printed about 1535, for it bears no date, the <i>seventh</i> verse is put in brackets thus:-</p>
<p><i>And it is the Sprete that beareth wytnes; for the Sprete is the</i> <i>truth. (For there are thre which beare recorde in heaven: the</i> <i>Father, the Woorde, and the Holy Ghost, and these thre are one.)</i> <i>And there are thre which beare record in earth: the Sprete, water,</i> <i>and bloude and these thre are one. If we receyve, c.</i></p>
<p>TINDAL was as critical as he was conscientious and though he admitted the words into the text of the first edition of his New Testament printed in 1526, yet he distinguished them by a different letter, and put them in brackets, as <i>Coverdale</i> has done; and also the words <i>in earth</i>, which stand in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:8">1 John 5:8</span>, without proper authority, and which being excluded make the text the same as in the MSS., c.</p>
<p>Two editions of this version are now before me one printed in English and Latin, quarto, with the following title:-</p>
<p><i>The New Testament, both in Englyshe and Laten, of Master</i> <i>Erasmus translation-and imprinted by William Powell-the yere of</i> <i>out Lorde M.CCCCC.XLVII. And the fyrste yere of the kynges (Edw.</i> <i>VI.) moste gratious reygne.</i></p>
<p>In this edition the text stands thus:-</p>
<p><i>And it is the Spirite that beareth wytnes, because the Spirite</i> <i>is truth (for there are thre whiche beare recorde in heaven, the</i> <i>Father, the Worde, and the Holy Ghost, and these thre are one.)</i> <i>For there are thre which beare recorde, (in earth,) the Spirite,</i> <i>water, and blode, and these thre are one. If we receyve, c.</i></p>
<p>The other printed in London "by William Tylle, 4to without the Latin of Erasmus in M.CCCCC.XLIX. the thyrde yere of the reigne of our moost dreade Soverayne Lorde Kynge Edwarde the Syxte," has, with a small variety of spelling, the text in the same order, and the same words included in brackets as above.</p>
<p>The English Bible, with the book of Common Prayer, printed by <i>Richard Cardmarden</i>, at Rouen in Normandy, fol. 1566, exhibits the text faithfully, but in the following singular manner:-</p>
<p><i>And it is the Spyryte that beareth witnesse, because the</i> <i>Spyryte is truthe</i>. (for there are three which beare recorde in heaven, the Father, the Woorde, and the Holy Ghost; and these Three are One) <i>And three which beare recorde</i>* (in earth) <i>the</i> <i>Spirite, and water, and bloode; and these three are one</i>.</p>
<p>The first English Bible which I have seen, where these <i>distinctions</i> were omitted, is that called The <i>Bishops' Bible</i>, printed by Jugge, fol. 1568. Since that time, all such distinctions have been generally disregarded.</p>
<p>Though a conscientious believer in the doctrine of the ever blessed, holy, and undivided Trinity, and in the proper and essential Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, which doctrines I have defended by many, and even new, arguments in the course of this work, I cannot help doubting the authenticity of the text in question; and, for farther particulars, refer to the <i>observations</i> at the end of this chapter.</p>
