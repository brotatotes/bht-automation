<p>Verse 8. <i><b>The Spirit, and the water, and the blood</b></i> â€” This verse is supposed to mean "<i>the Spirit</i>-in the word confirmed by miracles; the <i>water</i>-in baptism, wherein we are dedicated to the Son, (with the Father and the Holy Spirit,) typifying his spotless purity, and the inward purifying of our nature; <i>and the blood</i>-represented in the Lord's Supper, and applied to the consciences of believers: and all these harmoniously agree in the same testimony, that Jesus Christ is the Divine, the complete, the only Saviour of the world."-Mr. <i>Wesley's</i> notes.</p>
<p>By the <i>written word</i>, which proceeded from the Holy Spirit, that Spirit is continually witnessing <i>upon earth</i>, that God hath given unto us eternal life.</p>
<p>By <i>baptism</i>, which points out our <i>regeneration</i>, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and which is still maintained as an initiatory rite in the Christian Church, we have another witness <i>on earth</i> of the truth, certainty, importance, and efficacy of the Christian religion. The same may be said of the <i>blood</i>, represented by the <i>holy eucharist</i>, which continues to show forth the death and atoning sacrifice of the Son of God till he comes.
