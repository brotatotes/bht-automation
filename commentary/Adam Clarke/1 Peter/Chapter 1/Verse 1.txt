<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>. <i><b>Peter, an apostle</b></i> — Simon Peter, called also <i>Kephas</i>: he was a fisherman, son of <i>Jonah</i>, brother of <i>Andrew</i>, and born at Bethsaida; and one of the first disciples of our Lord. See the <i>preface</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The strangers scattered throughout</b></i> — <i>Jews</i> first, who had believed the Gospel in the different countries here specified; and converted <i>Gentiles</i> also. Though the word <i>strangers</i> may refer to all truly religious people, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:9">Genesis 47:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:12">Psalms 39:12</span>, in the Septuagint, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>, yet the inscription may have a special reference to those who were driven by persecution to seek refuge in those heathen provinces to which the influence of their persecuting brethren did not extend.</p>
<p><i><b>Pontus</b></i> — An ancient kingdom of Asia Minor, originally a part of <i>Cappadocia</i>; bounded on the east by <i>Colchis</i>, on the west by the river <i>Halys</i>, on the north by the <i>Euxine Sea</i>, and on the south by <i>Armenia Minor</i>. This country probably derived its name from the <i>Pontus Euxinus</i>, on which it was partly situated. In the time of the Roman emperors it was divided into three parts: 1. <i>Pontus</i> <i>Cappadocius</i>; 2. <i>Pontus Galaticus</i>; and, 3. <i>Pontus Polemoniacus</i>. The first extended from the Pontus Polemoniacus to Colchis, having <i>Armenia Minor</i> and the upper stream of the <i>Euphrates</i> for its southern boundary. The <i>second</i> extended from the river <i>Halys</i> to the river <i>Thermodon</i>. The <i>third</i> extended from the river Thermodon to the borders of the Pontus Cappadocius.</p>
<p>Six kings of the name of <i>Mithridates</i> reigned in this kingdom, some of whom are famous in history. The last king of this country was <i>David Comnenus</i>, who was taken prisoner, with all his family, by <i>Mohammed</i> II. in the year 1462, and carried to Constantinople; since which time this country (then called the empire of <i>Trebizond</i>, from <i>Trapezas</i>, a city founded by the Grecians, on the uttermost confines of Pontus) has continued under the degrading power of the Turks.</p>
<p><i><b>Galatia</b></i> — The ancient name of a province of <i>Asia Minor</i>, now called <i>Amasia</i>. It was called also <i>Gallograecia</i>, and <i>Gallia Parva.</i> It was bounded on the east by <i>Cappadocia</i>, on the south by <i>Pamphylia</i>, on the north by the <i>Euxine Sea</i>, and on the west by <i>Bithynia</i>. See the preface to the Epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<p><i><b>Cappadocia</b></i> — An ancient kingdom of Asia, comprehending all the country lying between Mount Taurus and the Euxine Sea.</p>
<p><i><b>Asia</b></i> — This word is taken in different senses: It signifies, 1. One of the three general divisions of our continent, and one of the <i>four</i> of the whole earth. It is separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, the Archipelago, the Black Sea, the <i>Palus</i> <i>Maeolis</i>, the rivers <i>Don</i> and <i>Dwina</i>; and from Africa by the Arabic Gulf, or Red Sea: it is everywhere else surrounded by water. It is situated between latitude 2° and 77° N., and between longitude 26° E. and 170° W.; and is about 7,583 miles in length, and 5,200 miles in breadth.</p>
<p>2. Asia Minor, that part of Turkey in Asia, now called <i>Natolia</i>, which comprehends a great number of province situated between the Euxine, Mediterranean, and Archipelago.</p>
<p>3. That province of Asia Minor of which Ephesus was the capital. It appears, says Calmet, that it is in this latter sense that it is used here by St. Peter, because <i>Pontus, Galatia</i>, and <i>Bithynia</i>, are comprised in the provinces of <i>Asia Minor</i>. See <i>Calmet</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Bithynia</b></i> — An ancient kingdom of Asia, formerly called <i>Mysia,</i> <i>Mygdonia, Bebrycia</i>, and <i>Bithonia</i>. It was bounded on the west by the <i>Bosphorus, Thracius</i>, and part of the <i>Propontis</i>, on the south by the river <i>Rhyndacus</i>, and Mount <i>Olympus</i>, on the north by the Euxine Sea, and on the east by the river <i>Parthenius</i>. This place is in some sort rendered infamous by the conduct of <i>Prusias</i>, one of its kings, who delivered up Hannibal, who had fled to him for protection, into the hands of the Romans. <i>Nicomedes</i> IV. bequeathed it to the Romans; and it is now in the hands of the Turks.</p>
