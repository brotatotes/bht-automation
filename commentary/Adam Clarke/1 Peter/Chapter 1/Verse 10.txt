<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Of which salvation the prophets have inquired</b></i> — The incarnation and suffering of Jesus Christ, and the redemption procured by him for mankind, were made known, in a general way, by the prophets; but they themselves did not know the time when these things were to take place, nor the people among and by whom he was to suffer, c. they therefore <i>inquired accurately</i> or <i>earnestly</i>, εξεζητησαν, and <i>searched diligently</i>, εξηρευνησαν, <i>inquiring</i> of others who were then under the same inspiration, and <i>carefully</i> <i>searching</i> the writings of those who had, before their time, spoken of these things. The prophets plainly saw that the grace which was to come under the Messiah's kingdom was vastly superior to any thing that had ever been exhibited under the law; and in consequence they made all possible inquiry, and searched as after grains of gold, hidden among sand or compacted with ore, (for such is the meaning of the original word,) in order to ascertain the time, and the signs of that time, in which this wondrous display of God's love and mercy to man was to take place; but all that God thought fit to instruct them in was what is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>.</p>
