<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Unto whom it was revealed</b></i> — We may presume that, in a great variety of cases, the prophets did not understand the meaning of their own predictions. They had a general view of God's designs; but of particular circumstances, connected with those great events, they seem to have known nothing, God reserving the explanation of all particulars to the time of the issue of such prophecies. When they wished to find out the times, the seasons, and the circumstances, God gave them to understand that it <i>was not for themselves, but for us, that they did minister the</i> <i>things which are now reported unto us by the preaching of the</i> <i>Gospel</i>. This was all the satisfaction they received in consequence of their earnest searching; and this was sufficient to repress all needless curiosity, and to induce them to rest satisfied that the Judge of all the earth would do right. If all succeeding interpreters of the prophecies had been contented with the same information relative to the predictions still unaccomplished, we should have had fewer books, and more wisdom.</p>
<p><i><b>Angels desire to took into.</b></i> — παρακυψαι. <i>To stoop down to</i>; the posture of those who are earnestly intent on finding out a thing, especially a <i>writing</i> difficult to be read; they bring it to the light, place it so that the rays may fall on it as collectively as possible, and then <i>stoop down</i> in order to examine all the parts, that they may be able to make out the whole. There is evidently an allusion here to the attitude of the cherubim who stood at the ends of the ark of the covenant, in the inner tabernacle, with their eyes turned towards the mercy-seat or propitiatory in a bending posture, as if <i>looking attentively</i>, or, as we term it, <i>poring</i> upon it. Even the holy angels are struck with astonishment at the plan of human redemption, and justly wonder at the incarnation of that infinite object of their adoration. If then these things be objects of deep consideration to the <i>angels</i> of God, how much more so should they be to us; in them angels can have no such interest as human beings have.</p>
<p>We learn from the above that it was the <i>Spirit of Christ</i> in the Jewish prophets that prophesied of Christ; it was that Spirit which revealed him; and it is the same Spirit which takes of the things of Christ, and shows them unto us. Christ was never known by prophecy, but through his own Spirit; and he never was known, nor can be known, to the salvation of any soul, but by a revelation of the same Spirit. It is he alone that bears witness with our spirits that we are the children of God.</p>
