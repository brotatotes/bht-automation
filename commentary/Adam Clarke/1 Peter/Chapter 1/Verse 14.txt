<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Not fashioning yourselves</b></i> â€” As the <i>offices</i> of certain persons are known by the <i>garb</i> or <i>livery</i> they wear, so are transgressors: where we see the <i>world's livery</i> we see the <i>world's</i> <i>servants</i>; they <i>fashion</i> or <i>habit</i> themselves according to their <i>lusts</i>, and we may guess that they have a <i>worldly mind</i> by their conformity to <i>worldly fashions</i>.</p>
