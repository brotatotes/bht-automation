<p>Verse 15. <i><b>But as he which hath called you</b></i> â€” Heathenism scarcely produced a god whose example was not the most abominable; their greatest gods, especially, were paragons of impurity; none of their philosophers could propose the objects of their adoration as objects of imitation. Here Christianity has an infinite advantage over heathenism. <i>God is holy</i>, and he calls upon all who believe in him to <i>imitate his holiness</i>; and the reason why they should be holy is, that <i>God who has called them is holy</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span>.</p>
