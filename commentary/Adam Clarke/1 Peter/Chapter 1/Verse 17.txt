<p>Verse 17. <i><b>And if ye call on the Father</b></i> — Seeing ye invoke the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and your Father through Christ, and profess to be <i>obedient children</i>, and <i>sojourners</i> here below for a short time only, see that ye maintain a godly <i>reverence</i> for this Father, walking in all his testimonies blameless.</p>
<p><i><b>Who without respect of persons</b></i> — God is said to be <i>no respecter</i> <i>of persons</i> for this reason among many others, that, being infinitely righteous, he must be infinitely impartial. He cannot prefer one to another, because he has nothing to <i>hope</i> or <i>fear</i> from any of his creatures. All <i>partialities</i> among men spring from one or other of these two principles, <i>hope</i> or <i>fear</i>; God can feel neither of them, and therefore God can be no <i>respecter of persons</i>. He approves or disapproves of men according to their <i>moral</i> <i>character</i>. He pities all, and provides salvation for all, but he loves those who resemble him in his holiness; and he loves them in proportion to that resemblance, <i>i.e.</i> the more of his image he sees in any, the more he loves him; and <i>e contra</i>. And every <i>man's</i> <i>work</i> will be the <i>evidence</i> of his conformity or nonconformity to God, and according to this evidence will God judge him. Here, then, is no <i>respect of persons</i>; God's judgment will be according to a <i>man's work</i>, and a <i>man's work</i> or <i>conduct</i> will be according to the moral state of his mind. No <i>favouritism</i> can prevail in the day of judgment; nothing will pass there but <i>holiness</i> of <i>heart</i> and <i>life</i>. A righteousness imputed, and not possessed and practised, will not avail where God <i>judgeth according to every man's work</i>. It would be well if those <i>sinners</i> and <i>spurious believers</i> who fancy themselves safe and complete in the righteousness of Christ, while impure and unholy in themselves, would think of this testimony of the apostle.</p>
