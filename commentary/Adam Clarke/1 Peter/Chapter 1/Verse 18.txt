<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things</b></i> — To <i>redeem</i>, λυτροω, signifies to procure life for a captive or liberty for a slave by <i>paying a price</i>, and the <i>precious blood of Christ</i> is here stated to be the <i>price</i> at which the souls of both Jews and Gentiles were redeemed; is was a <i>price</i> paid down, and a price which God's righteousness required.</p>
<p>Corruptible things mean here any thing that man usually gives in exchange for another; but the term necessarily includes all created things, as all these are <i>corruptible</i> and <i>perishing</i>. The meaning of the apostle is, evidently, that created things could not purchase the souls of men, else the sacrifice of Christ had not been offered; could any thing less have done, God would not have given up his only-begotten Son. Even <i>silver</i> and <i>gold</i>, the most valuable medium of commerce among men, bear no proportion in their value to the souls of a lost world, for there should be a congruity between the <i>worth</i> of the thing <i>purchased</i> and the <i>valuable consideration</i> which is given for it; and the laws and customs of nations require this: on this ground, <i>perishable</i> <i>things</i>, or things the value of which must be infinitely less than the worth of the souls of men, cannot purchase those souls. Nothing, therefore, but such a <i>ransom price</i> as God provided could be a sufficient ransom, oblation, and satisfaction, for the sins of the world.</p>
<p><i><b>Vain conversation</b></i> — Empty, foolish, and unprofitable conduct, full of vain hopes, vain fears, and vain wishes.</p>
<p><b>Received </b><i><b>by tradition from your fathers</b></i> — The <i>Jews</i> had innumerable burdens of empty ceremonies and useless ordinances, which they received <i>by tradition</i> from their fathers, rabbins, or doctors. The <i>Gentiles</i> were not less encumbered with such than the Jews; all were wedded to their <i>vanities</i>, because they received them from their <i>forefathers</i>, as <i>they</i> had done from <i>theirs</i>. And this <i>antiquity</i> and <i>tradition</i> have been the ground work of many a vain ceremony and idle pilgrimage, and of numerous doctrines which have nothing to plead in their behalf but this mere antiquity. But such persons seem not to consider that <i>error</i> and <i>sin</i> are nearly <i>coeval</i> with the world itself.</p>
