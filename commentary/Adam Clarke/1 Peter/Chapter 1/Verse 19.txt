<p>Verse 19. <i><b>The precious blood of Christ</b></i> — τιμιω αιματι. <i>The</i> <i>valuable blood; how valuable</i> neither is nor could be stated.</p>
<p><i><b>As of a lamb</b></i> — Such as was required for a <i>sin-offering</i> to God; and THE <i>Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Without blemish</b></i> — In himself, and <i>without spot</i> from the world; being perfectly <i>pure</i> in his <i>soul</i>, and <i>righteous</i> in his <i>life</i>.</p>
