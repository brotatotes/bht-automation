<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>. <i><b>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God</b></i> — If the apostle had directed his letter to persons <i>elected to eternal</i> <i>life</i>, no one, as Drs. Lardner and Macknight properly argue, could have received such a letter, because no one could have been sure of his election in this way till he had arrived in heaven. But the persons to whom the apostle wrote were all, with propriety, said to be <i>elect according to the foreknowledge of God</i>; because, agreeably to the original purpose of God, discovered in the prophetical writings, Jews and Gentiles, indiscriminately, were called to be the visible Church, and entitled to all the privileges of the people of God, on their believing the Gospel. In this sense the word <i>elected</i> is used in other places of Scripture; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:4">1 Thessalonians 1:4</span>, and the note there.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. Wesley has an excellent note on this passage, which I shall transcribe for the benefit of those of my readers who may not have his works at hand.</p>
<p>"Strictly speaking, there is no <i>foreknowledge</i>, no more than <i>afterknowledge</i>, with God; but all things are known to him as <i>present</i>, from eternity to eternity. <i>Election</i>, in the scriptural sense, is God's doing any thing that our merit or power has no part in. The true predestination or foreappointment of God is,</p>
<p>1. He that believeth shall be saved from the guilt and power of sin.</p>
<p>2. He that endureth to the end shall be saved eternally. </p>
<p>3. They who receive the precious gift of faith thereby become the sons of God; and, being sons, they shall receive the Spirit of holiness, to walk as Christ also walked.</p>
<p>Throughout every part of this appointment of God, <i>promise</i> and <i>duty</i> go hand in hand. All is free gift; and yet, such is the gift, that it depends in the final issue on our future obedience to the heavenly call. But other predestination than this, either to life or death eternal, the Scripture knows not of: moreover,</p>
<p>1. It is cruel respect of persons; an unjust regard of one, and an unjust disregard of another: it is mere <i>creature partiality</i>, and not <i>infinite justice</i>.</p>
<p>2. It is not <i>plain</i> Scripture doctrine, (if true,) but rather inconsistent with the express written word that speaks of God's universal offers of grace; his invitations, promises, threatenings, being all general. </p>
<p>3. We are bid to choose life, and reprehended for not doing it. </p>
<p>4. It is inconsistent with a state of probation in those that <i>must</i> be saved, or <i>must</i> be lost.</p>
<p>5. It is of fatal consequence; all men being ready, on very slight grounds, to <i>fancy</i> themselves of the elect number.</p>
<p>But the doctrine of predestination is entirely changed from what it formerly was: now it implies neither faith, peace, nor purity; it is something that will do <i>without</i> them all. Faith is no longer, according to the modern predestination scheme, a Divine <i>evidence</i> <i>of things not seen</i> wrought in the soul by the immediate power of the Holy Ghost; not an <i>evidence</i> at all, but a <i>mere notion</i>: neither is faith made any longer a means of holiness, but something that will do without it. Christ is no more a Saviour <i>from sin</i>, but a defence and a countenancer of it. He is no more a fountain of spiritual life in the souls of believers, but leaves his elect inwardly <i>dry</i>, and outwardly <i>unfruitful</i>; and is made little more than a refuge from the image of the heavenly, even from righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."</p>
<p><i><b>Through sanctification of the Spirit</b></i> — through the renewing and purifying influences of his Spirit on their souls, <i>unto</i> <i>obedience</i> - to engage and enable them to yield themselves up to all holy obedience, the foundation of all which is the <i>sprinkling of</i> <i>the blood of Jesus Christ</i> - the atoning blood of Jesus Christ which was typified by the sprinkling of the blood of sacrifices under the law, in allusion to which it is called the <i>blood of</i> <i>sprinkling</i>.</p>
