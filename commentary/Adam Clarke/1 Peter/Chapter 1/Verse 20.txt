<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Who verily was foreordained</b></i> — προεγνωσμενου. <i>Foreknown; appointed</i> in the Divine purpose to be sent into the world, because infinitely <i>approved</i> by the Divine justice.</p>
<p><i><b>Before the foundation of the world</b></i> — Before the law was given, or any sacrifice prescribed by it. Its whole sacrificial system was appointed in reference to this <i>foreappointed Lamb</i>, and consequently from him derived all its significance and virtue. The phrase καταβοληκοσμου, <i>foundation of the world</i>, occurs often in the New Testament, and is supposed by some learned men and good critics to signify the <i>commencement of the Jewish state</i>. Perhaps it may have this meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:35">Matthew 13:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:50">Luke 11:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3">Hebrews 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>. But if we take it here in its common signification, the <i>creation of universal nature</i>, then it shows that God, foreseeing the fall and ruin of man, appointed the remedy that was to cure the disease. It may here have a reference to the opinion of the Jewish doctors, who maintain that <i>seven</i> things existed before the creation of the world, one of which was the Messiah.</p>
<p><i><b>Last times</b></i> — The Gospel dispensation, called the <i>last times</i>, as we have often seen, because never to be succeeded by any other.</p>
