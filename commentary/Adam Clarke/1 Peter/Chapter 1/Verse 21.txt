Verse 21. Who by him do believe in God — This is supposed to refer to the Gentiles, who never knew the true God till they heard the preaching of the Gospel: the Jews had known him long before, but the Gentiles had every thing to learn when the first preachers of the Gospel arrived amongst them.Gave him glory — Raised him to his right hand, where, as a Prince and a Saviour, he gives repentance and remission of sins.That your faith — In the fulfilment of all his promises, and your hope of eternal glory, might be in God, who is unchangeable in his counsels, and infinite in his mercies.
