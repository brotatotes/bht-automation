<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Who by him do believe in God</b></i> — This is supposed to refer to the <i>Gentiles</i>, who never knew the true God till they heard the preaching of the Gospel: the Jews had known him long before, but the Gentiles had every thing to learn when the first preachers of the Gospel arrived amongst them.</p>
<p><i><b>Gave him glory</b></i> — Raised him to his right hand, where, as a Prince and a Saviour, he gives repentance and remission of sins.</p>
<p><i><b>That your faith</b></i> — In the fulfilment of all his promises, and <i>your hope</i> of eternal glory, <i>might be in God</i>, who is unchangeable in his counsels, and infinite in his mercies.</p>
