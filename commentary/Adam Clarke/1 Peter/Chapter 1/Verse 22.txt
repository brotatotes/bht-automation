<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Seeing ye have purified your souls</b></i> — Having purified your souls, <i>in obeying the truth</i>-by believing in Christ Jesus, <i>through</i> the influence and teaching of <i>the Spirit</i>; and giving full proof of it by <i>unfeigned love</i> to the <i>brethren</i>; ye <i>love one</i> <i>another</i>, or <i>ye will love each other, with a pure heart fervently</i>. These persons, <i>First</i>, heard the <i>truth</i>, that is, the <i>Gospel</i>; thus called in a great variety of places in the New Testament, because it contains THE <i>truth</i> without mixture of error, and is the <i>truth</i> and substance of all the preceding dispensations by which it was typified. <i>Secondly</i>, they <i>obeyed</i> that <i>truth</i>, by believing on Him who came into the world to save sinners. <i>Thirdly</i>, through this believing on the Son of God, their hearts were purified by the word of truth applied to them by the Holy Spirit. <i>Fourthly</i>, the love of God being shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, they loved the brethren with pure hearts fervently, εκτενως, <i>intensely</i> or <i>continually</i>; the full proof that their <i>brotherly love</i> was <i>unfeigned</i>, φιλαδελφιαν ανυποκριτον, a <i>fraternal affection</i> <i>without hypocrisy</i>.</p>
