<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Being born again</b></i> — For being born of Abraham's seed will not avail to the entering of the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p><i><b>Not of corruptible seed</b></i> — By no human generation, or earthly means; <i>but of incorruptible </i>- a Divine and heavenly principle which is not liable to decay, nor to be affected by the changes and chances to which all sublunary things are exposed.</p>
<p><i><b>By the word of God</b></i> — Δια λογου ζωντος Θεου· By the <i>doctrine of</i> <i>the living God, which remaineth for ever</i>; which doctrine shall never change, any more than the source shall whence it proceeds.</p>
