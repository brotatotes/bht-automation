Verse 23. Being born again — For being born of Abraham's seed will not avail to the entering of the kingdom of heaven.Not of corruptible seed — By no human generation, or earthly means; but of incorruptible - a Divine and heavenly principle which is not liable to decay, nor to be affected by the changes and chances to which all sublunary things are exposed.By the word of God — Δια λογου ζωντος Θεου· By the doctrine of the living God, which remaineth for ever; which doctrine shall never change, any more than the source shall whence it proceeds.
