<p>Verse 24. <i><b>For all flesh</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>as grass</b></i> â€” Earthly seeds, earthly productions, and earthly generations, shall fail and perish like as the grass and flowers of the field; for the <i>grass withereth</i>, and <i>the flower falleth off</i>, though, in the ensuing spring and summer, they may put forth new verdure and bloom.</p>
