<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>. <i><b>Blessed be the God and Father</b></i> — Ευλογητος ὁ Θεος και Πατηρ· <i>Blessed be God even the Father</i>, or <i>blessed be God, the</i> <i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>. The και, <i>and</i>, is omitted by the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, and the <i>AEthiopic</i>. But if we translate και, <i>even</i>, a meaning which it frequently has in the New Testament, then we have a very good sense: Let that God have praise who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and who deserves the praise of every human being for his infinite mercy to the world, in its redemption by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>Begotten us again unto a lively hope</b></i> — I think the apostle has a reference here to his own case, and that of his fellow apostles, at the time that Christ was taken by the Jews and put to death. Previously to this time they had strong confidence that he was the Messiah, and <i>that it was he who should redeem Israel</i>; but when they found that he actually expired upon the cross, and was buried, they appear to have <i>lost all hope of the great things</i> <i>which before they had in prospect</i>. This is feelingly expressed by the two disciples whom our Lord, after his resurrection, overtook on the road going to Emmaus, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13-24">Luke 24:13-24</span>. And the <i>hope</i>, that with them, <i>died with their Master</i>, and seemed to be <i>buried in his grave</i>, was restored by the <i>certainty</i> of his <i>resurrection</i>. From Christ's preaching, miracles, c., they had a <i>hope of eternal life</i>, and all other blessings promised by him by his <i>death</i> and <i>burial</i> this hope became nearly, if not altogether, <i>extinct</i>; but by his <i>resurrection</i> the hope was <i>revived</i>. This is very properly expressed here by being <i>begotten again to a living </i> <i>hope</i>, εις ελπιδα ζωσας, as some MSS. and versions have it, εις ελπιδα ζωης, <i>to the hope of life</i>; which one copy of the <i>Itala</i>, with <i>Augustine, Gildas, Vigilius</i> of <i>Tapsum</i>, and <i>Cassiodorus</i>, have considered as meaning <i>eternal life</i>, agreeably to the context; and therefore they read <i>vitae aeternae</i>.</p>
<p>The expressions, however, may include more particulars than what are above specified; as none can <i>inherit</i> eternal life except those who are <i>children</i> in the heavenly <i>family</i>, and none are <i>children</i> but those who are <i>born again</i>: then St. Peter may be considered as laying <i>here</i> the foundation of the hope of eternal life in the <i>regeneration of the soul</i>; for none can <i>legally</i> inherit but the children, and none are children of God till they are spiritually <i>begotten</i> and born <i>again</i>.</p>
<p>It is the Gospel alone that gives the well grounded hope of eternal life; and the ground on which this hope rests is the <i>resurrection of Christ</i> himself. The certainty of our Lord's resurrection is the <i>great seal</i> of the Gospel. Without this what is vision, what is prophecy, what is promise, what are even miracles, to that unbelief which is natural to man on such a subject as this? But the resurrection of the human nature of Christ, the incontestable proofs of this resurrection, and the ascension of our nature to heaven in his person, are such evidences of the possibility and certainty of the thing, as for ever to preclude all doubt from the hearts of those who believe in him.</p>
