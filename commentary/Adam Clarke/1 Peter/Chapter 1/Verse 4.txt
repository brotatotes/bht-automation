<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span>. <i><b>To an inheritance</b></i> — Called an <i>inheritance</i> because it belongs to the <i>children</i> of God. Eternal life cannot be a gift to any but <i>these</i>; for, even in heaven, the <i>lot</i> is dealt out according to <i>law</i>: if <i>children</i>, then <i>heirs</i>; if <i>not children</i>, then <i>not</i> <i>heirs</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Incorruptible</b></i> — αφθαρτον. It has no principles of <i>dissolution</i> or <i>decay</i> in it; and, therefore, must be totally different from this earth.</p>
<p><i><b>Undefiled</b></i> — αμιαντον. Nothing <i>impure</i> can enter it; it not only has no principles or seeds of <i>dissolution</i> in itself, but it can never admit any; therefore its deterioration is impossible.</p>
<p><i><b>Fadeth not away</b></i> — αμαρνατον. <i>It cannot wither</i>, it is always in <i>bloom</i>; a metaphor taken from those flowers that never lose their <i>hue</i> nor their <i>fragrance</i>. From the Greek αμαραντος we have our flowers called <i>amaranths</i>, because they preserve their hue and odour for a long time.</p>
<p><i><b>Reserved in heaven</b></i> — Such a place as that described above is not to be expected on <i>earth</i>; it is that which was typified by the earthly Canaan, and in reference to which the patriarchs endured all trials and difficulties in this life, as seeing Him who is <i>invisible</i>.</p>
