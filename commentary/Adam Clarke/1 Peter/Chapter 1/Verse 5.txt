<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:5">1 Peter 1:5</span>. <i><b>Who are kept</b></i> — φρουρουμενονς. <i>Who are defended as in</i> <i>a fortress</i> or <i>castle</i>. There is a remarkable correspondence between the two verbs used in this sentence: the verb τηρεω, signifies to <i>keep, watch, guard</i>; and τηρησις, is a <i>place of</i> <i>custody</i> or <i>prison</i>. And φρουρεω, from φρουρος, a <i>sentinel,</i> signifies to <i>keep as under a military guard</i>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:22">Galatians 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>. The true disciples of Christ are under the continual watchful care of God, and the inheritance is <i>guarded</i> for them. In some countries military posts are constantly kept on the <i>confines</i>, in order to prevent irruptions from a neighbouring people; and, in many cases, <i>heirs</i>, while in their <i>minority</i>, are kept in <i>fortified</i> <i>places</i> under military guards.</p>
<p><i><b>By the power of God</b></i> — Εν δυναμει Θεου· By the <i>mighty</i> and <i>miracle-working power of God</i>; for nothing less is necessary to keep and preserve, in this state of continual trial, a soul from the contagion that is in the world. But this <i>power of God</i> is interested in the behalf of the soul by <i>faith</i>; to believe is our work, the exertion of the almighty power is of God. No persevering without the power, and no power without <i>faith</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Ready to be revealed</b></i> — Or rather, <i>Prepared to be revealed</i>. The inheritance is <i>prepared</i> for you; but its glories will not be revealed till the <i>last time</i>-till ye have done with life, and passed through your probation, having held fast faith and a good conscience. Some by <i>salvation</i> understand the deliverance of the Christians from the sackage of Jerusalem, the end of the Jewish polity being called the <i>last time</i>; others suppose it to refer to the <i>day of judgment</i>, and the glorification of the body and soul in heaven.</p>
