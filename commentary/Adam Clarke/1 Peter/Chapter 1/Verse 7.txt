<p>Verse 7. <i><b>That the trial of your faith, being much more</b></i><b> </b><i><b>precious than of gold</b></i> — As by the action of fire gold is separated from all alloy and heterogeneous mixtures, and is proved to be gold by its enduring the action of the fire without losing any thing of its nature, weight, colour, or any other property, so genuine faith is proved by adversities, especially such as the primitive Christians were obliged to pass through. For the word was then, "Renounce Jesus and live," "Cleave to him and die;" for every Christian was in continual danger of losing his life. He then who preferred Christianity to his life gave full proof, not only of his own sincerity, but also of the excellency of the principle by which he was influenced; as his religion put him in possession of greater blessings, and more solid comforts, than any thing the earth could afford.</p>
<p><i><b>Though it be tried with fire</b></i> — That is: Though gold will bear the action of the fire for any given time, even millions of years, were they possible, without losing the smallest particle of weight or value, yet even gold, in process of time, will wear away by continual use; and the earth, and all its works, will be burnt up by that <i>supernatural</i> fire whose action nothing can resist. But on that day the faith of Christ's followers will be found brighter, and more glorious. The earth, and universal nature, shall be dissolved; but he who doeth the will of God shall abide for ever, and his faith shall then be found to the <i>praise</i> of God's grace, the <i>honour</i> of Christ, and the <i>glory</i> or glorification of his own soul throughout eternity. God himself will <i>praise</i> such faith, angels and men will hold it in <i>honour</i>, and Christ will crown it with <i>glory</i>. For some remarks on the nature and properties of gold see at the end of the chapter.</p>
