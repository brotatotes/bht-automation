<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Receiving the end of your faith</b></i> — Ye are put in possession of the salvation of your souls, which was the thing presented to your faith, when ye were called by the Gospel of Christ. Your faith has had a proper issue, and has been crowned with a proper recompense. The word τελος, <i>end</i>, is often used so as to imply the <i>issue</i> or <i>reward</i> of any labour or action.</p>
<p><i><b>Salvation of</b></i><b> your </b><i><b>souls.</b></i> — The object of the Jewish expectations in their Messiah was the salvation or deliverance of their bodies from a foreign yoke; but the true Messiah came to save the soul from the yoke of the devil and sin. This glorious salvation these believers had already received.</p>
