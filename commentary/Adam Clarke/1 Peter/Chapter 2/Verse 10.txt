<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Which in time past</b></i><b> were </b><i><b>not a people</b></i> â€” This is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+1:9-10">Hosea 1:9-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:23">Hosea 2:23</span>, where the <i>calling of the Gentiles</i>, by the preaching of the Gospel, is foretold. From this it is evident, that the people to whom the apostle now addresses himself had been <i>Gentiles</i>, covered with ignorance and superstition, and now had obtained mercy by the preaching of the Gospel of Christ.</p>
