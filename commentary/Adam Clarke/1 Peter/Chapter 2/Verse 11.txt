<p>Verse 11. <i><b>As strangers and pilgrims</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>. These were <i>strangers</i> and <i>pilgrims</i> in the most literal sense of the word, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>, for they were <i>strangers</i> scattered through Asia, Pontus, c.</p>
<p><i><b>Abstain from fleshly lusts</b></i> — As ye are <i>strangers</i> and <i>pilgrims</i>, and profess to seek a heavenly country, do not entangle your affections with earthly things. While others spend all their time, and employ all their skill, in acquiring earthly property, and totally neglect the salvation of their souls <i>they</i> are not <i>strangers</i>, they are here at <i>home</i>; they are not <i>pilgrims</i>, they are seeking an <i>earthly possession</i>: Heaven is <i>your home</i>, seek <i>that</i>; God is your <i>portion</i>, seek <i>him</i>. All kinds of earthly desires, whether those of the <i>flesh</i> or of the <i>eye</i>, or those included in the <i>pride of life</i>, are here comprised in the words <i>fleshly lusts</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which war against the soul</b></i> — αιτινες στρατευονται κατα της ψυχης. Which are <i>marshalled</i> and <i>drawn up in battle array</i>, to fight against the soul; either to slay it, or to bring it into captivity. This is the object and operation of every earthly and sensual desire. How little do those who indulge them think of the ruin which they produce!</p>
