<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man</b></i> — In every settled state, and under every form of political government, where the laws are not in opposition to the laws of God, it may be very soundly and rationally said: "Genuine Christians have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them." Society and civil security are in a most dangerous state when the people take it into their heads that they have a right to remodel and change the laws. See the whole of this subject fully handled in the notes on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1">Romans 13:1</span><i>"</i>, c., to which I beg every reader, who may wish to know the political sentiments of this work, to have recourse.</p>
<p>The words παση ανθρωπινη κτισει literally signify, not <i>every</i> <i>ordinance of man</i>, but <i>every human creature</i> yet κτιζειν signifies sometimes to <i>arrange, order</i>, as well as to <i>create</i>, and therefore our translation may do: but as the apostle is evidently speaking here of <i>magistracy</i>, or <i>legislative</i> authority, and as the appointment of magistrates was termed a creating of them, it is better to understand the words thus, All the constituted authorities. So, <i>Decem tribunos plebis per pontificem creaverunt</i>; Cor. Nep. "They created ten tribunes of the plebeians, by the high priest." <i>Carthagine quotannis annui bini reges creabantur</i>; Caesar. "They created two kings every year at Carthage." <i>Consules creantur Caesar et Servilius</i>; Sallust. "Caesar and Servilius are created consuls." <i>Creare ducem gerendo bello</i>. "To create a general to conduct the war." The meaning of St. Peter appears to be this: the Jews thought it unlawful to obey any ruler that was not of <i>their own stock</i>; the apostle tells them they should obey the civil magistrate, let him be of what stock he may, whether a Jew or a Gentile, and let him exercise the government in whatsoever <i>form</i>. This is the general proposition: and then he instances <i>emperors</i> and their <i>deputies</i>; and, far from its being unlawful for them to <i>obey a heathen magistrate</i>, they were to do it <i>for the Lord's sake</i>, δια τον κυριον, <i>on account of the Lord</i>, whose <i>will</i> it was, and who <i>commanded</i> it.</p>
