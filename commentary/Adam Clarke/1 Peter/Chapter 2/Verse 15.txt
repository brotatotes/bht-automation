<p>Verse 15. <i><b>For so is the will of God</b></i> — God, as their supreme governor, shows them that it is his will that they should act uprightly and obediently at all times, and thus confound the ignorance of foolish men, who were ready enough to assert that their religion made them bad subjects. The word φιμουν, which we translate <i>put to silence</i>, signifies to <i>muzzle</i>, i.e., stop their mouths, leave them nothing to say; let them <i>assert</i>, but ever be unable to bring proof to support it.</p>
