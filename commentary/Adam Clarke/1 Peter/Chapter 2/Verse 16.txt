<p>Verse 16. <i><b>As free</b></i> — The Jews pretended that they were a free people, and owed allegiance to God alone; hence they were continually rebelling against the Roman government, to which God had subjected them because of their rebellion against him: thus they <i>used their liberty for a cloak of maliciousness</i>-for a <i>pretext</i> of rebellion, and by it endeavoured to vindicate their seditious and rebellious conduct.</p>
<p><i><b>But as the servants of God.</b></i> — These were <i>free</i> from sin and Satan, but they were the <i>servants of God-bound</i> to obey him; and, as he had made it their duty to obey the civil magistrate, they served God by submitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake.</p>
