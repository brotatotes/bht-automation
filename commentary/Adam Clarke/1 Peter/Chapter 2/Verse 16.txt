Verse 16. As free — The Jews pretended that they were a free people, and owed allegiance to God alone; hence they were continually rebelling against the Roman government, to which God had subjected them because of their rebellion against him: thus they used their liberty for a cloak of maliciousness-for a pretext of rebellion, and by it endeavoured to vindicate their seditious and rebellious conduct.But as the servants of God. — These were free from sin and Satan, but they were the servants of God-bound to obey him; and, as he had made it their duty to obey the civil magistrate, they served God by submitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake.
