<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Honour all men.</b></i> — That is, Give honour to whom honour is due, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:7">Romans 13:7</span>. Respect every man as a fellow creature, and as one who may be a fellow heir with you of eternal life; and therefore be ready to give him every kind of succour in your power.</p>
<p><i><b>Love the brotherhood.</b></i> — All true Christians, who form one great family of which God is the head.</p>
<p><i><b>Fear God.</b></i> — Who gives you these commandments, lest he punish you for disobedience.</p>
<p><i><b>Honour the king.</b></i> — Pay that respect to the <i>emperor</i> which his high authority requires, knowing that civil power is of God; that the authority with which he, in the course of his providence, has invested him, must be respected in order to its being obeyed; and that if the man be even bad, and as a man be worthy of no reverence, yet he should be respected on account of his <i>office</i>. If respect be banished, subordination will flee with it, and anarchy and ruin will rise up in their place. Truly <i>religious</i> persons are never found in seditions. <i>Hypocrites</i> may join themselves with <i>any</i> class of the workers of iniquity, and say, <i>Hail, brethren</i>!</p>
