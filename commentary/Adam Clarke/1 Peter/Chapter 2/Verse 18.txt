Servants, be subject — Ephesians 6:5; "Colossians 3:22"; and "Titus 2:9".With all fear — With all submission and reverence.The good and gentle — Those who are ever just in their commands, never requiring more work than is necessary or proper, and always allowing sufficient food and sufficient time.The froward. — σκολιοις. The crooked, perverse, unreasonable morose, and austere. Your time belongs to your master; obey him in every thing that is not sinful; if he employs you about unreasonable or foolish things, let him answer for it. He may waste your time, and thus play the fool with his own property; you can only fill up your time: let him assign the work; it is your duty to obey.
