<p>Verse 18. <i><b>Servants</b></i><b>, be </b><i><b>subject</b></i> — <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span>; <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+3:22">Colossians 3:22</span><i>"</i>; and <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:9">Titus 2:9</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>With all fear</b></i> — With all submission and reverence.</p>
<p><i><b>The good and gentle</b></i> — Those who are ever just in their commands, never requiring more work than is necessary or proper, and always allowing sufficient <i>food</i> and sufficient <i>time</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The froward.</b></i> — σκολιοις. The crooked, perverse, unreasonable morose, and austere. Your time belongs to your master; obey him in every thing that is not sinful; if he employs you about unreasonable or foolish things, let him answer for it. He may waste your time, and thus play the fool with his own property; you can only fill up your time: let him assign the work; it is your duty to obey.</p>
