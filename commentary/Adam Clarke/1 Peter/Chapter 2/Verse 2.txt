<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:2">1 Peter 2:2</span>. <i><b>As new-born babes</b></i> — In the preceding chapter, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span>, the apostle states that they had been <i>born again</i>; and as the new-born infant desires that aliment which nature has provided for it, so they, being <i>born again</i>-born from above, should as earnestly require that heavenly nourishment which is suited to their new nature; and this the apostle calls the <i>sincere milk of the word</i>, το λογικον αδολον γαλα, or, as some translate, <i>the rational</i> <i>unadulterated milk</i>; i.e. the pure doctrines of the Gospel, as delivered in the epistles and gospels, and as preached by the apostles and their successors. The rabbins frequently express <i>learning to know the law</i>, c., by the term <i>sucking</i>, and their disciples are often denominated <i>those that suck the breast</i>. The figure is very expressive: as a child newly born shows an immediate desire for that nourishment, and that only, which is its most proper food so they, being just <i>born of God</i>, should show that the incorruptible seed abides in them, and that they will receive nothing that is not suited to that new nature: and, indeed, they can have no spiritual growth but by the pure doctrines of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye may grow thereby</b></i> — εις σωτηριαν, <i>Unto salvation</i>, is added here by ABC, and about forty others; both the <i>Syriac</i>, the <i>Arabic</i> of Erpen, <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Slavonic, Vulgate</i>, and several of the ancient <i>fathers</i>. The reading is undoubtedly <i>genuine</i>, and is very important. It shows why they were regenerated, and why they were to desire the unadulterated doctrines of the Gospel; viz.: that they might <i>grow up unto</i> <i>salvation</i>. This was the <i>end</i> they should always have in view; and nothing could so effectually promote this end as continually receiving the pure truth of God, claiming the fulfilment of its promises, and acting under its dictates.</p>
