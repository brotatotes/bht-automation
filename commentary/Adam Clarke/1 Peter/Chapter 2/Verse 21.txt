<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Hereunto were ye called</b></i> — Ye were called to a state of suffering when ye were called to be Christians; for the world cannot endure the yoke of Christ, and they that will live godly in Christ must suffer persecution; they will meet with it in one form or other.</p>
<p><i><b>Christ also suffered for us</b></i> — And left us the example of his meekness and gentleness; for when he was reviled, he reviled not again. Ye cannot expect to fare better than your master; imitate his example, and his Spirit shall comfort and sustain you. Many MSS. and most of the versions, instead of <i>Christ also suffered for</i> US, <i>leaving</i> US, &amp;c., read, <i>suffered for</i> YOU, <i>leaving</i> YOU, &amp;c. This reading, which I think is genuine, is noticed in the <i>margin</i>.</p>
