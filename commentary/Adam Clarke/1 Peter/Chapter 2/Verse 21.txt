Verse 21. Hereunto were ye called — Ye were called to a state of suffering when ye were called to be Christians; for the world cannot endure the yoke of Christ, and they that will live godly in Christ must suffer persecution; they will meet with it in one form or other.Christ also suffered for us — And left us the example of his meekness and gentleness; for when he was reviled, he reviled not again. Ye cannot expect to fare better than your master; imitate his example, and his Spirit shall comfort and sustain you. Many MSS. and most of the versions, instead of Christ also suffered for US, leaving US, &c., read, suffered for YOU, leaving YOU, &c. This reading, which I think is genuine, is noticed in the margin.
