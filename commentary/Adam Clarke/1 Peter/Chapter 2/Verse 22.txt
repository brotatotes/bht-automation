<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Who did no sin</b></i> â€” He suffered, but not on account of any evil he had either <i>done</i> or <i>said</i>. In <i>deed</i> and <i>word</i> he was immaculate, and yet he was exposed to suffering; expect the same, and when it comes bear it in the same spirit. It is very likely that the apostle mentions <i>guile</i>, because those who do wrong generally strive to screen themselves by prevarication and lies. These words appear to be a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:9">Isaiah 53:9</span>.</p>
