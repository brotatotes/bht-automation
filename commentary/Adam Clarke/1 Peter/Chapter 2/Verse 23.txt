<p>Verse 23. <i><b>But committed</b></i><b> himself</b>] Though he could have inflicted any kind of punishment on his persecutors, yet to give <i>us</i>, in this respect also, an example that we should follow his steps, <i>he committed his cause</i> to him who is the <i>righteous Judge</i>. To avoid evil tempers, and the uneasiness and danger of avenging ourselves, it is a great advantage in all such cases to be able to refer our cause to God, and to be assured that the Judge of all the earth will do right.</p>
<p>The <i>Vulgate</i>, one copy of the <i>Itala</i>, St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and <i>Fulgentius</i>, read, <i>Tradebat autem judicanti se injuste</i>; "He delivered himself to him who judged unrighteously;" meaning Pontius Pilate. Some critics approve of this reading, but it has not sufficient evidence to recommend it as genuine.</p>
