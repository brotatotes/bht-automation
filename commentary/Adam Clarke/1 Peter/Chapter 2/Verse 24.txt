<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Who his own self</b></i> — Not <i>another</i> in his <i>place</i>, as some anciently supposed, because they thought it impossible that the Christ should suffer.</p>
<p><i><b>Bare our sins in his own body</b></i> — Bore the punishment due to our sins. In no other sense could Christ bear them. To say that they were so <i>imputed</i> to him as if they had been <i>his own</i>, and that the Father beheld him as <i>blackened with imputed sin</i>, is monstrous, if not blasphemous.</p>
<p><i><b>That we, being dead to sins</b></i> — Ἱνα ταις ἁμαρτιαις απογενομενοι· <i>That we, being freed from sin</i>-delivered out of its power, and from under its tyranny.</p>
<p><i><b>Should live unto righteousness</b></i> — That <i>righteousness</i> should be our <i>master</i> now, as <i>sin</i> was before. He is speaking still lo <i>servants</i> who were under an oppressive yoke, and were cruelly used by their masters, scourged, buffeted, and variously maltreated.</p>
<p><i><b>By whose stripes ye were healed.</b></i> — The apostle refers here to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:4-6">Isaiah 53:4-6</span>; and he still keeps the case of these persecuted servants in view, and encourages them to suffer patiently by the example of Christ, who was <i>buffeted</i> and <i>scourged</i>, and who bore all this that the deep and inveterate <i>wounds</i>, inflicted on their souls by sin, <i>might be healed</i>.</p>
