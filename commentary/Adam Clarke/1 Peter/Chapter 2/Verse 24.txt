Verse 24. Who his own self — Not another in his place, as some anciently supposed, because they thought it impossible that the Christ should suffer.Bare our sins in his own body — Bore the punishment due to our sins. In no other sense could Christ bear them. To say that they were so imputed to him as if they had been his own, and that the Father beheld him as blackened with imputed sin, is monstrous, if not blasphemous.That we, being dead to sins — Ἱνα ταις ἁμαρτιαις απογενομενοι· That we, being freed from sin-delivered out of its power, and from under its tyranny.Should live unto righteousness — That righteousness should be our master now, as sin was before. He is speaking still lo servants who were under an oppressive yoke, and were cruelly used by their masters, scourged, buffeted, and variously maltreated.By whose stripes ye were healed. — The apostle refers here to Isaiah 53:4-6; and he still keeps the case of these persecuted servants in view, and encourages them to suffer patiently by the example of Christ, who was buffeted and scourged, and who bore all this that the deep and inveterate wounds, inflicted on their souls by sin, might be healed.
