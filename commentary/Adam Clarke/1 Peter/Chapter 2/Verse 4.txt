<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>. <i><b>To whom coming</b></i><b>, as unto </b><i><b>a living stone</b></i> — This is a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>: <i>Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a</i> <i>precious corner stone, a sure foundation</i>. Jesus Christ is, in both the prophet and apostle, represented as the <i>foundation</i> on which the Christian Church is built, and on which it must continue to rest: and the <i>stone</i> or <i>foundation</i> is called here <i>living</i>, to intimate that he is the source of life to all his followers, and that it is in union with him that they live, and answer the end of their regeneration; as the stones of a building are of no use but as they occupy their proper places in a building, and rest on the foundation.</p>
<p><i><b>Disallowed indeed of men</b></i> — That is, rejected by the Jews. This is a plain reference to the prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>: <i>The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of</i> <i>the corner</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Chosen of God</b></i> — To be the Saviour of the world, and the Founder of the Church, and the foundation on which it rests; As Christ is the <i>choice</i> of the Father, we need have no doubt of the efficacy and sufficiency of all that he has suffered and done for the salvation of a lost world. God can never be mistaken in his <i>choice</i>; therefore he that chooses Christ for his portion shall never be confounded.</p>
<p><i><b>Precious</b></i> — εντιμον. <i>Honourable</i>. Howsoever despised and rejected by men, Jesus, as the sacrifice for a lost world, is infinitely honourable in the sight of God; and those who are united by faith to him partake of the same honour, being <i>members</i> of that great and glorious <i>body</i> of which he is the <i>head</i>, and <i>stones</i> in that superb <i>building</i> of which he is the <i>foundation</i>.</p>
