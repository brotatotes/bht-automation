<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>. <i><b>Ye also, as lively stones</b></i> — λιθοι ζωντες. <i>Living</i> <i>stones</i>; each being instinct with the principle of life, which proceeds from him who is the foundation, called above λιθον ζωντα, <i>a living stone</i>.</p>
<p>The metaphor in this and the following verse is as bold as it is singular; and commentators and critics have found it difficult to hit on any <i>principle</i> of explanation. In all metaphors there is something in the natural image that is illustrative of some chief moral property in the thing to be represented. But what analogy is there between the <i>stones</i> of a building and a multitude of <i>human</i> <i>beings</i>? We shall soon see. The Church of Christ, it is true, is represented under the figure of a <i>house</i>, or rather <i>household</i>; and as a <i>household</i> or <i>family</i> must have a <i>place</i> of residence, hence, by a <i>metonymy</i>, the <i>house</i> itself, or <i>material building</i>, is put for the <i>household</i> or <i>family</i> which occupies it, the <i>container</i> being put for the <i>contained</i>. This point will receive the fullest illustration if we have recourse to the Hebrew: in this language, בית <i>beith</i> signifies both a <i>house</i> and a <i>family</i>; בן ben a son; בת <i>bath</i> a daughter; and אבן <i>eben</i> a stone. Of all these nouns, בנה <i>banah</i>, he built, is, I believe, the common <i>root</i>. Now as בית <i>beith</i>, a house, is built of <i>abanim</i>, stones, hence בנה <i>banah</i>, he built, is a proper radix for both <i>stones</i> and <i>building</i>; and as בית <i>beith</i>, a family or <i>household</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:6">Psalms 68:6</span>) is constituted or made up of בנים <i>banim</i>, sons, and בנות <i>banoth</i> daughters, hence the same root בנה <i>banah</i>, he built, is common to all; for sons and daughters <i>build up</i> or constitute a <i>family</i>, as <i>stones</i> do a <i>building</i>. Here, then, is the ground of the metaphor: the <i>spiritual house</i> is the <i>holy</i> or <i>Christian family</i> or <i>household</i>, this <i>family</i> or <i>household</i> is composed of the <i>sons</i> and <i>daughters</i> of God Almighty; and hence the propriety of <i>living</i> <i>stones</i>, because this is the <i>living house</i> or <i>spiritual family</i>. As a building <i>rests</i> upon a <i>foundation</i>, and this foundation is its <i>support</i>; so a <i>family</i> or <i>household</i> rests on the <i>father</i>, who is properly considered the <i>foundation</i> or <i>support</i> of the building. But as every father is <i>mortal</i> and <i>transitory</i>, none can be called a <i>living stone</i>, foundation, or support, but He who <i>liveth for ever</i>, and has <i>life independent</i>; so none but Jesus, who hath <i>life in</i> <i>himself</i>, i.e. <i>independently</i>, and who is the <i>Way, the Truth, and</i> <i>the</i> LIFE, can be a <i>permanent</i> foundation or support to the whole spiritual house. And as all the stones-sons and daughters, that constitute the spiritual building are made partakers of the <i>life</i> of Christ, consequently, they may with great propriety be called <i>living stones</i>, that is, <i>sons and daughters of God</i>, who <i>live by</i> <i>Christ Jesus</i>, because <i>he lives in them</i>. Now, following the metaphor; these various <i>living stones</i> become one grand <i>temple</i>, in which God is <i>worshipped</i>, and in which he manifests himself as he did in the temple of old. Every stone-son and daughter, being a spiritual sacrificer or priest, they all offer up praise and thanksgiving to God through Christ; and such sacrifices, being offered up in the name and through the merit of his Son, are all acceptable in his sight.</p>
<p>This is the true metaphor, and which has not, as far as I know, ever been properly <i>traced out</i>. To talk of "stones being said to be <i>alive</i> as long as they are not cut out of the quarry, but continue to partake of that nourishment which circulates from vein to vein," is as unsatisfactory as it is unphilosophical; the other is the true metaphor, and explains every thing.</p>
