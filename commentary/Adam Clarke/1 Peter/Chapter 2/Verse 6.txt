<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Behold, I lay in Sion</b></i> — This intimates that the foundation of the Christian Church should be laid at Jerusalem; and <i>there</i> it was laid, for there Christ suffered, and there the preaching of the Gospel commenced.</p>
<p><i><b>A chief corner stone</b></i> — This is the same as the foundation stone; and it is called here the <i>chief corner stone</i> because it is laid in the foundation, at an angle of the building where its two sides form the ground work of a <i>side</i> and <i>end</i> wall. And this might probably be designed to show that, in Jesus, both Jews and Gentiles were to be <i>united</i>; and this is probably the reason why it was called a <i>stone of stumbling, and rock of offence</i>; for nothing stumbled, nothing offended the Jews so much as the calling of the Gentiles into the Church of God, and admitting them to the same privileges which had been before peculiar to the Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>Elect, precious</b></i> — <i>Chosen</i> and <i>honourable</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall not be confounded.</b></i> — These words are quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>; but rather more from the Septuagint than from the Hebrew text. The latter we translate, <i>He that believeth shall not</i> <i>make haste</i>-he who comes to God, through Christ, for salvation, shall never be confounded; he need not <i>haste</i> to flee away, for no enemy shall ever be able to annoy him.</p>
