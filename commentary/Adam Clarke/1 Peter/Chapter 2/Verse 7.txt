<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Unto you therefore which believe</b></i> — You, both Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p><b>He is</b> <i><b>precious</b></i> — Ὑμιν ουν ἡ τιμη τοις πιστευουσιν· <i>The honour</i> <i>is to you who believe</i>; i.e. the honour of being in this building, and of having your souls saved through the blood of the Lamb, and becoming sons and daughters of God Almighty.</p>
<p><i><b>Them which be disobedient</b></i> — The <i>Jews</i>, who continue to reject the Gospel; that very person whom they reject is <i>head of the</i> <i>corner </i>- is Lord over all, and has all power in the heavens and the earth.</p>
