<p>Verse 8. <i><b>A stone of stumbling</b></i> — Because in him all Jews and Gentiles who believe are united; and because the latter were admitted into the Church, and called by the Gospel to enjoy the same privileges which the Jews, as the peculiar people of God, had enjoyed for two thousand years before; therefore they rejected the Christian religion, they would have no partakers with themselves in the salvation of God. This was the true cause why the Jews rejected the Gospel; and they rejected Christ because he did not come as a <i>secular</i> prince. In the <i>one case</i> he was a <i>stone of</i> <i>stumbling</i>-he was <i>poor</i>, and affected no worldly pomp; in the other he was a <i>rock of offence</i>, for his Gospel called the Gentiles to be a peculiar people whom the Jews believed to be everlastingly reprobated, and utterly incapable of any spiritual good.</p>
<p><i><b>Whereunto also they were appointed.</b></i> — Some good critics read the verse thus, carrying on the sense from the preceding: <i>Also a</i> <i>stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence: The disobedient stumble</i> <i>against the word</i>, (or doctrine,) <i>to which verily they were</i> <i>appointed</i>.-Macknight.</p>
<p>Mr. Wakefield, leaving out, with the <i>Syriac</i>, the clause, <i>The</i> <i>stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of</i> <i>the corner</i>, reads <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:7">1 Peter 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:8">1 Peter 2:8</span> thus: <i>To you therefore who trust</i> thereon, this stone is <i>honourable; but</i> <i>to those who are not persuaded</i>, (απειθουσι,) it is <i>a stone to</i> <i>strike upon and to stumble against, at which they stumble who</i> <i>believe not the word; and unto this indeed they were appointed</i>; that is, they who <i>believe not the word</i> were appointed to stumble and fall by it, not to disbelieve it; for the word of the Lord is either a <i>savour of life unto life</i>, or <i>death unto death</i>, to all them that hear it, according as they <i>receive</i> it by <i>faith</i>, or <i>reject</i> it by <i>unbelief</i>. The phrase τιθεναι τινα ειςτι is very frequent among the purest Greek writers, and signifies <i>to</i> <i>attribute any thing to another</i>, or <i>to speak a thing of them</i>; of which <i>Kypke</i> gives several examples from <i>Plutarch</i>; and paraphrases the words thus: <i>This stumbling and offence, particularly of the</i> <i>Jews, against Christ, the corner stone, was long ago asserted and</i> <i>predicted by the prophets, by Christ, and by others</i>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:15">Isaiah 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:44">Matthew 21:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:32">Romans 9:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>. Now this interpretation of Kypke is the more likely, because it is evident that St. Peter refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:15">Isaiah 8:15</span>: <i>And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and</i> <i>for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and</i> <i>for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and many among them</i> <i>shall stumble, and fall, and be broken</i>, c. The <i>disobedient</i>, therefore, being appointed to stumble against the word, or being <i>prophesied of</i> as persons that should stumble, necessarily means, from the connection in which it stands, and from the passage in the prophet, that their <i>stumbling, falling</i>, and <i>being broken</i>, is the consequence of their disobedience or unbelief but there is no intimation that they were <i>appointed</i> or <i>decreed to disobey</i>, that they might stumble, and fall, and be broken. They stumbled and fell through their <i>obstinate unbelief</i>; and thus their stumbling and falling, as well as their unbelief, were of themselves, in consequence of this they were <i>appointed</i> to be <i>broken</i>; this was God's work of judgment. This seems to be the meaning which our Lord attaches to this very prophecy, which he quotes against the chief priests and elders, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:44">Matthew 21:44</span>. On the whole of these passages, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42-44">Matthew 21:42-44</span>.</p>
