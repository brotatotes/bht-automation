<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Ye</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>a chosen generation</b></i> — The titles formerly given to the whole Jewish Church, <i>i.e.</i> to all the Israelites without exception, all who were in the covenant of God by circumcision, whether they were holy persons or not, are here given to Christians in general in the same way; <i>i.e.</i> to all who believed in Christ, whether Jews or Gentiles, and who received baptism in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>The Israelites were a <i>chosen</i> or <i>elected race</i>, to be <i>a special</i> <i>people unto the Lord their God, above all people that were upon</i> <i>the face of the earth</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+7:6">Deuteronomy 7:6</span>.</p>
<p>They were also a <i>royal priesthood</i>, or what Moses calls <i>a</i> <i>kingdom of priests</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>. For all were called to sacrifice to God; and he is represented to be the <i>King</i> of that people, and <i>Father</i> of those of whom he was king; therefore they were all <i>royal</i>.</p>
<p>They were a <i>holy nation</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>; for they were separated from all the people of the earth, that they might worship the one only true God, and abstain from the abominations that were in the heathen world.</p>
<p>They were also a <i>peculiar people</i>, λαος εις περιποιησιν, <i>a purchased people</i>; סגלה segullah, a <i>private property</i>, belonging to God Almighty, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+7:6">Deuteronomy 7:6</span>; none other having any <i>right</i> in them, and they being under obligation to God alone. All these things the apostle applies to the Christians, to whom indeed they belong, in their spirit and essence, in such a way as they could not belong to the Hebrews of old. But they were called to this state of salvation <i>out of</i> <i>darkness</i> - idolatry, superstition, and ungodliness, <i>into his</i> <i>marvellous light</i> - the Gospel dispensation, which, in reference to the discoveries it had made of God, his nature, will, and gracious promises towards mankind, differed as much from the preceding dispensation of the Jews, as the light of the meridian <i>sun</i> from the faint twinkling of a <i>star</i>. And they had these privileges <i>that</i> <i>they might show forth the praises of Him who had</i> thus <i>called them</i>; αρετας, <i>the virtues</i>, those perfections of the wisdom, justice, truth, and goodness of God, that shone most illustriously in the Christian dispensation. These they were to exhibit in a holy and useful life, being transformed into the image of God, and walking as Christ himself walked.</p>
