<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>. <i><b>Ye wives, be in subjection</b></i> — Consider that your husband is, by God's appointment, the head and ruler of the house; do not, therefore, attempt to usurp his government; for even though he <i>obey not the word</i>-is not a <i>believer in the Christian</i> <i>doctrine</i>, his rule is not thereby impaired; for Christianity never alters civil relations: and your affectionate, obedient conduct will be the most likely means of convincing him of the truth of the doctrine which you have received.</p>
<p><i><b>Without the word</b></i> — That your holy conduct may be the means of begetting in them a reverence for Christianity, the preaching of which they will not hear. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:34">1 Corinthians 14:34</span>, and the other places referred to in the margin.</p>
