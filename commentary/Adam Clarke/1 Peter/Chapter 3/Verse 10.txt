<p>Verse 10. <i><b>For he that will love life</b></i> — This is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+34:12-16">Psalms 34:12-16</span>, as it stands in the Septuagint; only the aorist of the imperative is changed from the second into the third person, c. He who wishes to live long and prosperously, must act as he is here directed. 1. He must refrain from <i>evil-speaking,</i> <i>lying</i>, and <i>slandering</i>. 2. He must avoid <i>flattery</i> and fair speeches, which cover <i>hypocritical</i> or wicked <i>intentions</i>. 3. He must <i>avoid evil</i>, keep <i>going away</i> εκκλινατω, from evil. 4. He must do good he must walk in the way of righteousness. 5. He must live <i>peaceably</i> with all men; <i>seek peace</i> where it has been lost; <i>restore</i> it where it has been broken; and <i>pursue it</i> where it seems to be flying away. He who lives thus must live happy in himself. And as <i>excess</i> in <i>action</i> and <i>passion</i> always tends to the shortening of life, and nothing preys on the constitution more than disorderly passions, he must live not only happiest but longest who avoids them. It is an edifying story that is told in the book <i>Mussar</i>, chap. 1., quoted by Rosenmuller: "A certain person, travelling through the city, continued to call out, <i>Who</i> <i>wants the elixir of life</i>? The daughter of Rabbi Joda heard him, and told her father. He said, Call the man in. When he came in, the rabbi said, What is that elixir of life thou sellest? He answered, Is it not written, <i>What man is he that loveth life, and</i> <i>desireth to see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil,</i> <i>and his lips from speaking</i> guile? This is the elixir of life, and is found in the mouth of man."</p>
