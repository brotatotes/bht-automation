<p>Verse 12. <i><b>The eyes of the Lord</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>over the righteous</b></i> — That is, He is continually under God's notice and his care; God continually watches <i>for</i> him and watches <i>over</i> him, and he is <i>under</i> his constant protection.</p>
<p><i><b>And his ears</b></i><b> are open </b><i><b>unto their prayers</b></i> — The original is very emphatic: <i>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his</i> <i>ears to their prayers</i>. The righteous man ever attracts the Divine notice, and wherever he is, there is the ear of God; for, as every righteous man is a <i>man of prayer</i>, wherever he prays, there is the ear of God, into which the prayer, as soon as formed, enters.</p>
<p><i><b>But the face of the Lord</b></i> — Far from his eye being upon <i>them</i>, or his ear open to their requests, (for <i>prayer</i> they have none,) his <i>face</i>, his <i>approbation</i>, his <i>providence</i> and <i>blessing</i>, are turned away from them; and he only looks upon them to abhor them, and to turn the arm of his justice against them.</p>
