<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Who</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>he that will harm you</b></i> — Is it possible that a man can be wretched who has God for his friend? "All the devices which the devil or wicked men work against such must be brought to naught, and by the providence of his goodness be dispersed."</p>
<p><i><b>If ye be followers</b></i>, &amp;c.] Εαν Του Αγαθου μιμηται γενησθε· <i>If</i> <i>ye be imitators of the good One</i>, i.e. of God. Ὁ Αγαθος, <i>the</i> <i>good One</i>, is one of God's prime epithets, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:17">Matthew 19:17</span>, and Satan is distinguished by the reverse, ὁ πονηρος, the EVIL <i>one</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:19">Matthew 13:19</span>, where see the notes. Instead of μιμηται, <i>followers</i>, or rather <i>imitators</i>, ζηλωται, <i>zealous</i> of what is good, is the reading of ABC, fifteen others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i> and <i>Vulgate</i>, with some of the <i>fathers</i>. This is a very probable reading, and <i>Griesbach</i> has placed it in the <i>margin</i> as a candidate for the place of that in the text.</p>
