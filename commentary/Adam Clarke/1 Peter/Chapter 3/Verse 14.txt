Verse 14. But and if ye suffer — God may permit you to be tried and persecuted for righteousness' sake, but this cannot essentially harm you; he will press even this into your service, and make it work for your good.Happy are ye] This seems to refer to Matthew 5:10, c. Blessed or happy, are ye when men persecute you, c. It is a happiness to suffer for Christ and it is a happiness, because if a man were not holy and righteous the world would not persecute him, so he is happy in the very cause of his sufferings.Be not afraid of their terror — Τον δε φοβον αυτων μη φοβηθητε· Fear not their fear see Isaiah 8:12. Sometimes fear is put for the object of a man's religious worship; see Genesis 31:42; Proverbs 1:26, and the place in Isaiah just quoted. The exhortation may mean, Fear not their gods, they can do you no hurt; and supposing that they curse you by them, yet be not troubled; "He who fears God need have no other fear."
