<p>Verse 14. <i><b>But and if ye suffer</b></i> — God may permit you to be tried and persecuted for righteousness' sake, but this cannot <i>essentially harm you</i>; he will press even this into your service, and make it work for your good.</p>
<p><i><b>Happy</b></i><b> are ye</b>] This seems to refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span>, c. <i>Blessed</i> or <i>happy, are ye when men persecute you</i>, c. It is a happiness to suffer for Christ and it is a happiness, because if a man were not <i>holy</i> and <i>righteous</i> the world would not persecute him, so he is happy in the very <i>cause</i> of his sufferings.</p>
<p><i><b>Be not afraid of their terror</b></i> — Τον δε φοβον αυτων μη φοβηθητε· <i>Fear not their fear</i> see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:12">Isaiah 8:12</span>. Sometimes <i>fear</i> is put for the <i>object of a man's religious worship</i>; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+31:42">Genesis 31:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="pr+1:26">Proverbs 1:26</span>, and the place in <i>Isaiah</i> just quoted. The exhortation may mean, <i>Fear not their gods</i>, they can do you no hurt; and supposing that they curse you by them, yet <i>be not troubled</i>; "He who fears God need have no other fear."</p>
