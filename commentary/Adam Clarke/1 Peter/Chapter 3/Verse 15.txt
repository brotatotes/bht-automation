<p>Verse 15. <i><b>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts</b></i> — To sanctify God may signify to offer him the <i>praises</i> due to his grace, but as to <i>sanctify</i> literally signifies to <i>make holy</i>, it is impossible that God should be thus sanctified. We have often already seen that αγιαζω signifies to <i>separate from earth</i>, that is, from any <i>common use</i> or <i>purpose</i>, that the <i>thing</i> or <i>person</i> thus <i>separated</i> may be <i>devoted to a sacred use</i>. Perhaps we should understand Peter's words thus: Entertain just notions of God; of his nature, power, will, justice, goodness, and truth. Do not conceive of him as being actuated by such <i>passions</i> as <i>men;</i> <i>separate him in your hearts</i> from every thing <i>earthly, human,</i> <i>fickle, rigidly severe</i>, or <i>capriciously merciful</i>. Consider that he can neither be like man, feel like man, nor act like man. Ascribe no <i>human passions</i> to him, for this would <i>desecrate</i> not <i>sanctify</i> him. Do not <i>confine</i> him in your conceptions to place, space, vacuity, heaven, or earth; endeavour to think worthily of the <i>immensity</i> and <i>eternity</i> of his nature, of his <i>omniscience,</i> <i>omnipresence</i>, and <i>omnipotence</i>. Avoid the error of the heathens, who bound even their <i>Dii Majores</i>, their greatest gods, by <i>fate</i>, as many well-meaning Christians do the true God by <i>decrees</i>; conceive of him as infinitely <i>free to act</i> or <i>not act</i>, as he pleases. Consider the <i>goodness</i> of his nature; for <i>goodness</i>, in every possible state of perfection and infinitude, belongs to him. Ascribe no <i>malevolence</i> to him; nor any work, purpose, or decree, that implies it: this is not only a human passion, but a passion of <i>fallen</i> man. Do not suppose that he can do evil, or that he can <i>destroy</i> when he might save; that he ever did, or ever can, <i>hate</i> any of those whom he made in his own image and in his own likeness, so as by a positive decree to doom them, unborn, to everlasting perdition, or, what is of the same import, <i>pass them</i> <i>by</i> without affording them the means of salvation, and consequently rendering it impossible for them to be saved. Thus endeavour to conceive of him; and, by so doing, you <i>separate him</i> from all that is <i>imperfect, human, evil, capricious, changeable</i>, and <i>unkind</i>. Ever remember that he has wisdom without error, power, without limits, truth without falsity, love without hatred, holiness without evil, and justice without rigour or severity on the one hand, or capricious tenderness on the other. In a word, that he neither can <i>be, say, purpose</i>, or <i>do</i>, any thing that is not infinitely just, holy, wise, true, and gracious; that he hates nothing that he has made; and has so loved the world, the whole human race, as to give his only-begotten Son to die for them, that they might not perish, but have everlasting life. Thus <i>sanctify</i> <i>the Lord God in your hearts</i>, and you will ever be <i>ready to give a</i> <i>reason of the hope that is in you</i> to every serious and candid inquirer after truth. Most religious systems and creeds are incapable of rational explanation, because founded on some misconception of the Divine nature. </p>
<p>What I have written above is not against any particular creed of religious people, it is against any or all to whom it may justly apply, it may even be against some portions of <i>my own</i>; for even in this respect I am obliged daily to labour to sanctify the Lord God in my heart, to <i>abstract</i> him from every thing <i>earthly</i> and <i>human</i>, and apprehend him as far as possible in his own essential nature and attributes through the light of his Spirit and the medium of his own <i>revelation</i>. To act thus requires no common effort of soul: and just apprehensions of this kind are not acquired without much prayer, much self-reflection, much time, and much of the grace and mercy of God.</p>
<p>Instead of τονθεον, GOD, ABC, four others, both the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic</i>, the <i>Coptic, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Armenian</i>, with <i>Clement</i> and <i>Fulgentius</i>, read τονχριστον, CHRIST. <i>Sanctify Christ in your</i> <i>hearts</i>. This reading is at least equal to the other in the authorities by which it is supported; but <i>which</i> was written by St. Peter we know not.</p>
<p><i><b>A reason of the hope</b></i> — An <i>account</i> of your <i>hope of the</i> <i>resurrection of the dead</i> and eternal life in God's glory. This was the great object of their <i>hope</i>, as Christ was the grand <i>object</i> of their <i>faith</i>.</p>
<p>The word απολογια, which we translate <i>answer</i>, signifies a <i>defence</i>; from this we have our word <i>apology</i>, which did not originally signify an <i>excuse</i> for an act, but a <i>defence of that</i> <i>act</i>. The <i>defences of Christianity</i> by the primitive fathers are called <i>apologies</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:1">Acts 21:1</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>With meekness and fear</b></i> — Several excellent MSS. add the word αλλα, <i>but</i>, here, and it improves the sense considerably: <i>Be</i> <i>ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a</i> <i>reason of the hope that is in you</i>, BUT <i>with meekness and fear</i>. Do not permit your <i>readiness to answer</i>, nor the <i>confidence</i> you have in the goodness of your cause, to lead you to answer <i>pertly</i> or <i>superciliously</i> to any person; defend the truth with all possible <i>gentleness</i> and <i>fear</i>, lest while you are doing it you should forget his presence whose cause you support, or say any thing unbecoming the dignity and holiness of the religion which you have espoused, or inconsistent with that heavenly temper which the Spirit of your indwelling Lord must infallibly produce.</p>
