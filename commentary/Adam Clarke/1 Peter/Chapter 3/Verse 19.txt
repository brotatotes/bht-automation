<p>Verse 19. <i><b>By which</b></i> — Spirit, his own Divine energy and authority.</p>
<p><i><b>He went and preached</b></i> — By the ministry of Noah, one hundred and twenty years.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto the spirits in prison</b></i> — The inhabitants of the antediluvian world, who, having been <i>disobedient</i>, and convicted of the most flagrant transgressions against God, were sentenced by his just law to destruction. But their punishment was delayed to see if they would <i>repent</i>; and <i>the long-suffering of God waited</i> one hundred and twenty years, which were granted to them for this purpose; during which time, as criminals tried and convicted, they are represented as being <i>in prison</i>-detained under the arrest of Divine justice, which <i>waited</i> either for their <i>repentance</i> or the expiration of the <i>respite</i>, that the punishment pronounced might be inflicted. This I have long believed to be the sense of this difficult passage, and no other that I have seen is so consistent with the whole scope of the place. That the <i>Spirit of God</i> did <i>strive</i> with, convict, and reprove the antediluvians, is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:3">Genesis 6:3</span>: <i>My Spirit shall not always strive with man, forasmuch as he is</i> <i>flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years</i>. And it was by this Spirit that Noah became a <i>preacher of righteousness</i>, and <i>condemned</i> that ungodly <i>world</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>, who would not believe till wrath-Divine punishment, came upon them to the uttermost. The word πνευμασι, <i>spirits</i>, is supposed to render this view of the subject improbable, because this must mean <i>disembodied</i> spirits; but this certainly does not follow, for <i>the spirits of</i> <i>just men made perfect</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>, certainly means <i>righteous men</i>, and men <i>still in the Church</i> <i>militant</i>; and the <i>Father of spirits</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:9">Hebrews 12:9</span>, means <i>men still in the body</i>; and <i>the God of the spirits of all</i> <i>flesh</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:22">Numbers 16:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+27:16">Numbers 27:16</span>, means <i>men not in a disembodied state</i>.</p>
<p>But even on this word there are several various readings; some of the Greek MSS. read πνευματι, <i>in spirit</i>, and one πνευματι αγιω, in the <i>Holy Spirit</i>. I have before me one of the first, if not the very <i>first edition</i> of the <i>Latin Bible</i>; and in it the verse stands thus: <i>In quo et hiis, qui in carcere erant,</i> SPIRITUALITER <i>veniens praedicavit</i>; "by which he came <i>spiritually</i>, and preached to them that were in prison."</p>
<p>In two very ancient MSS. of the Vulgate before me, the clause is thus: <i>In quo et his qui in carcere erant</i> SPIRITU <i>venient</i> <i>praedicavit</i>; "in which, coming <i>by the Spirit</i>, he preached to those who were in prison." This is the reading also in the <i>Complutensian Polyglot</i>.</p>
<p>Another ancient MS. in my possession has the words nearly as in the printed copy: <i>In quo et hiis qui in carcere</i> CONCLUSI <i>erant</i> SPIRITUALITER <i>veniens praedicavit</i>; "in which, coming <i>spiritually</i>, he preached to those who were SHUT UP in prison."</p>
<p>Another MS., written about A. D. 1370, is the same as the printed copy.</p>
<p>The common <i>printed Vulgate</i> is different from all these, and from all the MSS. of the Vulgate which I have seen in reading <i>spiritibus</i>, "to the spirits."</p>
<p>In my old MS. Bible, which contains the first translation into English ever made, the clause is the following: <i>In whiche thing</i> <i>and to hem that weren closid togyder in prison, hi commynge in</i> <i>Spirit, prechide</i>. The copy from which this translation was taken evidently read <i>conclusi erdnt</i>, with one of the MSS. quoted above, as <i>closid togyder</i> proves.</p>
<p>I have quoted all these authorities from the most authentic and correct copies of the Vulgate, to show that from them there is no ground to believe that the text speaks of Christ's going to hell to preach the Gospel to the damned, or of his going to some feigned place where the souls of the patriarchs were detained, to whom he preached, and whom he delivered from that place and took with him to paradise, which the Romish Church holds as an article of faith.</p>
<p>Though the judicious <i>Calmet</i> holds with his Church this opinion, yet he cannot consider the text of St. Peter as a proof of it. I will set down his own words: Le sentiment qui veut que Jesus Christ soit descendu aux enfers, pour annoncer sa venue aux anciens patriarches, et pour les tirer de cette espece de prison, ou ils Pattendoient si long tems, est indubitable; et nous le regardons comme un article de notre foi: mais on peut douter que ce soit le sens de Saint Pierre en cet endroit. "The opinion which states that Jesus Christ descended into hell, to announce his coming to the ancient patriarchs, and to deliver them from that species of prison, where they had so long waited for him, is incontrovertible; and we (the Catholics) consider it as an article of our faith: but we may doubt whether this be the meaning of St. Peter in this place."</p>
<p>Some think the whole passage applies to the preaching of the Gospel to the <i>Gentiles</i>; but the interpretation given above appears to me, after the fullest consideration, to be the most consistent and rational, as I have already remarked.</p>
