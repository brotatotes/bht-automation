Verse 20. When once the long-suffering of God waited — In Pirkey Aboth, cap. v. 1 Peter 3:2, we have these words: "There were ten generations from Adam to Noah, that the long-suffering of God might appear; for each of these generations provoked him to anger, and went on in their iniquity, till at last the deluge came."Were saved by water. — While the ark was preparing, only Noah's family believed; these amounted to eight persons; and these only were saved from the deluge διυοατος, on the water: all the rest perished in the water; though many of them, while the rains descended, and the waters daily increased, did undoubtedly humble themselves before God, call for mercy, and receive it; but as they had not repented at the preaching of Noah, and the ark was now closed, and the fountains of the great deep broken up, they lost their lives, though God might have extended mercy to their souls.
