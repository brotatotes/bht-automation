<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>. <i><b>Who is gone into heaven</b></i> — Having given the fullest proof of his resurrection from the dead, and of his having accomplished the end for which he came into the world.</p>
<p><i><b>On the right hand of God</b></i> — In the place of the highest dignity, honour, and influence.</p>
<p>The Vulgate, one copy of the Itala, Augustine, Fulgentius, Cassiodorus, and Bede, have the following remarkable addition after the above words: <i>Deglutiens mortem, ut vitae aeternae</i> <i>haeredes efficeremur</i>. "Having abolished (swallowed down) death, that we might be made heirs of eternal life." But this addition is found in no Greek copy, nor in any other of the ancient versions.</p>
<p><i><b>Angels and authorities and powers</b></i> — That is, all creatures and beings, both in the heavens and in the earth, are put under subjection to Jesus Christ. He has all power in the heavens and in the earth. He alone can save; and he alone can destroy. None need fear who put their trust in him, as he can do whatsoever he will in behalf of his followers, and has good and evil spirits under his absolute command. Well may his enemies tremble, while his friends exult and sing. He can raise the dead, and save to the uttermost all that come unto the Father through him.</p>
<p>If he have all power, if angels and authorities and powers be subject to him, then he can do <i>what</i> he will, and employ <i>whom</i> he will. To raise the dead can be no difficulty to him, because he has power over all things. He created the world; he can destroy it, and he can create it anew. We can conceive nothing too difficult for Omnipotence. This same omnipotent Being is the friend of man. Why then do we not come to him with confidence, and expect the utmost salvation of which our souls and bodies are capable?</p>
