<p><i><b>Plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold</b></i> — Plaiting the hair, and variously folding it about the head, was the most ancient and most simple mode of disposing of this chief ornament of the female head. It was practised anciently in every part of the east, and is so to the present day in India, in China, and also in Barbary. It was also prevalent among the Greeks and Romans, as ancient gems, busts, and statues, still remaining, sufficiently declare. We have a remarkable instance of the plaiting of the hair in a statue of Agrippina, wife of Germanicus, an exact representation of which may be seen in a work of <i>Andre Lens</i>, entitled <i>Le Costume</i> <i>de Peuple de I' Antiquite</i>, pl. 33. Many plates in the same work show the different modes of dressing the hair which obtained among the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and other nations. Thin <i>plates of gold</i> were often mixed with the hair, to make it appear more ornamental by the reflection of light and of the solar rays. Small golden <i>buckles</i> were also used in different parts; and among the Roman ladies, <i>pearls</i> and precious stones of different colours. <i>Pliny</i> assures us, <i>Hist. Nat</i>., l. ix. c. 35, that these latter ornaments were not introduced among the Roman women till the time of Sylla, about 110 years before the Christian era. But it is evident, from many remaining monuments, that in numerous cases the <i>hair</i> differently plaited and curled was the <i>only ornament</i> of the head. Often a simple <i>pin</i>, sometimes of <i>ivory</i>, pointed with gold, seemed to connect the plaits. In monuments of antiquity the <i>heads</i> of the <i>married</i> and <i>single</i> women may be known, the former by the hair being <i>parted</i> from the forehead over the middle of the top of the head, the latter by being quite close, or being plaited and curled all in a general mass.</p>
<p>There is a remarkable passage in Plutarch, <i>Conjugalia</i> <i>Praecept</i>., c. xxvi., very like that in the text: Κοσμος γαρ εστιν, ὡς ελεγε Κρατης, το κοσμουν· κοσμει δε το κοσμιωτεραν γυναικα ποιουν· ποιει δε ταυτην ου χρυσος, ουτε σμαραγδος, ουτε κοκκος, αλλ 'ὁσα σεμνοτητος, ευταξιας, αιδους εμφασιν περιτιθησιν· <i>Opera</i> <i>a Wyttenb</i>., vol. i., page 390. "An <i>ornament</i>, as Crates said, is that which <i>adorns</i>. The proper ornament of a woman is that which becomes her best. This is neither gold, nor pearls, nor scarlet; but those things which are an evident proof of gravity, regularity, and modesty." The wife of <i>Phocion</i>, a celebrated Athenian general, receiving a visit from a lady who was elegantly adorned with <i>gold</i> and <i>jewels</i>, and her <i>hair with pearls</i>, took occasion to call the attention of her guest to the elegance and costliness of her dress, remarking at the same time, "<i>My</i> ornament is my husband, now for the twentieth year general of the Athenians." <i>Plut</i>., in <i>vit. Phoc</i>. How few Christian women act this part! Women are in general at as much pains and cost in their dress, as if by it they were to be recommended both to God and man. It is, however, in every case, the argument either of a <i>shallow mind</i>, or of a <i>vain</i> and <i>corrupted</i> <i>heart</i>.</p>
