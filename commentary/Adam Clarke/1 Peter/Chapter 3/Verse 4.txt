<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:4">1 Peter 3:4</span>. <i><b>The hidden man of the heart</b></i> — Ὁ κρυπτος της καρδιας ανθρωπος. This phrase is of the same import with that of St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:22">Romans 7:22</span>, οεσωανθρωπος, the <i>inner man</i>; that is, the <i>soul</i>, with the whole system of affections and passions. Every part of the Scripture treats man as a compound being: the <i>body</i> is the <i>outward</i> or <i>visible</i> <i>man</i>; the <i>soul</i>, the <i>inward, hidden</i>, or <i>invisible man</i>. The term ανθρωπος, <i>man</i>, is derived, according to the best etymologists, from ανατρεπωνωπα, <i>turning the face upward</i>. This derivation of the word is beautifully paraphrased by <i>Ovid</i>. The whole passage is beautiful; and, though well known, I shall insert it. After speaking of the creation and formation of all the irrational animals, he proceeds thus: - </p>
<p><i><b>A meek and quiet spirit</b></i> — That is, a mind that will not give provocation to others, nor receive irritation by the provocation of others. <i>Meekness</i> will prevent the first; <i>quietness</i> will guard against the last.</p>
<p><i><b>Great price.</b></i> — All the ornaments placed on the head and body of the most illustrious female, are, in the sight of God, of no worth; but a <i>meek and silent spirit</i> are, in his sight, invaluable, because proceeding from and leading to himself, being incorruptible, surviving the ruins of the <i>body</i> and the ruins of <i>time</i>, and enduring eternally.</p>
