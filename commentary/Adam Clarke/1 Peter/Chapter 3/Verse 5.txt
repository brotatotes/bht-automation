<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:5">1 Peter 3:5</span>. <i><b>For after this manner</b></i> — Simplicity reigned in primitive times; <i>natural ornaments</i> alone were then in use. Trade and commerce brought in luxuries; and luxury brought <i>pride</i>, and all the <i>excessive nonsense</i> of DRESS. No female head ever looks so well as when adorned with its own hair alone. This is the ornament appointed by God. To cut it off or to cover it is an unnatural practice; and to exchange the hair which God has given for hair of some other colour, is an insult to the Creator. How the <i>delicacy</i> of the female character can stoop to the use of <i>false</i> <i>hair</i>, and especially when it is considered that the chief part of this kind of hair was once the <i>natural</i> property of some ruffian soldier, who fell In battle by many a ghastly wound, is more than I can possibly comprehend. See the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:14-16">1 Corinthians 11:14-16</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:9">1 Timothy 2:9</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Who trusted in God</b></i> — The women <i>who trust</i> NOT in God are fond of <i>dress</i> and <i>frippery</i>; those <i>who trust in God</i> follow <i>nature</i> and <i>common sense</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Being in subjection unto their own husbands</b></i> — It will rarely be found that women who are <i>fond of dress</i>, and extravagant in it, have any subjection to their husbands but what comes from <i>mere</i> <i>necessity</i>. Indeed, their dress, which they <i>intend</i> as an attractive to the eyes of <i>others</i>, is a sufficient proof that they have neither <i>love</i> nor <i>respect</i> for their own husbands. Let them who are concerned refute the charge.</p>
