<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Even as Sara obeyed</b></i> — Almost the same words are in <i>Rab. Tanchum</i>, fol. 9, 3: "The wife of Abraham reverenced him, and called him lord, as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:12">Genesis 18:12</span>: <i>And my lord is old</i>." The words of the apostle imply that she acknowledged his superiority, and her own subjection to him, in the order of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Whose daughters ye are</b></i> — As Abraham is represented the <i>father</i> of all his male <i>believing descendants</i>, so Sara is represented as the <i>mother</i> of all her believing female posterity. A <i>son of</i> <i>Abraham</i> is a true believer; a <i>daughter of Sarah</i> is the same.</p>
<p><i><b>As long as ye do well</b></i> — For you cannot maintain your relationship to her longer than ye <i>believe</i>; and ye cannot <i>believe</i> longer than ye continue to <i>obey</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And are not afraid with any amazement.</b></i> — It is difficult to extract any sense out of this clause. The original is not very easy; μηφοβουμεναιμηδεμιανπτοησις may be rendered, <i>And not</i> <i>fearing with any terror</i>. If ye do well, and act conscientiously your part as <i>faithful wives</i>, ye will at no time live under the <i>distressing apprehension</i> of being <i>found out</i>, or terrified at every appearance of the discovery of <i>infidelities</i>, or improper conduct. Being not guilty of these, you will not have occasion to fear <i>detection</i>. On this subject a learned man has quoted these words, which I have produced elsewhere, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:14">Ephesians 6:14</span>: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> --------------- <i>hic murus aheneus esto</i>,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> <i>Nil</i> conscire sibi, <i>nulla</i> pallescere <i>culpa</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> "Let this be my brazen wall, to be <i>self-convicted</i> of no</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> private delinquency, nor to <i>change colour</i> at being</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> charged with a fault." </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "><br/> </p>
<p>Happy is the <i>wife</i>, and happy is the <i>husband</i>, who can <i>conscientiously</i> adopt the saying.</p>
