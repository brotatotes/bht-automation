<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Dwell with</b></i><b> them </b><i><b>according to knowledge</b></i> — Give your wives, by no species of unkind carriage, any excuse for delinquency. How can a man expect his wife to be faithful to him, if he be unfaithful to her? and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Giving honour unto the wife</b></i> — Using your superior strength and experience in her behalf, and thus <i>honouring</i> her by becoming her protector and support. But the word τιμη <i>honour</i>, signifies <i>maintenance</i> as well as <i>respect</i>;-<i>maintain, provide for</i> the wife.</p>
<p><i><b>As-the weaker vessel</b></i> — Being mare delicately, and consequently more slenderly, constructed. <i>Roughness</i> and <i>strength</i> go hand in hand; so likewise do <i>beauty</i> and <i>frailty</i>. The female has what the man wants-beauty and delicacy. The male has what the female wants-courage and strength. The one is as good in its place as the other: and by these things God has made an equality between the man and the woman, so that there is properly very little superiority on either side. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Being heirs together</b></i> — Both the man and woman being equally called to eternal glory: and as <i>prayer</i> is one great means of obtaining a meetness for it, it is necessary that they should live together in such a manner as to prevent all family contentions, that they may not be prevented, by disputes or misunderstandings, from uniting daily in this most important duty-family and social prayer.</p>
