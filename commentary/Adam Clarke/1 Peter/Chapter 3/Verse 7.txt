Verse 7. Dwell with them according to knowledge — Give your wives, by no species of unkind carriage, any excuse for delinquency. How can a man expect his wife to be faithful to him, if he be unfaithful to her? and vice versa.Giving honour unto the wife — Using your superior strength and experience in her behalf, and thus honouring her by becoming her protector and support. But the word τιμη honour, signifies maintenance as well as respect;-maintain, provide for the wife.As-the weaker vessel — Being mare delicately, and consequently more slenderly, constructed. Roughness and strength go hand in hand; so likewise do beauty and frailty. The female has what the man wants-beauty and delicacy. The male has what the female wants-courage and strength. The one is as good in its place as the other: and by these things God has made an equality between the man and the woman, so that there is properly very little superiority on either side. 1 Thessalonians 4:4.Being heirs together — Both the man and woman being equally called to eternal glory: and as prayer is one great means of obtaining a meetness for it, it is necessary that they should live together in such a manner as to prevent all family contentions, that they may not be prevented, by disputes or misunderstandings, from uniting daily in this most important duty-family and social prayer.
