Verse 9. Not rendering evil for evil — Purposing, saying, doing nothing but good; and invariably returning good for evil.Ye are thereunto called — This is your calling-your business in life, to do good, and to do good for evil, and to implore God's blessing even on your worst enemies. And this is not only your duty, but your interest; for in so doing you shall obtain God's blessing, even life for evermore.
