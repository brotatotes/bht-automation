<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Not rendering evil for evil</b></i> — Purposing, saying, doing nothing but <i>good</i>; and invariably returning good for evil.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye are thereunto called</b></i> — This is your <i>calling</i>-your <i>business in</i> <i>life</i>, to do good, and to do good for evil, and to implore God's <i>blessing</i> even on your worst enemies. And this is not only your <i>duty</i>, but your <i>interest</i>; for in so doing you shall obtain God's blessing, even life for evermore.</p>
