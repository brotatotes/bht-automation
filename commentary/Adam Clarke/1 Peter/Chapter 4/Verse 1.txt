<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:1">1 Peter 4:1</span>. <i><b>As Christ hath suffered</b></i> — He is your proper pattern; have the same disposition he had; the same forgiving spirit, with meekness, gentleness, and complete self-possession.</p>
<p><i><b>He that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sin</b></i> — This is a general maxim, if understood literally: The man who suffers generally reflects on his ways, is humbled, fears approaching death, loathes himself because of his past iniquities, and ceases from them; for, in a state of suffering, the mind loses its relish for the sins of the flesh, because they are embittered to him through the apprehension which he has of death and judgment; and, on his application to God's mercy, he is delivered from his sin.</p>
<p>Some suppose the words are to be understood thus: "Those who have <i>firmly resolved</i>, if called to it, to <i>suffer death</i> rather than <i>apostatize</i> from Christianity, have consequently <i>ceased from</i>, or are <i>delivered</i> from, the sin of <i>saving</i> their <i>lives</i> at the expense of their faith." Others think that it is a parallel passage to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:7">Romans 6:7</span>, and interpret it thus: "He that hath mortified the flesh, hath ceased from sin." Dr. Bentley applies the whole to our redemption by Christ: <i>He that hath suffered in the flesh hath</i> <i>died for our sins</i>. But this seems a very constrained sense.</p>
