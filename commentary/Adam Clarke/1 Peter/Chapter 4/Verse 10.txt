<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Hath received the gift</b></i> — χαρισμα. <i>A gift</i>; any blessing of <i>providence</i> or <i>grace</i>. I cannot think that the word means here the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, or any of his supernatural gifts or influences; it may include those, but it signifies any thing given by the mere mercy and bounty of God: but perhaps in this place it may signify some or any <i>office</i> in the Church; and this sense, indeed, the connection seems to require.</p>
<p><i><b>Stewards of the manifold grace</b></i> — Whatever gifts or endowments any man may possess, they are properly speaking, not his own; they are the Lord's property, and to be employed in his work, and to promote his glory.</p>
