<p>Verse 11. <i><b>If any man speak</b></i> — In order to explain or enforce God's word, and edify his neighbour, let him do it as those did to whom the <i>living oracles</i> were committed: they spoke as they were inspired by the Holy Ghost. Those, therefore, at Pontus, c., who undertook to teach others, should speak by the same influence or, if not under this immediate influence, should speak <i>as</i> or <i>according to</i> the <i>oracles</i> already delivered, grounding all their exhortations and doctrines on some portion of that revelation already given. This command is sent to every man upon earth in <i>holy orders</i>, in <i>pretended holy orders</i>, or <i>pretending to holy</i> <i>orders</i>. Their teaching should be what the oracles of God, the Holy Scriptures, teach and authenticate.</p>
<p><i><b>Of the ability which God giveth</b></i> — Perhaps the <i>ministering</i> here may refer to the <i>care of the poor</i>, and the <i>ability</i> is the <i>quantum</i> <i>of means</i> which God may have placed in their hands; and they are to minister this as coming immediately <i>from God</i>, and lead the minds of the poor to consider <i>him</i> as their benefactor, <i>that he in all</i> <i>things may be glorified through Christ Jesus</i>. This is implied in the <i>essence</i> of any charitable act: the <i>actor</i> is not the <i>author</i>, God is the author; and the poor man should be taught to consider <i>him</i> as his immediate <i>benefactor</i>. Those who give any thing <i>as from</i> <i>themselves</i>, rob God; for to him the <i>praise</i> for all good, and the <i>dominion</i> over all men and things, belong <i>for ever and ever</i>.</p>
