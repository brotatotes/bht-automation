<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial</b></i> — πυρωσει. <i>The burning</i>. The metaphor is old, but noble; it represents the Christians at Pontus as having <i>fire</i> cast upon them for the <i>trying</i> of their faith, as <i>gold</i> is tried by fire, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>, to which the apostle alludes.-<i>Macknight</i>.</p>
<p>St. Peter returns here to what he had often touched upon in this epistle, namely, to exhort the Christians to behave with patience and integrity under their present severe persecution; to which purpose he uses the following arguments:-</p>
<p><i>First</i>, He intimates that it was not a <i>strange</i> or <i>unusual</i> thing for the people of God to be persecuted.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, That if they suffered here as <i>Christ did</i>, they should hereafter be glorified with him.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Besides the prospect of that future glory; they had at present the <i>Spirit of God</i> for their support and comfort.</p>
<p><i>Fourthly</i>, That it was an honour for any of them to suffer, not as a <i>malefactor</i>, but as a <i>Christian</i>.</p>
<p><i>Fifthly</i>, Though the afflictions began with the Christians, yet the weight of the storm would fall upon the unbelievers. From these considerations he exhorted them to persevere in their duty, and trust all events with God. See <i>Dodd</i>.</p>
