<p>Verse 14. <i><b>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ</b></i> — To be reproached for the <i>name of Christ</i> is to be reproached for being a <i>Christian</i>, that is, for being <i>like Christ</i>. This is the highest honour to which any man can arrive in this world, and therefore the apostle says to such? <i>Happy</i> are ye.</p>
<p><i><b>The Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you</b></i> — As this Divine Spirit <i>rested</i> upon Jesus, so does it rest upon his persecuted followers. There is a various reading here, και δυναμεως, <i>and of power</i>, which is found in some of the chief MSS., (the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, and above twenty others,) the later <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, some copies of the <i>Itala, Athanasius, Theophylact, Cyprian</i>, and <i>Cassiodorus</i>; and in them the whole verse reads thus: <i>If ye be</i> <i>reproached for the name of Christ, happy</i> are ye; <i>for the Spirit of</i> <i>glory</i>, AND OF POWER, <i>and of God, resteth upon you</i>. This is agreeable to our Lord's words, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11-12">Matthew 5:11-12</span>. So that what constituted them <i>unhappy</i> in the sight of the <i>world</i> was their <i>chief</i> <i>happiness</i> in the sight of <i>God</i>; they carried Christ the fountain of <i>blessedness</i> in their heart, and therefore could not be unhappy.</p>
<p><i><b>On their part he is evil spoken of</b></i> — καταμεναυτους Κατα μεν αυτους βλασφημειται, κατα δε ὑμας δοξαζεται· <i>By them he is blasphemed,</i> <i>by you he is honoured</i>.</p>
