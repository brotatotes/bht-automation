<p>Verse 15. <i><b>But let none of you suffer - as a busybody in other</b></i><b> </b><i><b>men's matters</b></i> — αλλοτριοεπισκοπος. <i>The inspector of another</i>; meddling with other people's concerns, and forgetting their own; such persons are hated of all men. But some think that meddling with those in <i>public office</i> is here intended, as if he had said: Meddle not with the affairs of state, leave public offices and public officers to their own master, strive to live peaceably with all men, and show yourselves to be humble and unaspiring.</p>
