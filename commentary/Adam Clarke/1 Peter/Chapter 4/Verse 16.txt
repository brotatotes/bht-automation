<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Yet if - as a Christian</b></i> — If he be persecuted because he has embraced the <i>Christian</i> faith, let him not be <i>ashamed</i>, but let him rather glorify God on this very account. Christ suffered by the Jews because he was <i>holy</i>; Christians suffer because they resemble him.</p>
<p>The word χριστιανος, <i>Christian</i>, is used only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:28">Acts 26:28</span>. See the note on the former passage.</p>
