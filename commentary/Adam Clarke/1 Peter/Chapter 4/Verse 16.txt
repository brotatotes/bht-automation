Verse 16. Yet if - as a Christian — If he be persecuted because he has embraced the Christian faith, let him not be ashamed, but let him rather glorify God on this very account. Christ suffered by the Jews because he was holy; Christians suffer because they resemble him.The word χριστιανος, Christian, is used only here and in Acts 11:26; Acts 26:28. See the note on the former passage.
