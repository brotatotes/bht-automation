Verse 1 Peter 4:2. That he no longer should live - in the flesh â€” Governed by the base principle of giving up his faith to save his life; to the lusts of men-according to the will of his idolatrous persecutors; but to the will of God; which will of God is, that he should retain the truth, and live according to its dictates, though he should suffer for it.
