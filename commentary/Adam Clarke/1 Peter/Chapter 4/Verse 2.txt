<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:2">1 Peter 4:2</span>. <i><b>That he no longer should live - in the flesh</b></i> â€” Governed by the base principle of giving up his faith to save his life; <i>to</i> <i>the lusts of men</i>-according to the will of his idolatrous persecutors; <i>but to the will of God</i>; which will of God is, that he should retain the truth, and live according to its dictates, though he should suffer for it.</p>
