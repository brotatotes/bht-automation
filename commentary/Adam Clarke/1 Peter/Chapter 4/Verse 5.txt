<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:5">1 Peter 4:5</span>. <i><b>To judge the quick and the dead.</b></i> â€” They shall give account of these irregularities to Him who is prepared to judge both the Jews and the Gentiles. The <i>Gentiles</i>, previously to the preaching of the Gospel among them, were reckoned to be <i>dead in</i> <i>trespasses and sins</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1-5">Ephesians 2:1-5</span>; under the sentence of <i>death, because</i> they had sinned. The Jews had at least, by their religious profession, a name to live; and by that profession were bound to give to God.</p>
