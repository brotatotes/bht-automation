<p>Verse 7. <i><b>But the end of all things is at hand</b></i> — I think that here also St. Peter keeps the history of the deluge before his eyes, finding a parallel to the state of the Jews in his own time in that of the antediluvians in the days of Noah. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:13">Genesis 6:13</span>, God said unto Noah, <i>The end of all flesh is come before me</i>. This was spoken at a time when God had decreed the destruction of the world by a flood. Peter says, <i>The end of all things is at hand</i>; and this he spoke when God had determined to destroy the Jewish people and their polity by one of the most signal judgments that ever fell upon any nation or people.</p>
<p>In a very few years after St. Peter wrote this epistle, even taking it at the lowest computation, viz., A. D. 60 or 61, Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans. To this destruction, which was literally then at hand, the apostle alludes when he says, <i>The</i> <i>end of all things is at hand</i>; the end of the temple, the end of the Levitical priesthood, the end of the whole Jewish economy, was then at hand.</p>
<p>If these words could be taken in any general sense, then we might say to every present generation, <i>The end of all things is at</i> <i>hand</i>; the <i>end</i> of all the <i>good</i> which the <i>wicked</i> enjoy, and the end of all the <i>evil</i> which the <i>righteous</i> suffer.</p>
<p><i><b>Be - sober, and watch unto prayer.</b></i> — <i>Be sober</i>-make a prudent and moderate use of all you possess; and <i>watch</i> against all occasions of sin; and <i>pray</i> for the supporting hand of God to be upon you for good, that ye may escape the destruction that is coming upon the Jews, and that ye may be saved from among them when the scourge comes.</p>
