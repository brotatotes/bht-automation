Verse 8. Have fervent charity — αγαπηνεκτενη. Intense love; for love shall cover a multitude of sins. A loving disposition leads us to pass by the faults of others, to forgive offences against ourselves, and to excuse and lessen, as far as is consistent with truth, the transgressions of men. It does not mean that our love to others will induce God to pardon our offences. James 5:20; James 5:20.
