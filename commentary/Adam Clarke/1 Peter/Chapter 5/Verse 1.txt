<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span>. <i><b>The elders which are among you</b></i> — In this place the term πρεσβυτεροι, <i>elders</i> or <i>presbyters</i> is the name of an office. They were as <i>pastors</i> or <i>shepherds</i> of the flock of God, the Christian people among whom they lived. They were the same as <i>bishops, presidents, teachers</i> and <i>deacons</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>. And that these were the same as bishops the next verse proves.</p>
<p><i><b>Who am also an elder</b></i> — συμπρεσβυτερος. <i>A fellow elder</i>; one on a level with yourselves. Had he been what the popes of Rome say he was-<i>the prince of the apostles</i>; and <i>head of the Church</i>, and what <i>they</i> affect to be-mighty secular lords, binding the kings of the earth in chains, and their nobles in fetters of iron; could he have spoken of himself as he here does? It is true that the Roman pontiffs, in all their bulls, each style themselves <i>servus</i> <i>servorum Dei</i>, servant of the servants <i>of God</i>, while each affects to be <i>rex regum</i>, king of kings, and vicar of Jesus Christ. But the <i>popes</i> and the <i>Scriptures</i> never agree.</p>
<p><i><b>A witness of the sufferings of Christ</b></i> — He was with Christ in the <i>garden</i>; he was with him when he was <i>apprehended</i>. and he was with him in the <i>high priest's hall</i>. Whether he followed him to the <i>cross</i> we know not; probably he did not, for in the hall of the high priest he had denied him most shamefully; and, having been deeply convinced of the greatness of his crime, it is likely he withdrew to some private place, to humble himself before God, and to implore mercy. He could, however, with the strictest propriety, say, from the above circumstances, that he was a <i>witness of the sufferings of Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>A partaker of the glory</b></i> — He had a <i>right</i> to it through the blood of the Lamb; he had a blessed <i>anticipation</i> of it by the power of the Holy Ghost; and he had the <i>promise</i> from his Lord and Master that he should be with him in heaven, to behold his glory; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>.</p>
