<p>Verse 10. <i><b>But the God of all grace</b></i> — The Fountain of infinite compassion, mercy, and goodness. <i>Mohammed</i> has conveyed this fine description of the Divine Being in the words with which he commences every surat or chapter of his <i>Koran</i>, two excepted; viz.; </p>
<p><i><b>Who hath called us</b></i> — By the preaching of the Gospel.</p>
<p><i><b>Unto his eternal glory</b></i> — To the infinite felicity of the heavenly state.</p>
<p><i><b>By Christ Jesus</b></i> — Through the <i>merit</i> of his <i>passion</i> and <i>death,</i> by the <i>influence</i> of his <i>Holy Spirit</i>, by the <i>precepts</i> of his <i>Gospel</i>, and by the <i>splendour</i> of his own <i>example</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>After that ye have suffered a while</b></i> — Ολιγον παθοντας· <i>Having</i> <i>suffered a little time</i>; that is, while ye are enduring these persecutions, God will cause all to work together for your good.</p>
<p><i><b>Make you perfect</b></i> — Καταρτισει, στηριξει, σθενωσει, θεμελιωσει· All these words are read in the <i>future</i> tense by the best MSS. and versions.</p>
<p><i>He will make you perfect</i>. - Καταρτισει· Put you in <i>complete</i> <i>joint</i> as the timbers of a building.</p>
<p><i><b>Stablish</b></i> — Στηριξει· Make you <i>firm</i> in every part; adapt you strongly to each other, so that you may be mutual supports, the whole building being one in the Lord.</p>
<p><i><b>Strengthen</b></i> — Σθενωσει· Cramp and bind every part, so that there shall be no danger of warping, splitting, or falling.</p>
<p><i><b>Settle</b></i> — Θεμελιωσει· Cause all to rest so <i>evenly</i> and <i>firmly</i> upon the best and surest foundation, that ye may grow together to a holy temple in the Lord: in a word, that ye may be <i>complete</i> in all the mind that was in Christ; <i>supported</i> in all your trials and difficulties; <i>strengthened</i> to resist and overcome all your enemies; and after all <i>abide</i>, firmly <i>founded</i>, in the truth of grace. All these phrases are <i>architectural</i>; and the apostle has again in view the fine image which he produced <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>, where see the notes.</p>
