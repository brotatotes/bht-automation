<p>Verse 12. <i><b>By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I</b></i><b> </b><i><b>suppose</b></i> — To say the least of this translation, it is extremely obscure, and not put together with that elegance which is usual to our translators. I see no reason why the clause may not be thus translated: <i>I have written to you, as I consider, briefly, by</i> <i>Silvanus, the faithful brother</i>. On all hands it is allowed that this <i>Silvanus</i> was the same as <i>Silas</i>, Paul's faithful companion in travel, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:40">Acts 15:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>; and, if he were the same, Peter could never say <i>as I suppose</i> to <i>his</i> faith and piety: but he might well say this to the shortness of his epistle, notwithstanding the many and important subjects which it embraced. See the <i>Syriac, Vulgate</i>, c. If the words be applied to <i>Silvanus</i>, they must be taken in a sense in which they are often used: "I <i>conclude</i> him to be a trustworthy person one by whom I may safely send this letter; who will take care to travel through the different regions in Asia, Pontus, Galatia, and Bithynia; read it in every Church; and leave a copy for the encouragement and instruction of Christ's flock." And in such a state of the Church, in such countries, no ordinary person could have been intrusted with such a message.</p>
<p><i><b>Exhorting</b></i> — Calling upon you to be faithful, humble, and steady.</p>
<p><i><b>And testifying</b></i> — επιμαρτυρων, <i>Earnestly witnessing</i>, that it <i>is the true grace</i>-the genuine Gospel of Jesus Christ, <i>in which ye</i> <i>stand</i>, and in which ye should persevere to the end.</p>
