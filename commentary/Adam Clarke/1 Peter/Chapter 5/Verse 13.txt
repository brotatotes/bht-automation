<p>Verse 13. <i><b>The</b></i><b> Church that is </b><i><b>at Babylon</b></i> — After considering all that has been said by learned men and critics on this place, I am quite of opinion that the apostle does not mean Babylon in <i>Egypt</i>, nor <i>Jerusalem</i>, nor <i>Rome</i> as <i>figurative</i> Babylon, but the ancient celebrated Babylon in Assyria, which was, as Dr. Benson observes, the metropolis of the eastern dispersion of the Jews; but as I have said so much on this subject in the <i>preface</i>, I beg leave to refer the reader to that place.</p>
<p>Instead of <i>Babylon</i>, some MSS. mentioned by <i>Syncellus</i> in his Chronicon have ιοππη, <i>Joppa</i>; and one has ρωμη, <i>Rome</i>, in the margin, probably as the meaning, according to the writer, of the word <i>Babylon</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Elected together with</b></i><b> you</b>] συνεκλεκτη. <i>Fellow elect</i>, or <i>elected jointly</i> with you. Probably meaning that they, and the believers at Babylon, received the Gospel about the same time. On the <i>election</i> of those to whom St. Peter wrote, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And-Marcus my son.</b></i> — This is supposed to be the same person who is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>, and who is known by the name of <i>John Mark</i>; he was sister's son to Barnabas, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>, his mother's name was Mary, and he is the same who wrote the gospel that goes under his name. He is called here <i>Peter's son</i>, i.e. according to the <i>faith</i>, Peter having been probably the means of his conversion. This is very likely, as Peter seems to have been intimate at his mother's house. See the account, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:6-17">Acts 12:6-17</span>.</p>
