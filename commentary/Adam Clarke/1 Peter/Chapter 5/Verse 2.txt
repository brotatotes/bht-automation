<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>. <i><b>Feed the flock</b></i> — Do not <i>fleece</i> the flock.</p>
<p><i><b>Taking the oversight</b></i> — επισκοπουντες. Discharging the office of <i>bishops</i> or <i>superintendents</i>. This is another proof that <i>bishop</i> and <i>presbyter</i> were the same order in the <i>apostolic</i> times, though <i>afterwards</i> they were made distinct.</p>
<p><i><b>Not by constraint</b></i> — The office was laborious and dangerous, especially in these times of persecution; it is no wonder then that even those who were best qualified for the office should strive to excuse themselves with a genuine <i>Nolo episcopari</i>, "I am unwilling to be a bishop."</p>
<p><i><b>Not for filthy lucre</b></i> — Could the office of a <i>bishop</i>, in those early days, and in the time of persecution, be a <i>lucrative</i> office? Does not the Spirit of God lead the apostle to speak these things rather for <i>posterity</i> than for that time? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>But of a ready mind</b></i> — Doing all for Christ's sake, and through love to immortal souls.</p>
