Verse 1 Peter 5:2. Feed the flock — Do not fleece the flock.Taking the oversight — επισκοπουντες. Discharging the office of bishops or superintendents. This is another proof that bishop and presbyter were the same order in the apostolic times, though afterwards they were made distinct.Not by constraint — The office was laborious and dangerous, especially in these times of persecution; it is no wonder then that even those who were best qualified for the office should strive to excuse themselves with a genuine Nolo episcopari, "I am unwilling to be a bishop."Not for filthy lucre — Could the office of a bishop, in those early days, and in the time of persecution, be a lucrative office? Does not the Spirit of God lead the apostle to speak these things rather for posterity than for that time? 1 Timothy 3:3.But of a ready mind — Doing all for Christ's sake, and through love to immortal souls.
