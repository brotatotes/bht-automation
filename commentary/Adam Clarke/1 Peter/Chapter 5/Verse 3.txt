<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:3">1 Peter 5:3</span>. <i><b>Neither as being lords over</b></i><b> God's </b><i><b>heritage</b></i> — This is the voice of St. Peter in his <i>catholic</i> epistle to the <i>catholic</i> <i>Church</i>! According to him there are to be no lords over God's heritage, the bishops and presbyters who are appointed by the head of the Church are to <i>feed the flock</i>, to <i>guide</i> and to <i>defend</i> it, not to <i>fleece</i> and <i>waste</i> it; and they are to look for their reward in another world, and in the approbation of God in their consciences. And in humility, self-abasement, self-renunciation, and heavenly-mindedness, they are to be <i>ensamples</i>, τυποι, <i>types</i>, to the flock, <i>moulds</i> of a heavenly form, into which the spirits and lives of the flock may be <i>cast</i>, that they may come out after a perfect pattern. We need not ask, Does the Church that arrogates to itself the exclusive title of <i>Catholic</i>, and do its <i>supreme</i> <i>pastors</i>, who affect to be the successors of Peter and the vicars of Jesus Christ, act in this way? They are in every sense the reverse of this. But we may ask, Do the other Churches, which profess to be <i>reformed</i> from the abominations of the above, keep the advice of the apostle in their eye? Have they <i>pastors</i> <i>according to God's own heart, who feed them with knowledge and</i> <i>understanding</i>? <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:15">Jeremiah 3:15</span>. Do they feed <i>themselves</i>, and not the <i>flock</i>? Are they <i>lords over</i> <i>the heritage of Christ</i>, ruling with a high eeclesiastico-secular hand, disputing with their flocks about penny-farthing <i>tithes</i> and <i>stipends</i>, rather than contending for the faith once delivered to the saints? Are <i>they</i> heavenly <i>moulds</i>, into which the spirits and conduct of their flocks may be cast? I leave those who are concerned to answer these questions; but I put them, in the name of God, to all the preachers in the land. How many among them properly care for the flock? Even among those reputed <i>evangelical</i> teachers, are there not some who, on their first coming to a parish or a congregation, make it their <i>first</i> business to <i>raise</i> <i>the tithes</i> and the <i>stipends</i>, where, in all good conscience, there was before enough, and more than enough, to provide them and their families with not only the <i>necessaries</i>, but all the <i>conveniences</i> and <i>comforts</i> of life? conveniences and comforts which neither Jesus Christ nor his servant Peter ever enjoyed. And is not the great concern among ministers to seek for those <i>places, parishes</i>, and <i>congregations</i>, where the provision is the most ample, and the work the smallest? Preacher or minister, whosoever thou art, who readest this, apply not the word to thy <i>neighbour</i>, whether he be state-appointed, congregation-appointed, or self-appointed; take all to thyself; <i>mutato nomine de</i> TE <i>fabula narratur</i>. See that thy <i>own</i> heart, views, and conduct be right with God; and then proceed to the next verse.</p>
