<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>. <i><b>When the chief Shepherd</b></i> â€” That is, the Lord Jesus Christ, whose is the flock, and who provides the pasture, and from whom, if ye are legally called to the most awful work of preaching the Gospel, ye have received your commission; when he <i>shall appear</i> to judge the world in righteousness, ye who have fed his flock, who have taken the <i>superintendency</i> of it, not by <i>constraint</i>, nor for <i>filthy lucre's sake</i>, not as <i>lords over the heritage</i>, but with a <i>ready mind</i>, employing body, soul, spirit, time and talents, in endeavouring to pluck sinners as brands from eternal burnings, and build up the Church of Christ on its most holy faith; YE shall <i>receive a crown of glory</i> that <i>fadeth not away</i>, an eternal nearness and intimacy with the ineffably glorious God; so that ye who have turned many to righteousness shall shine, not merely as stars, but as suns in the kingdom of your Father! O ye heavenly-minded, diligent, self-denying pastors after God's own heart, whether ye be in the <i>Church</i> established by the <i>state</i>, or in those <i>divisions</i> widely separated from, or <i>nearly</i> connected with it, take courage; preach Jesus; press through all difficulties in the faith of your God; fear no evil while meditating nothing but good. Ye are stars in the right hand of Jesus, who walks among your golden candlesticks, and has lighted that lamp of life which ye are appointed to trim; fear not, <i>your</i> labour in the Lord cannot be in vain! Never, never can ye preach one sermon in the spirit of your office, which the God of all grace shall permit to be unfruitful; ye carry and sow the seed of the kingdom by the command and on the authority of your God; ye sow it, and the heavens shall drop down dew upon it. Ye may go forth weeping, though bearing this precious seed; but ye shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing your sheaves with you. Amen, even so, Lord Jesus!</p>
