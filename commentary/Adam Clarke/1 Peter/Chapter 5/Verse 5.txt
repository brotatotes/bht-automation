<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:5">1 Peter 5:5</span>. <i><b>Likewise, ye younger</b></i> — νεωτεροι probably means here <i>inferiors</i>, or those not in sacred offices; and may be understood as referring to the <i>people</i> at large who are called to obey them that have the rule over them in the Lord. In this sense our Lord, it appears, uses the word, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:26">Luke 22:26</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Be subject one to another</b></i> — Strive all to serve each other; let the pastors strive to serve the people, and the people the pastors; and let there be no contention, but who shall do most to oblige and profit all the rest.</p>
<p><i><b>Be clothed with humility</b></i> — To be <i>clothed</i> with a <i>thing</i> or <i>person</i> is a Greek mode of speech for <i>being that thing</i> or person with which a man is said <i>to be clothed</i>. Be ye <i>truly humble</i>; and let your <i>outward garb</i> and <i>conduct</i> be a proof of the humility of your hearts. εγκομβωμα, from the original word εγκομβωσασθε, signifies often an outward ornamental garment, tied in different places with <i>knots</i> or <i>bows</i>, probably ornamented all over with bows or knots of different coloured ribands, silk twist, c. But it also signifies the outward garment worn by <i>servants, slaves,</i> <i>girls</i>, and <i>shepherds</i>, which was rather intended to be the <i>guard</i> of the other garments than an <i>ornament</i> to those thus dressed: and I am rather inclined to take it in this sense than in the former for as the apostle calls upon them to be subject to each other, he desires them to put on <i>humility</i>, as the <i>encomboma</i> or <i>servant's</i> <i>dress</i>, that they may appear to be such as were <i>ready to serve</i>; and that he cannot refer to this article of clothing as an <i>ornament</i> the next words sufficiently prove: <i>God resisteth the</i> PROUD, <i>and</i> <i>giveth grace to the</i> HUMBLE-the <i>proud</i>, with all their <i>ornaments</i>, God <i>resists</i>; while those who are clothed with the humble garment he <i>adorns</i>.</p>
