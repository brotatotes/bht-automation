<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Humble yourselves</b></i> â€” Those who submit patiently to the dispensations of God's providence he lifts up; those who lift themselves up, God thrusts down.</p>
<p>If we humble not ourselves under God's <i>grace</i>, he will humble us under his <i>judgments</i>. Those who patiently submit to him, he exalts in due time; if his hand be <i>mighty</i> to <i>depress</i>, it is also <i>mighty</i> to <i>exalt</i>.</p>
