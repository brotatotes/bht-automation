Verse 6. Humble yourselves â€” Those who submit patiently to the dispensations of God's providence he lifts up; those who lift themselves up, God thrusts down.If we humble not ourselves under God's grace, he will humble us under his judgments. Those who patiently submit to him, he exalts in due time; if his hand be mighty to depress, it is also mighty to exalt.
