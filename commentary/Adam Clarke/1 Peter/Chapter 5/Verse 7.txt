Verse 7. Casting all your care — τηνμεριμναν. Your anxiety, your distracting care, on him, for he careth for you, οτιαυτω μελειπεριυμων, for he meddles or concerns himself, with the things that interest you. Whatever things concern a follower of God, whether they be spiritual or temporal, or whether in themselves great or small, God concerns himself with them; what affects them affects him; in all their afflictions he is afflicted. He who knows that God cares for him, need have no anxious cares about himself. This is a plain reference to Psalms 55:22: Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain thee. He will bear both thee and thy burden.
