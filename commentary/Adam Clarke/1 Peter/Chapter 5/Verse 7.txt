<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Casting all your care</b></i> — τηνμεριμναν. Your <i>anxiety</i>, your <i>distracting care, on him, for he careth for you</i>, οτιαυτω μελειπεριυμων, <i>for he meddles</i> or <i>concerns himself, with the</i> <i>things that interest you</i>. Whatever things concern a follower of God, whether they be spiritual or temporal, or whether in themselves great or small, God concerns himself with them; what affects them affects him; in all their afflictions he is afflicted. He who knows that God cares for him, need have no anxious cares about himself. This is a plain reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:22">Psalms 55:22</span>: <i>Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain thee</i>. He will bear both thee and thy burden.</p>
