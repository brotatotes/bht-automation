<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Be sober</b></i> — Avoid <i>drunkenness</i> of your <i>senses</i>, and <i>drunkenness</i> in your <i>souls</i>; be not <i>overcharged</i> with the concerns of the world.</p>
<p><i><b>Be vigilant</b></i> — Awake, and keep awake; be always <i>watchful</i>; never be off your guard; your enemies are alert, they are never off theirs.</p>
<p><i><b>Your adversary the devil </b></i> — This is the reason why ye should be sober and vigilant; ye have an ever active, implacable, subtle enemy to contend with. He <i>walketh about</i>-he has access to you everywhere; he knows your feelings and your propensities, and informs himself of all your circumstances; only God can know more and do more than he, therefore your care must be cast upon God.</p>
<p><i><b>As a roaring lion</b></i> — Satan tempts under <i>three</i> forms: 1. The <i>subtle serpent</i>; to beguile our senses, pervert our judgment, and enchant our imagination. 2. As an <i>angel of light</i>; to deceive us with <i>false views</i> of spiritual things, <i>refinements</i> in religion, and presumption on the providence and grace of God. 3. As a <i>roaring</i> <i>lion</i>; to bear us down, and destroy us by <i>violent opposition,</i> <i>persecution</i>, and <i>death</i>. Thus he was acting towards the followers of God at Pontus, c., who were now suffering a grievous persecution.</p>
<p><i><b>Walketh about</b></i> — Traversing the earth a plain reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="job+2:2">Job 2:2</span>, which see.</p>
<p><i><b>Seeking whom he may devour</b></i> — τινψκαταπιη. <i>Whom he may gulp</i> <i>down</i>. It is not <i>every one</i> that he can <i>swallow down</i>: those who are <i>sober</i> and <i>vigilant</i> are proof against him, these he MAY NOT <i>swallow down</i>; those who are <i>drunken</i> with the cares of this world, c., and are <i>unwatchful</i>, these he MAY <i>swallow down</i>. There is a beauty in this verse, and a striking apposition between the <i>first</i> and <i>last words</i>, which I think have not been noticed: <i>Be sober</i>, νηψατε from νη, <i>not</i>, and πιειν to <i>drink do not drink, do</i> <i>not swallow down</i>: and the word καταπιη, from κατα, <i>down</i>, and πιειν, to <i>drink</i>. If you swallow strong drink down, the devil will swallow you down. Hear this, ye drunkards, topers, tipplers, or by whatsoever name you are known in society, or among your fellow sinners. Strong drink is not only the way to the devil, but the devil's way into you; and YE are such as the devil particularly MAY <i>swallow down</i>.</p>
