<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Whom resist</b></i> — Stand against him, αντιστητε. Though <i>invulnerable</i>, he is not <i>unconquerable</i>: the weakest follower of God can confound and overpower him, if he continue <i>steadfast in the</i> <i>faith</i>-believing on the Son of God, and walking uprightly before him. To a soul thus engaged he can do no damage.</p>
<p><i><b>The same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren</b></i> — It is the lot of all the disciples of Christ to suffer persecution. The <i>brotherhood</i>, αδελφοτης, the <i>Christian Church</i>, everywhere is exposed to the assaults of men and devils; you are persecuted by the <i>heathen</i> among whom ye live, and from among whom ye are gathered into the fold of Christ: but even those who profess the same faith with you, and who are resident among the <i>Jews</i>, (for so I think ενκοσμω, <i>in the world</i>, is here to be understood,) are also persecuted, both <i>heathens</i> and <i>Jews</i> being equally opposed to the pure and holy doctrines of the Gospel. Any man who has read the Greek Testament with any attention must have observed a vast number of places in which the word κοσμος, which we translate <i>world</i>, means the <i>Jewish people</i> and the <i>Jewish state</i>, and nothing else.</p>
