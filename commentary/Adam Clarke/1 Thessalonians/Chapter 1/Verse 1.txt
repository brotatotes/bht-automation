<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span>. <i><b>Paul, and: Silvanus, and Timotheus</b></i> — Though St. Paul <i>himself</i> dictated this letter, yet he joins the names of Silas and Timothy, because they had been with him at Thessalonica, and were well known there. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And Silvanus</b></i> — This was certainly the same as <i>Silas</i>, who was St. Paul's companion in all his journeys through Asia Minor and Greece; see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:10">Acts 17:10</span>. Him and Timothy, the apostle took with him into Macedonia, and they continued at Berea when the apostle went from thence to Athens; from this place St. Paul sent for them to come to him speedily, and, though it is not said that they came while he was at Athens, yet it is most probable that they did; after which, having sent them to Thessalonica, he proceeded to Corinth, where they afterwards rejoined him, and from whence he wrote this epistle.
