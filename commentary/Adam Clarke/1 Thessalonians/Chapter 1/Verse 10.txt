<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span>. <i><b>And to wait for his Son from heaven</b></i> — To <i>expect</i> a <i>future state</i> of <i>glory</i>, and <i>resurrection</i> of the body, according to the Gospel doctrine, after the example of Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead, and ascended unto heaven, ever to appear in the presence of God for us.</p>
<p><i><b>Delivered us from the wrath to come.</b></i> — From all the punishment due to us for our sins, and from the destruction which is about to come on the unbelieving and impenitent Jews.</p>
<p>This was the <i>news</i>, the <i>sounding out</i>, that went abroad concerning the converted Thessalonians. Every where it was said: They have believed the Gospel; they have renounced idolatry; they worship the living and true God; they have received the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit; they are happy in their souls, unspotted in their lives, and full of joy; expecting an eternal glory through that Christ who had died for and purged their sins, and who shall fashion their degraded bodies and make them like to his glorious body, and give them an eternal residence with himself in a state of blessedness.</p>
<p>These were glorious news; and, wherever they were told, prepared the way of the Gospel among the heathen. The mere <i>preaching</i> of the Gospel has done much to convince and convert sinners, but the <i>lives</i> of the sincere followers of Christ, as <i>illustrative</i> of the truth of these doctrines, have done much more: Truth represented in <i>action</i> seems to assume a <i>body</i>, and thus renders itself <i>palpable</i>. In heathen countries, which are under the dominion of Christian powers, the Gospel, though established there, does little good, because of the profane and irreligious lives of those who profess it. Why has not the whole peninsula of India been long since evangelized? The Gospel has been preached there; but the lives of the Europeans professing Christianity there have been, in general, profligate, sordid, and base. From them sounded out no good report of the Gospel; and therefore the <i>Mohammedans</i> continue to prefer their <i>Koran</i>, and the <i>Hindoos</i> their <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Shasters</i>, to the <i>Bible</i>. It should now ever be acknowledged, to the glory of God, that of late years a few apostolic men in that country are turning the tide in favour of the Gospel; and several eminent Europeans have warmly espoused the doctrine of Christ, and are labouring to circulate the <i>word of God</i> through the whole of British India.</p>
