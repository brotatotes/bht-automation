<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>. <i><b>Your work of faith</b></i> â€” This verse contains a very high character of the believers at Thessalonica. They had FAITH, not <i>speculative</i> and <i>indolent</i>, but <i>true, sound</i>, and <i>operative</i>; their <i>faith worked</i>. They had LOVE, not that <i>gazed</i> at and became enamoured of the perfections of God, but such a love as <i>laboured</i> with faith to fulfil the whole will of God. Faith worked; but love, because it can do more, did more, and therefore <i>laboured</i>-worked energetically, to promote the glory of God and the salvation of men. They had HOPE; not an idle, cold, heartless expectation of future good, from which they felt no excitement, and for which they could give no reason, but such a hope as produced a satisfying expectation of a future life and state of blessedness, the reality of which faith had descried, and love anticipated; a <i>hope</i>, not hasty and impatient to get out of the trials of life and possess the heavenly inheritance, but one that was as willing to <i>endure hardships</i> as to <i>enjoy glory</i> itself, when God might be most honoured by this patient endurance. FAITH <i>worked</i>, LOVE <i>laboured</i>, and HOPE <i>endured patiently</i>.</p>
<p>It is not a mark of much grace to be longing to get to heaven because of the troubles and difficulties of the present life; they who love Christ are ever willing to suffer with him; and he may be as much glorified by <i>patient suffering</i>, as by the most <i>active</i> <i>faith</i> or <i>laborious love</i>. There are times in which, through affliction or other hinderances, we cannot <i>do</i> the will of God, but we can <i>suffer</i> it; and in such cases he seeks a heart that bears submissively, suffers patiently, and endures, as seeing him who is invisible, without repining or murmuring. This is as full a proof of Christian perfection as the most intense and ardent love. Meekness, gentleness, and long-suffering, are in our present state of more use to ourselves and others, and of more consequence in the sight of God, than all the ecstasies of the spirits of just men made perfect, and than all the raptures of an archangel. That Church or Christian society, the members of which manifest the <i>work</i> of <i>faith, labour</i> of <i>love</i>, and <i>patience</i> of <i>hope</i>, is most nearly allied to heaven, and is on the suburbs of glory.</p>
