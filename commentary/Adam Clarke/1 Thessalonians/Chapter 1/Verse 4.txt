<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:4">1 Thessalonians 1:4</span>. <i><b>Knowing - your election of God.</b></i> â€” Being assured, from the doctrine which I have delivered to you, and which God has confirmed by various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, that he has <i>chosen</i> and <i>called</i> the Gentiles to the same privileges to which he <i>chose</i> and <i>called</i> the Jews; and that, as they have rejected the offers of the Gospel, God has now <i>elected</i> the Gentiles in their stead. This is the <i>election</i> which the Thessalonians <i>knew</i>; and of which the apostle treats at large in his Epistle to the <i>Romans</i>, and also in his Epistles to the <i>Galatians</i> and <i>Ephesians</i>. No irrespective, unconditional, eternal, and personal election to everlasting glory, is meant by the apostle. <i>As</i> God had chosen the Jews, whom, because of their obstinate unbelief, he had now rejected; <i>so</i> he had now chosen or elected the Gentiles. And in neither case was there any thing absolute; all was most specifically conditional, as far as their <i>final salvation</i> was concerned; without any merit on their side, they were <i>chosen</i> and <i>called</i> to those blessings which, if <i>rightly</i> <i>used</i>, would lead them to eternal glory. That these blessings could be <i>abused</i>-become finally useless and forfeited, they had an ample proof in the case of the Jews, who, after having been the <i>elect</i> of God for more than 2000 years, were now become <i>reprobates</i>.</p>
