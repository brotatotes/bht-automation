<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</span>. <i><b>For our Gospel</b></i> — That is, the glad tidings of salvation by Jesus Christ, and of your being elected to enjoy all the privileges to which the Jews were called, without being obliged to submit to circumcision, or fulfil the rites and ceremonies of the Mosaic law.</p>
<p><i><b>Came not unto you in word only</b></i> — It was not by <i>simple teaching</i> or mere <i>reasoning</i> that the doctrines which we preached recommended themselves to you, we did not insist on your using this or the other religious institution; we insisted on a change of heart and life, and we held out the energy which was able to effect it.</p>
<p><i><b>But also in power</b></i> — εν δυναμει. With <i>miraculous</i> manifestations, to your eyes and to your hearts, which induced you to acknowledge that this Gospel was the <i>power of God unto</i> <i>salvation</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And in the Holy Ghost</b></i> — By his influence upon your hearts, in changing and renewing them; and by the testimony which ye received from him, that you were accepted through the Beloved, and become the adopted children of God.</p>
<p><i><b>And in much assurance</b></i> — εν πληροφορια πολλη. The Holy Spirit which was given you <i>left no doubt</i> on your mind, either with respect to the <i>general truth</i> of the doctrine, or the safety of your own state. Ye had the fullest assurance that the Gospel was true, and the fullest assurance that ye had received the remission of sins through that Gospel; the Spirit himself bearing witness with your spirit, that you are the sons and daughters of God Almighty.</p>
<p><i><b>What manner of men we were</b></i> — How we <i>preached</i>, and how we <i>lived</i>; our <i>doctrines</i> and our <i>practices</i> ever corresponding. And <i>for your</i> <i>sakes</i> we sustained difficulties, endured hardships, and were incessant in our labours.</p>
