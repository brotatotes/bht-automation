<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Ye became followers of us</b></i> — Ye became <i>imitators</i>, μιμηται, of us-ye believed the same truths, walked in the same way, and minded the same thing; knowing that our doctrine was of the Lord, and that the way in which we walked was prescribed by himself, and that he also suffered the contradictions of ungodly men.</p>
<p><i><b>Having received the word in much affliction</b></i> — That they received the doctrine of the Gospel in the midst of much persecution we may learn from the history in general, and from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5-6">Acts 17:5-6</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>With joy of the Holy Ghost</b></i> — The consolations which they received, in consequence of believing in Christ, more than counterbalanced all the afflictions which they suffered from their persecutors.</p>
