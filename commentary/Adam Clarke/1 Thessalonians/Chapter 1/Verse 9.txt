<p>Verse 9. <i><b>How ye turned to God from idols</b></i> — This could not be spoken either of the <i>Jews</i> or of the <i>devout persons</i>, but of the <i>heathen Greeks</i>, and of such it appears that the majority of the Church was formed. See what is said on this subject in the <i>preface</i> to this epistle.</p>
<p><i><b>To serve the living and true God</b></i> — The living God; in opposition to the idols, which were either <i>inanimate</i> stocks or stones, or the representations of <i>dead</i> men.</p>
<p><i>The true God</i>-In opposition to the whole system of idolatry, which was <i>false</i> in the <i>objects</i> of its <i>adoration, false</i> in its <i>pretensions, false</i> in its <i>promises</i>, and false in all its <i>prospects</i>.</p>
