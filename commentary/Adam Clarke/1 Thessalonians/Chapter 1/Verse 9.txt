Verse 9. How ye turned to God from idols — This could not be spoken either of the Jews or of the devout persons, but of the heathen Greeks, and of such it appears that the majority of the Church was formed. See what is said on this subject in the preface to this epistle.To serve the living and true God — The living God; in opposition to the idols, which were either inanimate stocks or stones, or the representations of dead men.The true God-In opposition to the whole system of idolatry, which was false in the objects of its adoration, false in its pretensions, false in its promises, and false in all its prospects.
