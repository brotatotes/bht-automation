<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Ye</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>witnesses, and God</b></i><b> also, </b><i><b>how holily</b></i> â€” i.e., in reference to GOD; how <i>justly</i> in reference to <i>men</i>; and <i>unblamably</i> in reference to our <i>spirit</i> and <i>conduct</i>, as ministers of Christ, <i>we behaved ourselves among you</i>. What a consciousness of his own integrity must St. Paul have had to use the expressions that are here! No hypocrite, and none who did the work of the Lord carelessly, could make such an appeal both to God and man.</p>
