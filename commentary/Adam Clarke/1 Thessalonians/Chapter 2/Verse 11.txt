Verse 11. How we exhorted — What pastoral care is marked here! They exhorted-were continually teaching and instructing, the objects of their charge; this was their general work.And comforted — They found many under trials and temptations, and those they encouraged.And charged — μαρτυρουμενοι. Continued witness to the people that all the threatenings and promises of God were true; that he required faith, love, and obedience; that he could not behold sin with allowance; that Jesus died to save them from their sins; and that, without holiness, none should see God. And all these things they did, not in a general way only, but they spoke to every man; none was left unnoticed, unadmonished, uncomforted. The spirit in which they performed all these branches of the pastoral care was that which was most likely to insure success; as a father treats his children, so they treated every member of the Church.
