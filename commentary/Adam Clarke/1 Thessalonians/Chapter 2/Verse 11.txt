<p>Verse 11. <i><b>How we exhorted</b></i> — What pastoral care is marked here! They <i>exhorted</i>-were continually teaching and instructing, the objects of their charge; this was their <i>general</i> work.</p>
<p><i><b>And comforted</b></i> — They found many under trials and temptations, and those they encouraged.</p>
<p><i><b>And charged</b></i> — μαρτυρουμενοι. Continued <i>witness</i> to the people that all the threatenings and promises of God were true; that he required faith, love, and obedience; that he could not behold sin with allowance; that Jesus died to save them from their sins; and that, without holiness, none should see God. And all these things they did, not in a general way only, but they spoke to <i>every man</i>; none was left unnoticed, unadmonished, uncomforted. The spirit in which they performed all these branches of the pastoral care was that which was most likely to insure success; as a <i>father</i> treats his children, so they treated every member of the Church.</p>
