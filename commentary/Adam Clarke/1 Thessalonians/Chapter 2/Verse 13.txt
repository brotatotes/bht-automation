<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Ye received the word of God</b></i> â€” Ye received the <i>doctrine</i> of God, not as any thing fabricated by <i>man</i>, but as coming immediately from God himself, we being only his <i>messengers</i> to declare what he had previously revealed to us. And ye have had the fullest proof that ye have not believed in vain; for that doctrine, under the power and influence of the Holy Ghost, has <i>worked most powerfully</i> in you, filling you with light, life, and holiness.</p>
