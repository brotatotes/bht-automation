<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Ye - became followers of the Churches of God</b></i> — There is not a word here of the <i>Church of Rome</i> being the <i>model</i> after which the other Churches were to be formed; it had no such pre-eminence: this honour belonged to the <i>Churches of Judea</i>; it was according to <i>them</i>, not the Church at <i>Rome</i>, that the Asiatic Churches were modelled. The purest of all the apostolic Churches was that of the <i>Thessalonians</i>, and this was formed after the Christian Churches in <i>Judea</i>.</p>
<p>Had any pre-eminence or authority belonged to the Church of Rome, the apostle would have proposed this as a model to all those which he formed either in Judea, Asia Minor, Greece, or Italy.</p>
<p><i><b>Ye also have suffered-of your own countrymen</b></i> — It is worthy of remark that, in almost every case, the <i>Jews</i> were the leaders of all persecutions against the apostles and the infant Church. And what they could not do <i>themselves</i>, they instigated others to do; and, by gathering together lewd fellows of the baser sort from among the Gentiles, they made frequent uproars, and especially at Thessalonica, where the opposition to the Gospel was very high, and the persecution of the Christians very hot.</p>
