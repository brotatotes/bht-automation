<p>Verse 15. 16. <i><b>Who hath killed the Lord Jesus</b></i>, c.] What a finished but just character is this of the Jews!</p>
<p>1. <i>They slew the</i> <i>Lord Jesus</i>, through the most unprincipled and fell malice.</p>
<p>2. They <i>killed their own prophets</i> there was no time in which the seed of the serpent did not hate and oppose spiritual things, they slew even their own prophets who declared to them the will of God.</p>
<p>3. They <i>persecuted the apostles</i> showing the same spirit of enmity to the <i>Gospel</i> which they had shown to the <i>law</i>.</p>
<p>4. <i>They did</i> <i>not please God</i>, nor seek to please him; though they pretended that their opposition to the Gospel was through their <i>zeal for God's</i> <i>glory</i>, they were <i>hypocrites</i> of the worst kind.</p>
<p>5. They <i>were</i> <i>contrary to all men</i>; they hated the whole human race, and judged and wished them to perdition.</p>
<p>6. They <i>forbade the apostles to</i> <i>preach to the Gentiles, lest they should be saved</i>; this was an inveteracy of malice completely superhuman; they persecuted the body to death, and the soul to damnation! They were afraid that the Gentiles should get their souls saved if the Gospel was preached to them!</p>
<p>7. They <i>filled up their sins always</i>; they had no mere <i>purposes</i> or <i>outlines</i> of iniquity, all were filled up; every <i>evil purpose</i> was followed, as far as possible, with a <i>wicked</i> <i>act</i>! Is it any wonder, therefore, that <i>wrath</i> should <i>come upon</i> <i>them to the uttermost</i>? It is to be reckoned among the highest mercies of God that the whole nation was not pursued by the Divine justice to utter and final extinction.</p>
