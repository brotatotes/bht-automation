<p>Verse 19. <i><b>For what</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>our hope</b></i> â€” I can have no prospects from earth; I have forsaken all for the Gospel; and esteem every thing it can afford as dross and dung, that I may gain Christ. Why then should I continually labour at the risk of my life, preaching the Gospel? Is it not to get your souls saved, that ye may be <i>my</i> <i>crown of rejoicing in the day of Christ</i>? For this I labour; and, having <i>planted</i> the Gospel among you, I wish to take every opportunity of <i>watering</i> it, that it may grow up unto eternal life.</p>
