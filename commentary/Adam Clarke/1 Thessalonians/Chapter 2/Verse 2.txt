<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>. <i><b>Shamefully entreated - at Philippi</b></i> — There Paul and Silas had been beaten with many stripes, shut up in the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>, c. and the notes there.</p>
<p><i><b>With much contention.</b></i> — The words εν πολλω αγωνι not only signify, <i>with intense labour</i> and <i>earnestness</i>, but may here mean, <i>exposed to the greatest danger; at the peril of our lives</i>. The Greek phrase quoted by <i>Rosenmuller</i> is to the point, αγων προφασιν ουκ αναμενει, <i>in danger we must not delay</i>-activity and despatch are then indispensably necessary.</p>
