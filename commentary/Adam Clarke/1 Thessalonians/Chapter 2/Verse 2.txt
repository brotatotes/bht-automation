Verse 1 Thessalonians 2:2. Shamefully entreated - at Philippi — There Paul and Silas had been beaten with many stripes, shut up in the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks. See Acts 16:23, c. and the notes there.With much contention. — The words εν πολλω αγωνι not only signify, with intense labour and earnestness, but may here mean, exposed to the greatest danger; at the peril of our lives. The Greek phrase quoted by Rosenmuller is to the point, αγων προφασιν ουκ αναμενει, in danger we must not delay-activity and despatch are then indispensably necessary.
