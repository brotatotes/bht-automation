<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:3">1 Thessalonians 2:3</span>. <i><b>Our exhortation</b></i> — The word παρακλησις has a very extensive meaning; it signifies not only <i>exhortation</i> and <i>teaching</i> in general, but also <i>encouragement, consolation</i>, and the like. When the apostles exhorted or admonished men, it was that they should turn from <i>evil</i> to <i>good</i>, from <i>misery</i> to <i>happiness</i>, from <i>Satan</i> to <i>God</i>, and from <i>hell</i> to <i>heaven</i>. Their exhortations having this object, every word was <i>consolatory</i>; and as the truth which they delivered was unquestionable, therefore their ministry was a subject of the highest encouragement and joy.</p>
<p><i><b>Not of deceit</b></i> — We did not endeavour to allure you with false pretences; we did not deceive you, nor were we deceived ourselves.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor of uncleanness</b></i> — Such as the teachings of the Gentile philosophers were; their supreme gods were celebrated for their adulteries, fornications, uncleannesses, thefts, barbarities, and profligacies of the most odious kind. Our Gospel was pure; came from the pure and holy God; was accompanied with the influences of the Holy Spirit, and produced purity both in the hearts and lives of all that received it.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor in guile</b></i> — We had no false pretences, and were influenced by no sinister motives.</p>
