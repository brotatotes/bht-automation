Verse 1 Thessalonians 2:5. Flattering words — Though we proclaimed the Gospel or glad tidings, yet we showed that without holiness none should see the Lord.Ye know — That while we preached the whole Gospel we never gave any countenance to sin.For a cloak of covetousness — We did not seek temporal emolument; nor did we preach the Gospel for a cloak to our covetousness: God is witness that we did not; we sought you, not yours. Hear this, ye that preach the Gospel! Can ye call God to witness that in preaching it ye have no end in view by your ministry but his glory in the salvation of souls? Or do ye enter into the priesthood for a morsel of bread, or for what is ominously and impiously called a living, a benefice? In better days your place and office were called a cure of souls; what care have you for the souls of them by whose labours you are in general more than sufficiently supported? Is it your study, your earnest labour, to bring sinners to God; to preach among your heathen parishioners the unsearchable riches of Christ?But I should speak to the thousands who have no parishes, but who have their chapels, their congregations, pew and seat rents, c., c. Is it for the sake of these that ye have entered or continue in the Gospel ministry? Is God witness that, in all these things, ye have no cloak of covetousness? Happy is the man who can say so, whether he has the provision which the law of the land allows him, or whether he lives on the free-will offerings of the people.The faithful labourer is worthy of his hire for the ox that treads out the corn should not be muzzled and they that preach the Gospel should live, not riot, by the Gospel. But wo to that man who enters into the labour for the sake of the hire! he knows not Christ; and how can he preach him?
