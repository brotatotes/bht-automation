Verse 6. Nor of men sought we glory — As we preached not for worldly gain, so we preached not for popular applause; we had what we sought for-the approbation of God, and the testimony of a good conscience.When we might have been burdensome — They had a right to their maintenance while they devoted themselves wholly to the work of the Gospel for the sake of the people's souls. Others understand the words εν βαρει ειναι, to be honourable; we sought no glory of you nor of others, though we were honourable as the apostles of Christ. כבוד cabod, in Hebrew, to which the Greek βαρος answers, signifies not only weight but glory; and in both these senses the apostle uses it, 2 Corinthians 4:17.
