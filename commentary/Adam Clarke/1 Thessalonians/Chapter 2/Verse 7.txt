<p>Verse 7. <i><b>But we were gentle among you</b></i> — Far from assuming the authority which we had, we acted towards you as a tender nurse or parent does to a delicate child. We fed, counselled, cherished, and bore with you; we taught you to walk, preserved you from stumbling, and led you in a right path.</p>
<p>Instead of ηπιοι, <i>gentle</i>, many MSS., and several versions and fathers, have νηπιοι, <i>young children</i>. But this never can be considered the original reading, the scope of the place being totally opposed to it. It is the Thessalonians whom the apostle considers as <i>young children</i>, and <i>himself</i> and fellow labourers as the <i>nurse</i>; he could with no propriety say that he was among them as a <i>little child</i>, while himself professed to be <i>their nurse</i>.</p>
