<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Being affectionately desirous of you</b></i> — We had such intense love for you that we were not only willing and forward to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ to you, but also to give our <i>own lives</i> for your sake, <i>because ye were dear</i>, διοτι αγαπητοι ἡμιν, <i>because ye were beloved by us</i>. The words used here by the apostle are expressive of the strongest affection and attachment.</p>
