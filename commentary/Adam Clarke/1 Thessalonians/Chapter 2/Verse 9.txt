<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Ye remember - our labour and travail</b></i> â€” From this it appears that St. Paul spent much more time at Thessalonica than is generally supposed; for the expressions in this verse denote a long continuance of a constantly exercised ministry, interrupted only by manual labour for their own support; <i>labouring night and</i> <i>day, because we would not be chargeable to you</i>. Probably Paul and his companions worked with their hands by <i>day</i>, and spent a considerable part of the <i>night</i>, or <i>evenings</i>, in preaching Christ to the people.</p>
