<p><i><b>Might perfect that which is lacking</b></i> — That I might have the opportunity of giving you the fullest instructions in the doctrine of Christ, that ye might have every thing in the most ample <i>detail</i>; so that the great <i>outlines</i> of truth which you already know may be <i>filled up</i>, that ye may be perfectly fitted to every good word and work.</p>
