<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Make you to increase and abound in love</b></i> â€” They had already love to each other, so as to unite them in one Christian body; and he prays that they may have an <i>increase</i> and an <i>abundance</i> of it; that they might feel the same love to each other which he felt for them all.</p>
