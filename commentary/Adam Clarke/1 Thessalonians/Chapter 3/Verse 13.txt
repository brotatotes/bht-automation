<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>. <i><b>To the end he may establish your hearts</b></i> — Without <i>love</i> to God and man, there can be no establishment in the religion of Christ. It is <i>love</i> that produces both <i>solidity</i> and <i>continuance</i>. And, as <i>love is the fulfilling of the law</i>, he who is filled with love is <i>unblamable in holiness</i>: for he who has the love of God in him is a partaker of the Divine nature, for <i>God</i> is love.</p>
<p><i><b>At the coming of our Lord</b></i> — God is coming to judge the world; every hour that passes on in the general lapse of time is advancing his approach; whatsoever he does is in reference to this great event: and whatsoever <i>we</i> do should be in reference to the same. But who in that great day shall give up his accounts with joy? That person only whose heart is established in holiness <i>before God</i>; i.e., so as to bear the eye and strict scrutiny of his Judge. Reader, lay this to heart, for thou knowest not what a moment may bring forth. When thy soul departs from thy body it will be the <i>coming of the Lord</i> to <i>thee</i>.</p>
