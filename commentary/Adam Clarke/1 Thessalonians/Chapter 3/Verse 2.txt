<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:2">1 Thessalonians 3:2</span>. <i><b>Timotheus, our brother</b></i> — It appears that Timothy was but a youth when converted to God; he had now however been some years in the work of God; Paul therefore calls him his <i>brother</i>, being one of the same Christian <i>family</i>, a <i>son of God</i> by <i>adoption</i>: elsewhere he calls him <i>his own son</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>; and his <i>dearly beloved son</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:2">2 Timothy 1:2</span>; because he was brought to the knowledge of the true God, and to salvation by Christ, through the apostle's instrumentality. See the <i>preface</i> to the First Epistle to Timothy.</p>
<p><i><b>Minister of God</b></i> — Employed by God to preach the Gospel; this was God's work, and he had appointed Timothy to do it, and to do it at this time in conjunction with St. Paul; and therefore he calls him his <i>fellow labourer</i>. There were no <i>sinecures</i> then; preaching the Gospel was God's work; the primitive preachers were his <i>workmen</i>, and <i>laboured</i> in this calling. It is the same still, but who <i>works</i>?</p>
