Verse 1 Thessalonians 3:3. That no man should be moved — That is, caused to apostatize from Christianity.We are appointed thereunto. — εις τουτο κειμεθα. We are exposed to this, we lie open to such, they are unavoidable in the present state of things; as the Latins say, sic est sors nostra, "this is our lot." God appoints nothing of this kind, but he permits it: for he has made man a free agent.
