<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:3">1 Thessalonians 3:3</span>. <i><b>That no man should be moved</b></i> — That is, caused to apostatize from Christianity.</p>
<p><i><b>We are appointed thereunto.</b></i> — εις τουτο κειμεθα. <i>We are</i> <i>exposed to this, we lie open to such, they are unavoidable</i> in the present state of things; as the Latins say, <i>sic est sors nostra</i>, "this is our lot." God <i>appoints</i> nothing of this kind, but he <i>permits</i> it: for he has made man a <i>free agent</i>.</p>
