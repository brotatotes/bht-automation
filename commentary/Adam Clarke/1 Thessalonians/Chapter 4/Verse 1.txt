<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</span>. <i><b>We beseech you, brethren, and exhort</b></i> — We give you proper <i>instructions</i> in heavenly things, and <i>request</i> you to attend to our advice. The apostle used the most pressing entreaties; for he had a strong and affectionate desire that this Church should excel in all righteousness and true holiness.</p>
<p><i><b>Please God more and more.</b></i> — God sets no <i>bounds</i> to the communications of his grace and Spirit to them that are faithful. And as there are no bounds to the <i>graces</i>, so there should be none to the <i>exercise</i> of those graces. No man can ever <i>feel</i> that he loves God too much, or that he loves man too much for God's sake.</p>
