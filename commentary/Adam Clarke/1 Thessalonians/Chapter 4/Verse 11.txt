<p>Verse 11. <i><b>That ye study to be quiet</b></i> — Though in general the Church at Thessalonica was pure and exemplary, yet there seem to have been some <i>idle, tattling</i> people among them, who disturbed the peace of others; persons who, under the pretence of religion, <i>gadded about from house to house</i>; did not <i>work</i>, but were burdensome to others; and were continually <i>meddling</i> with other people's business, <i>making parties</i>, and procuring their bread by religious gossipping. To these the apostle gives those directions which the whole Church of God should enforce wherever such troublesome and dangerous people are found; viz: That they should <i>study to be quiet</i>, ησυχαζειν, <i>to hold their peace</i>, as their religious cant will never promote true religion; that they should <i>do their own business</i>, and let that of others alone; and that they should <i>work with their own hands</i>, and not be a burden to the Church of God, or to those well meaning but weak and inconsiderate people who entertain them, being imposed on by their apparent sanctity and glozing conversation. An <i>idle</i> person, though able to discourse like an angel, or pray like an apostle, cannot be a Christian; all such are hypocrites and deceivers; the true members of the Church of Christ <i>walk, work</i>, and <i>labour</i>.</p>
