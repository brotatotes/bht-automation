<p>Verse 12. <i><b>That ye may walk honestly</b></i> — ευσχημονως. <i>Becomingly,</i> <i>decently, respectably</i>; as is <i>consistent</i> with the <i>purity, holiness,</i> <i>gravity</i>, and <i>usefulness</i> of your Christian calling.</p>
<p><i><b>Them that are without</b></i> — The unconverted <i>Gentiles</i> and Jews. See this expression explained at large on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>That </b><i><b>ye may have lack of nothing.</b></i> — That ye may be able to get your bread by honest labour, which God will ever bless; and be chargeable to no man. He that is dependent on another is necessarily in bondage; and he who is able to get his own bread by the sweat of his brow, should not be under obligation even to a king.</p>
<p>I do not recollect whether, in any other part of this work, I have given the following story from the <i>Hatem Tai Nameh</i>. Hatem Tai was an Arabian nobleman, who flourished some time before the Mahommedan era; he was reputed the most <i>generous</i> and <i>liberal</i> man in all the east. One day he slew one hundred camels, and made a feast, to which all the Arabian lords and all the peasantry in the district were invited. About the time of the feast he took a walk towards a neighbouring wood, to see if he could find any person whom he might invite to partake of the entertainment which he had then provided. Walking along the skirt of the wood, he espied an old man coming out of it, laden with a burden of faggots; he accosted him and asked if he had not heard of the entertainment made that day by <i>Hatem Tai</i>. The old man answered in the affirmative. He asked him why he did not attend and partake with the rest. The old man answered: "He that is able to gain his bread even by collecting faggots in the wood, should not be beholden even <i>to Hatem Tai</i>." This is a noble saying, and has long been a rule of conduct to the writer of this note.</p>
