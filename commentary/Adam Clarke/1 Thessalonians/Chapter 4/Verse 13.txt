<p>Verse 13. <i><b>I would not have you to be ignorant</b></i> — Instead of εχομεν, <i>have</i>, θελομεν, <i>wish</i>, is the reading of ADEFG, many others, besides the <i>Arabic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, some of the <i>Slavonian</i>, the <i>Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, with many of the Greek <i>fathers</i>. This is undoubtedly the true reading: <i>Brethren, I would</i> <i>not wish you to be ignorant</i>; or, <i>I would not that you should be</i> <i>ignorant</i>.</p>
<p>This was probably one of the points which were <i>lacking in their</i> <i>faith</i>, that he wished to go to Thessalonica to instruct them in.</p>
<p><i><b>Them which are asleep</b></i> — That is, those who are <i>dead</i>. It is supposed that the apostle had heard that the Thessalonians continued to lament over their dead, as the heathens did in general who had <i>no hope</i> of the resurrection of the body; and that they had been puzzled concerning the doctrine of the resurrection. To set them right on this important subject, he delivers three important truths:</p>
<p>1. He asserts, as he had done before, that they who died in the Lord should have, in virtue of Christ's resurrection, a resurrection unto eternal life and blessedness.</p>
<p>2. He makes a new discovery, that the <i>last generation</i> should not die at all, but be in a moment changed to immortals.</p>
<p>3. He adds another new discovery, that, though the living should not die, but be transformed, yet the dead should first be raised, and be made glorious and immortal; and so, in some measure, have the preference and advantage of such as shall then be found alive. See <i>Dodd</i>.</p>
