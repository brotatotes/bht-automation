Verse 14. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again — ει γαρ. Seeing that we believe; knowing that the resurrection of Christ is as fully authenticated as his death.Even so them — It necessarily follows that them who sleep-die, in him-in the faith of the Gospel, will God bring with him-he will raise them up as Jesus was raised from the dead, in the same manner, i.e. by his own eternal power and energy; and he will bring them with him-with Christ, for he is the head of the Church, which is his body.
