<p>Verse 14. <i><b>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again</b></i> — ει γαρ. <i>Seeing that we believe</i>; knowing that the <i>resurrection</i> of Christ is as fully authenticated as his death.</p>
<p><i><b>Even so them</b></i> — It necessarily follows that them who <i>sleep</i>-die, <i>in him</i>-in the faith of the Gospel, <i>will God bring with him</i>-he will raise them up as Jesus was raised from the dead, in the same manner, i.e. by his own eternal power and energy; and he will bring them <i>with him</i>-with Christ, for he is the <i>head</i> of the Church, which is his <i>body</i>.</p>
