<p>Verse 15. <i><b>This we say unto you by the word of the Lord</b></i> — This I have, by <i>express revelation</i>, from the Lord: what he now delivers, he gives as coming immediately from the Spirit of God. Indeed, human reason could not have found out the points which he immediately subjoins; no <i>conjectures</i> could lead to them. Allowing even the general doctrine of the resurrection to be believed, yet what follows does not flow from the premises; they are doctrines of pure revelation, and such as never could have been found out by human ingenuity. In no place does the apostle speak more confidently and positively of his <i>inspiration</i> than here; and we should prepare ourselves to receive some momentous and interesting truth.</p>
<p><i><b>We which are alive</b></i><b>, and </b><i><b>remain</b></i> — By the pronoun <i>we</i> the apostle does not intend <i>himself</i>, and the <i>Thessalonians</i> to whom he was then writing; he is speaking of the genuine Christians which shall be found on earth when Christ comes to judgment. From not considering the manner in which the apostle uses this word, some have been led to suppose that he imagined that the day of judgment would take place in <i>that generation</i>, and while he and the then believers at Thessalonica <i>were in life</i>. But it is impossible that a man, under so direct an influence of the Holy Spirit, should be permitted to make such a mistake: nay, no man in the exercise of his sober reason could have formed such an opinion; there was nothing to warrant the supposition; no premises from which it could be fairly deduced; nor indeed any thing in the <i>circumstances</i> of the <i>Church</i>, nor in the <i>constitution</i> of the <i>world</i>, that could have suggested a hint of the kind. The apostle is speaking of the thing <i>indefinitely</i> as to the <i>time</i> when it shall happen, but <i>positively</i> as to the ORDER that shall be then observed.</p>
<p><i><b>Shall not prevent them which are asleep.</b></i> — Those who shall be found living in that day, though they shall not pass through death, but be suddenly changed, shall not go to glory <i>before</i> them that are dead, <i>for the dead in Christ shall rise first</i>-they shall be raised, their bodies made glorious, and be caught up to meet the Lord, <i>before</i> the others shall be changed. And this appears to be the meaning of the apostle's words, μη φθασωμεν, which we translate <i>shall not prevent</i>; for, although this word <i>prevent</i>, from <i>prae</i> and <i>venio</i>, literally signifies to go before, yet we use it now in the sense of <i>to hinder</i> or <i>obstruct</i>. φθανειντινα signifies the same, according to <i>Hesychius</i>, as προηκειν, <i>to go</i> <i>before</i>, προλαμβανειν, to <i>anticipate, be before</i>. Those who shall be found alive on that day shall not anticipate glory before the dead in Christ; for they shall rise <i>first</i>, and begin the enjoyment of it before the others shall be changed. This appears to be the apostle's meaning.</p>
