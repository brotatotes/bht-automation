<p>Verse 16. <i><b>The Lord himself</b></i> — That is: Jesus Christ <i>shall</i> <i>descend from heaven</i>; shall descend in like manner as he was seen by his disciples to ascend, i.e. in his human form, but now infinitely more glorious; for <i>thousands of thousands shall</i> <i>minister unto him</i>, and <i>ten thousand times ten thousand shall stand</i> <i>before him</i>; for <i>the Son of man shall come on the throne of his</i> <i>glory</i>: but who may abide the day of his coming, or stand when he appeareth?</p>
<p><i><b>With a shout</b></i> — Or <i>order</i>, ενκελευσματι. and probably in these words. <i>Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment</i>; which order shall be repeated by the archangel, who shall accompany it with the sound of the trump of God, whose great and terrible blasts, like those on mount Sinai, <i>sounding louder and louder</i>, shall shake both the heavens and the earth!</p>
<p>Observe the order of this terribly glorious day:</p>
<p>1. Jesus, in all the dignity and splendour of his eternal majesty, <i>shall</i> <i>descend from heaven</i> to the mid region, what the apostle calls the <i>air</i>, somewhere within the earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>2. Then the κελευσμα, <i>shout</i> or <i>order</i>, shall be given for the dead to arise.</p>
<p>3. Next the archangel, as the <i>herald</i> of Christ, shall repeat the order, <i>Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment</i>!</p>
<p>4. When all the dead in Christ are raised, then the <i>trumpet shall sound</i>, as the signal for them all to flock together to the throne of Christ. It was by the <i>sound of the trumpet</i> that the solemn assemblies, under the law, were convoked; and to such convocations there appears to be here an allusion.</p>
<p>5. When the dead in Christ are raised, their vile bodies being made like unto his glorious body, then,</p>
<p>6. Those who <i>are</i> alive shall be <i>changed</i>, and made immortal.</p>
<p>7. These shall be <i>caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air</i>.</p>
<p>8. We may suppose that the judgment will now be set, and the books opened, and the dead judged out of the things written in those books.</p>
<p>9. The eternal states of quick and dead being thus determined, then all who shall be found to have <i>made a covenant</i> <i>with him by sacrifice</i>, and to have <i>washed their robes, and made</i> <i>them white in the blood of the Lamb</i>, shall be taken to his eternal glory, and <i>be for ever with the Lord</i>. What an inexpressibly terrific glory will then be exhibited! I forbear to call in here the descriptions which men of a poetic turn have made of this terrible scene, because I cannot trust to their correctness; and it is a subject which we should speak of and contemplate as nearly as possible in the words of Scripture.</p>
