<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</span>. <i><b>This is the will of God</b></i><b>, even </b><i><b>your sanctification</b></i> — God has called you to holiness; he requires that you should be holy; for without holiness none can see the Lord. This is the <i>general</i> calling, but in it many particulars are included. Some of these he proceeds to mention; and it is very likely that these had been points on which he gave them particular instructions while among them.</p>
<p><i><b>That ye should abstain from fornication</b></i> — The word πορνεια, as we have seen in other places, includes <i>all sorts of uncleanness</i>; and it was probably this consideration that induced several MSS., some <i>versions</i> and <i>fathers</i>, to add here πασης, all. Directions of this kind were peculiarly necessary among the Greeks, and indeed heathens in general, who were strongly addicted to such vices.</p>
