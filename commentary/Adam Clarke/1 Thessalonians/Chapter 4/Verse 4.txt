<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span>. <i><b>How to possess his vessel</b></i> — Let every man use his <i>wife</i> for the purpose alone for which God created her, and instituted <i>marriage</i>. The word ακευος answers to the Hebrew כלי <i>keli</i>, which, though it signifies <i>vessel</i> in general, has several other meanings. That the rabbins frequently express <i>wife</i> by it, <i>Schoettgen</i> largely proves; and to me it appears very probable that the apostle uses it in that sense here. St. Peter calls the wife the <i>weaker</i> VESSEL, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:7">1 Peter 3:7</span>. Others think that the <i>body</i> is meant, which is the <i>vessel</i> in which the <i>soul</i> dwells. In this sense St. Paul uses it, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>: <i>We have this treasure in earthen</i> VESSELS; and in this sense it is used by both Greek and Roman authors. There is a <i>third</i> sense which interpreters have put on the word, which I forbear to name. The general sense is plain; <i>purity</i> and <i>continency</i> are most obviously intended, whether the word be understood as referring to the <i>wife</i> or the <i>husband</i>, as the following verse sufficiently proves.</p>
