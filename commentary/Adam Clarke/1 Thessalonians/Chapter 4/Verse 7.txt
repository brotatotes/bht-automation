<p>Verse 7. <i><b>God hath not called us unto uncleanness</b></i> â€” He is the creator of male and female, and the institutor of marriage, and he has called men and women to this state; but the <i>end</i> of this and all the other callings of God to man is <i>holiness</i>, not <i>uncleanness</i>. And they who use the marriage state as he directs, will find it conducive to their holiness and perfection.</p>
