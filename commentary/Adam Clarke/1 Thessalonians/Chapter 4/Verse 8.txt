<p>Verse 8. <i><b>He therefore that despiseth</b></i> — He who will not receive these teachings, and is led either to undervalue or despise them, despises not us but God, from whom we have received our commission, and by whose Spirit we give these directions. See Clarke's note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.</b></i> — Instead of εις ημας, <i>unto</i> US, εις υμας, <i>unto</i> YOU, is the reading of BDEFG, a great many others, the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic, Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, some of the <i>Itala, Clement, Didymus</i>, and <i>Ambrosiaster</i>; this seems to be the better reading. God has taught <i>us</i> that we may teach <i>you</i>; and he has also given <i>you</i> his Holy Spirit that ye might understand and be enabled to practise these things. It is one thing to <i>receive</i> a <i>revelation</i> from the Spirit of God; it is another thing to <i>receive</i> that <i>Spirit</i> to enable a man to live according to that revelation. In the first sense the apostles alone received this Holy Spirit; in the latter sense all true Christians, as well as the Thessalonians, receive it. I think υμας, <i>you</i>, is the true reading, and that it is confirmed by the following verse: <i>For ye yourselves are</i> TAUGHT OF GOD <i>to love</i> <i>one another</i>. Griesbach has inserted it in the margin, but has not admitted it into the text, because it has not what he deemed full support from those MSS. which are of the <i>Alexandrian recension</i>; but he thought its genuineness very probable.</p>
