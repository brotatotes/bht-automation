<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Who died for us</b></i> — His death was an atoning sacrifice for the Gentiles as well as for the Jews.</p>
<p><i><b>Whether we wake or sleep</b></i> — Whether we <i>live</i> or <i>die</i>, whether we are in this state or in the other world, we shall live together with him-shall enjoy his life, and the consolations of his Spirit, while <i>here</i>; and shall be glorified together with him in the eternal world. The words show that <i>every where</i> and in <i>all</i> <i>circumstances</i> genuine believers, who walk after God, have life and communion with him, and are continually happy, and constantly safe. The apostle, however, may refer to the doctrine he has delivered, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>, concerning the <i>dead in Christ rising first</i>; and the <i>last</i> <i>generation</i> of men not <i>dying</i>, but undergoing such a change as shall render them <i>immortal</i>. On that great day, all the followers of God, both those who had long <i>slept</i> in the dust of the earth, and all those who shall be found <i>living</i>, shall be acknowledged by Christ as his own, and <i>live together</i> for ever <i>with him</i>.</p>
