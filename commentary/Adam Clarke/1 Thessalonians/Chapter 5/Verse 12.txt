<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Know them</b></i> — Act <i>kindly</i> towards them; <i>acknowledge</i> them as the messengers of Christ; and treat them with <i>tenderness</i> and <i>respect</i>. This is a frequent meaning of the word γινωσκω. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:10">John 1:10</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Them which labour among you</b></i> — The words τους κοπιωντας have appeared to some as expressing those who <i>had</i> laboured among them; but as it is the <i>participle</i> of the <i>present</i> tense, there is no need to consider it in this light. Both it and the word προισταμενους, the <i>superintendents</i>, refer to persons then actually employed in the work of God. These were all <i>admonishers, teachers</i>, and <i>instructers</i> of the people, devoting their time and talents to this important work.</p>
