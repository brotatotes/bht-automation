<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Esteem them very highly in love</b></i> — Christian ministers, who preach the <i>whole truth</i>, and <i>labour</i> in the word and doctrine, are entitled to more than <i>respect</i>; the apostle commands them to be esteemed υπερεκπερισσου, <i>abundantly</i>, and <i>superabundantly</i>; and this is to be done <i>in love</i>; and as men delight to serve those whom they love, it necessarily follows that they should provide for them, and see that they want neither the <i>necessaries</i> nor <i>conveniences</i> of life; I do not say <i>comforts</i>, though these also should be furnished; but of these the genuine messengers of Christ are frequently destitute. However, they should have <i>food, raiment</i>, and <i>lodging</i> for themselves and their household. This they ought to have <i>for their work's sake</i>; those who do not <i>work</i> should not <i>eat</i>. As <i>ministers of Christ</i>, such as labour not are unworthy either of respect or support.</p>
