<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Warn them that are unruly</b></i> — The whole phraseology of this verse is <i>military</i>; I shall consider the import of each term. ατακτους. Those who are <i>out of their ranks</i>, and are neither in a <i>disposition</i> nor <i>situation</i> to perform the work and duty of a soldier; those who will not do the work prescribed, and who will meddle with what is not commanded. There are many such in every Church that is of considerable magnitude.</p>
<p><i><b>Comfort the feeble-minded</b></i> — τους ολιγοψυχους. Those of <i>little</i> <i>souls</i>; the <i>faint-hearted</i>; those who, on the eve of a battle, are <i>dispirited</i>, because of the number of the enemy, and their own feeble and unprovided state. Let them know that the battle is not theirs, but the Lord's; and that those who trust in him shall conquer.</p>
<p><i><b>Support the weak</b></i> — αντεχεσθε των ασθενων. <i>Shore up, prop</i> them that are weak; strengthen those wings and companies that are likely to be most exposed, that they be not overpowered and broken in the day of battle.</p>
<p><i><b>Be patient toward all</b></i> — μακροθυμειτε προς παντας. The <i>disorderly</i>, the <i>feeble-minded</i>, and the <i>weak</i>, will exercise your patience, and try your temper. If the troops be irregular, and cannot in every respect be reduced to proper order and discipline, let not the <i>officers</i> lose their temper nor courage; let them do the best they can; God will be with them, and a victory will give confidence to <i>their</i> troops. We have often seen that the Christian life is compared to a warfare, and that the directions given to <i>soldiers</i> are, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>; allowing for the different systems, suitable to Christians. This subject has been largely treated on, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:0">Ephesians 6:0</span>. The ministers of Christ, being considered as <i>officers</i>, should acquaint themselves with the officers' duty. He who has the direction and management of a Church of God will need all the skill and prudence he can acquire.</p>
