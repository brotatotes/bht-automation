<p>Verse 15. <i><b>See that none render evil for evil</b></i> — Every temper contrary to <i>love</i> is contrary to <i>Christianity</i>. A peevish, fretful, vindictive man may be a child of Satan; he certainly is not a child of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Follow that which is good</b></i> — That by which ye may profit your brethren and your neighbours of every description, whether <i>Jews</i> or <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>
