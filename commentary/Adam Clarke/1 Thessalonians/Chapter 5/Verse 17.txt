<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Pray without ceasing.</b></i> â€” Ye are <i>dependent</i> on God for every good; without him ye can do nothing; feel that dependence at all times, and ye will always be in the spirit of prayer; and those who feel this spirit will, as frequently as possible, be found in the exercise of prayer.</p>
