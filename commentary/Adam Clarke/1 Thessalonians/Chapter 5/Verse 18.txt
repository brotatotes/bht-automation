<p>Verse 18. <i><b>In every thing give thanks</b></i> — For this reason, that all things work together for good to them that love God; therefore, every occurrence may be a subject of gratitude and thankfulness. While ye live to God, prosperity and adversity will be equally helpful to you.</p>
<p><i><b>For this is the will of God</b></i> — That ye should be always happy; that ye should ever be in the spirit of prayer; and that ye should profit by every occurrence in life, and be continually grateful and obedient; for <i>gratitude</i> and <i>obedience</i> are inseparably connected.</p>
