<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Quench not the Spirit.</b></i> â€” The Holy Spirit is represented as a <i>fire</i>, because it is his province to <i>enlighten</i> and quicken the soul; and to purge, purify, and refine it. This Spirit is represented as being <i>quenched</i> when any <i>act</i> is done, <i>word</i> spoken, or <i>temper</i> indulged, contrary to its dictates. It is the Spirit of <i>love</i>, and therefore anger, malice, revenge, or any unkind or unholy temper, will quench it so that it will withdraw its influences; and then the heart is left in a state of <i>hardness</i> and <i>darkness</i>. It has been observed that fire may be quenched as well by heaping <i>earth</i> on it as by throwing water on it; and so the <i>love of the world</i> will as effectually grieve and quench the Spirit as any ordinary act of transgression.</p>
<p>Every genuine Christian is made a partaker of the Spirit of God; and he who has not the spirit of Christ is none of his. It cannot be the <i>miraculous gifts</i> of the Spirit which the apostle means, for these were given to <i>few</i>, and not <i>always</i>; for even apostles could not work miracles when they pleased; but the direction in the text is <i>general</i>, and refers to a gift of which they were generally partakers.</p>
