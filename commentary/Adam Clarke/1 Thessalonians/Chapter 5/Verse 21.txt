<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Prove all things</b></i> — Whatever ye hear in these <i>prophesyings</i> or preachings, examine by the words of Christ, and by the doctrines which, from time to time, we have delivered unto you in our preaching and writings. <i>Try the spirits</i>-the different teachers, by the word of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Hold fast that which is good.</b></i> — Whatever in these prophesyings has a tendency to increase your <i>faith, love, holiness</i>, and <i>usefulness</i>, that receive and hold fast. There were <i>prophets</i> or <i>teachers</i> even at that time who professed to be of God, and yet were not.</p>
