<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</b></i> — Sin not, and avoid even the <i>appearance</i> of it. Do not drive your morality so near the bounds of evil as to lead even weak persons to believe that ye actually touch, taste, or handle it. Let not the <i>form</i> of it, ειδος, appear with or among you, much less the <i>substance</i>. Ye are called to holiness; <i>be ye holy, for God is holy</i>.</p>
