<p>Verse 23. <i><b>And the very God of peace</b></i> — That same God who is the author of peace, the giver of peace; and who has sent, for the redemption of the world, the <i>Prince of peace</i>; may that very God <i>sanctify you wholly</i>; leave no more evil <i>in</i> your hearts than his precepts tolerate evil in your conduct. The word <i>wholly</i>, ολετελεις means precisely the same as our phrase, <i>to all intents</i> <i>and purposes</i>. May he sanctify you to the end and to the uttermost, that, <i>as sin hath reigned unto death, even so may grace</i> <i>reign through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our</i> <i>Lord</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Your whole spirit and soul and body</b></i> — Some think that the apostle alludes to the Pythagorean and Platonic doctrine, which was acknowledged among the Thessalonians. I should rather believe that he refers simply to the <i>fact</i>, that the creature called <i>man</i> is a compound being, consisting,</p>
<p>1. Of a <i>body</i>, σωμα, an organized system, formed by the creative energy of God out of the dust of the earth; composed of bones, muscles, and nerves; of arteries, veins, and a variety of other vessels, in which the blood and other fluids circulate.</p>
<p>2. Of a <i>soul</i>, ψυχη, which is the seat of the different <i>affections</i> and <i>passions</i>, such as love, hatred, anger, c., with sensations, appetites, and propensities of different kinds.</p>
<p>3. Of <i>spirit</i>, πνευμα, the immortal principle, the source of life to the body and soul, without which the animal functions cannot be performed, how perfect soever the bodily organs may be and which alone possesses the faculty of intelligence, understanding, thinking, and reasoning, and produces the faculty of speech wherever it resides, if accident have not impaired the organs of speech.</p>
<p>The apostle prays that this compound being, in all its parts, powers, and faculties, which he terms ολοκληρον, <i>their whole</i>, comprehending all parts, every thing that constitutes <i>man</i> and <i>manhood</i>, may be <i>sanctified and preserved blameless till the coming</i> <i>of Christ</i>; hence we learn,</p>
<p>1. That body, soul, and spirit are debased and polluted by sin.</p>
<p>2. That each is capable of being sanctified, consecrated in all its powers to God, and made holy.</p>
<p>3. That the whole man is to be preserved to the coming of Christ, that body, soul, and spirit may be then glorified for ever with him.</p>
<p>4. That in <i>this</i> state the whole man may be so sanctified as to be preserved <i>blameless</i> till the coming of Christ. And thus we learn that the sanctification is not to take place <i>in, at</i>, or <i>after</i> death.
