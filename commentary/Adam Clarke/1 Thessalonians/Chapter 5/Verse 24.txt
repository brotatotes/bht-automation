<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Faithful is he that calleth you</b></i> â€” In a great variety of places in his word God has promised to <i>sanctify</i> his followers, and his faithfulness binds him to fulfil his promises; therefore <i>he will do it</i>. He who can believe will find this thing also possible to him.</p>
