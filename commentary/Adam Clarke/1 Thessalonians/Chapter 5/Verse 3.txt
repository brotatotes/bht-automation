<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:3">1 Thessalonians 5:3</span>. <i><b>For when they shall say, Peace and safety</b></i> — This points out, very particularly, the state of the Jewish people when the Romans came against them; and so fully persuaded were they that God would not deliver the city and temple to their enemies, that they refused every overture that was made to them.</p>
<p><i><b>Sudden destruction</b></i> — In the storming of their city and the burning of their temple, and the massacre of several hundreds of thousands of themselves; the rest being sold for slaves, and the whole of them dispersed over the face of the earth.</p>
<p><i><b>As travail upon a woman</b></i> — This figure is perfectly consistent with what the apostle had said before, viz.: that the <i>times and</i> <i>seasons</i> were not known: though the <i>thing</i> itself was expected, our Lord having predicted it in the most positive manner. So, a woman with child knows that, if she be spared, she will have a bearing time; but the <i>week</i>, the <i>day</i>, the <i>hour</i>, she cannot tell. In a great majority of cases the time is accelerated or retarded much <i>before</i> or <i>beyond</i> the time that the woman expected; so, with respect to the Jews, neither the <i>day, week, month</i>, nor <i>year</i> was known. All that was specifically known was this: their destruction was <i>coming</i>, and it should be <i>sudden</i>, and <i>they should</i> <i>not escape</i>.</p>
