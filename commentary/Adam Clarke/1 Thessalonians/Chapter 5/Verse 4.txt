<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>. <i><b>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness</b></i> â€” Probably St. Paul refers to a notion that was very prevalent among the Jews, viz.: that God would judge the <i>Gentiles</i> in the <i>night time</i>, when utterly secure and careless; but he would judge the <i>Jews</i> in the <i>day time</i>, when employed in reading and performing the words of the law. The words in <i>Midrash Tehillim</i>, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:8">Psalms 9:8</span>, are the following: <i>When the holy blessed God shall judge the Gentiles, it</i> <i>shall be in the night season, in which they shall be asleep in</i> <i>their transgressions; but when he shall judge the Israelites, it</i> <i>shall be in the day time, when they are occupied in the study of</i> <i>the law</i>. This maxim the apostle appears to have in view in the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th verses. (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4-8">1 Thessalonians 5:4-8</span>)</p>
