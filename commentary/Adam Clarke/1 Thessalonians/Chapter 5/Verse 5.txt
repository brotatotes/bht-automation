<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:5">1 Thessalonians 5:5</span>. <i><b>Ye are all the children of light</b></i> — Ye are children of God, and enjoy both his <i>light</i> and <i>life</i>. Ye are <i>Christians</i>-ye belong to him who has brought <i>life</i> and <i>immortality</i> to <i>light</i> by his Gospel. This dispensation, under which ye are, has <i>illustrated</i> all the preceding dispensations; in its <i>light</i> all is become <i>luminous</i>; and ye, who walked formerly in heathen <i>ignorance</i>, or in the <i>darkness</i> of Jewish prejudices, are now <i>light</i> in the Lord, because ye have believed in him who is the <i>light</i> to <i>lighten</i> the <i>Gentiles</i>, and the <i>glory</i> and <i>splendour</i> of his people <i>Israel</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>We are not of the night, nor of darkness.</b></i> — Our actions are such as we are not afraid to expose to the fullest and clearest light. Sinners hate the <i>light</i>; they are enemies to <i>knowledge</i>; they love <i>darkness</i>; they will not receive <i>instructions</i>; and their deeds are such as cannot bear the <i>light</i>.</p>
