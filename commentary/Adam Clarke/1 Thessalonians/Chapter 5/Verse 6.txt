<p>Verse 6. <i><b>Let us not sleep, as</b></i><b> do </b><i><b>others</b></i> — Let <i>us</i> who are of the <i>day</i>-who believe the Gospel and belong to Christ, not give way to a careless, unconcerned state of mind, like to the Gentiles and sinners in general, who are stupified and blinded by sin, so that they neither <i>think</i> nor <i>feel</i>; but live in time as if it were eternity; or rather, live as if there were no eternity, no future state of existence, rewards, or punishments.</p>
<p><i><b>Let us watch</b></i> — Be always on the alert; <i>and be sober</i>, making a <i>moderate</i> use of all things.</p>
