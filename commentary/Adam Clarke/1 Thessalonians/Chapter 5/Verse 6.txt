Verse 6. Let us not sleep, as do others — Let us who are of the day-who believe the Gospel and belong to Christ, not give way to a careless, unconcerned state of mind, like to the Gentiles and sinners in general, who are stupified and blinded by sin, so that they neither think nor feel; but live in time as if it were eternity; or rather, live as if there were no eternity, no future state of existence, rewards, or punishments.Let us watch — Be always on the alert; and be sober, making a moderate use of all things.
