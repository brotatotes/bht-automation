<p>Verse 7. <i><b>For they that sleep</b></i> â€” Sleepers and drunkards seek the night season; so the careless and the profligate persons indulge their evil propensities, and avoid all means of instruction; they prefer their ignorance to the word of God's grace, and to the light of life. There seems to be here an allusion to the opinion mentioned under <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>, to which the reader is requested to refer. It may be remarked, also, that it was accounted doubly scandalous, even among the heathen, to be drunk in the day time. They who were drunken <i>were drunken in the night</i>.</p>
