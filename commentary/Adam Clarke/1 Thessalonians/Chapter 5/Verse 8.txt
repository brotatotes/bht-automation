<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Putting on the breastplate</b></i> â€” We are not only called to WORK, but we are called also to <i>fight</i>; and that we may not be surprised, we must <i>watch</i>; and that we may be in a condition to defend ourselves, we must be sober; and that we may be enabled to conquer, we must be <i>armed</i>: and what the <i>breastplate</i> and <i>helmet</i> are to a <i>soldier's heart</i> and <i>head</i>, such are <i>faith, love</i>, and <i>hope</i> to us. <i>Faith</i> enables us to <i>endure</i>, as seeing him who is invisible; <i>love</i> excites us to <i>diligence</i> and <i>activity</i>, and makes us bear our troubles and difficulties pleasantly; <i>hope</i> helps us to <i>anticipate</i> the great <i>end</i>, the glory that shall be revealed, and which we know we shall in due time obtain, if we faint not. For an explanation of the different parts of the Grecian armour, as illustrating that of the Christian, see the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:0">Ephesians 6:0</span>, where the subject is largely explained.</p>
