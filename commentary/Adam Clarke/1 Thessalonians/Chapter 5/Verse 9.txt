<p>Verse 9. <i><b>For God hath not appointed us to wrath</b></i> — So then it appears that <i>some</i> were <i>appointed to wrath</i>, εις οργην, <i>to</i> <i>punishment</i>; on this subject there can be no dispute. But <i>who</i> are they? <i>When</i> did this appointment take place? And for what <i>cause</i>? These are supposed to be "very difficult questions, and such as cannot receive a satisfactory answer; and the whole must be referred to the <i>sovereignty</i> of God." If we look carefully at the apostle's words, we shall find all these difficulties vanish. It is very obvious that, in the preceding verses, the apostle refers simply to the destruction of the Jewish polity, and to the terrible judgments which were about to fall on the Jews as a <i>nation</i>; therefore, they are the <i>people</i> who were appointed to <i>wrath</i>; and they were thus appointed, not from <i>eternity</i>, nor from any indefinite or remote time, but from that time in which they utterly rejected the offers of salvation made to them by Jesus Christ and his apostles; the privileges of their <i>election</i> were still continued to them, even after they had crucified the Lord of glory; for, when he gave commandment to his disciples <i>to go into</i> <i>all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature</i>, he bade them <i>begin at Jerusalem</i>. They did so, and continued to offer salvation to them, till at last, being everywhere persecuted, and the whole nation appearing with one consent to reject the Gospel, the kingdom of God was wholly taken away from them, and the apostles turned to the <i>Gentiles. Then</i> God appointed them to wrath; and the <i>cause</i> of that appointment was their final and determined rejection of Christ and his Gospel. But even this <i>appointment to wrath</i> does not signify <i>eternal damnation</i>; nothing of the kind is intended in the word. Though we are sure that those who die in their sins can never see God, yet it is possible that many of those wretched Jews, during their calamities, and especially during the siege of their city, did turn unto the Lord who smote them, and found that <i>salvation</i> which he never denies to the sincere penitent.</p>
<p>When the Jews were <i>rejected</i>, and <i>appointed to wrath</i>, then the <i>Gentiles</i> were <i>elected</i>, and appointed to <i>obtain salvation</i> by our Lord Jesus Christ, whose Gospel they gladly received, and continue to prize; while the remnant of the Jews continue, in all places of their dispersion, the same irreconcilable and blasphemous opponents of the Gospel of Christ. On <i>these accounts</i> the <i>election</i> of the <i>Gentiles</i> and the <i>reprobation</i> of the <i>Jews</i> still continue.</p>
