<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:1">1 Timothy 1:1</span>. <i><b>Paul an apostle - by the commandment of God</b></i> — We have already seen that the term αποστολος, <i>apostle</i>, literally signifies a <i>person sent</i> from one to another, without implying any particular <i>dignity</i> in the person, or <i>importance</i> in the message. But it is differently used in the New Testament, being applied to those who were <i>sent expressly from God Almighty</i>, with the message of salvation to mankind. It is, therefore, the highest character any human being can have; and he message is the most important which even God himself can send to his intelligent creatures. It was by the express command of God that St. Paul went to the Gentiles preaching the doctrine of salvation by faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>Jesus Christ-our hope</b></i> — Without Jesus, the world was <i>hopeless</i>; the <i>expectation</i> of being saved can only come to mankind by his Gospel. He is called our <i>hope</i>, as he is called our <i>life</i>, our <i>peace</i>, our <i>righteousness</i>, &amp;c., because from him hope, life, peace, righteousness, and all other blessings proceed.</p>
