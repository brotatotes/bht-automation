<p>Verse 10. <i><b>For whoremongers</b></i> — πορνοις. Adulterers, fornicators, and prostitutes of all sorts.</p>
<p><i><b>Them that defile themselves with mankind</b></i> — αρσενοκοιταις. From αρσην, a <i>male</i>, and κοιτη, a <i>bed</i>; a word too bad to be explained. A <i>sodomite</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Men-stealers</b></i> — ανδραποδισταις. <i>Slave-dealers</i>; whether those who <i>carry on the traffic in human flesh and blood</i>; or those who <i>steal</i> a person in order to sell him into bondage; or those who <i>buy</i> such stolen men or women, no matter of what <i>colour</i> or what <i>country</i>; or those who <i>sow dissensions</i> among barbarous tribes in order that they who are taken in war may be sold into slavery; or the <i>nations</i> who <i>legalize</i> or <i>connive</i> at such traffic: all these are <i>men-stealers</i>, and God classes them with the most flagitious of mortals.</p>
<p><i><b>For liars</b></i> — ψευσταις. They who speak for <i>truth</i> what they know to be <i>false</i>; and even they who tell <i>the truth</i> in such a way as to lead others to draw a contrary meaning from it.</p>
<p><i><b>For perjured persons</b></i> — επιορκοις. From επι, <i>against</i>, and ορκος, <i>an oath</i>; such as <i>do</i> or leave <i>undone</i> any thing <i>contrary</i> to an oath or moral engagement, whether that engagement be made by what is called <i>swearing</i>, or by an <i>affirmation</i> or <i>promise</i> of any kind.</p>
<p><i><b>And if there be any other thing</b></i> — Every species of vice and immorality, all must be necessarily included, that is contrary to <i>sound doctrine</i>-to the immutable moral law of God, as well as to the pure precepts of Christianity where that law is incorporated, explained, and rendered, if possible, more and more binding.</p>
