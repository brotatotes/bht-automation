Verse 10. For whoremongers — πορνοις. Adulterers, fornicators, and prostitutes of all sorts.Them that defile themselves with mankind — αρσενοκοιταις. From αρσην, a male, and κοιτη, a bed; a word too bad to be explained. A sodomite.Men-stealers — ανδραποδισταις. Slave-dealers; whether those who carry on the traffic in human flesh and blood; or those who steal a person in order to sell him into bondage; or those who buy such stolen men or women, no matter of what colour or what country; or those who sow dissensions among barbarous tribes in order that they who are taken in war may be sold into slavery; or the nations who legalize or connive at such traffic: all these are men-stealers, and God classes them with the most flagitious of mortals.For liars — ψευσταις. They who speak for truth what they know to be false; and even they who tell the truth in such a way as to lead others to draw a contrary meaning from it.For perjured persons — επιορκοις. From επι, against, and ορκος, an oath; such as do or leave undone any thing contrary to an oath or moral engagement, whether that engagement be made by what is called swearing, or by an affirmation or promise of any kind.And if there be any other thing — Every species of vice and immorality, all must be necessarily included, that is contrary to sound doctrine-to the immutable moral law of God, as well as to the pure precepts of Christianity where that law is incorporated, explained, and rendered, if possible, more and more binding.
