Verse 11. According to the glorious Gospel — The sound doctrine mentioned above, which is here called ευαγγελιον της δοξης του μακαριου θεου, the Gospel of the glory of the blessed or happy God-a dispensation which exhibits the glory of all his attributes; and, by saving man in such a way as is consistent with the glory of all the Divine perfections, while it brings peace and good will among men, brings glory to God in the highest. Sin has dishonoured God, and robbed him of his glory; the Gospel provides for the total destruction of sin, even in this world, and thus brings back to God his glory.
