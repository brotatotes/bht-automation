<p>Verse 11. <i><b>According to the glorious Gospel</b></i> — The <i>sound</i> <i>doctrine</i> mentioned above, which is here called ευαγγελιον της δοξης του μακαριου θεου, <i>the Gospel of the glory of the blessed</i> or <i>happy God</i>-a dispensation which exhibits the <i>glory</i> of all his <i>attributes</i>; and, by saving man in such a way as is consistent with the <i>glory</i> of all the Divine perfections, while it brings peace and good will among men, brings <i>glory</i> to God in the highest. Sin has dishonoured God, and robbed him of his <i>glory</i>; the Gospel provides for the total destruction of sin, even in this world, and thus brings back to God his glory.</p>
