<p>Verse 12. <i><b>I thank Christ</b></i> — I feel myself under infinite obligation to Christ who hath <i>strengthened me</i>, ενδυναμωσαντι, who hath <i>endued me with various miraculous gifts</i> of his Holy Spirit, and put me into the <i>ministry</i>, διακονιαν, the <i>deaconship</i>, the <i>service of mankind</i>, by preaching the Gospel, for that he <i>counted</i> <i>me</i>-he knew that I would be, <i>faithful</i> to the charge that was delivered to me.</p>
