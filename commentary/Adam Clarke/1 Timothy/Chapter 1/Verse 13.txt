<p>Verse 13. <i><b>A blasphemer</b></i> — Speaking impiously and unjustly of Jesus, his doctrine, his ways, and his followers.</p>
<p><i><b>And-persecutor</b></i> — Endeavouring, to the uttermost of his power, to <i>exterminate</i> all who called on the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><i><b>And injurious</b></i> — και υβριστην. As full of insolence as I was of malevolence; and yet, all the while, thinking I did God service, while sacrificing men and women to my own prejudices and intolerance.</p>
<p><i><b>I did it ignorantly in unbelief</b></i> — Not having <i>considered</i> the nature and evidences of Christianity, and not having <i>believed</i> that Jesus was the promised <i>Messiah</i>, I acted wholly under the prejudices that influenced my countrymen in general. God therefore showed me mercy, because I acted under this influence, not knowing better. This extension of mercy, does not, however, excuse the infuriated conduct of Saul of Tarsus, for he says himself that he was <i>exceedingly mad against them</i>. Let us beware, lest we lose the man's former crimes in his after character.</p>
