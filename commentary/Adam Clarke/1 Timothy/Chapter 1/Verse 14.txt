<p>Verse 14. <i><b>The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant</b></i> — The original is very emphatic, <i>that grace of our Lord</i>, υπερεπλεονασε, <i>hath superabounded </i>- it manifested itself in a way of <i>extraordinary</i> mercy.</p>
<p><i><b>With faith and love</b></i> — Not only pardoning such offences, but leading me to the full experimental knowledge of Christianity; of that <i>faith</i> and <i>love</i> which are essential to it; and giving me authority to proclaim it to mankind.</p>
