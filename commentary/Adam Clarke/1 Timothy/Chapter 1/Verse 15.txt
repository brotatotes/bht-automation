<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners</b></i> — This is one of the most glorious truths in the book of God; the most important that ever reached the human ear, or can be entertained by the heart of man. <i>All men</i> are sinners; and as such condemned, justly condemned, to eternal death. Christ Jesus became incarnate, suffered, and died to redeem them; and, by his grace and Spirit, <i>saves</i> them from their sins. This <i>saying</i> or <i>doctrine</i> he calls, <i>first</i>, a <i>faithful</i> or <i>true</i> saying; πιστοςολογος, it is a doctrine that may be <i>credited</i>, without the slightest doubt or hesitation; God himself has spoken it; and the death of Christ and the mission of the Holy Ghost, sealing pardon on the souls of all who believe, have confirmed and established the truth.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, it is <i>worthy of all acceptation</i>; as <i>all</i> need it, it is worthy of being received by <i>all</i>. It is designed for the whole human race, for all that are <i>sinners</i> is applicable to <i>all</i>, because all are <i>sinners</i>; and may be received by <i>all</i>, being put within every man's reach, and brought to every man's ear and bosom, either by the letter of the word, or, where that revelation is not yet come, by the power of the Divine Spirit, the true light from Christ that lightens every man that cometh into the world. From this also it is evident that the death of Christ, and all its eternally saving effects, were designed for <i>every man</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Of whom I am chief</b></i> — ων πρωτος ειμι εγω. Confounding <i>Paul</i> the <i>apostle</i>, in the fulness of his faith and love, with <i>Saul</i> of <i>Tarsus</i>, in his ignorance, unbelief, and persecuting rage, we are in the habit of saying: "This is a <i>hyperbolical</i> expression, arguing the height of the apostle's modesty and humility and must not be taken according to the letter." I see it not in this light; I take it not with abatement; it is strictly and literally true: take the whole of the apostle's conduct, previously to his conversion, into consideration, and was there a greater sinner converted to God from the incarnation to his own time? Not one; he was the <i>chief</i>; and, keeping his <i>blasphemy, persecution</i>, and <i>contumely</i> in view, he asserts: Of all that the Lord Jesus came into the world to save, and of all that he <i>had saved</i> to that time, <i>I am chief</i>. And who, however humble now, and however flagitious before, could have contested the points with him? He <i>was what</i> he has said, and <i>as</i> he has said it. And it is very probable that the apostle refers to those in whom the grace and mercy of God were, at the <i>first</i> promulgation of the Gospel, manifested: and comparing himself with all these he could with propriety say, ων πρωτος ειμι, <i>of whom I am the first</i>; the <i>first</i> who, from a blasphemer, persecutor (and might we not add <i>murderer</i>? see the part he took in the martyrdom of Stephen,) became a preacher of that Gospel which I had persecuted. And hence, keeping this idea strictly in view, he immediately adds: <i>Howbeit, for this cause I obtained mercy; that in me</i> FIRST, πρωτω, <i>Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a</i> <i>pattern</i> TO THEM <i>which should</i> HEREAFTER, των μελλοντων <i>believe</i> <i>on him to life everlasting</i>. And this great display of the pardoning mercy of God, granted in so singular a manner, at the very <i>first</i> promulgation of the Gospel, was most proper to be produced as a <i>pattern</i> for the encouragement of all penitent sinners to the end of time. If Jesus Christ, with whom there can be no <i>respect of persons</i>, saved Saul of Tarsus, no sinner need despair.</p>
