<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Now unto the King eternal</b></i> — This burst of thanksgiving and gratitude to God, naturally arose from the subject then under his pen and eye. God has most wondrously manifested his mercy, in this <i>beginning</i> of the Gospel, by saving me, and making me a <i>pattern</i> to all them that shall <i>hereafter</i> <i>believe on Christ</i>. He is βασιλευς των αιωνων, <i>the king of</i> <i>eternities</i>; the eternity <i>a parte ante</i>, and the eternity <i>a parte</i> <i>post</i>; the eternity that <i>was</i> before <i>time</i> was, and the <i>eternity</i> that <i>shall</i> be when <i>time</i> is <i>no more</i>. Therefore, <i>ever living</i> to justify and save sinners, to the end of the world.</p>
<p><i><b>Immortal</b></i> — αφθαρτω. <i>Incorruptible</i>-not liable to decay or corruption; a simple uncompounded essence, incapable, therefore, of decomposition, and consequently permanent and eternal. One MS., the later <i>Syriac</i> in the margin, the <i>Vulgate</i>, one copy of the <i>Itala</i>, and some of the <i>Latin fathers</i>, read αθανατω, <i>immortal,</i> which our translation follows; but it is not the original reading.</p>
<p><i><b>Invisible</b></i> — αορατω. One who fills all things, works everywhere, and yet is <i>invisible</i> to angels and men; the perfect reverse of false gods and idols, who are <i>confined to one spot</i>, <i>work nowhere</i>, and, being stocks and stones, <i>are seen</i> by every body.</p>
<p><i><b>The only wise God</b></i> — The word σοφω <i>wise</i>, is omitted by AD*FG, <i>Syriac, Erpen's Arabic, Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Armenian</i>, <i>Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>. Some of the Greek fathers quote it sometimes, and omit it at others; which shows that it was an unsettled reading, probably borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>. See the note there. <i>Griesbach</i> leaves it out of the text. Without it the reading is very strong and appropriate: <i>To the only God</i>; nothing visible or invisible being worthy of adoration but himself.</p>
<p><i><b>Be honour</b></i> — All the <i>respect</i> and <i>reverence</i> that can be paid by intelligent beings, ascribing to him at the same time all the <i>glory</i>-excellences, and perfections, which can be possessed by an intelligent, unoriginated, independent, and eternal Being; and this for ever and ever-through <i>eternity</i>.</p>
