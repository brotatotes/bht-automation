<p>Verse 18. <i><b>This charge</b></i> — See the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>. It was a <i>charge</i> that the Judaizing teachers should not teach differently from that doctrine which the apostle had delivered to him. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>According to the prophecies</b></i> — This may refer to some predictions by inspired men, relative to what Timothy should be: and he wishes him to act in all things conformably to those predictions. It was predicted that he should have this high and noble calling; but his behaviour in that calling was a matter of <i>contingency</i>, as it respected the use he might make of the grace of his calling. The apostle therefore exhorts him to <i>war a good</i> <i>warfare, c</i>. He was now called to that estate to which the prophecies referred and now he is to act <i>worthily</i> or <i>unworthily</i> of that calling, according as he <i>fought</i> or <i>did not fight</i> the good warfare, and according as he <i>held</i> or <i>did not hold</i> faith and a good conscience.</p>
<p>Some think that the προαγουσας προφητειας, <i>the foregoing</i> <i>prophecies</i>, refer to <i>revelations</i> which the apostle himself had received concerning Timothy; while others think that the word is to be understood of <i>advices, directions</i>, and <i>exhortations</i>, which the apostle had previously delivered to him; we know that προφητευω signifies to <i>speak to men to edification, to</i> <i>exhortation</i>, and <i>to comfort</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>. This is a very sober and good sense of the passage.</p>
<p><i><b>War a good warfare</b></i> — The trials and afflictions of the followers of God are often represented as a <i>warfare</i> or <i>campaign</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:2">Isaiah 40:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>; and see the reasons of this metaphorical form of speech, in <i>Clarke's notes on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span><i>"</i>.</p>
