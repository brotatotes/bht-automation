<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Holding faith</b></i> — All the <i>truths</i> of the <i>Christian</i> <i>religion</i>, firmly believing them, and fervently proclaiming them to others.</p>
<p><i><b>And a good conscience</b></i> — So holding the <i>truth</i> as to <i>live</i> according to its dictates, that a <i>good conscience</i> may be ever preserved. As the apostle had just spoken of the Christian's <i>warfare</i>, so he here refers to the Christian <i>armour</i>, especially to the <i>shield</i> and <i>breastplate</i>; the <i>shield of faith</i>, and the <i>breastplate</i> of <i>righteousness</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>, c., and <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which some having put away</b></i> — απωσαμενοι. Having <i>thrust away</i> as a fool-hardy soldier might his <i>shield</i> and his <i>breastplate</i>, or a mad sailor his pilot, helm, and compass.</p>
<p><i><b>Concerning faith</b></i> — The great <i>truths</i> of the Christian religion.</p>
<p><i><b>Have made shipwreck</b></i> — Being without <i>the faith</i>, that only infallible system of truth; <i>and a good conscience</i>, that skilful <i>pilot</i>, that steady and commanding helm, that faithful and invariable loadstone; <i>have been driven to and fro by every wind</i> <i>of doctrine</i>, and, getting among <i>shoals, quicksands</i>, and <i>rocks</i>, have been shipwrecked and ingulfed.</p>
