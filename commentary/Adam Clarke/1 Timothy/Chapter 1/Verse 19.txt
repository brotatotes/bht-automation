Verse 19. Holding faith — All the truths of the Christian religion, firmly believing them, and fervently proclaiming them to others.And a good conscience — So holding the truth as to live according to its dictates, that a good conscience may be ever preserved. As the apostle had just spoken of the Christian's warfare, so he here refers to the Christian armour, especially to the shield and breastplate; the shield of faith, and the breastplate of righteousness. Ephesians 6:13, c., and "1 Thessalonians 5:8".Which some having put away — απωσαμενοι. Having thrust away as a fool-hardy soldier might his shield and his breastplate, or a mad sailor his pilot, helm, and compass.Concerning faith — The great truths of the Christian religion.Have made shipwreck — Being without the faith, that only infallible system of truth; and a good conscience, that skilful pilot, that steady and commanding helm, that faithful and invariable loadstone; have been driven to and fro by every wind of doctrine, and, getting among shoals, quicksands, and rocks, have been shipwrecked and ingulfed.
