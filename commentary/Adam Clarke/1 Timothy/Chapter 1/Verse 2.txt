<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>. <i><b>My own son in the faith</b></i> — Brought to salvation through Christ by my ministry alone. Probably the apostle speaks here according to this Jewish maxim: כל המלמר בן תכירו תורה מעלה עליו הכתוב כאלו ילרו <i>He who teaches the law to his neighbour's son</i> <i>is considered by the Scripture as if he had begotten him</i>; Sanhedrin, fol. xix. 2. And they quote <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:1">Numbers 3:1</span>, as proving it: <i>These are the generations of Aaron and Moses-and these are the</i> <i>names of the sons of Aaron</i>. "Aaron," say they, "<i>begot</i> them, but Moses <i>instructed</i> them; therefore they are called by his name." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>But γνησιω τεκνω may mean my beloved son; for in this sense το γνησιον is not unfrequently used.</p>
<p><i><b>In the faith</b></i> — The word πιστις, <i>faith</i>, is taken here for the whole of the Christian religion, <i>faith in Christ</i> being its essential characteristic.</p>
<p><i><b>Grace, mercy</b></i>, and <i>peace</i>] GRACE, the favour and approbation of God. MERCY, springing from that grace, pardoning, purifying, and supporting. PEACE, the consequence of this manifested mercy, peace of conscience, and peace with God; producing internal happiness, quietness, and assurance.</p>
