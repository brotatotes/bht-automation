<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>. <i><b>Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander</b></i> — Who <i>had</i> the <i>faith</i> but <i>thrust it away</i>; who <i>had a good conscience</i> through believing, but made <i>shipwreck</i> of it. Hence we find that all this was not only <i>possible</i>, but did <i>actually</i> take place, though some have endeavoured to maintain the contrary; who, confounding eternity with a state of probation, have supposed that if a man once enter into the grace of God in this life, he must necessarily continue in it to all eternity. Thousands of texts and thousands of facts refute this doctrine.</p>
<p><i><b>Delivered unto Satan</b></i> — For the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. See what is noted on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>; what this sort of punishment was no man now living knows. There is nothing of the kind referred to in the Jewish writings. It seems to have been something done by mere apostolical authority, under the direction of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p><i>Hymeneus</i>, it <i>appears</i>, denied the resurrection, see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:17-18">2 Timothy 2:17-18</span>; but whether this <i>Alexander</i> be the same with <i>Alexander the coppersmith</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:14">2 Timothy 4:14</span>, or the Alexander, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:33">Acts 19:33</span>, cannot be determined. Probably, he was the same with the <i>coppersmith</i>. Whether they were brought back to the acknowledgment of the truth does not appear. From what is said in the second epistle the case seems extremely doubtful. Let him who most assuredly standeth, take heed lest he fall.</p>
<p>He that is <i>self-confident</i> is already half fallen. He who professes to believe that God will <i>absolutely</i> keep him from falling finally, and neglects watching unto prayer, is not in a safer state. He who lives by the moment, walks in the light, and maintains his communion with God, is in no danger of apostasy.</p>
