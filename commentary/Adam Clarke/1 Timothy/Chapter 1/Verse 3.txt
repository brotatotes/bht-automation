<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>. <i><b>I besought thee</b></i> — The apostle had seen that a bad seed had been sown in the Church; and, as he was obliged to go then into Macedonia, he wished Timothy, on whose prudence, piety, and soundness in the faith he could depend, to stay behind and prevent the spreading of a doctrine that would have been pernicious to the people's souls. I have already supposed that this epistle was written <i>after</i> Paul had been delivered from his first imprisonment at Rome, about the end of the year 64, or the beginning of 65. See the <i>preface</i>. When, therefore, the apostle came from Rome into Asia, he no doubt visited Ephesus, where, ten years before, he had planted a Christian Church, and, as he had not time to tarry then, he left Timothy to correct abuses.</p>
<p><i><b>That thou mightest charge some</b></i> — He does not name any persons; the <i>Judaizing teachers</i> are generally supposed to be those intended; and the term τισι, <i>some, certain persons</i>, which he uses, is expressive of high disapprobation, and at the same time of delicacy: they were not <i>apostles</i>, nor <i>apostolic men</i>; but they were undoubtedly <i>members</i> of the Church at Ephesus, and might yet be reclaimed.</p>
