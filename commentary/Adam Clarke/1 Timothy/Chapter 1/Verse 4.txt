<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span>. <i><b>Neither give heed to fables</b></i> — Idle fancies; things of no moment; doctrines and opinions unauthenticated; silly legends, of which no people ever possessed a greater stock than the Jews. Their <i>Talmud</i> abounds with them; and the English reader may find them in abundance in <i>Stehlin's</i> Jewish Traditions, 2 vols. 8vo.</p>
<p><i><b>Endless genealogies</b></i> — I suppose the apostle to mean those genealogies which were <i>uncertain</i>-that never could be <i>made out</i>, either in the <i>ascending</i> or <i>descending</i> line; and, principally, such as referred to the great promise of the <i>Messiah</i>, and to the <i>priesthood</i>. The Jews had scrupulously preserved their genealogical tables till the advent of Christ and the evangelists had recourse to them, and appealed to them in reference to our Lord's descent from the house of David; Matthew taking this genealogy in the <i>descending</i>, Luke in the <i>ascending</i>, line. And whatever difficulties we may now find in these genealogies, they were certainly clear to the Jews; nor did the most determined enemies of the Gospel attempt to raise one objection to it from the appeal which the evangelists had made to their own public and accredited tables. All was then <i>certain</i>; but we are told that Herod destroyed the public registers; he, being an Idumean, was jealous of the noble origin of the Jews; and, that none might be able to reproach him with his descent, be ordered the genealogical tables, which were kept among the archives in the temple, to be burnt. See <i>Euseb</i>. H. E., lib. i. cap. 8. From this time the Jews could refer to their genealogies only from <i>memory</i>, or from those imperfect tables which had been preserved in private hands; and to make out any regular <i>line</i> from these must have been <i>endless</i> and uncertain. It is probably to this that the apostle refers; I mean the endless and useless labour which the attempts to make out these genealogies must produce, the authentic tables being destroyed. This, were all other proofs wanting, would be an irresistible argument against the Jews that the Messiah is come; for their own prophets had distinctly marked out the line by which he was to come; the genealogies are now all lost; nor is there a Jew in the universe that can show from what tribe he is descended. There can, therefore, be no Messiah to come, as none could show, let him have what other pretensions he might, that he sprang from the house of David. The Jews do not, at present, pretend to have any such tables; and, far from being able to prove the Messiah from his descent, they are now obliged to say that, when, the Messiah comes, he will restore the genealogies by the Holy Spirit that shall rest upon him. "For," says <i>Maimonides</i>, "in the days of the Messiah, when his kingdom shall be established, all the Israelites shall be gathered together unto him; and all shall be classed in their genealogies by his mouth, through the Holy Spirit that shall rest upon him; as it is written, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:3">Malachi 3:3</span>: <i>He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall</i> <i>purify the sons of Levi</i>. First he will purify the <i>Levites</i>, and shall say: 'This man is a descendant from the <i>priests</i>; and this, of the stock of the <i>Levites</i>;' and he shall cast out those who are not of the stock of Israel; for behold it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ezr+2:63">Ezra 2:63</span>: <i>And the Tirshatha said-they should not eat of the most holy</i> <i>things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim</i>. Thus, by the Holy Spirit, the genealogies are to be revised." See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
<p>Some learned men suppose that the apostle alludes here to the <i>AEons</i>, among the <i>Gnostics</i> and <i>Valentinians</i>, or whom there were endless numbers to make up what was called their <i>pleroma</i>; or to the <i>sephiroth</i>, or splendours of the <i>Cabalists</i>. But it is certain that these heresies had not arrived to any formidable head in the apostle's time; and it has long been a doubt with me whether they even existed at that time: and I think it the most simple way, and most likely to be the intention of the apostle, to refer all to the Jewish genealogies, which he calls <i>Jewish fables</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:14">Titus 1:14</span>, to which we know they were strongly and even conscientiously attached and which, at this time, it must have been extremely difficult to make out.</p>
<p>Instead of γενεαλογιαις, <i>genealogies</i>, some learned men have conjectured that the original word was κεςολογιαις, <i>empty words</i>, <i>vain speeches</i>; but this conjecture is not supported by any MS. or <i>version</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which minister questions</b></i> — They are the foundation of endless altercations and disputes; for, being <i>uncertain</i> and not <i>consecutive</i>, every person had a right to call them in question; as we may naturally suppose, from the state in which the genealogical tables of the Jews then were, that many <i>chasms</i> must be supplied in different <i>lines</i>, and consequently much must be done by <i>conjecture</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Rather than godly edifying</b></i> — Such discussions as these had no tendency to promote <i>piety</i>. Many, no doubt, employed much of that time in inquiring <i>who</i> were their <i>ancestors</i>, which they should have spent in obtaining that grace by which, being <i>born from</i> <i>above</i>, they might have become the <i>sons and daughters of God</i> <i>Almighty</i>.</p>
<p>Instead of οικοδομιαν θεου, <i>godly edifying</i>, or <i>the</i> <i>edification of God</i>, οικονομιαν θεου, the economy or dispensation of God, is the reading of almost every MS. in which this part of the epistle is extant, (for some MSS. are here mutilated,) and of almost all the <i>versions</i>, and the chief of the Greek <i>fathers</i>. Of the genuineness of this reading scarcely a doubt can be formed; and though the old reading, which is supported by the <i>Latin</i> fathers and the <i>Vulgate</i>, gives a good sense, yet the connection and spirit of the place show that the latter must be the true reading. <i>Griesbach</i> has received this reading into the text.</p>
<p>What had Jewish <i>genealogies</i> to do with the Gospel? Men were not to be saved by virtue of the <i>privileges</i> or <i>piety</i> of their ancestors. The Jews depended much on this. <i>We have Abraham to</i> <i>our father</i> imposed silence on every check of conscience, and every godly reproof which they received for their profligacy and unbelief. In the <i>dispensation of God</i>, FAITH in Christ Jesus was the only means and way of salvation. These <i>endless</i> and <i>uncertain</i> <i>genealogies</i> produced no faith; indeed they were intended as a <i>substitute</i> for it; for those who were intent on making out their <i>genealogical descent</i> paid little attention to <i>faith in Christ</i>. They <i>ministered questions rather than that economy of God which is</i> <i>by faith</i>. This <i>dispensation</i>, says the apostle, <i>is by faith</i>, οικονομιαν θεου την εν πιστει. It was not by <i>natural descent</i>, nor by <i>works</i>, but by <i>faith</i> in Christ; therefore it was necessary that the people who were seeking salvation in any other way should be strictly informed that all their toil and labour would be vain.</p>
