<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>. <i><b>Now the end of the commandment is charity</b></i> — These genealogical questions lead to <i>strife</i> and <i>debate</i>; and the <i>dispensation of God</i> leads to <i>love</i> both to God and man, through faith in Christ. These genealogical questions leave the <i>heart</i> under the influence of all its <i>vile tempers</i> and <i>evil propensities</i>; FAITH in Jesus <i>purifies</i> the heart. No inquiry of this kind can add to any thing by which the <i>guilt</i> of <i>sin</i> can be taken away; but the Gospel proclaims <i>pardon</i>, through the blood of the Lamb, to every believing penitent. The <i>end</i>, aim, and design of God in giving this dispensation to the world is, that men may have an <i>unfeigned</i> <i>faith</i>, such as lays hold on Christ crucified, and produces a <i>good</i> <i>conscience</i> from a sense of the pardon received, and leads on to <i>purity of heart</i>; LOVE to God and man being the grand issue of the grace of Christ here below, and this fully preparing the soul for eternal glory. He whose soul is filled with love to God and man has a <i>pure heart</i>, a <i>good conscience</i>, and <i>unfeigned faith</i>. But these blessings no soul can ever acquire, but according to <i>God's</i> <i>dispensation of faith</i>.</p>
<p>The paraphrase and note of Dr. <i>Macknight</i> on this verse are very proper: "<i>Now the scope of the charge</i> to be given by thee to these teachers <i>is</i>, that, instead of inculcating fables and genealogies, they inculcate <i>love</i> to God and man, proceeding from a <i>pure heart</i>, and directed by a <i>good conscience</i>, and nourished by <i>unfeigned</i> <i>faith</i> in the Gospel doctrine. The word παραγγελια denotes a <i>message</i> or <i>order</i>, brought to one from another, and delivered by word of mouth. The <i>charge</i> here meant is that which the apostle ordered Timothy to deliver to the teachers in Ephesus; for he had said, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>: I had besought thee <i>to abide still at Ephesus</i>, ινα παραγγειλνς, <i>that thou mightest charge some</i>: here he tells him what the scope of this charge was to be."</p>
<p><i><b>Of faith unfeigned</b></i> — πιστεως ανυποκριτου. A <i>faith not</i> <i>hypocritical</i>. The apostle appears to allude to the Judaizing teachers, who <i>pretended faith</i> in the Gospel, merely that they might have the greater opportunity to bring back to the Mosaic system those who had embraced the doctrine of Christ crucified. This IS evident from the following verse.</p>
