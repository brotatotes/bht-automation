<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:6">1 Timothy 1:6</span>. <i><b>From which some having swerved</b></i> — <i>From which some</i>, though they have pretended to <i>aim</i> at the τελος, <i>scope</i>, or <i>mark</i>, have <i>missed that mark</i>. This is the import of the original word αστοχησαντες.</p>
<p><i><b>Turned aside unto vain jangling</b></i> — The original term, ματαιολογιαν, signifies <i>empty</i> or <i>vain talking</i>; discourses that turn to no profit; a great many words and little sense; and that sense not worth the pains of hearing. Such, indeed, is all preaching where Jesus Christ is not held forth.</p>
