<p>Verse 7. <i><b>Teachers of the law</b></i> — To be esteemed or celebrated as <i>rabbins</i>; to be reputed cunning in solving knotty questions and enigmas, which answered no end to true religion. Of such the rabbinical teaching was full.</p>
<p><i><b>Understanding neither what they say</b></i> — This is evident from almost all the Jewish comments which yet remain. Things are <i>asserted</i> which are either <i>false</i> or <i>dubious</i>; words, the import of which they did not understand, were brought to illustrate them: so that it may be said, <i>They understand not what they say, nor</i> <i>whereof they affirm</i>. I will give one instance from the <i>Jerusalem</i> <i>Targum</i>, on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:15">Genesis 1:15</span>: <i>And God made two great lights, and they were equal in splendour</i> <i>twenty-one years, the six hundred and seventy-second part of an</i> <i>hour excepted: and afterwards the moon brought a false accusation</i> <i>against the sun, and therefore she was lessened; and God made the</i> <i>sun the greater light to superintend the day, &amp;c</i>. I could produce a thousand of a similar complexion.</p>
