<p>Verse 9. <i><b>The law is not made for a righteous man</b></i> — There is a <i>moral law</i> as well as a <i>ceremonial law</i>: as the object of the <i>latter</i> is to <i>lead us to Christ</i>; the object of the <i>former</i> is to <i>restrain crimes</i>, and inflict punishment on those that commit them. It was, therefore, not made for the <i>righteous</i> as a restrainer of crimes, and an inflicter of punishments; for the righteous avoid sin, and by living to the glory of God expose not themselves to its censures. This seems to be the mind of the apostle; he does not say <i>that the law was not</i> MADE <i>for a</i> <i>righteous man</i>, but ουκειται, <i>it does not</i> LIE <i>against a</i> <i>righteous man</i>; because <i>he</i> does not transgress it: but it <i>lies</i> <i>against the wicked</i>; for such as the apostle mentions have broken it, and grievously too, and are condemned by it. The word κειται, <i>lies</i>, refers to the custom of writing laws on boards, and hanging them up in public places within reach of every man, that they might be read by all; thus all would see against whom the law <i>lay</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The lawless</b></i> — ανομοις. Those who will not be <i>bound by a law</i>, and acknowledge none, therefore have no rule of moral conduct.</p>
<p><i><b>Disobedient</b></i> — ανυποτακτοις. Those who acknowledge no <i>authority</i>; from α, <i>negative</i>, and οποτασσω, <i>to subject</i>; they neither acknowledge <i>law</i>, nor <i>executive authority</i>, and consequently endeavour to live as they list; and from such dispositions all the crimes in the following catalogue may naturally spring.</p>
<p><i><b>For the ungodly</b></i> — ασεβεσι. The <i>irreligious</i>-those who do <i>not worship God</i>, or have no <i>true worship</i>; from α, <i>negative</i>, and σεβω, to <i>worship</i>. <i>For sinners</i>, αμαπτωλοις those who <i>transgress</i> the laws; from α, <i>negative</i>, and μαρπτω, <i>to hit</i> <i>the mark</i>. This has been elsewhere explained.</p>
<p><i><b>For unholy</b></i> — ανοσιοις. Persons <i>totally polluted</i>-unclean <i>within</i>, and unclean <i>without</i>; from α, <i>negative</i>, and οσιος <i>holy</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And profane</b></i> — βεβηλοις. Such who are so unholy and abominable as not to be fit to attend any public worship; from βε, denoting <i>privation</i> or <i>separation</i>, and βηλος, <i>a</i> <i>threshold</i> or <i>pavement</i>, particularly of a temple. Our word <i>profane</i> comes from <i>procul a fano</i>, "far from the temple." When the ancients, even heathens, were about to perform some very sacred rites, they were accustomed to command the irreligious to keep at a distance; hence that saying in a fragment of <i>Orpheus</i>:- </p>
<p><i><b>Manslayers</b></i> — ανδροφονοις. <i>Murderers</i> simply; all who take away the life of a human being contrary to law. For no <i>crime</i>, unless it be <i>murder</i>, should any man lose his life. If the law did not speak differently, I should not scruple to say that he whose life is taken away, except for murder, is murdered.</p>
