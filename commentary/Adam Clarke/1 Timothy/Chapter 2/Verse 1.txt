<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1">1 Timothy 2:1</span>. <i><b>I exhort - that, first of all</b></i> — <i>Prayer</i> for the pardon of sin, and for obtaining necessary supplies of grace, and continual protection from God, with gratitude and thanksgiving for mercies already received, are duties which our sinful and dependent state renders absolutely necessary; and which should be chief in our view, and <i>first of all</i> performed. It is difficult to know the precise difference between the four words used here by the apostle. They are sometimes distinguished thus: - </p>
<p><i><b>Supplications</b></i> — δεησεις. Prayers for <i>averting evils</i> of every kind.</p>
<p><i><b>Prayers</b></i> — προσευχας. Prayers <i>for obtaining the good things</i>, spiritual and temporal, which ourselves need.</p>
<p><i><b>Intercessions</b></i> — εντευξεις. Prayers in <i>behalf of others</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Giving of thanks</b></i> — ευχαριστιας. Praises to God, as the parent of all good, for all the blessings which we and others have received. It is probable that the apostle gives directions here for public worship; and that the words may be thus paraphrased: "<i>Now, I exhort first of all</i> that, in the public assemblies, <i>deprecations</i> of evils, and <i>supplications</i> for such good things as are necessary, and <i>intercessions</i> for their conversion, and <i>thanksgiving</i> for mercies, <i>be offered in behalf of all men</i> - for heathens as well as for Christians, and for enemies as well as for friends."
