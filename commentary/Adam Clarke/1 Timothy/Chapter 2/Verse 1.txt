Verse 1 Timothy 2:1. I exhort - that, first of all — Prayer for the pardon of sin, and for obtaining necessary supplies of grace, and continual protection from God, with gratitude and thanksgiving for mercies already received, are duties which our sinful and dependent state renders absolutely necessary; and which should be chief in our view, and first of all performed. It is difficult to know the precise difference between the four words used here by the apostle. They are sometimes distinguished thus: - Supplications — δεησεις. Prayers for averting evils of every kind.Prayers — προσευχας. Prayers for obtaining the good things, spiritual and temporal, which ourselves need.Intercessions — εντευξεις. Prayers in behalf of others.Giving of thanks — ευχαριστιας. Praises to God, as the parent of all good, for all the blessings which we and others have received. It is probable that the apostle gives directions here for public worship; and that the words may be thus paraphrased: "Now, I exhort first of all that, in the public assemblies, deprecations of evils, and supplications for such good things as are necessary, and intercessions for their conversion, and thanksgiving for mercies, be offered in behalf of all men - for heathens as well as for Christians, and for enemies as well as for friends."
