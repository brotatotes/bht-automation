<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Nor to usurp authority</b></i> — A woman should attempt nothing, either in public or private, that belongs to man as his peculiar function. This was prohibited by the Roman laws: <i>In</i> <i>multis juris nostri articulis deterior est conditio foeminarum</i> <i>quam masculorun</i>,; <i>l</i>. 9, PAP. LIB. 31, QUAEST. <i>Foeminoe ab</i> <i>omnibus officiis civilibus vel publicis remotae sunt; et ideo nec</i> <i>judicis esse possunt, nec magistratum gerere, nec postulare, nec</i> <i>pro alio invenire, nec procuratores existere</i>; <i>l</i>. 2, <i>de Reg</i>. <i>Juris</i>. ULP. LIB. i. AD SAB.-Vid. POTH. <i>Pand. Justin</i>., vol. i. p. 13.</p>
<p>"In our laws the condition of <i>women</i> is, in many respects, worse than that of <i>men</i>. Women are precluded from all public offices; therefore they cannot be judges, nor execute the function of magistrates; they cannot <i>sue, plead</i>, nor act in any case, as <i>proxies</i>. They were under many other disabilities, which may be seen in different places of the <i>Pandects</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But to be in silence.</b></i> — It was lawful for <i>men</i> in public assemblies to ask questions, or even interrupt the speaker when there was any matter in his speech which they did not understand; but this liberty was not granted to <i>women</i>.
