<p>Verse 13. <i><b>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</b></i> â€” And by this very act God designed that he should have the <i>pre-eminence</i>. God fitted man, by the robust construction of his body, to live a <i>public life</i>, to contend with difficulties, and to be capable of great exertions. The structure of woman's body plainly proves that she was never designed for those exertions required in public life. In this the chief part of the <i>natural inferiority</i> of woman is to be sought.</p>
