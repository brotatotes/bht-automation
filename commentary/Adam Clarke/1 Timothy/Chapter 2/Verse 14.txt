<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Adam was not deceived</b></i> — It does not appear that Satan attempted the man; the woman said: <i>The serpent beguiled me</i>, <i>and I did eat</i>. Adam received the fruit from the hand of his wife; <i>he</i> knew he was transgressing, he was not <i>deceived</i>; however, <i>she</i> led the way, and in consequence of this she was subjected to the domination of her husband: <i>Thy desire shall be to thy</i> <i>husband, and he shall rule over thee</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:16">Genesis 3:16</span>. There is a Greek verse, but it is not English law, that speaks a language nearly similar to that above:- </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Γυναικι δ' αρχειν ου διδωσιν ἡ φυσις.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> For nature suffers not a woman's rule. God has not only rendered her unfit for it, but he has subjected her, expressly, to the government of the man.</p>
