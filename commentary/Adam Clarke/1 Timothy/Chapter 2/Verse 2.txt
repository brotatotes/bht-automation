<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:2">1 Timothy 2:2</span>. <i><b>For kings</b></i> — As it is a positive maxim of Christianity to pray for all secular governors, so it has ever been the practice of Christians. When <i>St. Cyprian</i> defended himself before the Roman proconsul, he said: <i>Hunc (Deum) deprecamur-pro nobis et</i> <i>pro omnibus hominibus; et pro incolumitate ipsorum Imperatorum</i>. "We pray to God, not only for ourselves, but for all mankind, and particularly for the emperors."</p>
<p><i>Tertullian</i>, in his Apology, is more particular: <i>Oramus pro</i> <i>omnibus Imperatoribus, vitam illis prolixam, imperium securum,</i> <i>domum tutam, exercitus fortes, senatum fidelem, populum probum,</i> <i>orbem quietum, et quaecunque hominis et Caesaris vota sunt</i>. Apol., cap. 30. "We pray for all the emperors, that God may grant them long life, a secure government, a prosperous family, vigorous troops, a faithful senate, an obedient people; that the whole world may be in peace; and that God may grant, both to Caesar and to every man, the accomplishment of their just desires."</p>
<p>So Origen: Ευχομεθα τους βασιλεις και αρχοντας μετα της βασιλικης δυναμεως και σωφρονα τον λογισμον εχοντας εὑρεθηναι. Cont. Cels., lib. viii. "We pray for kings and rulers, that with their royal authority they may be found possessing a wise and prudent mind." Indeed they prayed even for those by whom they were persecuted. If the state be not in safety, the individual cannot be secure; self-preservation, therefore, should lead men to pray for the government under which they live. Rebellions and insurrections seldom terminate even in political good; and even where the government is radically bad, <i>revolutions</i> themselves are most precarious and hazardous. They who wish such commotions would not be quiet under the most mild and benevolent government.</p>
<p><i><b>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life</b></i> — We thus pray for the government that the public peace may be preserved. <i>Good</i> <i>rulers</i> have power to do much good; we pray that their authority may be ever preserved and well directed. <i>Bad rulers</i> have power to do much evil; we pray that they may be prevented from thus using their power. So that, whether the rulers be <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>, prayer for them is the positive duty of all Christians; and the answer to their prayers, in either ease, will be the means of their being enabled to <i>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all</i> <i>godliness and honesty</i>.</p>
