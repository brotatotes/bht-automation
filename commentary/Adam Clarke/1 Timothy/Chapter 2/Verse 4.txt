<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>. <i><b>Who will have all men to be saved</b></i> — Because he wills the salvation of all men; therefore, he wills that all men should be prayed for. In the face of such a declaration, how can any Christian soul suppose that God ever unconditionally and eternally reprobated any man? Those who can believe so, one would suppose, can have little acquaintance either with the <i>nature</i> of GOD, or the <i>bowels</i> of <i>Christ</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And to come unto the knowledge of the truth</b></i> — The <i>truth</i>-the Gospel of Christ, should be <i>proclaimed</i> to them; and it is the duty of all who know it, to diffuse it far and wide, and when it is made known, then it is the duty of those who hear it to acknowledge and receive it. This is the proper import of the original word, that they may come, εις επιγνωσιν αληθειας, <i>to the</i> <i>acknowledgment of the truth</i>-that they may receive it as the truth, and make it the rule of their faith, the model and director of their life and actions.</p>
