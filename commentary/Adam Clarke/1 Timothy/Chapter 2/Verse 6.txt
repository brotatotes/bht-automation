<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:6">1 Timothy 2:6</span>. <i><b>Who gave himself a ransom</b></i> — The word λυτρον signifies a ransom paid for the <i>redemption of a captive</i>; and αντιλυτρον, the word used here, and applied to the death of Christ, signifies that ransom which consists in the <i>exchange of</i> <i>one person for another</i>, or the <i>redemption</i> of <i>life</i> by <i>life</i>; or, as <i>Schleusner</i> has expressed it in his translation of these words, <i>Qui morte sua omnes liberavit a vitiositatis vi et poenis,</i> <i>a servitute quassi et miseria peccatorum</i>. "He who by his death has redeemed all from the power and punishment of vice, from the slavery and misery of sinners." As God is the God and father of all, (for there is but <i>one</i> God, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:5">1 Timothy 2:5</span>), and Jesus Christ the mediator of all, so he gave himself a ransom for all; i.e., for all that God made, consequently for every human soul; unless we could suppose that there are human souls of which God is not the Creator; for the argument of the apostle is plainly this: 1. There is one God; 2. This God is the Creator of all; 3. He has made a revelation of his kindness to all; 4. He will have all men to be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth; and 5. He has provided a mediator for all, who has given himself a ransom for all. As surely as God has created all men, so surely has Jesus Christ died for all men. This is a truth which the nature and revelation of God unequivocally proclaim.</p>
<p><i><b>To be testified in due time.</b></i> — The original words, το μαρτυριον καιροις ιδιοις, are not very clear, and have been understood variously. The most authentic copies of the <i>printed Vulgate</i> have simply, <i>Testimonium temporibus suis</i>; which CALMET translates: <i>Rendant ainsi temoignage au tems marqué</i>; "Thus rendering testimony at the appointed time." Dr. MACKNIGHT thus: <i>Of which</i> <i>the testimony is in its proper season</i>. WAKEFIELD thus: "That testimony <i>reserved</i> to <i>its</i> proper time" ROSENMULLEN: <i>Haec est</i> <i>doctrina, temporibus suis reservata</i>. "This is the doctrine which is reserved for its own times;" that is, adds he, <i>quoe suo</i> <i>tempore in omni terrarum orbe tradetur</i>, "the doctrine which in its own time shall be delivered to all the inhabitants of the earth." Here he translates μαρτυριον, <i>doctrine</i>; and contends that this, not <i>testimony</i>, is its meaning, not only in this passage, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:6">1 Corinthians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>, c. Instead of μαρτυριον, <i>testimony</i>, one MS., Cod. Kk., vi. 4, in the public library, Cambridge, has, μυστηριον, <i>mystery</i> but this is not acknowledged by any other MS., nor by any <i>version</i>. In D*FG the whole clause is read thus: οὑ το μαρτυριον καιροις ιδιοις εδοθη· <i>The testimony</i> <i>of which was given in its own times</i>. This is nearly the reading which was adopted in the <i>first printed copies</i> of the <i>Vulgate</i>. One of them now before me reads the passage thus: <i>Cujus testimonium</i> <i>temporibus suis confirmatum est</i>. "The testimony of which is confirmed in its own times." This reading was adopted by Pope <i>Sixtus V</i>., in the <i>famous</i> edition published by him; but was corrected to the reading above, by <i>Pope Clement VIII</i>. And this was rendered literally by our <i>first</i> translator: <i>Whos witnessinge</i> <i>is confermyd in his timis</i>. This appears to be the apostle's meaning: Christ gave himself a ransom for all. This, in the times which seemed best to the Divine wisdom, was to be testified to every nation, and people, and tongue. The apostles had begun this testimony; and, in the course of the Divine economy, it has ever since been gradually promulgated; and at present runs with a more rapid course than ever.</p>
