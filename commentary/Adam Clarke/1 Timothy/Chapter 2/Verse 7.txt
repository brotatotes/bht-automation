<p>Verse 7. <i><b>I am ordained a preacher</b></i> — <i>I am set apart</i>, ετεθην, <i>appointed</i>. The word does not imply any <i>imposition of hands</i> by either <i>bishop</i> or <i>presbytery</i>, as is vulgarly supposed.</p>
<p><i><b>I speak the truth in Christ</b></i> — As I have received my commission from him, so I testify his truth. I did not run before I was sent; and I speak nothing but what I have received.</p>
<p><i><b>A teacher of the Gentiles</b></i> — Being <i>specially</i> commissioned to preach the Gospel, not to the <i>Jews</i>, but to the <i>nations</i> of the <i>world</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>In faith and verity.</b></i> — <i>Faithfully</i> and <i>truly</i>; preaching the TRUTH, the <i>whole</i> TRUTH, and <i>nothing but</i> the TRUTH; and this <i>fervently, affectionately</i>, and <i>perseveringly</i>.</p>
<p>Instead of ενπιστει, <i>in faith</i>, the Cod. Alexand. has εν πνευματι, <i>in spirit</i>. "A teacher of the Gentiles in spirit and truth."</p>
