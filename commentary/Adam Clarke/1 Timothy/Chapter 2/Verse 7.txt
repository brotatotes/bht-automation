Verse 7. I am ordained a preacher — I am set apart, ετεθην, appointed. The word does not imply any imposition of hands by either bishop or presbytery, as is vulgarly supposed.I speak the truth in Christ — As I have received my commission from him, so I testify his truth. I did not run before I was sent; and I speak nothing but what I have received.A teacher of the Gentiles — Being specially commissioned to preach the Gospel, not to the Jews, but to the nations of the world.In faith and verity. — Faithfully and truly; preaching the TRUTH, the whole TRUTH, and nothing but the TRUTH; and this fervently, affectionately, and perseveringly.Instead of ενπιστει, in faith, the Cod. Alexand. has εν πνευματι, in spirit. "A teacher of the Gentiles in spirit and truth."
