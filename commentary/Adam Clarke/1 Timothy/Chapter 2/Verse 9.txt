<p>Verse 9. <i><b>In like manner also</b></i> — That is, he <i>wills</i> or <i>commands</i> what follows, as he had commanded what went before.</p>
<p><i><b>That women adorn themselves</b></i> — Και τας γυναικας ες καταστολῃ κοσμιῳ. The apostle seems to refer here to different parts of the Grecian and Roman dress. The στολη, <i>stola</i>, seems to have been originally very simple. It was a long piece of cloth, doubled in the middle, and sewed up on both sides, leaving room only for the arms; at the top, a piece was cut out, or a slit made, through which the head passed. It hung down to the feet, both before and behind, and was girded with the <i>zona</i> round the body, just under the breasts. It was sometimes made with, sometimes without, sleeves; and, that it might sit the better, it was gathered on each shoulder with a <i>band</i> or <i>buckle</i>. Some of the Greek women wore them <i>open</i> on each side, from the bottom up above the knee, so as to discover a part of the <i>thigh</i>. These were termed φαινομηριδες, <i>showers (discoverers) of the thigh</i>; but it was, in general, only <i>young girls</i> or <i>immodest women</i> who wore them thus.</p>
<p>The καταστολη seems to have been the same as the <i>pallium</i> or <i>mantle</i>, which, being made nearly in the form of the <i>stola</i>, hung down to the <i>waist</i>, both in back and front, was gathered on the shoulder with a band or buckle, had a hole or slit at top for the head to pass through, and hung loosely over the <i>stola</i>, without being confined by the <i>zona</i> or <i>girdle</i>. Representations of these dresses may be seen in LENS' <i>Costume des Peuples de l'Antiquité</i>, fig. 11, 12, 13, and 16. A more modest and becoming dress than the Grecian was never invented; it was, in a great measure, revived in England about the year 1805, and in it, simplicity, decency, and elegance were united; but it soon gave place to another mode, in which frippery and nonsense once more prevailed. It was too rational to last long; and too much like religious simplicity to be suffered in a land of shadows, and a world of painted outsides.</p>
<p><i><b>With shamefacedness and sobriety</b></i> — The <i>stola, catastola</i>, <i>girdle, c.</i>, though simple in themselves, were often highly ornamented both with <i>gold</i> and <i>precious stones</i> and, both among the Grecian and Roman women, the <i>hair</i> was often <i>crisped</i> and <i>curled</i> in the most variegated and complex manner. To this the apostle alludes when he says: Μη εν πλεγμασιν, η χρυσῳ, η μαργαριταις, η ἱματισμῳ πολυτελει· <i>Not with plaited hair, or</i> <i>gold, or pearls, or costly raiment</i>. The <i>costly raiment</i> might refer to the <i>materials</i> out of which the raiment was made, and to the <i>workmanship</i>; the <i>gold</i> and <i>pearls</i>, to the <i>ornaments</i> on the raiment.</p>
<p><i>With shame-facedness</i> or <i>modesty</i>, μετα αιδους. This would lead them to avoid every thing <i>unbecoming</i> or <i>meretricious</i> in the mode or <i>fashion</i> of their dress.</p>
<p><i>With sobriety</i>, μετα σωφροσυνης. Moderation would lead them to avoid all unnecessary expense. They might follow the <i>custom</i> or <i>costume of the country</i> as to the dress itself, for nothing was ever more becoming than the Grecian <i>stola, catastola</i>, and <i>zona</i>; but they must not imitate the extravagance of those who, through <i>impurity</i> or <i>littleness of mind</i>, decked themselves merely to attract the eye of admiration, or set in lying action the tongue of flattery. Woman has been invidiously defined: <i>An animal fond</i> <i>of dress</i>. How long will they permit themselves to be thus degraded?</p>
<p>Those beautiful lines of <i>Homer</i>, in which he speaks of the death of Euphorbus, who was slain by Menelaus, show how anciently the Grecians plaited and adorned their hair: - </p>
<p><i>Kypke</i>, however, denies that any particular article of dress is intended here, and says that καταστολη is to be understood as coming from καταστελλω, to <i>restrain, repress</i>; and he refers it to that <i>government</i> of the mind, or <i>moderation</i> which women should exercise over their dress and demeanour in general, and every thing that may fall under the observation of the senses. All this, undoubtedly, the apostle had in view.</p>
<p>When either women or men spend much time, cost, and attention on decorating their persons, it affords a painful proof that <i>within</i> there is little excellence, and that they are endeavoring to supply the want of <i>mind</i> and <i>moral good</i> by the feeble and silly aids of dress and ornament. Were <i>religion</i> out of the question, <i>common sense</i> would say in all these things: Be decent; but be moderate and modest.</p>
