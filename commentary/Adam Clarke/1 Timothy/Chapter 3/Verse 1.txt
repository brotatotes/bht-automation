<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</span>. <i><b>This is a true saying</b></i> — πιστος ο λογος. <i>This is a</i> <i>true doctrine</i>. These words are joined to the last verse of the preceding chapter by several of the Greek fathers, and by them referred to the doctrine there stated.</p>
<p><i><b>The office of a bishop</b></i> — επισκοπης. The <i>episcopacy</i>, <i>overseership</i> or <i>superintendency</i>. The word ορεγεται, which we translate <i>desire</i>, signifies <i>earnest, eager, passionate desire</i>; and επιθυμει, which we translate <i>desire</i>, also signifies <i>earnestly</i> <i>to desire or covet</i>. It is strange that the episcopacy, in those times, should have been an object of <i>intense desire</i> to any man; when it was a place of danger, awl exposure to severe labour, want, persecution, and death, without any secular emolument whatsoever. On this ground I am led to think that the Spirit of God designed these words more for the ages that were to come, than for those which were then; and in reference to after ages the whole of what follows is chiefly to be understood.</p>
<p><i><b>A good work.</b></i> — A <i>work</i> it then was; heavy, incessant, and painful. There were no unpreaching prelates in those days, and should be none now. <i>Episcopacy</i> in the <i>Church</i> of God is of Divine appointment, and should be maintained and respected. Under God, there should be supreme governors in the <i>Church</i> as well as in the <i>state</i>. The <i>state</i> has its <i>monarch</i>, the Church has its <i>bishop;</i> one should govern according to the <i>laws of the land</i>, the other according to the <i>word of God</i>.</p>
<p>What a <i>constitutional king should be</i>, the principles of the <i>constitution</i> declare; what a <i>bishop</i> should be, the following verses particularly show.</p>
