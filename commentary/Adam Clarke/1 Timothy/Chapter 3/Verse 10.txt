<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Let these - be proved</b></i> — Let them not be <i>young</i> <i>converts</i>, or persons lately brought to the knowledge of the truth. This is the same in spirit with what is required of the bishops, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:6">1 Timothy 3:6</span>.</p>
<p>Let no man be put into an office in the Church till he has given full proof of his sincerity and steadiness, by having been for a considerable time a consistent private member of the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Being</b></i><b> found </b><i><b>blameless.</b></i> — ανεγκλητοι οντες. Being irreproachable; persons against whom no evil can be proved. The same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>, though a different word is used. See the note there.</p>
