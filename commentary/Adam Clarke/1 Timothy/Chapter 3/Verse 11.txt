<p>Verse 11. <i><b>Even so</b></i><b> must their </b><i><b>wives</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>grave</b></i> — I believe the apostle does not mean here the <i>wives</i> either of the <i>bishops</i> or <i>deacons</i> in particular, but the Christian <i>women</i> in general. The original is simply: γυναικας ωσαυτως σεμνας. <i>Let the women</i> <i>likewise be grave</i>. Whatever is spoken here becomes women in general; but if the apostle had those termed <i>deaconesses</i> in his eye, which is quite possible, the words are peculiarly suitable to <i>them</i>. That there was such an <i>order</i> in the apostolic and primitive Church, and that they were appointed to their office by the <i>imposition</i> of hands, has already been noticed on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>. Possibly, therefore, the apostle may have had this <i>order</i> of <i>deaconesses</i> in view, to whom it was as necessary to give counsels and cautions as to the <i>deacons</i> themselves; and to prescribe their qualifications, lest improper persons should insinuate themselves into that office.</p>
<p><i><b>Not slanderers</b></i> — μη διαβολους. Literally, <i>not devils</i>. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7">1 Timothy 3:7</span>. This may be properly enough translated <i>slanderers, backbiters, tale-bearers</i>, c., for all these are of their father, the devil, and his lusts they will do. Let all such, with the vast tribe of <i>calumniators</i> and <i>dealers in scandal</i>, remember that the apostle ranks them all with <i>malicious, fallen</i> <i>spirits</i> a consideration which one would suppose might be sufficient to deter them from their injurious and abominable conduct.</p>
<p><i><b>Sober</b></i> — See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Faithful in all things.</b></i> — The deaconesses had much to do among the poor, and especially among poor women, in dispensing the bounty of the Church. They were not only <i>faithfully</i> to <i>expend</i> <i>all</i> they had got, and <i>for</i> the <i>purpose</i> for which they got it; but they must do this with <i>impartiality</i>, showing no <i>respect of</i> <i>persons</i>, the degree of <i>distress</i> being the only rule by which the distribution was to be regulated.</p>
