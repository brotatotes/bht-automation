Verse 11. Even so must their wives be grave — I believe the apostle does not mean here the wives either of the bishops or deacons in particular, but the Christian women in general. The original is simply: γυναικας ωσαυτως σεμνας. Let the women likewise be grave. Whatever is spoken here becomes women in general; but if the apostle had those termed deaconesses in his eye, which is quite possible, the words are peculiarly suitable to them. That there was such an order in the apostolic and primitive Church, and that they were appointed to their office by the imposition of hands, has already been noticed on Romans 16:1. Possibly, therefore, the apostle may have had this order of deaconesses in view, to whom it was as necessary to give counsels and cautions as to the deacons themselves; and to prescribe their qualifications, lest improper persons should insinuate themselves into that office.Not slanderers — μη διαβολους. Literally, not devils. See note on 1 Timothy 3:7. This may be properly enough translated slanderers, backbiters, tale-bearers, c., for all these are of their father, the devil, and his lusts they will do. Let all such, with the vast tribe of calumniators and dealers in scandal, remember that the apostle ranks them all with malicious, fallen spirits a consideration which one would suppose might be sufficient to deter them from their injurious and abominable conduct.Sober — See note on 1 Timothy 3:2.Faithful in all things. — The deaconesses had much to do among the poor, and especially among poor women, in dispensing the bounty of the Church. They were not only faithfully to expend all they had got, and for the purpose for which they got it; but they must do this with impartiality, showing no respect of persons, the degree of distress being the only rule by which the distribution was to be regulated.
