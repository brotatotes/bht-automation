<p>Verse 13. <i><b>That have used the office of a deacon well</b></i> — They who, having been <i>tried</i> or <i>proved</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:10">1 Timothy 3:10</span>, have shown by their steadiness, activity, and zeal, that they might be raised to a higher office, are here said to have <i>purchased to themselves a</i> <i>good degree</i>, βαθμον καλον. for, instead of having to administer to the <i>bodies</i> and <i>bodily wants</i> of the poor, the faithful deacons were raised to minister in holy things; and, instead of ministering the <i>bread that perisheth</i>, they were raised to the <i>presbyterate</i> or <i>episcopate</i>, to minister the <i>bread of life</i> to immortal souls. And hence the apostle adds; <i>And great boldness</i> <i>in the faith</i>; πολλην παρῥησιαν, <i>great liberty of speech</i>; i.e. in teaching the <i>doctrines</i> of Christianity, and in expounding the Scriptures, and preaching. It seems to have been a practice dictated by common sense, that the most grave and steady of the <i>believers</i> should be employed as <i>deacons</i>; the most experienced and zealous of the <i>deacons</i> should be raised to the rank of <i>elders</i>; and the most able and pious of the <i>elders</i> be consecrated <i>bishops</i>. As to a <i>bishop of bishops</i>, that age did not know such. The <i>pope</i> <i>of Rome</i> was the first who took this title. The <i>same office</i>, but not with the same powers nor abuse, is found in the <i>patriarch</i> of the <i>Greek</i> Church, and the <i>archbishop</i> of the <i>Protestant</i> Church. As the <i>deacon</i> had many <i>private members</i> under his care, so the <i>presbyter</i> or <i>elder</i> had several <i>deacons</i> under his care; the <i>bishop</i>, several <i>presbyters</i>; and the <i>archbishop</i>, several <i>bishops</i>. But I speak now more of the <i>modern</i> than of the <i>ancient</i> Church. The <i>distinction</i> in some of these <i>offices</i> is not so apparent in ancient times; and some of the offices themselves are <i>modern</i>, or comparatively so. But <i>deacon, presbyter</i>, and <i>bishop</i>, existed in the <i>apostolic Church</i>, and may therefore be considered of <i>Divine</i> <i>origin</i>.</p>
