<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>. <i><b>A bishop then must be blameless</b></i> — Our term <i>bishop</i> comes from the Anglo-Saxon [A.S.], which is a mere corruption of the Greek επισκοπος, and the Latin <i>episcopus</i>; the former being compounded of επι, <i>over</i>, and σκεπτομαι, to <i>look</i> or <i>inspect</i>, signifies one who has the <i>inspection</i> or <i>oversight</i> of a place, persons, or business; what we commonly term a <i>superintendent</i>. The New Testament writers have borrowed the term from the <i>Septuagint</i>, it being the word by which they translate the <i>pakid</i> of the Hebrew text, which signifies a <i>visiter</i>, one that <i>personally inspects</i> the people or business over which he presides. It is given by St. Paul to the elders at Ephesus, who had the <i>oversight</i> of Christ's flock, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>; and to such like persons in other places, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>, the place in question; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>.</p>
<p>Let us consider the <i>qualifications</i> of a Christian bishop, and then we shall soon discover <i>who</i> is fit for the office.</p>
<p><i>First</i>. - This Christian bishop <b>must be </b><i><b>blameless</b></i>; ανεπιληπτον, a person <i>against whom no evil can be proved</i>; one who is everywhere <i>invulnerable</i>; for the word is a metaphor, taken from the case of an expert and skilful pugilist, who <i>so defends</i> <i>every part of his body</i> that it is impossible for his antagonist to give one hit. So this Christian bishop is one that has so conducted himself, as to put it out of the reach of any person to prove that he is either unsound in a single article of the Christian <i>faith</i>, or <i>deficient</i> in the <i>fulfilment</i> of any <i>duty</i> incumbent on a Christian. He <i>must</i> be irreprehensible; for how can he reprove that in others which they can reprove in him?</p>
<p><i>Second</i>. - <b>He must be </b><i><b>the husband of one wife</b></i>. He should be a <i>married</i> man, but he should be no <i>polygamist</i>; and have only <i>one</i> <i>wife</i>, i.e. <i>one</i> at <i>a time</i>. It does <i>not mean</i> that, if he has been married, and his wife die, he should never marry another. Some have most foolishly spiritualized this, and say, that by <i>one</i> <i>wife</i> the <i>Church</i> is intended! This silly quibbling needs no refutation. The apostle's meaning appears to be this: that he should not be a man who has <i>divorced</i> his wife and married another; nor one that has <i>two wives</i> at a time. It does not appear to have been any part of the apostle's design to prohibit <i>second</i> marriages, of which some have made such a serious business. But it is natural for some men to tithe mint and cummin in religion, while they neglect the weightier matters of the law.</p>
<p><i>Third</i>. - <b>He must be </b><i><b>vigilant</b></i>; νηφαλεον, from νη, <i>not</i> and πιω, to <i>drink</i>. <i>Watchful</i>; for as one who drinks is apt to <i>sleep</i>, so he who abstains from it is more likely to keep <i>awake</i>, and attend to his <i>work</i> and <i>charge</i>. A bishop has to watch <i>over</i> the Church, and watch <i>for</i> it; and this will require all his care and circumspection. Instead of νηφαλεον, many MSS. read νηφαλιον. this may be the better <i>orthography</i>, but makes no alteration in the sense.</p>
<p><i>Fourth</i>. - <b>He must be </b><i><b>sober</b></i>; σωφρονα, <i>prudent</i> or, according to the etymology of the word, from σως, sound, and φρην, <i>mind, a</i> <i>man of a sound mind</i>; having a good understanding, and the complete government of all his passions.</p>
<p>A bishop should be a man of <i>learning</i>, of an extensive and well cultivated mind, dispassionate, prudent, and sedate.</p>
<p><i>Fifth</i>. - <b>He must be </b><i><b>of good behaviour</b></i>; κοσμιον, <i>orderly</i>, <i>decent, grave</i>, and <i>correct</i> in the whole of his <i>appearance</i>, <i>carriage</i>, and <i>conduct</i>. The preceding term, σωφρονα, refers to the <i>mind</i>; this latter, κοσμιον, to the <i>external manners</i>. A clownish, rude, or boorish man should never have the rule of the Church of God; the sour, the sullen, and the boisterous should never be invested with a dignity which they would most infallibly disgrace.</p>
<p><i>Sixth</i>. - <b>He must be </b><i><b>given to hospitality</b></i>; φιλοξενον, literally, a <i>lover of strangers</i>; one who is ready to receive into his house and relieve every necessitous stranger. <i>Hospitality</i>, in those primitive times, was a great and necessary virtue; then there were few <i>inns</i>, or places of <i>public entertainment</i>; to those who were noted for benevolence the necessitous stranger had recourse. A Christian bishop, professing love to God and all mankind, preaching a religion, one half of the morality of which was included in, <i>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</i>, would naturally be sought to by those who were in distress and destitute of friends. To enable them to entertain such, the Church over which they presided must have furnished them with the <i>means</i>. Such a bishop as St. Paul, who was often obliged to labour with his hands for his own support, could have little to give away. But there is a considerable difference between an apostolical bishop and an ecclesiastical bishop: the one was generally itinerant, the other comparatively local; the former had neither house nor home, the latter had both; the apostolical bishop had charge of the Church of Christ universally, the ecclesiastical bishop of the Churches in a particular district. Such should be addicted to hospitality, or works of charity; especially in these modern times, in which, besides the <i>spiritualities</i>, they possess the <i>temporalities</i>, of the Church.</p>
<p><i>Seventh</i>. - <b>He should be </b><i><b>apt to teach</b></i>; διδακτικον, one <i>capable</i> <i>of teaching</i>; not only <i>wise</i> himself, but <i>ready</i> to communicate his wisdom to others. One whose delight is, to instruct the ignorant and those who are out of the way. He must be a <i>preacher</i>; an able, zealous, fervent, and assiduous preacher.</p>
<p>He is no bishop who has health and strength, and yet seldom or never preaches; i.e. if he <i>can</i> preach - if he have the necessary gifts for the office.</p>
<p>In former times bishops wrote much and preached much; and their labours were greatly owned of God. No Church since the apostle's days has been more honoured in this way than the British Church. And although bishops are <i>here</i>, as elsewhere, appointed by the <i>state</i>, yet we cannot help adoring the good providence of God, that, taken as a body, they have been an honour to their function; and that, since the reformation of religion in these lands, the bishops have in general been men of great learning and probity, and the ablest advocates of the Christian system, both as to its <i>authenticity</i>, and the <i>purity</i> and <i>excellence</i> of its <i>doctrines</i> and <i>morality</i>.</p>
<p>CHAUCER'S character of the <i>Clerke of Oxenford</i> is a good paraphrase on St. Paul's character of a primitive bishop: - </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Of studie tookin he moste cure and hede,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Nought oo word spak he more than there was nede,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And that was selde in forme and and reverence,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And short, and quick, and full of high sentence;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Sowning in moral vertue was speche,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teache. </p>
