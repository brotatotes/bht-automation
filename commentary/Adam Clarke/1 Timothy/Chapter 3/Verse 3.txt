<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>. An <i>eighth</i> article in his character is, <b>he must not be </b><i><b>given to wine</b></i>; μηπαροινον. This word not only signifies one who is <i>inordinately attached to wine</i>, a <i>winebibber</i> or <i>tippler</i>, but also one who is <i>imperious, abusive, insolent</i>, whether through wine or otherwise. <i>Kypke</i> contends for this latter acceptation here. See his <i>proofs</i> and <i>examples</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ninth</i>. - <b>He must be </b><i><b>no striker</b></i>; μηπληκτην, not <i>quarrelsome</i>; not ready to <i>strike a person</i> who may displease him; no <i>persecutor</i> of those who may differ from him; not prone, as one wittily said, </p>
<p><i>Tenth</i>. - <b>He must </b><i><b>not</b></i><b> be </b><i><b>greedy of filthy lucre</b></i>; μη αισχροκερδη, <i>not desirous of base gain</i>; not using <i>base</i> and <i>unjustifiable</i> methods to raise and increase his revenues; not trading or trafficking; for what would be honourable in a <i>secular</i> character, would be base and dishonourable in a bishop. Though such a trait should never appear in the character of a Christian prelate, yet there is much reason to suspect that the words above are not authentic; they are omitted by ADFG, many others, the <i>Syriac</i>, all the <i>Arabic, Coptic</i>, (and <i>Sahidic</i>,) <i>AEthiopic</i>, <i>Armenian</i>, later <i>Syriac</i>, (but it appears in the margin,) the <i>Vulgate</i> and <i>Itala</i>, and by most of the <i>Greek fathers</i>. <i>Griesbach</i> has left it out of the text, in which it does not appear that it ever had a legitimate place. The word <i>covetous</i>, which we have below, expresses all the meaning of this; and it is not likely that the apostle would insert in the same sentence two words of the same <i>meaning</i>, because they were different in <i>sound</i>. It appears to have been borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>.</p>
<p><i>Eleventh</i>. - <b>He must be </b><i><b>patient</b></i>; επιεικη, <i>meek, gentle</i>; the opposite to πληκτην, a quarrelsome person, which it immediately follows when the spurious word αισχροκερδη is removed. Where <i>meekness</i> and <i>patience</i> do not reign, <i>gravity</i> cannot exist, and the <i>love of God</i> cannot dwell.</p>
<p><i>Twelfth</i>. - <b>He must not be a </b><i><b>brawler</b></i>; αμαχον, not <i>contentious</i> or <i>litigious</i>, but <i>quiet</i> and <i>peaceable</i>.</p>
<p><i>Thirteenth</i>. - <b>He must not be </b><i><b>covetous</b></i>; αφιλαργυρον, <i>not a</i> <i>lover of money</i>; not desiring the <i>office</i> for the sake of its <i>emoluments</i>. He who loves money will stick at nothing in order to get it. Fair and foul methods are to him alike, provided they may be equally productive. For the sake of reputation he may wish to get all honourably; but if that cannot be, he will not scruple to adopt other methods. A brother heathen gives him this counsel: "Get money if thou canst by fair means; if not, get it by hook and by crook."</p>
