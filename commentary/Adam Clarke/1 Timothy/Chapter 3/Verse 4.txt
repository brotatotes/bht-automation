<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:4">1 Timothy 3:4</span>. The <i>fourteenth</i> qualification of a Christian bishop is, that <b>he </b><i><b>ruleth well his own house</b></i>; του ιδιου οικου καλως προΐσταμενον, one who <i>properly presides over</i> and <i>governs his own</i> <i>family</i>. One who has the <i>command</i>, of his <i>own house</i>, not by sternness, severity, and tyranny, but with all <i>gravity</i>; governing his household by <i>rule</i>, every one knowing his own <i>place</i>, and each doing his own <i>work</i>, and each work having the proper <i>time</i> assigned for its beginning and end. This is a maxim of common sense; no family can be prosperous that is not under subjection, and no person can govern a family but the <i>head</i> of it, the husband, who is, both by nature and the appointment of God, the <i>head</i> or <i>governor</i> of his own house. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span>.</p>
