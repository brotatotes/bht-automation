<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:5">1 Timothy 3:5</span>. <i><b>For if a man know not</b></i> â€” <i>Method</i> is a matter of great importance in all the affairs of life. It is a true saying, <i>He</i> <i>that does little with his head must do much with his hands</i>; and even <i>then</i> the business is not half done for want of <i>method</i>. Now, he who has a proper method of doing business will show it in <i>every affair</i> of life, even the <i>least</i>. He who has a <i>disorderly</i> family has no <i>government</i> of that family; he probably has none because he has no <i>method</i>, no <i>plan</i>, of presiding. It was natural for the apostle to say, <i>If a man know not how to rule his own</i> <i>house, how shall he take care of the Church of God</i>? Look at a man's domestic arrangements; if they be not good, he should not be trusted with any branch of government, whether ecclesiastical or civil.</p>
