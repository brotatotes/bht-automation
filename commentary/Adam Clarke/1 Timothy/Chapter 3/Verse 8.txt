<p>Verse 8. <i><b>Likewise</b></i><b> must </b><i><b>the deacons</b></i> — The term <i>deacon</i>, διακονος, simply signifies a <i>regular</i> or <i>stated servant</i>: from δια, <i>through</i> or <i>emphatic</i>, and κονεω, to <i>minister</i> or <i>serve</i>. See it explained in <i>Clarke's note on "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:26">Matthew 20:26</span><i>"</i>. As nearly the same qualifications were required in the <i>deacons</i> as in the <i>bishops</i>, the reader may consult what is said on the preceding verses.</p>
<p><i><b>Grave</b></i> — Of a sedate and dignified carriage and conduct.</p>
<p><i><b>Not double-tongued</b></i> — Speaking one thing to one person, and another thing to another, on the <i>same subject</i>. This is hypocrisy and deceit. This word might also be translated <i>liars</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Not given to much wine</b></i> — Neither a drunkard, tippler, nor what is called a <i>jovial companion</i>. All this would be inconsistent with <i>gravity</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Not greedy of filthy lucre</b></i> — See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>.</p>
