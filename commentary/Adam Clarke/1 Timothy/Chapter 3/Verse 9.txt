<p>Verse 9. <i><b>Holding the mystery of the faith</b></i> — Instead of της πιστεως, <i>the faith</i>, one MS. (the readings of which are found in the margin of a copy of Mill's Greek text in the Bodleian library, and which is marked 61 in <i>Griesbach</i>) reads αναστασεως, <i>of the resurrection</i>. This reading, like many others in this MS., is found nowhere else; and is worthy of little regard, but as expressing what appeared to the writer to be the apostle's <i>meaning</i>. One of the greatest mysteries of the faith was undoubtedly the <i>resurrection of the dead</i>; and this was held in a <i>pure conscience</i> when the person <i>so exercised himself</i> as to <i>have a</i> <i>conscience void of offence towards God and towards men</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:16">Acts 24:16</span>. What has been since called <i>Antinomianism</i>, that is, making void the <i>moral law</i>, by a pretended <i>faith</i> in the righteousness of Christ, is that which the apostle has here particularly in view.</p>
