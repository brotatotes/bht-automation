<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>. <i><b>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly</b></i> — Ῥητως· <i>Manifestly, openly</i>. It is very likely that the apostle refers here to a prophecy <i>then</i> furnished by the Holy Ghost, and probably immediately after he had written the words in the preceding verses; and as this prophecy contains things nowhere else spoken of in the sacred writings, and of the utmost moment to the Christian Church, we cannot hear or read them with too much reverence or respect.</p>
<p><i><b>In the latter times</b></i> — This does not necessarily imply the last ages of the world, but any times consequent to those in which the Church then lived.</p>
<p><i><b>Depart from the faith</b></i> — Αποστησονται - της πιστεως· <i>They will</i> <i>apostatize from the faith</i>, i.e. from Christianity; renouncing the whole system <i>in effect</i>, by bringing in doctrines which render its essential truths null and void, or denying and renouncing such doctrines as are essential to Christianity as a system of salvation. A man may hold all the truths of Christianity, and yet render them of none effect by holding other doctrines which counteract their influence; or he may apostatize by denying some essential doctrine, though he bring in nothing <i>heterodox</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Giving heed to seducing spirits</b></i> — Πνευμασι πλανοις· Many MSS. and the chief of the fathers have πνευμασι πλανης· <i>spirits of</i> <i>deceit</i>; which is much more emphatic than the common reading. Deception has her spirits, emissaries of every kind, which she employs to darken the hearts and destroy the souls of men. Pretenders to <i>inspiration</i>, and false teachers of every kind, belong to this class.</p>
<p><i><b>And doctrines of devils</b></i> — Δαιμονιων· <i>Demons</i>; either meaning <i>fallen spirits</i>, or <i>dead men, spectres</i>, &amp;c., or doctrines inspired by Satan relative to these, by which he secures his own interest, and provides for his own worship.</p>
