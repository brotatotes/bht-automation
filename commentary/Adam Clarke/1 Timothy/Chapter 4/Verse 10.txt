<p>Verse 10. <i><b>For therefore we both labour</b></i> — This verse was necessary to explain what he had before said; and here he shows that his meaning was not that the followers of God should enjoy <i>worldly prosperity</i> and <i>exemption from natural evils</i>; for, said he, it is because we exercise ourselves to godliness that we have both labour and reproach, and we have these because we trust In the living God: but still we have mental happiness, and all that is necessary for our passage through life; for in the midst of persecutions and afflictions we have the peace of God that passeth knowledge, and have all our crosses and sufferings so sanctified to us that we consider them in the number of our blessings.</p>
<p><i><b>Who is the Saviour of all men</b></i> — Who has provided salvation for the whole human race, and has freely offered it to them in his word and by his Spirit.</p>
<p><i><b>Specially of those that believe.</b></i> — What God intends for ALL, he actually gives to <i>them</i> that believe in Christ, who died for the sins of the world, and tasted death for every man. As <i>all</i> have been purchased by his blood so all may believe; and consequently all may be saved. Those that perish, perish through their own fault.</p>
