<p>Verse 11. <i><b>These things command and teach.</b></i> â€” Let it be the sum and substance of thy preaching, that true <i>religion</i> is profitable for both worlds; that <i>vice</i> destroys both body and soul; that Christ tasted death for every man; and that he saves to the uttermost all them that believe in his name.</p>
