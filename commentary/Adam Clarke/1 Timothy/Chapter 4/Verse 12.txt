<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Let no man despise thy youth</b></i> — Act with all the <i>gravity</i> and decorum which become thy situation in the Church. As thou art in the place of an <i>elder</i>, act as an <i>elder</i>. Boyish playfulness ill becomes a minister of the Gospel, whatever his age may be. Concerning Timothy's age see the conclusion of the preface to this epistle.</p>
<p><i><b>Be thou an example of the believers</b></i> — It is natural for the flock to follow the shepherd; if <i>he</i> go wrong, they will go wrong also. </p>
<p><i><b>In word</b></i> — εν λογω. <i>In doctrine</i>; teach nothing but the truth of God, because nothing but that will save souls.</p>
<p><i><b>In conversation</b></i> — εν αναστροφη. In the whole of <i>thy conduct</i> in every department which thou fillest in all thy domestic as well as public relations, <i>behave</i> thyself well.</p>
<p><i><b>In charity</b></i> — εν αγαπη. In love to God and man; show that this is the <i>principle</i> and <i>motive</i> of all thy conduct.</p>
<p><i><b>In spirit</b></i> — εν πνευματι. In the <i>manner</i> and <i>disposition</i> in which thou dost all things. How often is a <i>holy</i> or <i>charitable</i> work done in an <i>unholy, uncharitable</i>, and peevish spirit! To the doer, such work is unfruitful.</p>
<p>These words are wanting in ACDFG, and several others; both the <i>Syriac</i>, Erpen's <i>Arabic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, and many of the <i>fathers</i>. Griesbach leaves them out of the text. They have in all probability been added by a later hand.</p>
<p><i><b>In faith</b></i> — εν πιστει. This word πιστις is probably taken here for <i>fidelity</i>, a sense which it often bears in the New Testament. It cannot mean <i>doctrine</i>, for that has been referred to before. Be <i>faithful</i> to thy <i>trust</i>, to thy <i>flock</i>, to thy <i>domestics</i>, to the <i>public</i>, to thy GOD. <i>Fidelity</i> consists in honestly keeping, preserving, and delivering up when required, whatever is intrusted to our care; as also in <i>improving</i> whatever is delivered in trust for that purpose. Lose nothing that God gives, and improve every gift that he bestows.</p>
<p><i><b>In purity.</b></i> — εν αγνεια. <i>Chastity</i> of body and mind; a direction peculiarly necessary for a young minister, who has more temptations to break its rules than perhaps any other person. "<i>Converse sparingly with women, and especially with young women</i>," was the advice of a very holy and experienced minister of Christ.</p>
