<p>Verse 13. <i><b>Give attendance to reading</b></i> â€” Timothy could easily comprehend the apostle's meaning; but at present this is not so easy. What <i>books</i> does the apostle mean? The books of the Old Testament were probably what he intended; these testified of Jesus, and by these he could either <i>convince</i> or <i>confound</i> the Jews. But, whether was the reading of these to be <i>public</i> or <i>private</i>? Probably both. It was customary to read the law and the prophets in the synagogue, and doubtless in the assemblies of the Christians; after which there was generally an exhortation founded upon the subject of the prophecy. Hence the apostle says: <i>Give attendance to reading, to</i> EXHORTATION, <i>to</i> DOCTRINE. Timothy was therefore to be diligent in reading the sacred writings at <i>home</i>, that he might be the better qualified to read and expound them in the public assemblies to the Christians, and to others who came to these public meetings.</p>
<p>As to <i>other books</i>, there were not many at that time that could be of much use to a Christian minister. In those days the great business of the preacher was to bring forward the <i>grand facts</i> of Christianity, to prove these, and to show that all had happened according to the prediction of the prophets; and from these to show the work of God in the <i>heart</i>, and the evidence of that work in a <i>holy life</i>.</p>
<p>At present the truth of God is not only to be <i>proclaimed</i>, but defended; and many <i>customs</i> or <i>manners</i>, and <i>forms of speech</i>, which are to us obsolete, must be explained from the writings of the ancients, and particularly from the works of those who lived about the same times, or nearest to them, and in the same or contiguous <i>countries</i>. This will require the knowledge of those languages in which those works have been composed, the chief of which are <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>Greek</i>, the languages in which the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments have been originally written.</p>
<p><i>Latin</i> is certainly of the next consequence; a language in which some of the most <i>early comments</i> have been written; and it is worth the trouble of being learned, were it only for the sake of the works of <i>St. Jerome</i>, who translated and wrote a commentary on the whole of the Scriptures; though in many respects it is both erroneous and superficial.</p>
<p><i>Arabic</i> and <i>Syriac</i> may be added with great advantage: the <i>latter</i> being in effect the language in which <i>Christ</i> and his apostles spoke and preached in Judea; and the <i>former</i> being radically the same with the Hebrew, and preserving many of the <i>roots</i> of that language, the <i>derivatives</i> of which often occur in the Hebrew Bible, but the <i>roots</i> never.</p>
<p>The works of various scholars prove of how much consequence even the writings of heathen authors, chiefly those of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Italy</i>, are to the illustration of the sacred writings. And he who is best acquainted with the sacred records will avail himself of such helps, with gratitude both to God and man. Though so many languages and so much reading are not absolutely necessary to form a minister of the Gospel, (for there are many eminent ministers who have not such advantages,) yet they are <i>helps</i> of the first magnitude to those who have them and know how to use them.</p>
