<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Neglect not the gift that is in thee</b></i> — The word χαρισμα here must refer to the <i>gifts</i> and <i>graces</i> of the <i>Divine</i> <i>Spirit</i>, which Timothy received when set apart to the work of an evangelist by the imposition of <i>St. Paul's hands</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>, and by that of the <i>presbytery</i> or <i>eldership</i>; for it most evidently appears, from this verse and that above quoted, that he received this double <i>imposition</i>, not probably at <i>different</i> times, but on one and the same occasion. These very gifts and graces might be <i>improved</i>; and we have reason to believe, if not improved, would be withdrawn by the great Head of the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Given thee by prophecy</b></i> — It has already been conjectured (see the <i>preface</i>, and <i>see the note on Clarke "</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span><i>"</i>) that there had been some remarkable <i>prediction</i> relative to the future destiny and usefulness of Timothy. And probably it was in consequence of this that he was set apart to the office of evangelist and bishop in the Church at Ephesus. When apostles laid their hands on men, they ordinarily received the Holy Spirit with this imposition. This may be what the apostle calls to the remembrance of Timothy, and tells him not to neglect what he had received, nor the purpose for which he had received it.</p>
