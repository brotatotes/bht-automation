<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Meditate upon these things</b></i> — ταυτα μελετα. Revolve them frequently in thy mind; consider deeply their nature and importance; get them deeply fastened in thy heart, and let all thy conduct flow from this inward feeling and conviction. Let the nature, reasons, and motives of thy ministry, be ever in the view of thy heart and conscience.</p>
<p><i><b>Give thyself wholly to them</b></i> — εν τουτοις ισθι. <i>Be thou in</i> <i>these things</i>. Horace has a similar expression: <i>Omnis in hoc sum</i>. "I am absorbed in this." Occupy thyself wholly with them; make them not only thy <i>chief</i> but thy <i>sole</i> concern. Thou art called to save thy own soul, and the souls of them that hear thee; and God has given thee the Divine <i>gifts</i> for this and <i>no other purpose</i>. To this let all thy reading and study be directed; this is thy great business, and thou must perform it as the servant and steward of the Lord. <i>Bengel</i> has a good saying on this verse, which I will quote: In his qui est, <i>minus erit in sodalitatibus</i> <i>mundanis, in studiis alienis, in colligendis libris, conchis,</i> <i>nummis, quibus multi pastores notabilem aetatis partem</i> <i>insistentes conterunt</i>; "<i>He</i> who is <i>wholly in these things</i> will be <i>little</i> in worldly company, in foreign studies, in collecting books, shells, and coins, in which many ministers consume a principal part of their life." Such persons are worthy of the deepest reprehension, unless all these studies, collections, c., be formed with the <i>express view</i>, of illustrating the sacred records and to such awful drudgery few Christian ministers are called. Many, when they have made such collections, seem to know nothing of their use; they only <i>see</i> them and <i>show</i> them, but can never bring them to their assistance in the work of the ministry. <i>These should be prayed for and pitied</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>That thy profiting may appear to all.</b></i> — By being made a universal blessing; convincing and converting sinners; and building up the Church of God on its most holy faith.</p>
