<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:2">1 Timothy 4:2</span>. <i><b>Speaking lies in hypocrisy</b></i> — Persons pretending, not only to Divine inspiration, but also to extraordinary degrees of holiness, self-denial, mortification, c., in order to accredit the <i>lies</i> and false doctrines which they taught. Multitudes of lies were framed concerning miracles wrought by the <i>relics</i> of departed <i>saints</i>, as they were termed. For, even in this country, Thomas a Becket was, deemed a saint, his relics wrought numerous miracles and his tomb was frequented by multitudes of pilgrims! However, as he works none now, we may rest assured that he never did work any. In 1305, King Edward I. was prevailed on by his clergy to write to Pope Clement V. to <i>canonize</i> Thomas de Cantelupo, bishop of Hereford, because a multitude of miracles had been wrought by his influence; <i>In tantum</i>, says the king, <i>quod</i> <i>ipsius meritis et intercessionibus gloriosis, lumen caecis,</i> <i>surdis auditus, verbum mutis, et gressus claudis, et alia</i> <i>pleraque beneficia ipsius patrocinium implorantibus, caelesti</i> <i>dextra conferuntur</i>. "Insomuch that, by his glorious merits and intercessions, the blind receive their sight, the deaf hear, the dumb speak, and the lame walk; and many other benefits are conferred by the right hand of the Divine Being on those who implore his patronage." And therefore he prays that this dead bishop may be added to the calendar, "that he and his kingdom may enjoy his suffrages and merit his patronage in heaven, who had the benefit of his conversation on earth." <i>Nos attendentes, per</i> <i>Dei gratiam, fideles in Christo, nosque praecipue, et populum</i> <i>regni nostri, ejus posse suffragiis adjuvari, ut, quem familiarem</i> <i>habuimus in terris, mereamur habere patronum in caelis</i>.

<p><i><b>Having their conscience seared with a hot iron</b></i> — They bear the marks of their hypocrisy as evidently and as indelibly in their conscience in the sight of God, as those who have been <i>cauterized</i> for their crimes do in their bodies in the sight of men. It was customary in ancient times to mark those with a <i>hot iron</i> who had been guilty of great crimes, such as sacrilege, c. And the heathens supposed that even in the other world they bear such marks and by these the infernal judges knew the quantum of their vices, and appointed the degrees of their punishment. There is a saying much like that of the apostle in the invective of <i>Claudian</i> against <i>Rufinus</i>, whom he supposes to be thus addressed by Rhadamanthus, one of the infernal judges:- </p>
