<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>. <i><b>Forbidding to marry</b></i> — These hypocritical priests pretending that a single life was much more favourable to devotion, and to the perfection of the Christian life. This sentiment was held by the <i>Essenes</i>, a religious sect among the Jews; and we know that it is a favourite opinion among the Romanists, who oblige all their clergy to live a single life by a <i>vow of continency</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>To abstain from meats</b></i> — Both among the heathens, Jews, and Romanists, certain <i>meats</i> were prohibited; Some <i>always</i>, others at <i>particular times</i>. This the apostle informs us was directly contrary to the original design of God; and says that those <i>who</i> <i>know the truth</i>, know this.</p>
