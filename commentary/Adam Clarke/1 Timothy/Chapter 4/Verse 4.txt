<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:4">1 Timothy 4:4</span>. <i><b>For every creature of God</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>good</b></i> — That is: Every creature which God has made for man's nourishment is good for that purpose, and to be thankfully received whenever necessary for the support of human life; and <i>nothing</i> of that sort is at any time to be refused, ουδεν αποβλητον, <i>rejected</i> or <i>despised</i>. We find a saying very similar to this in <i>Lucian's Timon</i>: Ουτοι αποβλητα εισι δωρα τα παρα Διος. <i>The gifts which are from Jove</i> <i>ought not to be</i> DESPISED. This appears to have been a proverbial saying among the heathens.</p>
