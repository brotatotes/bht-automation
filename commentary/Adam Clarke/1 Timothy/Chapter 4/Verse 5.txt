Verse 1 Timothy 4:5. For it is sanctified by the word of God — δια λογου θεου. By the command of God; probably referring to Genesis 1:29: And God said, I have given you every herb-and every tree-to you it shall be for meat; and Genesis 9:3: Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things; i.e. I have given you every animal that is proper for food, as I have given you every herb and fruit proper for nourishment. Therefore, all this was sanctified, set apart, and appropriated to this use by this command. And when man is about to use it, he is to sanctify or set it apart to that use by prayer to God,1. That it may "answer the end to us for which it was designed;2. That we may use it with gratitude and moderation;3. That all the strength derived from it may be devoted to God, in filling up the duties of those situations in which his providence has placed us.Those who thank not God for their food, and pray not for his blessing in the use of it, are unworthy even of a morsel of bread, and of the breath they breathe. Bishop Newton's opinion of this prophecy I have reserved to the end of this chapter.
