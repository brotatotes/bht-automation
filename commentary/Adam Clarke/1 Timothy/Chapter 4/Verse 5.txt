<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:5">1 Timothy 4:5</span>. <i><b>For it is sanctified by the word of God</b></i> — δια λογου θεου. <i>By the command of God</i>; probably referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:29">Genesis 1:29</span>: <i>And God said, I have given you every herb-and every tree-to you it</i> <i>shall be for meat</i>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:3">Genesis 9:3</span>: <i>Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the</i> <i>green herb have I given you all things</i>; i.e. I have given you every animal that is proper for food, as I have given you every herb and fruit proper for nourishment. Therefore, all this was <i>sanctified, set apart</i>, and appropriated to this use by this command. And when man is about to use it, he is to <i>sanctify</i> or <i>set it apart</i> to that use by <i>prayer to God</i>,</p>
<p>1. That it may "answer the end to us for which it was designed;</p>
<p>2. That we may use it with gratitude and moderation;</p>
<p>3. That all the strength derived from it may be devoted to God, in filling up the duties of those situations in which his providence has placed us.</p>
<p>Those who thank not God for their food, and pray not for his blessing in the use of it, are unworthy even of a morsel of bread, and of the breath they breathe. Bishop Newton's opinion of this prophecy I have reserved to the end of this chapter.</p>
