<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:6">1 Timothy 4:6</span>. <i><b>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these</b></i><b> </b><i><b>things</b></i> — Show the Church that, even now, there is danger of this apostasy; put them on their guard against it; for the forewarned are half armed. Schoettgen supposes from this verse that what is spoken above refers to the <i>Jews</i> alone; and that there is no reference here to a Church which in after ages might apostatize from, or corrupt, the true doctrine of our Lord and Saviour. Bishop Newton and others are of a different opinion. See at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p><i><b>Nourished up in the words of faith</b></i> — By acting as I command thee, thou wilt show that thou art a good minister of Jesus Christ, and that thou hast been nourished from thy youth upon the doctrines of faith. The apostle seems to allude here to Timothy's Christian education. See the preface to this epistle.</p>
<p><i><b>Whereunto thou hast attained.</b></i> — Ἡ παρηκολουθηκας· Which thou hast <i>thoroughly understood</i>. For the meaning of this word, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>.</p>
