<p>Verse 7. <i><b>But refuse profane and old wives' fables</b></i> â€” This seems to refer particularly to the <i>Jews</i>, whose Talmudical writings are stuffed with the most ridiculous and profane fables that ever disgraced the human intellect. It may with equal propriety be applied to the <i>legends</i> of the Romish Church. Let any man read the <i>Aurea Legenda</i>, and he will find of profane and old wives' fables what may stand, with considerable propriety, column for column with the Talmud. See <i>Joseline's</i> Life of St. Patrick for miracles, without rhyme or reason, abundantly more numerous and more stupendous than all the <i>necessary</i> ones wrought by Jesus Christ and his apostles. This is enough to persuade a man that the Spirit of God had these very corruptions and this corrupt Church particularly in view.</p>
<p><i><b>Exercise thyself</b></i> rather <i>unto godliness.</i>] To understand this expression it is necessary to know that the apostle alludes here to the <i>gymnastic</i> exercises among the Greeks, which were intended as a <i>preparation</i> for, their contests at the public <i>games</i>. They did this in order to obtain a <i>corruptible</i> or <i>fading crown</i>, i. e, a chaplet of leaves, which was the reward of those who conquered in those games; Timothy was to exercise himself unto godliness, that he might be prepared for the kingdom of heaven, and there receive a crown that <i>fadeth not away</i>.
