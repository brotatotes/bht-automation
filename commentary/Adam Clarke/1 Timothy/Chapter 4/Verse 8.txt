<p>Verse 8. <i><b>For bodily exercise profiteth little</b></i> — Προς ολιγον εστιν ωφελιμος. Those gymnastic exercises, so highly esteemed among the Greeks, are but <i>little worth</i>; they are but of <i>short</i> <i>duration</i>; they refer only to <i>this life</i>, and to the applause of men: but godliness has the promise of this life, and the life to come; it is profitable for all things; and for both time and eternity.</p>
<p><i><b>But godliness is profitable unto all things</b></i> — By <i>godliness</i> we are to understand every thing that the Christian religion either <i>promises</i> or <i>prescribes</i>: the <i>life of God in the soul of man</i>; and the <i>glory of God</i> as the <i>object</i> and <i>end</i> of that <i>life</i>. To receive the first, a man must renounce his sins, deny himself, take up his cross, and follow his Lord through evil and through good report. To obtain the latter, a man must <i>labour</i> to enter into that rest which remains for the people of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Having promise, of the life that now is</b></i> — The man that fears, loves, and serves God, has God's blessing all through life. His religion saves him from all those <i>excesses</i>, both in <i>action</i> and <i>passion</i>, which sap the foundations of life, and render existence itself often a burden. The peace and love of God in the heart produces a <i>serenity</i> and <i>calm</i> which cause the lamp of life to burn clear, strong, and permanent. Evil and disorderly passions obscure and stifle the vital spark. Every truly religious man extracts the uttermost good out of life itself, and through the Divine blessing gets the uttermost good that is in life; and, what is better than all, acquires a full preparation here below for an eternal life of glory above. Thus godliness has the promise of, and secures the blessings of, both worlds.</p>
