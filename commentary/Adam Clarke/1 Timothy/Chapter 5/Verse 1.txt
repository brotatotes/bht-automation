<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:1">1 Timothy 5:1</span>. <i><b>Rebuke not an elder</b></i> — That is, an elderly person; for the word πρεσβυτερος is here taken in its natural sense, and signifies one advanced in years. At <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>, it is taken in what may be termed its ecclesiastical meaning, and signifies, an <i>officer</i> in the Church, what we commonly call a <i>presbyter</i> or <i>bishop</i>; for sometimes these terms were confounded. There are but few cases in which it at all becomes a young man to reprove an old man, and especially one who is a father in the Church. If such a one does wrong, or gets out of the way, he should be <i>entreated</i> as a father, with great caution and respect. To this at least his age entitles him. The word επιπληξης signifies, do not <i>smite</i>; i.e. do not treat them <i>harshly</i>, nor with <i>magisterial</i> <i>austerity</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The younger men as brethren</b></i> — Showing humility, and arrogating nothing to thyself on account of thy office. Feel for them as thou oughtest to feel for thy own brethren.</p>
