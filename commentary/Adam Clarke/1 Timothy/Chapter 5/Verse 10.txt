<p>Verse 10. <i><b>Well reported of for good works</b></i> — Numbers being able to <i>bear testimony</i>, as the word implies, that she has not only avoided all sin, but that she has walked according to the testimony of God.</p>
<p><i><b>Brought up children</b></i> — It was customary among the Gentiles to expose their children, when so poor that they were not able to provide for them. Pious and humane people took these up; and fed, clothed, and educated them. The words <i>brought up</i> may refer to the children of <i>others</i>, who were educated in the Christian faith by pious Christian women.</p>
<p><i><b>Lodged strangers</b></i> — If she have been given to hospitality, freely contributing to the necessitous, when she had it in her power.</p>
<p><i><b>Washed the saints' feet</b></i> — This was an office of humanity shown to all strangers and travellers in the eastern countries, who, either walking <i>barefoot</i>, or having only a sort of <i>sole</i> to defend the foot, needed washing when they came to their journey's end. Pious women generally did this act of kindness.</p>
<p><i><b>Relieved the afflicted</b></i> — Visited and ministered to the sick.</p>
<p><i><b>Diligently followed every good work</b></i> — In a word, if she have been <i>altogether a Christian</i>, living according to the precepts of the Gospel, and doing the Lord's work with all her heart, soul, and strength.</p>
<p>From the character given here of the <i>widow indeed</i>, it may be doubted whether χηρα, <i>widow</i>, was not in some cases the name of an <i>office</i>, which name it might have from being ordinarily filled by <i>widows</i>. It can hardly be supposed that any widow, unless she had considerable property, could have done the things enumerated in this verse, some of which would occasion no small expense. The <i>widow indeed</i> may mean a person who was to be employed in some office in the Church; and Timothy is enjoined not to take any into that office unless she had been before remarkable for piety and humanity. Some think that the widows of whom the apostle speaks had been <i>deaconesses</i>, and wished now to be taken on what might be termed the <i>superannuated list</i>; and the apostle lays down <i>rules</i> for the admission of such, the sum of which is: Let none come on this superannuated list unless she be at least sixty years of age, and can bring proof of her having conscientiously discharged the office and duty of a <i>deaconess</i>.</p>
