<p>Verse 11. <i><b>But the younger widows refuse</b></i> — Do not admit those into this office who are under sixty years of age. Probably those who were received into such a list <i>promised</i> to <i>abide</i> in their <i>widowhood</i>. But as young or comparatively young women might have both occasion and temptations to remarry, and so break their engagement to Christ, they should not be admitted. Not that the apostle condemns their remarrying as a crime in itself, but because it was contrary to their engagement.

<p><i><b>Wax wanton</b></i> — καταστρηνιασωσι. From κατα, intensive, and στρηνιαω, to act in a luxurious or wanton manner. The word is supposed to be derived from στερειν, <i>to remove</i>, and ηνια, <i>the</i> <i>rein</i>; and is a metaphor taken from a pampered horse, from whose mouth the rein has been removed, so that there is nothing to check or confine him. The metaphor is plain enough, and the application easy.</p>
