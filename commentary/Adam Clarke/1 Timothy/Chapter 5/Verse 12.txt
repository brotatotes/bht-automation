<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Having damnation</b></i> — In the sense in which we use this word I am satisfied the apostle never intended it. It is likely that he refers here to some promise or engagement which they made when taken on the list already mentioned, and now they have the <i>guilt</i> of having violated that promise; this is the κριμα, or condemnation, of which the apostle speaks.</p>
<p><i><b>They have cast off their first faith.</b></i> — By pledging their <i>fidelity</i> to a husband they have cast off their <i>fidelity</i> to Christ, as a married life and their previous engagement are incompatible. Dr. <i>Macknight</i> translates these two verses thus: But the younger widows <i>reject</i>, for when they <i>cannot endure</i> <i>Christ's rein</i>, they will marry; <i>incurring condemnation</i>, because they have <i>put away</i> their first <i>fidelity</i>.</p>
