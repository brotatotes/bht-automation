<p>Verse 13. <i><b>And withal they learn</b></i><b> to be </b><i><b>idle</b></i> — They do not love work, and they will not work.</p>
<p><i><b>Wandering about from house to house</b></i> — Gadding, gossiping; never contented with home; always visiting.</p>
<p><i><b>And not only idle</b></i> — If it went no farther, this would be intolerable; but they are <i>tattlers</i>-tale-bearers; whisperers; light, trifling persons; all noise and no work.</p>
<p><i><b>Busybodies</b></i> — Persons who meddle with the concerns of others; who mind every one's business but their own.</p>
<p><i><b>Speaking things which they ought not.</b></i> — Lies, slanders, calumnies; backbiting their neighbours, and everywhere sowing the seed of dissension.</p>
