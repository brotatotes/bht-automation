<p>Verse 14. <i><b>I will therefore that the younger women marry</b></i> — As the preceding discourse has been about the younger widows, and this is an inference from it; it is most evident that by the <i>younger women</i> the apostle means the young <i>widows</i>. These he considers unfit for the office of the female <i>diaconate</i>, and therefore wills them to marry, educate children, and give themselves wholly up to <i>domestic affairs</i>. Here the apostle, so far from forbidding <i>second</i> marriages, positively enjoins or at least recommends them. And what man of sense could have done otherwise in the cases he mentions? It is no sin in any case to marry, bear children, and take care of a family; but it is a sin in every case to be idle persons, gadders about, tattlers, busybodies, sifting out and detailing family secrets, c., &amp;c. The good sentiment, put by an able poet and pious divine into the mouths of <i>little children</i>, cannot be ill applied to multitudes of women, mothers, and grandmothers: - </p>
