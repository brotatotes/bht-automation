<p>Verse 16. <i><b>If any man or woman that believeth</b></i> — If any <i>Christian man</i> or <i>woman</i> have poor <i>widows</i>, which are their relatives, <i>let them relieve them </i>- provide them with the necessaries of life, and not <i>burden the Church</i> with their maintenance, that the funds may be spared for the support of those <i>widows</i> who were employed in its service, teaching children, visiting the sick, c., c. For the performing of such offices it is very likely that none but <i>widows</i> were employed and these were chosen, other things being equal, out of the most indigent of the widows, and therefore called by the apostle, here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:3">1 Timothy 5:3</span>, αἱς οντως χηραι, <i>widows indeed</i>-widows desolate, without support, and without relatives. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>.</p>
