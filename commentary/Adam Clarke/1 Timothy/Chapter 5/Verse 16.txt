Verse 16. If any man or woman that believeth — If any Christian man or woman have poor widows, which are their relatives, let them relieve them - provide them with the necessaries of life, and not burden the Church with their maintenance, that the funds may be spared for the support of those widows who were employed in its service, teaching children, visiting the sick, c., c. For the performing of such offices it is very likely that none but widows were employed and these were chosen, other things being equal, out of the most indigent of the widows, and therefore called by the apostle, here and in 1 Timothy 5:3, αἱς οντως χηραι, widows indeed-widows desolate, without support, and without relatives. See note on 1 Timothy 5:10.
