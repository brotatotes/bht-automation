Verse 17. Let the elders that rule well — Elder is probably here the name of an ecclesiastical officer, similar to what we now term presbyter. See note on 1 Timothy 5:1. Dr. Macknight has remarked that, "in the first age, the name πρεσβυτερος, elder, was given to all who exercised any sacred office in the Church, as is plain from Acts 20:28, where the persons are called επισκοποι, bishops, who, Acts 20:17, were called πρεσβυτεροι, elders. The same thing appears from Titus 1:5, where those are called elders who, Titus 1:7, are named bishops; and from 1 Timothy 4:14, where, collectively, all who held sacred offices in Lystra are called πρεσβυτεριον, the presbytery or eldership, and are said to have concurred with St. Paul in setting Timothy apart to the ministry."Double honour — Διπλης τιμης.

Some think this refers to distinct ecclesiastical orders but these technical distinctions were, in my opinion, a work of later times.
