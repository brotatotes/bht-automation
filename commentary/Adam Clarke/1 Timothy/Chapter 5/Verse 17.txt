<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Let the elders that rule well</b></i> — Elder is probably here the name of an ecclesiastical officer, similar to what we now term <i>presbyter</i>. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:1">1 Timothy 5:1</span>. Dr. <i>Macknight</i> has remarked that, "in the first age, the name πρεσβυτερος, <i>elder</i>, was given to all who exercised any sacred office in the Church, as is plain from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>, where the persons are called επισκοποι, <i>bishops</i>, who, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>, were called πρεσβυτεροι, <i>elders</i>. The same thing appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>, where those are called <i>elders</i> who, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>, are named <i>bishops</i>; and from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>, where, collectively, all who held sacred offices in Lystra are called πρεσβυτεριον, the <i>presbytery</i> or <i>eldership</i>, and are said to have concurred with St. Paul in setting Timothy apart to the ministry."</p>
<p><i><b>Double honour</b></i> — Διπλης τιμης. Almost every critic of note allows that τιμη here signifies <i>reward, stipend, wages</i>. Let him have a double or a larger salary who rules well; and why? Because in the discharge of his office he must be at expense, in proportion to his diligence, in visiting and relieving the sick, in lodging and providing for strangers; in a word, in his being given to <i>hospitality</i>, which was required of every bishop or presbyter.</p>
<p><i><b>Especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</b></i> — Those who not only preach publicly, but instruct privately, catechize, c. Some think this refers to distinct ecclesiastical <i>orders</i> but these technical distinctions were, in my opinion, a work of later times.</p>
