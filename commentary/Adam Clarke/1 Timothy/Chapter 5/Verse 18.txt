<p>Verse 18. <i><b>The Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox</b></i> — This is a manifest proof that by τιμη, <i>honour</i>, in the preceding verse, the apostle means <i>salary</i> or <i>wages</i>: "Let the elders that rule well be accounted worthy of double honour," a <i>larger salary</i> than any of the <i>official widows</i> mentioned before, for "the labourer is worthy of his hire." The maintenance of every man in the Church should be in proportion to his own labour, and the necessities of his family. He that does <i>no work</i> should have <i>no</i> <i>wages</i>. In the Church of Christ there never can be a <i>sinecure</i>. <i>They who minister at the altar</i> should <i>live by the altar</i>; the <i>ox</i> <i>that treadeth out the corn should not be muzzled; the labourer is</i> <i>worthy of his hire</i>: but the altar should not support him who <i>does</i> <i>not minister</i> at it; if the ox <i>won't tread out the corn</i>, let him go to the <i>common</i> or be <i>muzzled</i>; if the <i>man will not labour</i>, let him have <i>no hire</i>.</p>
