<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Against an elder</b></i> â€” Be very cautious of receiving evil reports against those whose business it is to preach to others, and correct their vices. Do not consider an elder as guilty of any alleged crime, unless it be <i>proved</i> by <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> witnesses. This the law of Moses required in respect to all. Among the Romans, a <i>plebeian</i> might be condemned on the deposition of <i>one</i> credible witness; but it required <i>two</i> to convict a <i>senator</i>. The reason of this difference is evident: those whose business it is to correct others will usually have many enemies; great caution, therefore, should be used in admitting accusations against such persons.</p>
