<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:2">1 Timothy 5:2</span>. <i><b>The elder women as mothers</b></i> — Treating them with the respect due to their age.</p>
<p><i><b>The younger as sisters</b></i> — Feel for every member of the Church, old and young, male and female; consider them as fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters; treat them all with gentleness; and labour to keep them in, not to expel them from, the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>With all purity.</b></i> — εν παση αγνεια. With all chastity. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>.</p>
<p>There are some who seem to take a barbarous pleasure in expelling members from, the Church. They should be continued in as long as possible; while they are <i>in the Church</i>-under its ordinances and discipline, there is some hope that their errors may be corrected; but when once driven out again into the world, that hope must necessarily become extinct. As <i>judgment</i> is God's strange work, so <i>excommunication</i> should be the strange, the last, and the most reluctantly performed work of every Christian minister.</p>
