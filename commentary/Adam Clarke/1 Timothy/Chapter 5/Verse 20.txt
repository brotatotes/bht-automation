<p>Verse 20. <i><b>Them that sin rebuke before all</b></i> — That is, before the members of the Church; which was the custom of the Jews in their synagogues. But, if the words refer to the elders alone, then the transgressing elder is to be reproved before his fellows, and be tried by them.</p>
<p><i><b>That others also may fear.</b></i> — This is the grand object of Church censures, to reclaim the transgressors, and to give warning to others.</p>
