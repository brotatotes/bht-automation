<p>Verse 21. <i><b>I charge</b></i><b> thee </b><i><b>before God</b></i> — The apostle would have Timothy to consider that all he did should be done as in the sight of God, the Father of the spirits of all flesh; in the sight of Christ, the Saviour of sinners, who purchased the Church with his own blood; and in the sight of the most holy, approved, and eminent angels, whose office it was to minister to the heirs of salvation. The word εκλεκτοι, <i>elect</i>, applied to the angels here, is supposed to distinguish those who <i>stood</i>, when others fell from their first estate. The former were <i>elect</i>, or <i>approved</i>; the latter <i>reprobate</i>, or <i>disapproved</i>. This is not an unfrequent sense of the word εκλεκτος, <i>elect</i>. Perhaps there is nothing else meant than the angels that are chosen out from among others, by the Lord himself, to be ministering servants to the Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Without preferring one before another</b></i> — χωρις προκριματος. <i>Without prejudice</i>. Promote no man's cause; make not up thy mind on any case, till thou hast weighed both sides, and heard both parties, with their respective witnesses; and then act <i>impartially</i>, as the matter may appear to be <i>proved</i>. Do not treat any man, in religious matters, according to the rank he holds in life, or according to any personal attachment thou mayest have for him. Every man should be dealt with in the Church as he will be dealt with at the judgment-seat of Christ. A minister of the Gospel, who, in the exercise of discipline in the Church, is swayed and warped by <i>secular</i> considerations, will be a curse rather than a blessing to the people of God. Accepting the persons of the rich, in ecclesiastical matters, has been a source of corruption in Christianity. With some ministers the <i>show</i> of piety in a <i>rich</i> man goes farther than the <i>soundest Christian</i> <i>experience</i> in the <i>poor</i>. What account can such persons give of their stewardship?</p>
