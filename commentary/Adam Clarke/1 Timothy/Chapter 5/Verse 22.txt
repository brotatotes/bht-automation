<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Lay hands suddenly on no man</b></i> — Do not hastily appoint any person to the sacred ministry: let the person be well proved before he receives the <i>imposition of hands</i>. Some understand this of laying hands on the sick.</p>
<p><i><b>Neither be partaker of other men's sins</b></i> — It is a sin for any improper person to <i>thrust himself</i> into the sacred office; and he partakes of that sin who introduces, helps him forward, or sanctions him in it. O, what an account will rash, undiscerning, and prejudiced bishops, presbyters, and others, have to render to God for their <i>ordinations</i>! Their laying rash or careless hands "on skulls that cannot teach, and will not learn;" while probably they refuse inducting others well qualified for the Christian ministry.</p>
<p><i><b>Keep thyself pure.</b></i> — From this and every other evil.</p>
