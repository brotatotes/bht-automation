<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:25">1 Timothy 5:25</span>. <i><b>Likewise also the good works</b></i> of some] Though those who are very holy and very useful in the Church cannot be unknown, yet there are others not less holy who need to be brought forward; who do much good in private; and their character and good works are not fully known till after diligent inquiry. These are they who do not let their left hand know what their right doeth.</p>
<p>1. AFTER so long and minute an examination of the subjects in this chapter, little remains to be said in the way of farther and more satisfactory explanation. The whole account concerning the <i>widows, who</i> they were, and <i>what</i> their <i>provision</i>, and what their <i>occupation</i>, and <i>how supported</i>, are to me questions of considerable difficulty. In the notes I have given the best account of the different subjects in my power. If the reader be satisfied and edified, I have gained my end.</p>
<p>2. On the subject of the <i>imposition of hands</i>, or what is vulgarly but improperly called <i>ordination</i>, I have not said much here, having given my views of the subject elsewhere in these notes. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</span>, c. I must again state my conviction that what is said on this subject in this chapter, and indeed in the epistle, is rather to be understood <i>prophetically</i> and to have been intended for a much lower age of the Christian Church. That any person should, from <i>impure</i> or <i>secular motives</i>, desire to be appointed to the ministerial office at such a time, when poverty and persecution were the least they would reasonably expect, to me seems altogether inexplicable. But that many, after the Church got <i>accredited</i> and <i>established</i>, and an ample <i>revenue</i> appointed for its ministers by emperors and kings, should wish to get into the priesthood for its emoluments, is a melancholy truth, which every year's experience testifies. To those who have the authority from the state to appoint ministers for the Church, this chapter reads a solemn and awful lesson. And not to them only, but to all who have the appointment of ministers or preachers in every sect and party. How few are there who would kindle a fire on God's altar were there not <i>secular emoluments</i> attending it! I am afraid the Scottish poet spoke the truth who said: -</p>

<p><i>Gold</i> or <i>money</i> is the <i>primum mobile</i> through every department of life. <i>Proh dolor</i>!</p>
