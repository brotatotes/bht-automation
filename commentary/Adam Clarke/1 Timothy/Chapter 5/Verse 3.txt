Verse 1 Timothy 5:3. Honour widows that are widows indeed. — One meaning of the word τιμαω, to honour, is to support, sustain, c., Matthew 15:4-5; and here it is most obviously to be taken in this sense. Provide for those widows especially which are widows indeed-persons truly destitute, being aged and helpless, and having neither children nor friends to take care of them, and who behave as becometh their destitute state. But see the note on 1 Timothy 5:10.
