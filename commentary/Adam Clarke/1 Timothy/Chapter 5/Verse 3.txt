<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:3">1 Timothy 5:3</span>. <i><b>Honour widows that are widows indeed.</b></i> — One meaning of the word τιμαω, to <i>honour</i>, is to <i>support, sustain, c.</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:4-5">Matthew 15:4-5</span>; and here it is most obviously to be taken in this sense. Provide for those widows especially which are <i>widows</i> <i>indeed</i>-persons <i>truly destitute</i>, being aged and helpless, and having neither <i>children</i> nor <i>friends</i> to take care of them, and who behave as becometh their destitute state. But see the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>.</p>
