<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:4">1 Timothy 5:4</span>. <i><b>But if any widow have children or nephews</b></i> — This shows that <i>widows indeed</i> are those that have <i>neither</i> children nor nephews, i.e. no relatives that either will or can help them, or no near relatives alive.</p>
<p><i><b>Let them learn first to show piety at home</b></i> — Let these children and nephews provide for their aged or helpless parents or relatives, and not burden the Church with them while they are able to support them.</p>
<p><i><b>And to requite their parents</b></i> — Και αμοιβας αποδιδοναι τοις προγονοις· Let them learn to <i>give benefit for benefit</i>. Your parents supported and nourished you when you were young and helpless; <i>you</i> ought therefore to support <i>them</i> when they are old and destitute. This is called <i>showing piety</i>; and there is doubtless an allusion to the fifth commandment: <i>Honour thy father</i> <i>and thy mother</i>-provide for them in their old age and afflictions; God commands this.</p>
