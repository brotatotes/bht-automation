<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:6">1 Timothy 5:6</span>. <i><b>But she that liveth in pleasure</b></i> — Ἡ δε σπαταλωσα· <i>She that liveth delicately-voluptuously</i> indulging herself with dainties; it does not indicate <i>grossly criminal pleasures</i>; but simply means one who indulges herself in <i>good eating and</i> <i>drinking</i>, pampering her body at the expense of her mind. The word is used in reference to what we term <i>petted</i> and <i>spoiled</i> children; and a remarkable passage, is produced by Kypke, from an epistle of <i>Theanus</i> to <i>Eubulus</i>, found in <i>Opusc. Myth</i>. Galaei, page 741, where he says: "What can be done with that boy, who, if he have not food when and as he pleases, bursts out into weeping; and, if he eats, must have dainties and sweetmeats? If the weather be hot he complains of fatigue; if it be cold, he trembles; if he be reproved, he scolds; if every thing be not provided for him according to his wish, he is enraged. If he eats not, he breaks out into fits of anger. He basely indulges himself in pleasure; and in every respect acts voluptuously and effeminately. Knowing then, O friend, ὁτι τα σπαταλωντα των παιδιων, ὁταν ακμασῃ προς ανδρας, ανδραποδα γινεται, τας τοιαυτας ἡδονας αφαιρει· that boys living thus <i>voluptuously</i>, when they grow up are wont to become <i>slaves</i>; take away, therefore, such pleasures from them." I have introduced this long quotation, the better to fix the meaning of the apostle, and to show that the <i>life of pleasure</i> mentioned here does not mean <i>prostitution</i> or <i>uncleanness</i> of any kind, though such a life may naturally lead to dissolute manners.</p>
<p><i><b>Is dead while she liveth.</b></i> — No purpose of life is answered by the existence of such a person. <i>Seneca</i>, in <i>Epist</i>. 60, says of pleasure-takers, and those who live a voluptuous life: <i>Hos itaque</i> <i>animalium loco numeremus, non hominum: quosdam vero ne animalium</i> <i>quidem, sed mortuorum-mortem antecesserunt</i>. "We rank such persons with brutes, not with men; and some of them not even with brutes, but with dead carcasses. They anticipate their own death." Such persons are, as the apostle says elsewhere, <i>dead in</i> <i>trespasses, and dead in sins</i>.</p>
