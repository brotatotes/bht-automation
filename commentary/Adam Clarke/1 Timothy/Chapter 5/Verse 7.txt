<p>Verse 7. <i><b>That they may be blameless.</b></i> — Charge the whole <i>Church</i> to attend to these things, that <i>they</i> may be blameless. The words are not spoken of the widows only, but of the Church or its officers; it cannot be restricted to the <i>widows</i>, for the adjective ανεπιληπτοι is both of the <i>masculine</i> and feminine gender.</p>
