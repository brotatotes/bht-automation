Verse 8. But if any provide not for his own — His own people or relatives.Those of his own house — That is, his own family, or a poor widow or relative that lives under his roof.Hath denied the faith — The Christian religion, which strongly inculcates love and benevolence to all mankind.Is worse than an infidel. — For what are called the dictates of nature lead men to feel for and provide for their own families. Heathen writers are full of maxims of this kind; TACITUS says: Liberos cuique ac propinquos NATURA carissimos esse voluit. "Nature dictates that to every one his own children and relatives should be most dear." And Cicero, in Epist. ad Caption: Suos quisque debet tueri. "Every man should take care of his own family."
