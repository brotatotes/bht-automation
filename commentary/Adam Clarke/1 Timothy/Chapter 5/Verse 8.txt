<p>Verse 8. <i><b>But if any provide not for his own</b></i> — His own <i>people</i> or <i>relatives</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Those of his own house</b></i> — That is, his own family, or a poor widow or relative that lives under his roof.</p>
<p><i><b>Hath denied the faith</b></i> — The Christian religion, which strongly inculcates love and benevolence to all mankind.</p>
<p><i><b>Is worse than an infidel.</b></i> — For what are called the <i>dictates of</i> <i>nature</i> lead men to feel for and provide for their own families. Heathen writers are full of maxims of this kind; TACITUS says: <i>Liberos cuique ac propinquos</i> NATURA <i>carissimos esse voluit</i>. "Nature dictates that to every one his own children and relatives should be most dear." And Cicero, in Epist. ad Caption: <i>Suos</i> <i>quisque debet tueri</i>. "Every man should take care of his own family."</p>
