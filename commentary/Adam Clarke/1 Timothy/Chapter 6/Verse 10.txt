<p>Verse 10. <i><b>The love of money is the root of all evil</b></i> — Perhaps it would be better to translate παντωντωνκακων, <i>of all these</i> <i>evils</i>; i.e. the evils enumerated above; for it cannot be true that the love of money is the root of <i>all evil</i>, it certainly was not the root whence the transgression of Adam sprang, but it is the root whence all the evils mentioned in the preceding verse spring. This text has been often very incautiously quoted; for how often do we hear," The Scripture says, <i>Money is the root of</i> <i>all evil</i>!" No, the Scripture says no such thing. <i>Money</i> is the root of <i>no</i> evil, nor is it an evil of any kind; but the <i>love</i> of it is the root of all the evils mentioned here.</p>
<p><i><b>While some coveted after</b></i> — ορεγομενοι. Insatiably desiring.</p>
<p><i><b>Have erred from the faith</b></i> — απεπλανηθησαν. Have <i>totally</i> <i>erred</i>-have made a most fatal and ruinous departure from the religion of Christ.</p>
<p><i><b>And pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</b></i> — The word περιεπειραν signifies to be <i>transfixed in every part</i>; and is an allusion to one of those <i>snares</i>, παγιδα, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9">1 Timothy 6:9</span>, where a hole is dug in the earth, and filled full of sharp stakes, and, being slightly covered over with turf, is not perceived; and whatever steps on it falls in, and is <i>pierced through and through</i> <i>with</i> these <i>sharp stakes</i>, the οδυναις πολλαις, the <i>many</i> <i>torments</i>, mentioned by the apostle. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9">1 Timothy 6:9</span>.</p>
