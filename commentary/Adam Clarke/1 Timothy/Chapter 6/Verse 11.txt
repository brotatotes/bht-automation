Verse 11. But thou, O man of God — Thou, who hast taken God for thy portion, and art seeking a city that hath foundations, whose builder is the living God, flee these things. Escape for thy life. Even thou art not out of the reach of the love of money. How many of the ministers of religion have been ruined by this! And how much has religion itself suffered by their love of money!Follow after righteousness — Justice and uprightness in all thy dealings with men. Godliness-a thorough conformity to the image of God and mind of Christ. Faith in Jesus, and in all that he has spoken; and fidelity to the talents thou hast received, and the office with which thou art intrusted.Love — To God and all mankind. Patience in all trials and afflictions.Meekness. — Bearing up with an even mind under all adversities and contradictions.
