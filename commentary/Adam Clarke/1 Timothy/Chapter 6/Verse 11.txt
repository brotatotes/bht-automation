<p>Verse 11. <i><b>But thou, O man of God</b></i> — Thou, who hast taken God for thy portion, and art seeking a city that hath foundations, whose builder is the living God, <i>flee these things</i>. Escape for thy life. Even <i>thou</i> art not out of the reach of the <i>love of</i> <i>money</i>. How many of the ministers of religion have been ruined by this! And how much has religion itself suffered by <i>their</i> love of money!</p>
<p><i><b>Follow after righteousness</b></i> — Justice and uprightness in all thy dealings with men. <i>Godliness</i>-a thorough conformity to the image of God and mind of Christ. <i>Faith</i> in Jesus, and in all that he has spoken; and <i>fidelity</i> to the talents thou hast received, and the office with which thou art intrusted.</p>
<p><i><b>Love</b></i> — To God and all mankind. <i>Patience</i> in all trials and afflictions.</p>
<p><i><b>Meekness.</b></i> — Bearing up with an <i>even mind</i> under all adversities and contradictions.</p>
