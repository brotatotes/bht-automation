<p>Verse 12. <i><b>Fight the good fight of faith</b></i> — "Agonize the good agony." Thou hast a <i>contest</i> to sustain in which thy honour, thy life, thy soul, are at stake. Live the Gospel, and defend the cause of God. Unmask hypocrites, expel the profligate, purge and build up the Church, live in the spirit of thy religion, and give thyself wholly to this work.</p>
<p><i><b>Lay hold on eternal life</b></i> — All this is in allusion to the exercises in the public Grecian games: Fight, conquer, and seize upon the prize; carry off the crown of eternal life!</p>
<p><i><b>Whereunto thou art also called</b></i> — The allusion to the public games is still carried on: Thou hast been <i>called</i> into this palaestra; thou hast been <i>accepted</i> as one proper to enter the lists with any antagonists that may offer; in the <i>presence of</i> <i>many witnesses</i> thou hast taken the necessary <i>engagements</i> upon thee, and submitted to be governed by the laws of the <i>stadium</i>; many eyes are upon thee, to see whether thou wilt fight manfully, and be faithful. Timothy's faith was undoubtedly tried by severe persecution. In <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:23">Hebrews 13:23</span>, it is said: <i>Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty</i>. Hence it appears that he was <i>imprisoned</i> for the testimony of Christ, and perhaps it was <i>then</i>, more than at his <i>ordination</i>, that he made the <i>good confession</i> here mentioned. He risked his life and conquered. If not a <i>martyr</i>, he was a <i>confessor</i>.</p>
