<p>Verse 13. <i><b>I give thee charge</b></i> — This is similar to that in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:21">1 Timothy 5:21</span> of the preceding chapter, where see the note.</p>
<p><i><b>Who quickeneth all things</b></i> — God, who is the fountain of life, and who is the resurrection; and who will raise thee up at the last day to a life of ineffable glory, if thou be faithful unto death. And should thy life fall a sacrifice to the performance of thy duty, all will be safe; for thy life is hid with Christ in God, and when he who is thy life shall appear, then shalt thou also appear with him in glory! Thy kingdom is not of this world; remember that this good confession was made by thy Master before Pilate. Keep disentangled from all earthly things, live to and for God, and all will be well.</p>
<p><i><b>A good confession</b></i> — The confession made by Christ before Pontius Pilate is, that <i>he was Messiah the King</i>; but that <i>his</i> <i>kingdom was not of this world</i>; and <i>that hereafter he should be</i> <i>seen coming in the clouds of heaven to judge the quick and dead</i>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:36-37">John 18:36-37</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:61-62">Mark 14:61-62</span>.</p>
