<p>Verse 14. <i><b>That thou keep</b></i><b> this </b><i><b>commandment without spot</b></i> — <i>Two</i> things are mentioned here: </p>
<p>1. That the <i>commandment</i> itself - the whole <i>doctrine of Christ</i>, should be kept <i>entire</i>. </p>
<p>2. That his <i>life</i> should be agreeable to that doctrine. Keep it <i>without</i> <i>spot </i>- let there be no <i>blot</i> on the sacred book; <i>add</i> nothing to it; <i>take</i> nothing <i>from it; change</i> nothing <i>in</i> it. Deliver down to thy successors the truth as thou hast had it from God himself.</p>
<p><i><b>Unrebukable</b></i> — Let there be nothing in thy <i>conduct</i> or <i>spirit</i> contrary to this truth. Keep the truth, and the truth will keep thee.</p>
<p><i><b>Until the appearing of our Lord</b></i> — Hand it down pure, and let thy conduct be a comment on it, that it may continue in the world and in the Church till the coming of Christ.</p>
