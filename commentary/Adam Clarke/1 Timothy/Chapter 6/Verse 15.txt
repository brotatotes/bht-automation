Verse 15. Which in his times he shall show — Jesus will appear in the most proper time; the time which the infinite God in his wisdom has appointed for the second coming of his Son.The blessed and only Potentate — δυναστης, Potentate, is applied to secular governors; but none of these can be styled ὁ μακαριος και μονος, the happy and only One; ὁ Βασιλευς των βασιλευοντων, the King of kings, or the King over all kings; and Κυριος των κυριευοντων, the Lord over all lords or rulers. These are titles which could not be given to any mortals. This is made more specific by the verse following.Ver. 15. Ὁ μακαριος και μονος Δυναστης, ὁ Βασιλευς των βασιλευοντων, και Κυριος των κυριευοντων.The supreme Being is also styled the King of kings, and the Blessed, by AESCHYLUS in his tragedy of the Supplicants:-  Αναξ ανακτων, μακαρων Μακαρτατε, και τελεων Τελειοτατον κρατος. Ver 520. Ed. Porson.  "O King of kings! most Blessed of the blessed! most Perfect of the perfect!"
