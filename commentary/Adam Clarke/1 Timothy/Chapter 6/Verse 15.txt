<p>Verse 15. <i><b>Which in his times he shall show</b></i> — Jesus will appear in the <i>most proper time</i>; the time which the infinite God in his wisdom has appointed for the second coming of his Son.</p>
<p><i><b>The blessed and only Potentate</b></i> — δυναστης, <i>Potentate</i>, is applied to <i>secular governors</i>; but none of these can be styled ὁ μακαριος και μονος, the <i>happy and only One</i>; ὁ Βασιλευς των βασιλευοντων, <i>the King of kings</i>, or <i>the King over all kings</i>; and Κυριος των κυριευοντων, <i>the Lord over all lords</i> or <i>rulers</i>. These are titles which could not be given to any mortals. This is made more specific by the verse following.</p>
<p>Ver. 15. Ὁ μακαριος και μονος Δυναστης, ὁ Βασιλευς των βασιλευοντων, και Κυριος των κυριευοντων.</p>
<p>The supreme Being is also styled the King of kings, and the Blessed, by AESCHYLUS in his tragedy of the <i>Supplicants</i>:- </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Μακαρτατε, και τελεων</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.9em; "> Τελειοτατον κρατος.</p>

<p>"O King of kings! most Blessed of the blessed! most Perfect of the perfect!"</p>
