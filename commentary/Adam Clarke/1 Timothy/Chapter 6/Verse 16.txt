<p>Verse 16. <i><b>Who only hath immortality</b></i> — All beings that are not <i>eternal</i> must be <i>mutable</i>; but there can be only <i>one eternal</i> Being, that is God; and he only can have <i>immortality</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto</b></i> — All this is said by the apostle in three words φως οικων απροσιτον, <i>inhabiting unapproachable light</i>. Such is the excessive glory of God, that neither angel nor man can approach it. It is indeed equally unapproachable to all created beings.</p>
<p><i><b>Whom no man hath seen, nor can see</b></i> — Moses himself could only see the symbol of the Divine presence; but the <i>face of God</i> no man could ever see. Because he is infinite and eternal, therefore he is <i>incomprehensible</i>; and if incomprehensible to the <i>mind</i>, consequently invisible to the eye.</p>
<p><i><b>To whom</b></i> — As the author of being, and the dispenser of all good, be ascribed <i>honour and power</i>-the sole authority of all-pervading, all-superintending, all-preserving, and everlasting might.</p>
<p>The words of St. Paul are inimitably sublime. It is a doubt whether human language can be carried much higher, even under the influence of inspiration, in a description of the supreme Being. It is well known that St. Paul had read the Greek poets. He quotes <i>Aratus, Epimenides</i>, and <i>Menander</i>; this is allowed on all hands. But does he not quote, or refer to, <i>AEschylus</i> and <i>Sophocles</i> too? Scarcely any person suspects this; and yet there is such a complete similarity between the following quotations from the above poets and the apostle's words, that we are almost persuaded he had them in his eye. But if so, he extends the thought infinitely higher, by language incomparably more exalted. I shall introduce and compare with the text the passages I refer to.</p>
<p>Ver. 16. Ὁ μονος εχων αθανασιαν, φως οικων απροσιτον.</p>
<p>This passage is grand and noble; but how insignificant does it appear when contrasted with the superior sublimity of the inspired writer! The deity of Sophocles dwells in the dazzling splendour of heaven; but the God of Paul inhabits light so dazzling and so resplendent that it is perfectly unapproachable!</p>
