<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Charge them that are rich</b></i> — He had before, in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9-10">1 Timothy 6:9-10</span>, given them a very awful lesson concerning their <i>obtaining riches</i>; and now he gives them one equally so concerning their <i>use</i> of them.</p>
<p><i><b>That they be not high-minded</b></i> — That they do not value themselves on account of their wealth, for this adds nothing to mind or moral worth.</p>
<p><i><b>Nor trust in uncertain riches</b></i> — πλουτου αδηλοτητι. The uncertainty of riches; things which are never at a <i>stay</i>, are ever changing, and seldom continue long with one proprietor; therefore, as well as on many other accounts, they are not to be trusted in: they cannot give happiness, because they are not <i>fixed</i> and <i>permanent</i>; neither can they meet the wishes of an immortal spirit; <i>but in the living God</i>, who is the unchangeable fountain of perfection.</p>
<p><i><b>Who giveth us richly all things to enjoy</b></i> — Who not only has all good, but dispenses it liberally for the supply of the wants of all his creatures; and he does not give merely what is <i>necessary</i>, but he gives what tends to render life <i>comfortable</i>. The <i>comforts</i> of life come from God, as well as the <i>necessaries</i>. He not only gives us a bare <i>subsistence</i>, but he gives us <i>enjoyments</i>. Were it not for the oppression and rapine of wicked men, every situation and state in life would be comparatively comfortable. God gives liberally; man divides it badly.</p>
