Verse 17. Charge them that are rich — He had before, in 1 Timothy 6:9-10, given them a very awful lesson concerning their obtaining riches; and now he gives them one equally so concerning their use of them.That they be not high-minded — That they do not value themselves on account of their wealth, for this adds nothing to mind or moral worth.Nor trust in uncertain riches — πλουτου αδηλοτητι. The uncertainty of riches; things which are never at a stay, are ever changing, and seldom continue long with one proprietor; therefore, as well as on many other accounts, they are not to be trusted in: they cannot give happiness, because they are not fixed and permanent; neither can they meet the wishes of an immortal spirit; but in the living God, who is the unchangeable fountain of perfection.Who giveth us richly all things to enjoy — Who not only has all good, but dispenses it liberally for the supply of the wants of all his creatures; and he does not give merely what is necessary, but he gives what tends to render life comfortable. The comforts of life come from God, as well as the necessaries. He not only gives us a bare subsistence, but he gives us enjoyments. Were it not for the oppression and rapine of wicked men, every situation and state in life would be comparatively comfortable. God gives liberally; man divides it badly.
