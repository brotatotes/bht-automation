<p>Verse 18. <i><b>That they do good</b></i> — That they relieve the wants of their fellow creatures, according to the abundance which God has given them. The highest luxury a human being can enjoy on this side of the grave.</p>
<p><i><b>Rich in good works</b></i> — That their good works may be as abundant as their riches.</p>
<p><i><b>Ready to distribute</b></i> — ευμεταδοτους ειναι. That they give nothing through partiality or favour, but be guided in their distribution by the necessities of the objects presented to them; and that they confine not their charity at home, but scatter it abroad.</p>
<p><i><b>Willing to communicate</b></i> — κοινωνικους. Bringing every poor person into a state of <i>fellowship</i> with themselves.</p>
