<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation</b></i> — St. Paul seems to have borrowed this form of speech from Tobit. See chap. iv. 8, 9: <i>If thou hast abundance, give alms accordingly:</i> <i>if thou hast but a little, be not afraid to give according to</i> <i>that little: for thou treasurest up a good reward for thyself</i> <i>against the day of necessity</i>. Θεμα ραρ αγαθον θησαυριζεις σεαυτω εις ἡμεραν αναγκης. The apostle says: Αποθησαυριζοντας ἑαυτοις θεμελιον καλον εις το μελλον, ἱνα επιλαβωνται της αιωνιου ζωης "Treasuring up a good foundation to them for the future, that they may lay hold on eternal life." The sentiment is the same in both writers; the words nearly so; and the meaning is simply this, as it is judiciously paraphrased by Mr. J. Wesley in his note on this passage: "<i>Treasuring up for themselves a good</i> <i>foundation</i>, of an abundant reward by the free mercy of God, <i>that</i> <i>they may lay hold on eternal life</i>. This cannot be done by almsdeeds; yet, they <i>come up for a memorial before God</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:4">Acts 10:4</span>. And the lack even of <i>this</i> may be the cause why God will withhold grace and salvation from us." Christ has said: <i>Blessed are the</i> <i>merciful for they shall obtain mercy</i>. They who have not been merciful according to their power, shall not obtain mercy; they that have, shall obtain mercy: and yet the eternal life which they obtain they look for from the mercy of God through Jesus Christ.</p>
