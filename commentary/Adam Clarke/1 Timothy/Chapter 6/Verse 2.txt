<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:2">1 Timothy 6:2</span>. <i><b>And they that have believing masters</b></i> — Who have been lately converted as well as themselves.</p>
<p><i><b>Let them not despise</b></i><b> them</b>] Supposing themselves to be their equals, because they are their brethren in Christ; and grounding their opinion on this, that in <i>him there is neither male nor</i> <i>female, bond nor free</i>; for, although all are equal as to their <i>spiritual privileges</i> and state, yet there still continues in the order of God's providence a great disparity of their <i>station</i>: the <i>master</i> must ever be in this sense <i>superior</i> to the <i>servant</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>But rather</b></i> do them <i>service</i>] Obey them the more cheerfully, because they are <i>faithful</i> and <i>beloved; faithful</i> to God's grace, <i>beloved</i> by him and his true followers.</p>
<p><i><b>Partakers of the benefit.</b></i> — της ευεπγεσιας αντιλαμβανομενοι. <i>Joint partakers of the benefit</i>. This is generally understood as referring to the <i>master's</i> participation in the services of his slaves. <i>Because those who are partakers of the benefit of your</i> <i>services</i> are <i>faithful and beloved</i>; or it may apply to the servants who are partakers of many benefits from their Christian <i>masters</i>. Others think that <i>benefit</i> here refers to the <i>grace of</i> the <i>Gospel</i>, the <i>common salvation</i> of believing masters and slaves; but Dr. <i>Macknight</i> well observes that ευεργεσια is nowhere used to denote the <i>Gospel</i>. One of <i>Uffenbach's</i> MSS. has εργασιασ, <i>of</i> <i>the service</i>; this reading is plainly a gloss; it is not acknowledged by any other MS., nor by any version. FG, and the Codex <i>Augustanus</i> 6, have ευσεβειας, <i>of godliness</i>; a term by which the whole <i>Gospel doctrine</i> is expressed, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7-8">1 Timothy 4:7-8</span>, as also in the 6th verse of this chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:6">1 Timothy 6:6</span></p>
