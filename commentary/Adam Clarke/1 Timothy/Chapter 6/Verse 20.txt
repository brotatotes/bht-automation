<p>Verse 20. <i><b>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy</b></i><b> </b><i><b>trust</b></i> — This is another repetition of the apostolic charge. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18-19">1 Timothy 1:18-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:6-7">1 Timothy 4:6-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14-16">1 Timothy 4:14-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:21">1 Timothy 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:13">1 Timothy 6:13</span>.) Carefully preserve that doctrine which I have delivered to thee. Nothing can be more solemn and affectionate than this charge.</p>
<p><i><b>Avoiding profane</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>vain babblings</b></i> — See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span>, and <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7">1 Timothy 4:7</span><i>"</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>And oppositions of science falsely so called</b></i> — Και αντιθεσεις της ψευδωνυμου γνωσεως· <i>And oppositions of knowledge falsely so</i> <i>named</i>. Dr. Macknight's note here is worthy of much attention: "In the enumeration of the different kinds of inspiration bestowed on the first preachers of the Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>, we find the <i>word of knowledge</i> mentioned; by which is meant that kind of inspiration which gave to the apostles and superior Christian prophets the <i>knowledge of the true meaning of the Jewish</i> <i>Scriptures</i>. <i>This</i> inspiration the false teachers pretending to possess, dignified their misinterpretations of the ancient Scriptures with the name of <i>knowledge</i>, that is, <i>inspired</i> knowledge; for so the word signifies, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6">1 Corinthians 14:6</span>. And as by these interpretations they endeavoured to establish the efficacy of the Levitical atonements, the apostle very properly termed these interpretations <i>oppositions of knowledge</i>, because they were framed to establish doctrines opposite to, and subversive of, the Gospel. To destroy the credit of these teachers, he affirmed that the <i>knowledge</i> from which they proceeded was <i>falsely called</i> <i>inspired knowledge</i>; for they were not inspired with the knowledge of the meaning of the Scriptures, but only pretended to it." Others think that the apostle has the <i>Gnostics</i> in view. But it is not clear that these heretics, or whatever they were, had any proper existence at this time. On the whole, Dr. Macknight's interpretation seems to be the best.</p>
