<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:3">1 Timothy 6:3</span>. <i><b>If any man teach otherwise</b></i> — It appears that there were teachers of a different kind in the Church, a sort of <i>religious levellers</i>, who preached that the converted servant had as much right to the master's service as the master had to his. Teachers of this kind have been in vogue long since the days of Paul and Timothy.</p>
<p><i><b>And consent not to wholesome words</b></i> — υγιαινουσι λογοις <i>Healing</i> <i>doctrines</i>-doctrines which give <i>nourishment</i> and <i>health</i> to the soul, which is the true character of all the doctrines taught by our Lord Jesus Christ; doctrines which are <i>according to</i> <i>godliness</i>-securing as amply the honour and glory of God, as they do the peace, happiness, and final salvation of man.</p>
<p>All this may refer to the general tenor of the Gospel; and not to any thing said, or <i>supposed to have been said, by our Lord</i>, relative to the condition of <i>slaves</i>. With political questions, or questions relative to private <i>rights</i>, our Lord scarcely ever meddled; he taught all men to <i>love one another</i>; to respect each other's rights; to submit to each other; to show all fidelity; to be obedient, humble, and meek; and to know that his kingdom was not of this world.</p>
