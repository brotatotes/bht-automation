<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4">1 Timothy 6:4</span>. <i><b>He is proud</b></i> — τετυφωται. He is <i>blown up</i>, or <i>inflated</i> with a vain opinion of his own knowledge; whereas his knowledge is foolishness, for he knows nothing.</p>
<p><i><b>Doting about questions</b></i> — He is <i>sick, distempered</i>, about these questions relative to the Mosaic law and the traditions of the elders; for it is most evident that the apostle has the <i>Judaizing</i> <i>teachers</i> in view, who were ever, in questions of theology, straining out a gnat, and swallowing a camel.</p>
<p><i><b>Strifes of words</b></i> — λογομαχιας. <i>Logomachies</i>; verbal contentions; splitting hairs; producing <i>Hillel</i> against <i>Shammai</i>, and <i>Shammai</i> against <i>Hillel</i>, relative to the particular mode in which the punctilios of some rites should be performed. In this sort of sublime nonsense the works of the Jewish rabbins abound.</p>
<p><i><b>Whereof cometh envy, strife, c.</b></i> — How little good have religious disputes ever done to mankind, or to the cause of truth! Most controversialists have succeeded in getting their own tempers <i>soured</i>, and in <i>irritating</i> their opponents. Indeed, truth seems rarely to be the object of their pursuit they labour to accredit their own party by abusing and defaming others; from <i>generals</i> they often descend to <i>particulars</i>; and then <i>personal</i> abuse is the order of the day. Is it not strange that Christians either cannot or will not see this? Cannot any man support his own opinions, and give his own views of the religion of Christ, without abusing and calumniating his neighbour? I know not whether such controversialists should not be deemed <i>disturbers of</i> <i>the public peace</i>, and come under the notice of the civil magistrate. Should not all Christians know that the <i>wrath of man</i> <i>worketh not the righteousness of the Lord</i>?</p>
