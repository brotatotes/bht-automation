<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:5">1 Timothy 6:5</span>. <i><b>Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds</b></i> — Disputations that cannot be settled, because their partisans will not listen to the truth; and they will not listen to the truth because their <i>minds</i> are <i>corrupt</i>. Both under the <i>law</i> and under the <i>Gospel</i> the true religion was: <i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God</i> <i>with all thy heart, soul, mind, and strength; and thy neighbour as</i> <i>thyself</i>. Where, therefore, the love of God and man does not prevail, <i>there</i> there is no religion. Such corrupt disputers are as <i>destitute of the truth</i> as they are of love to God and man.</p>
<p><i><b>Supposing that gain is godliness</b></i> — Professing religion only for the sake of secular profit; defending their own cause for the emoluments it produced; and having no respect to another world.</p>
<p><i><b>From such withdraw thyself</b></i> — Have no religions fellowship with such people. But this clause is wanting in AD*FG, some others, the <i>Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Vulgate</i>, and <i>Itala</i>, one copy excepted. It is probably spurious.</p>
