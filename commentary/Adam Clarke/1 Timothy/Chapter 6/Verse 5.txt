Verse 1 Timothy 6:5. Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds — Disputations that cannot be settled, because their partisans will not listen to the truth; and they will not listen to the truth because their minds are corrupt. Both under the law and under the Gospel the true religion was: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, mind, and strength; and thy neighbour as thyself. Where, therefore, the love of God and man does not prevail, there there is no religion. Such corrupt disputers are as destitute of the truth as they are of love to God and man.Supposing that gain is godliness — Professing religion only for the sake of secular profit; defending their own cause for the emoluments it produced; and having no respect to another world.From such withdraw thyself — Have no religions fellowship with such people. But this clause is wanting in AD*FG, some others, the Coptic, Sahidic, AEthiopic, Vulgate, and Itala, one copy excepted. It is probably spurious.
