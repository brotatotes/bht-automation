<p>Verse 7. <i><b>We brought nothing into this world</b></i> â€” There are some sayings in <i>Seneca</i> which are almost verbatim with this of St. Paul: <i>Nemo nascitur dives; quisquis exit in lucem jussus est</i> <i>lacte et panno esse contentus</i>; Epist. xx, "No man is born rich; every one that comes into the world is commanded to be content with food and raiment." <i>Excutit natura redeuntem, sicut</i> <i>intrantem; non licet plus auferre, quam intuleris</i>; Epist., cap. ii. "Nature, in returning, shakes off all incumbrances as in entering; thou canst not carry back more than thou broughtest in." Seneca and St. Paul were contemporary; but all the Greek and Latin poets, and especially the <i>stoic philosophers</i>, are full of such sentiments. It is a self-evident truth; relative to it there can be no controversy.</p>
