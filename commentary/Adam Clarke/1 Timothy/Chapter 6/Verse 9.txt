<p>Verse 9. <i><b>But they that will be rich</b></i> — οι δε βουλομενοι πλουτειν. The words are <i>emphatic</i>, and refer to persons who are <i>determined</i> to get riches; who make this their <i>object</i> and <i>aim</i> in life; who live to get money; who get all they can, save all they can, and keep all they get; and yet are apprehensive of no danger, because they seek to be rich by <i>honest means</i>; for it is likely that the apostle does not refer to those who wish to get riches by <i>robbery, plunder, extortion</i>, c.</p>
<p>By the term <i>rich</i> it is very likely that the apostle refers to what he had said above: <i>Having food and raiment, let us be</i> <i>therewith content</i>. He that has more than these is <i>rich</i> in the sense in which the apostle uses the term.</p>
<p><i><b>Fall into temptation and a snare</b></i> — του διαβολου, <i>Of the devil</i>, is added by D*FG, <i>Vulgate, Itala</i>, and many of the <i>fathers</i>. It is in consequence of the <i>temptation of the devil</i> that they have determined to be rich this temptation once received, others quickly succeed: and when they have swallowed down the temptation to the <i>thing</i>, then they drink in a thousand temptations to the <i>means</i>; and all these lead them εις παγιδα, into an unforeseen and concealed trap. παγις signifies a net, trap, gin, snare, springe, or pit dug in the ground filled with sharp stakes, and slightly covered over; so that when a man, or any animal, steps upon it, he tumbles in, and is taken or destroyed. Such a snare is that into which those <i>who will be rich</i> must necessarily fall. But who will believe this? See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10">1 Timothy 6:10</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>And</b></i><b> into </b><i><b>many foolish and hurtful lusts</b></i> — The whole conduct of such a person is a tissue of <i>folly</i>; scraping, gathering, and heaping up riches, and scarcely affording to take the necessaries of life out of them for himself. These lusts or desires are not only <i>foolish</i>, but they are <i>hurtful</i>; the mind is debased and narrowed by them; benevolent and generous feelings become extinct; charity perishes; and <i>selfishness</i>, the last and lowest principle in mental degradation, absorbs the soul; for these <i>foolish</i> and <i>hurtful lusts drown men in destruction and</i> <i>perdition</i>-the soul is <i>destroyed</i> by them here, and brought through them into a state of <i>perdition</i> hereafter. The apostle considers these persons like mariners in a storm; by the concurrence of winds, waves, and tide, they are violently driven among the rocks, the vessel is dashed to pieces, and in a moment they are all ingulfed in the great deep! Such is the lot and unavoidable catastrophe of them <i>that will be rich</i>, even though they should strive to accomplish their desires by means the most rigidly honest.</p>
<p>In this place I beg leave to refer the reader to a <i>sermon</i> on this text by the late Rev. JOHN WESLEY, in which the whole of this subject is treated by the hand of a master; and, for usefulness, the sermon is superior to every thing of the kind ever published. It is entitled, <i>The Danger of Riches</i>; and is found in his WORKS, Vol. 2, page 248, American edit.</p>
