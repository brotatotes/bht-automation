Verse 2 Corinthians 1:11. Ye also helping together by prayer — Even an apostle felt the prayers of the Church of God necessary for his comfort and support. What innumerable blessings do the prayers of the followers of God draw down on those who are the objects of them!The gift bestowed - by the means of many persons — The blessings communicated by means of their prayers.Thanks may be given by many — When they who have prayed hear that their prayers are so particularly answered, then all that have prayed will feel themselves led to praise God for his gracious answers. Thus, the prayers of many obtain the gift; and the thanksgiving of many acknowledge the mercy.The gift, or χαρισμα, which the apostle mentions, was his deliverance from the dangers and deaths to which he was exposed.
