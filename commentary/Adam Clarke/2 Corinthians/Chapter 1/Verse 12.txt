<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>. <i><b>For our rejoicing is this</b></i> — Ἡ καυχησις. Our <i>boasting, exultation, subject</i> of <i>glorying</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The testimony of our conscience</b></i> — Μαρτυριον της συνειδησεως· That testimony or witness which conscience, under the light and influence of the Spirit of God, renders to the soul of its state, sincerity, safety, c.</p>
<p><i><b>In simplicity</b></i> — Ἁπλοτητι· from α, denoting <i>unity</i> or <i>together</i>, and πελω, <i>to be</i> or from α, <i>negative</i>, and πολυς, <i>many</i>; not <i>compounded</i>, having <i>one end</i> in view, having no <i>sinister</i> purpose, no <i>by end</i> to answer. Instead of απλοτητι, many MSS. and versions have αγιοτητι, <i>holiness</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>In godly sincerity</b></i> — Ειλικρινειᾳ Θεου· <i>The sincerity of God</i>: that is, such a sincerity as comes from his work in the soul. Ειλικρινεια, <i>sincerity</i>, and ειλικρινης, <i>sincere</i>, come from ειλη, the <i>splendour</i>, or <i>bright shining of the sun</i>; and here signifies such <i>simplicity of intention</i>, and <i>purity of affection</i>, as can stand the test of the light of God shining upon it, without the discovery being made of a single blemish or flaw.</p>
<p><i><b>Not with fleshly wisdom</b></i> — The cunning and duplicity of man, who is uninfluenced by the Spirit of God, and has his secular interest, ease, profit, pleasure, and worldly honour in view.</p>
<p><i><b>But by the grace of God</b></i> — Which alone can produce the simplicity and godly sincerity before mentioned, and inspire the wisdom that comes from above.</p>
<p><i><b>We have had our conversation</b></i> — Ανεστραφημεν· We have conducted ourselves. The word properly refers to the whole tenor of a man's life-all that he does says, and intends; and the object or end he has in view, and in reference to which he speaks, acts, and thinks; and is so used by the best Greek writers. The verb αναστρεφω is compounded of ανα, <i>again</i>, and στρεφω, <i>to turn;</i> a continual coming back again to the point from which he set out; a circulation; beginning, continuing, and ending every thing to the glory of God; setting out with Divine views, and still maintaining them; beginning in the Spirit, and ending in the Spirit; acting in reference to <i>God</i>, as the <i>planets</i> do in reference to the <i>sun</i>, deriving all their light, heat, and motion from him; and incessantly and regularly revolving round him. Thus acted Paul; thus acted the primitive Christians; and thus must every Christian act who expects to see God in his glory. The word <i>conversation</i> is not an unapt Latinism for the Greek term, as <i>conversatio</i> comes from <i>con</i>, together, and <i>verto</i>, I turn; and is used by the <i>Latins</i> in precisely the same sense as the other is by the <i>Greeks</i>, signifying the whole of a man's conduct, the tenor and practice of his life: and <i>conversio astrorum</i>, and <i>conversiones</i> <i>caelestes</i>, is by CICERO used for the <i>course of the stars</i> and <i>heavenly bodies</i>.--De Leg. c. 8: <i>Caelum una</i> conversione <i>atque</i> <i>eadem, ipse circum se torquetur et vertitur</i>.--CIC <i>de Univers</i>., c. 8: "The heaven itself is, with one and the same revolution, whirled about, and revolves round itself."</p>
<p><i><b>In the world</b></i> — Both among Jews and Gentiles have we always acted as seeing Him who is invisible.</p>
<p><i><b>More abundantly to you - ward.</b></i> — That is, We have given the fullest proof of this in our <i>conduct</i> towards <i>you</i>; YOU have witnessed the holy manner in which we have always acted; and GOD is witness of the purity of the motives by which we have been actuated; and our conscience tells us that we have lived in uprightness before him.</p>
