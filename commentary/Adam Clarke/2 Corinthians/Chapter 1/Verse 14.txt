Verse 14. Have acknowledged us in part — Απο μερους may signify here not in part, but some of you; and it is evident, from the distracted state of the Corinthians, and the opposition raised there against the apostle, that it was only a part of them that did acknowledge him, and receive and profit by his epistles and advice.We are your rejoicing, c.] You boast of us as the ministers of Christ through whom ye have believed as we boast of you as genuine converts to the Christian faith, and worthy members of the Church of God.
