<p>Verse 14. <i><b>Have acknowledged us in part</b></i> — Απο μερους may signify here not <i>in part</i>, but <i>some of you</i>; and it is evident, from the distracted state of the Corinthians, and the opposition raised there against the apostle, that it was only <i>a part of them</i> that did acknowledge him, and receive and profit by his epistles and advice.</p>
<p><i><b>We are your rejoicing</b></i>, c.] You boast of <i>us</i> as the ministers of Christ through whom ye have believed as we boast of <i>you</i> as genuine converts to the Christian faith, and worthy members of the Church of God.</p>
