<p>Verse 15. <i><b>And in this confidence</b></i> — Under the conviction or persuasion that this is the case; that ye exult in us, as we do in you;</p>
<p><i><b>I was minded</b></i> — I had purposed <i>to come to you before</i>, as he had intimated, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>; for he had intended to call on them in his way from Macedonia, but this purpose he did not fulfil; and he gives the reason, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23">2 Corinthians 1:23</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>A second benefit</b></i> — He had been with them <i>once</i>, and they had received an especial blessing in having the <i>seed</i> of life <i>sown</i> among them by the preaching of the Gospel; and he had purposed to visit them again that they might have a <i>second</i> blessing, in having that seed <i>watered</i>. Instead of χαριν, <i>grace</i> or <i>benefit</i>, several MSS. read χαραν <i>joy, pleasure</i>; but the word <i>grace</i> or <i>benefit</i>, seems to express the apostle's meaning best.</p>
