Verse 15. And in this confidence — Under the conviction or persuasion that this is the case; that ye exult in us, as we do in you;I was minded — I had purposed to come to you before, as he had intimated, 1 Corinthians 16:5; for he had intended to call on them in his way from Macedonia, but this purpose he did not fulfil; and he gives the reason, 2 Corinthians 1:23.A second benefit — He had been with them once, and they had received an especial blessing in having the seed of life sown among them by the preaching of the Gospel; and he had purposed to visit them again that they might have a second blessing, in having that seed watered. Instead of χαριν, grace or benefit, several MSS. read χαραν joy, pleasure; but the word grace or benefit, seems to express the apostle's meaning best.
