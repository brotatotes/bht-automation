<p>Verse 17. <i><b>Did I use lightness?</b></i> â€” When I formed this purpose, was it without due consideration? and did I abandon it through fickleness of mind?</p>
<p><i><b>That with me there should be yea</b></i>, &amp;c.] That I should act as <i>carnal</i> men, who change their purposes, and falsify their engagements, according as may seem best to their secular interest?</p>
