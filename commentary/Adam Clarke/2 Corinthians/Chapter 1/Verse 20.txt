<p>Verse 20. <i><b>For all the promises of God</b></i> — Had we been light, fickle, worldly-minded persons; persons who could only be bound by our engagements as far as comported with our secular interest; would God have confirmed our testimony among you? Did we not lay before you the promises of God? And did not God fulfil those promises <i>by us</i>-by our instrumentality, to your salvation and his own glory? God is true; therefore every promise of God is true; and consequently each must have its due fulfilment. God will not make use of <i>trifling, worldly</i> men, as the instruments by which he will fulfil his promises; but he has fulfilled them by <i>us</i>; therefore we are just and spiritual men, else God would not have used us.</p>
<p><i><b>In him</b></i><b> are </b><i><b>yea, and in him amen</b></i> — All the promises which God has made to mankind are <i>yea</i>-true in themselves, and <i>amen</i>-faithfully fulfilled to them who believe in Christ Jesus. The <i>promises</i> are all made in reference to Christ; for it is only on the <i>Gospel system</i> that we can have <i>promises</i> of <i>grace</i>; for it is only on that system that we can have <i>mercy</i>. Therefore, the promise comes originally <i>by</i> Christ, and is <i>yea</i>; and it has its fulfilment <i>through</i> Christ, and is <i>amen</i>; and this is to the glory of God, by the preaching of the <i>apostles</i>.</p>
<p>From what the apostle says here, and the serious and solemn manner in which he vindicates himself, it appears that his enemies at Corinth had made a handle of his not coming to Corinth, according to his proposal, to defame his character, and to depreciate his ministry; but he makes use of it as a means of exalting the <i>truth</i> and <i>mercy</i> of God through Christ Jesus; and of showing that the promises of God not only come by <i>him</i>, but are fulfilled <i>through</i> him.</p>
