<p>Verse 21. <i><b>Now he which stablisheth us with you</b></i> â€” It is God that has brought both us and you to this sure state of salvation through Christ; and he has <i>anointed us</i>, giving us the extraordinary influences of the Holy Ghost, that we might be able effectually to administer this Gospel to your salvation. Through this unction we know and preach the truth, and are preserved by it from dissimulation and falsity of every kind.</p>
