<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Who hath also sealed us</b></i> — Not only deeply <i>impressed</i> His <i>truth</i> and <i>image</i> upon our <i>hearts</i>; but, by the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, attested the truth of our extraordinary <i>unction</i> or calling to the ministry.</p>
<p><i><b>And given the earnest of the Spirit</b></i> — Τον αρραβωνα του Πνευματος. From this <i>unction</i> and sealing we have a <i>clear</i> <i>testimony</i> in our souls, the Divine Spirit dwelling constantly in us, of our acceptance with God, and that our ways please him. The αρραβων of the apostle is the same as the ערבן <i>erabon</i> of Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:17">Genesis 38:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:18">Genesis 38:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:20">Genesis 38:20</span>, which we there translate <i>pledge</i>. The word properly signifies an <i>earnest</i> of something promised; <i>a part of the price</i> agreed for between a <i>buyer</i> and <i>seller</i>, by giving and receiving of which the bargain was ratified; or a <i>deposit</i>, which was to be restored when the thing promised was given. From the use of the term in <i>Genesis</i>, which the apostle puts here in Greek letters, we may at once see his meaning above, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>; the Holy Spirit being an <i>earnest</i> in the <i>heart</i>, and an <i>earnest of the promised inheritance</i> means a security given in hand for the fulfilment of all God's promises relative to grace and eternal life. We may learn from this, that eternal life will be given in the great day to all who can <i>produce</i> the <i>arrhabon</i>, or <i>pledge</i>. He who is found <i>then</i> with the earnest of God's Spirit in his heart, shall not only be saved from death, but have that eternal life of which it is the <i>pledge</i>, the <i>earnest</i>, and the <i>evidence</i>. Without this <i>arrhabon</i> there can be no glory. See the whole case of Judah and Tamar, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:13">Genesis 38:13</span>, &amp;c., and the notes there.</p>
