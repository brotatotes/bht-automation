<p>Verse 23. <i><b>I call God for a record upon my soul</b></i> â€” The apostle here resumes the subject which he left <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:16">2 Corinthians 1:16</span>, and in the most solemn manner calls God to <i>witness</i>, and consequently to punish, if he asserted any thing <i>false</i>, that it was through tenderness to them that he did not visit Corinth at the time proposed. As there were so many scandals among them, the apostle had reason to believe that he should be obliged to use the <i>severe</i> and authoritative part of his function in the <i>excommunication</i> of those who had sinned, and delivering them over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, c. but to give them space to amend, and to see what effect his epistle might produce, (not having heard as yet from them,) he proposed to delay his coming. It is plain, as several commentators have observed,</p>
<p>1. That St. Paul's doctrine had been opposed by some of Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:12">1 Corinthians 15:12</span>. His <i>apostleship</i> questioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1-2">1 Corinthians 9:1-2</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:13">2 Corinthians 12:13</span>.</p>
<p>2. Himself <i>despised</i>, and treated as a person who, because of the consciousness he had of his own <i>worthlessness</i>, dared not to come, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:18">1 Corinthians 4:18</span>. <i>His letters, say they, are weighty and powerful</i>-full of boastings of what he <i>can</i> and what he <i>will</i> do; <i>but his bodily presence is</i> <i>weak, and his speech contemptible</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>.</p>
<p>3. This being the state in which his reputation was then at Corinth, and he having promised to come to them, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>, he could not but think it necessary to vindicate his failing them by reasons which should be both convincing and kind, such as those contained in the preceding verses. See <i>Dodd</i> and others.</p>
