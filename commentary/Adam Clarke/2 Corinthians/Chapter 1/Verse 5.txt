<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:5">2 Corinthians 1:5</span>. <i><b>The sufferings of Christ</b></i> — Suffering endured for the cause of Christ: such as persecutions, hardships, and privations of different kinds.</p>
<p><i><b>Our consolation also aboundeth</b></i> — We stood as well, as firmly, and as easily, in the heaviest trial, as in the lightest; because the consolation was always proportioned to the trial and difficulty. Hence we learn, that he who is upheld in a slight trial need not fear a great one; for if he be faithful, his consolation shall <i>abound</i>, as his sufferings <i>abound</i>. Is it not as easy for a <i>man</i> to lift one hundred pounds' weight, as it is for an <i>infant</i> to lift a few <i>ounces</i>? The proportion of strength destroys the comparative difficulty.</p>
