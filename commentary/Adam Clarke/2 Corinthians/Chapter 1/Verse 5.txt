Verse 2 Corinthians 1:5. The sufferings of Christ — Suffering endured for the cause of Christ: such as persecutions, hardships, and privations of different kinds.Our consolation also aboundeth — We stood as well, as firmly, and as easily, in the heaviest trial, as in the lightest; because the consolation was always proportioned to the trial and difficulty. Hence we learn, that he who is upheld in a slight trial need not fear a great one; for if he be faithful, his consolation shall abound, as his sufferings abound. Is it not as easy for a man to lift one hundred pounds' weight, as it is for an infant to lift a few ounces? The proportion of strength destroys the comparative difficulty.
