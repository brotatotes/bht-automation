<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6">2 Corinthians 1:6</span>. <i><b>And whether we be afflicted</b></i> — See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:4">2 Corinthians 1:4</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>Which is effectual</b></i> — There is a strange and unusual variation in the MSS. and versions in this passage. Perhaps the whole should be read thus: <i>For if we be afflicted, it is for your</i> <i>encouragement and salvation; and if we be comforted, it is also</i> <i>for your encouragement, which exerted itself by enduring the same</i> <i>sufferings which we also suffer</i>.</p>
<p>This transposition of the <i>middle</i> and <i>last</i> clauses is authorized by the best MSS. and versions. The meaning seems to be this: While ye abide faithful to God, no suffering can be prejudicial to you; on the contrary, it will be advantageous; God having your comfort and salvation continually in view, by all the dispensations of his providence: and while you patiently endure, your salvation is advanced; sufferings and consolations all becoming energetic means of accomplishing the great design, for all things work together for good to them that love God. See the variations in <i>Griesbach</i>.</p>
