<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:8">2 Corinthians 1:8</span>. <i><b>Our trouble which came to us in Asia</b></i> — To what part of his history the apostle refers we know not: some think it is to the <i>Jews lying in wait to kill him</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span>; others, to the <i>insurrection raised against him by Demetrius and his fellow</i> <i>craftsmen</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:23">Acts 19:23</span>; others, to his <i>fighting with beasts at Ephesus</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span>, which they understand <i>literally</i>; and others think that there is a reference here to some persecution which is not recorded in any part of the apostle's history.</p>
<p><i><b>We were pressed out of measure, above strength</b></i> — The original is exceedingly emphatic: καθ' ὑπερβολην εβαρηθημεν ὑπερ δυναμιν· we were weighed down beyond what is credible, even beyond what any natural strength could support. There is no part of St. Paul's history known to us which can justify these strong expressions, except his being <i>stoned</i> at Lystra; which if not what is here intended, the facts to which he refers are not on record. As Lystra was properly in Asia, unless he mean Asia Minor, and his stoning at Lystra did most evidently destroy his life, so that his being raised was an effect of the miraculous power of God; he might be supposed to refer to this. <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span>, c. But it is very likely that the reference is to some terrible persecution which he had endured some short time before his writing this epistle and with the outlines of which the Corinthians had been acquainted.</p>
