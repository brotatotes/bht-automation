Verse 2 Corinthians 1:9. We had the sentence of death in ourselves — The tribulation was so violent and overwhelming, that he had no hope of escaping death.That we should not trust in ourselves — The tribulation was of such a nature as to take away all expectation of help but from GOD alone.But in God which raiseth the dead — This is very like the business at Lystra; and would be sufficient to fix the apostle's reference to that fact could the time and other circumstances serve.
