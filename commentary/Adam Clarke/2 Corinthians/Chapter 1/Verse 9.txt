<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:9">2 Corinthians 1:9</span>. <i><b>We had the sentence of death in ourselves</b></i> — The tribulation was so violent and overwhelming, that he had no hope of escaping death.</p>
<p><i><b>That we should not trust in ourselves</b></i> — The tribulation was of such a nature as to take away all expectation of help but from GOD alone.</p>
<p><i><b>But in God which raiseth the dead</b></i> — This is very like the business at Lystra; and would be sufficient to fix the apostle's reference to that fact could the <i>time</i> and other circumstances serve.</p>
