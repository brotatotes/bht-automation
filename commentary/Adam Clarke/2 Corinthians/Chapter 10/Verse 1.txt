<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span>. <i><b>I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness</b></i> — Having now finished his directions and advices relative to the <i>collection</i> <i>for the poor</i>, he resumes his argument relative to the false apostle, who had gained considerable influence by representing St. Paul as despicable in his person, his ministry, and his influence. Under this obloquy the apostle was supported by the meekness and gentleness of Christ; and through the same heavenly disposition he delayed inflicting that punishment which, in virtue of his apostolical authority, he might have inflicted on him who had disturbed and laboured to corrupt the Christian Church.</p>
<p><i><b>Who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold</b></i> <i>toward you</i>] He seems to quote <i>these</i> as the <i>words of his</i> <i>calumniator</i>, as if he had said; "This apostle of yours is a mere braggadocio; when he is among you, you know how <i>base</i> and <i>contemptible</i> he is; when absent, see how he <i>brags</i> and <i>boasts</i>." The word ταπεινος, which we render <i>base</i>, signifies <i>lowly</i>, and, as some think, <i>short of stature</i>. The insinuation is, that when there was danger or opposition at hand, St. Paul acted with great obsequiousness, fearing for his person and authority, lest he should lose his secular influence.
