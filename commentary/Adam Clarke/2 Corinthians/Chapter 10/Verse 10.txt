<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>. <i><b>For his letters, say they</b></i><b>, are </b><i><b>weighty and powerful</b></i> — He boasts of high powers, and that he can do great things. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1-2">2 Corinthians 10:1-2</span>.</p>
<p><i><b>But his bodily presence</b></i><b> is </b><i><b>weak</b></i> — When you behold the <i>man</i>, you find him a feeble, contemptible mortal; and when ye hear him <i>speak</i>, his speech, ο λογος, probably, his <i>doctrine</i>, εξουθενημενος, is good for nothing; his <i>person, matter</i>, and <i>manner</i>, are altogether uninteresting, unimpressive, and too contemptible to be valued by the wise and the learned. This seems to be the spirit and design of this slander.</p>
<p>Many, both among the ancients and moderns, have endeavoured to find out the <i>ground</i> there was for any part of this calumny; as to the <i>moral conduct</i> of the apostle, that was invulnerable; his <i>motives</i>, it is true, were suspected and denounced by this false apostle and his partisans; but they could never find any thing in his <i>conduct</i> which could support their insinuations.</p>
<p>What they could not attach to his <i>character</i>, they disingenuously attached to his <i>person</i> and his <i>elocution</i>.</p>
<p>If we can credit some ancient writers, such as <i>Nicephorus</i>, we shall find the apostle thus described:</p>
<p>An old Greek writer, says the same author, whose works are found among those of <i>Chrysostom</i>, tom. vi. hom. 30, page 265, represents him thus:-Παυλος ὁ τριπηχυς ανθρωπος, και των ουρανων ἁπτομενος· "Paul was a man of about three cubits in height, (four feet six,) and yet, nevertheless, touched the heavens." Others say that "he was a little man, had a bald head, and a large nose." See the above, and several other authorities in <i>Calmet</i>. Perhaps there is not one of these statements correct: as to <i>Nicephorus</i>, he is a writer of the fourteenth century, weak and credulous, and worthy of no regard. And the writer found in the works of <i>Chrysostom</i>, in making the apostle little more than a <i>pigmy</i>, has rendered his account incredible.</p>
<p>That St. Paul could be no such diminutive person we may fairly presume from the office he filled under the high priest, in the persecution of the Church of Christ and that he had not an <i>impediment</i> in his speech, but was a <i>graceful orator</i>, we may learn from his whole history, and especially from the account we have, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:12">Acts 14:12</span>, where the Lycaonians took him for <i>Mercury</i>, the <i>god of eloquence</i>, induced thereto by his powerful and persuasive elocution. In short, there does not appear to be any substantial evidence of the apostle's <i>deformity, pigmy stature, bald head, pale and wrinkled</i> <i>face, large nose, stammering speech</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c. These are probably all figments of an unbridled fancy, and foolish surmisings.</p>
