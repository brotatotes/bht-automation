<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:12">2 Corinthians 10:12</span>. <i><b>We dare not make ourselves</b></i>, c.] As if he had said: I dare neither associate with, nor compare myself to, those who are full of self-commendation. Some think this to be an <i>ironical</i> speech.</p>
<p><i><b>But they, measuring themselves by themselves</b></i> — They are not sent of God they are not inspired by his Spirit; therefore they have no <i>rule</i> to think or act by. They are also full of pride and self-conceit; they look within themselves for accomplishments which their self-love will soon find out; for to it <i>real</i> and <i>fictitious</i> are the same. As they dare not compare themselves with the true apostles of Christ, they compare themselves with each other; and, as they have no <i>perfect standard</i>, they can have no <i>excellence</i>; nor can they ever attain true <i>wisdom</i>, which is not to be had from looking at what we <i>are</i> but to what we <i>should</i> be; and if without a directory, <i>what we should be</i> will never appear, and consequently our <i>ignorance</i> must continue. This was the case with these self-conceited false apostles; but ουσυνιουσιν, <i>are not</i> <i>wise</i>, Mr. Wakefield contends, is an elegant <i>Graecism</i> signifying they are <i>not aware</i> that they are measuring themselves by themselves, &amp;c.</p>
