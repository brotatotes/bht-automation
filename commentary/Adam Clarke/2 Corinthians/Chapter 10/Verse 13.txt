<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:13">2 Corinthians 10:13</span>. <i><b>Things without</b></i><b> our </b><i><b>measure</b></i> — There is a great deal of difficulty in this and the three following verses, and there is a great diversity among the MSS.; and <i>which</i> is the <i>true reading</i> can scarcely be determined. Our version is perhaps the plainest that can be made of the text. By the <i>measure</i> mentioned here, it seems as if the apostle meant the commission he received from God to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles; <i>a measure</i> or <i>district</i> that extended through all Asia Minor and Greece, down to Achaia, where Corinth was situated, <i>a measure to reach even unto you</i>. But the expressions in these verses are all agonistical, and taken from the stadium or race course in the Olympic and Isthmian games. The μετρον, or <i>measure</i>, was the length of the δρομος, or <i>course</i>; and the κανων, <i>rule</i> or <i>line</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:15">2 Corinthians 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:16">2 Corinthians 10:16</span>, was probably the same with the γραμμα, or <i>white line</i>, which marked out the boundaries of the stadium; and the verbs <i>reach unto, stretch out</i>, &amp;c., are all references to the <i>exertions</i> made to win the <i>race</i>. As this subject is so frequently alluded to in these epistles, I have thought it of importance to consider it particularly in the different places where it occurs.</p>
