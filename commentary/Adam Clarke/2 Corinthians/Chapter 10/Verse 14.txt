<p>Verse 14. <i><b>For we stretch not ourselves beyond</b></i> â€” We have not proceeded straight from Macedonia through Thessaly, and across the Adriatic Gulf into Italy, which would have led us <i>beyond</i> you <i>westward</i>; but knowing the mind of our God we left this direct path, and came <i>southward</i> through <i>Greece</i>, down into <i>Achaia</i>, and there we planted the Gospel. The false apostle has therefore got into our <i>province</i>, and entered into our labours, and there boasts as if the conversion of the heathen Achaians had been his own work. As there is an allusion here to the <i>stadium</i>, and to the Olympic games in general, we may consider the apostle as laying to the charge of the disturber at Corinth that he had got his name surreptitiously inserted on the military list; that he was not striving lawfully; had no right to the <i>stadium</i>, and none to the <i>crown</i>.
