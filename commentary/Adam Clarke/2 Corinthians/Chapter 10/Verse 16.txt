<p>Verse 16. <i><b>To preach the Gospel in the</b></i><b> regions </b><i><b>beyond you</b></i> — He probably refers to those parts of the <i>Morea</i>, such as <i>Sparta</i>, c., that lay <i>southward</i> of them and to <i>Italy</i>, which lay on the <i>west</i>; for it does not appear that he considered his <i>measure</i> or <i>province</i> to extend to <i>Libya</i>, or any part of <i>Africa</i>. See the Introduction, sec. xii.</p>
<p><i><b>Not to boast in another man's line</b></i> — So very scrupulous was the apostle not to build on another man's foundation, that he would not even go to those places where other apostles were labouring. He appears to think that every apostle had a particular <i>district</i> or <i>province</i> of the heathen world allotted to him, and which God commissioned him to convert to the Christian faith. No doubt every apostle was influenced in the same way; and this was a wise order of God; for by these means the Gospel was more <i>quickly</i> spread through the heathen provinces than it otherwise would have been. The apostles had <i>deacons</i> or <i>ministers</i> with them whose business it was to <i>water</i> the seed sown; but the <i>apostles</i> alone, under Christ, <i>sowed</i> and <i>planted</i>.</p>
