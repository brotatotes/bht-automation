<p>Verse 17. <i><b>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</b></i> â€” Instead of boasting or exulting even in your own success in preaching the Gospel, as none can be successful without the especial blessing of God, let God who gave the blessing have the glory. Even the genuine apostle, who has his commission immediately from God himself, takes no praise to himself from the prosperity of his work, but gives it all to God. How little cause then have your <i>uncommissioned men</i> to boast, to whom God has assigned no province, and who <i>only boast in another man's line of</i> <i>things made ready to their hand</i>!</p>
