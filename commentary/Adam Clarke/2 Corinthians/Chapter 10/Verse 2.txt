<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:2">2 Corinthians 10:2</span>. <i><b>Some, which think of us as if we walked according to</b></i><b> </b><i><b>the flesh.</b></i> â€” As it is customary for <i>cowards</i> and <i>overbearing men</i> to <i>threaten</i> the <i>weak</i> and the <i>timid</i> when <i>present</i>; to <i>bluster</i> when <i>absent</i>; and to be very <i>obsequious</i> in the presence of the <i>strong</i> and <i>courageous</i>. This conduct they appear to have charged against the apostle, which he calls here <i>walking after the flesh</i>- acting as a man who had worldly <i>ends</i> in view, and would use any <i>means</i> in order to accomplish them.</p>
