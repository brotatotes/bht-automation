Verse 2 Corinthians 10:2. Some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. â€” As it is customary for cowards and overbearing men to threaten the weak and the timid when present; to bluster when absent; and to be very obsequious in the presence of the strong and courageous. This conduct they appear to have charged against the apostle, which he calls here walking after the flesh- acting as a man who had worldly ends in view, and would use any means in order to accomplish them.
