<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3">2 Corinthians 10:3</span>. <i><b>Though we walk in the flesh</b></i> â€” That is: Although I am in the common condition of human nature, and must live as a human being, yet I do <i>not war after the flesh</i>-I do not act the coward or the poltroon, as they insinuate. I have a good cause, a good captain, strength at will, and courage at hand. I neither fear <i>them</i> nor their <i>master</i>.</p>
