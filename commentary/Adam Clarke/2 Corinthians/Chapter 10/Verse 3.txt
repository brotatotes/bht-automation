Verse 2 Corinthians 10:3. Though we walk in the flesh â€” That is: Although I am in the common condition of human nature, and must live as a human being, yet I do not war after the flesh-I do not act the coward or the poltroon, as they insinuate. I have a good cause, a good captain, strength at will, and courage at hand. I neither fear them nor their master.
