<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:5">2 Corinthians 10:5</span>. <i><b>Casting down imaginations</b></i> — δογισμους. <i>Reasonings</i> or <i>opinions</i>. The Greek philosophers valued themselves especially on their <i>ethic systems</i>, in which their reasonings appeared to be very <i>profound</i> and <i>conclusive</i>; but they were obliged to <i>assume</i> <i>principles</i> which were either such as did not exist, or were false in themselves, as the whole of their <i>mythologic</i> system most evidently was: truly, from what remains of them we see that their <i>metaphysics</i> were generally bombast; and as to their <i>philosophy</i>, it was in general good for nothing. When the apostles came against their <i>gods many</i> and their <i>lords many</i> with the ONE SUPREME and ETERNAL BEING, they were confounded, scattered, annihilated; when they came against their various <i>modes</i> of <i>purifying the mind</i>-their <i>sacrificial</i> and <i>mediatorial</i> system, with the LORD JESUS CHRIST, his <i>agony</i> and <i>bloody sweat</i>, his <i>cross</i> and <i>passion</i>, his <i>death</i> and <i>burial</i>, and his <i>glorious resurrection</i> and <i>ascension,</i> they sunk before them, and appeared to be what they really were, as dust upon the balance, and lighter than vanity.</p>
<p><i><b>Every high thing</b></i> — Even the pretendedly <i>sublime doctrines</i>, for instance, of <i>Plato, Aristotle</i>, and the <i>Stoics</i> in general, fell before the simple preaching of Christ crucified.</p>
<p><i><b>The knowledge of God</b></i> — The doctrine of the <i>unity</i> and <i>eternity</i> of the <i>Divine nature</i>, which was opposed by the <i>plurality</i> of their idols, and the <i>generation</i> of their gods, and their <i>men-made</i> deities. It is amazing how feeble a resistance heathenism made, by <i>argument</i> or <i>reasoning</i>, against the doctrine of the Gospel! It instantly shrunk from the Divine light, and called on the <i>secular</i> power to contend for it! <i>Popery</i> sunk before <i>Protestantism</i> in the same way, and defended itself by the same <i>means</i>. The <i>apostles</i> destroyed <i>heathenism</i> wherever they came; the <i>Protestants</i> confuted <i>popery</i> wherever their voice was permitted to be heard.</p>
<p><i><b>Bringing into captivity every thought</b></i> — HEATHENISM could not recover itself; in vain did its thousands of altars smoke with reiterated hecatombs, their demons were silent, and their idols were proved to be <i>nothing in the world</i>. POPERY could never, by any power of self-reviviscence, restore itself after its defeat by the Reformation: it had no <i>Scripture</i>, consecutively understood; no <i>reason</i>, no <i>argument</i>; in vain were its <i>bells</i> rung, its <i>candles</i> lighted, its <i>auto da fe's</i> exhibited; in vain did its <i>fires blaze</i>; and in vain were innumerable human victims immolated on <i>its</i> altars! The light of God penetrated its hidden works of darkness, and dragged its <i>three-headed</i> Cerberus into open day; the monster sickened, vomited his <i>henbane</i>, and fled for refuge to his native <i>shades</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>The obedience of Christ</b></i> — Subjection to idols was annihilated by the progress of the Gospel among the heathens; and they soon had but <i>one</i> Lord, and his name <i>one</i>. In like manner the doctrines of the <i>reformation</i>, mighty through God, <i>pulled down</i>-demolished and <i>brought into captivity</i>, the whole papal system; and instead of <i>obedience to the pope</i>, the pretended vicar of God upon earth, <i>obedience to Christ</i>, as the sole almighty Head of the Church, was established, particularly in Great Britain, where it continues to prevail. Hallelujah! the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!</p>
