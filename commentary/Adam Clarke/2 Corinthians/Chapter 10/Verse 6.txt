<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:6">2 Corinthians 10:6</span>. <i><b>And having in a readiness to revenge all</b></i><b> </b><i><b>disobedience</b></i> — I am ready, through this mighty armour of God, to punish those opposers of the doctrine of Christ, and the disobedience which has been produced by them.</p>
<p><i><b>When your obedience is fulfilled.</b></i> — When you have in the fullest manner, discountenanced those men, and separated yourselves from their communion. The apostle was not in haste to pull up the <i>tares</i>, lest he should pull up the <i>wheat</i> also.</p>
<p>All the terms in these two verses are <i>military</i>. Allusion is made to a <i>strongly fortifed city</i>, where the enemy had made his <i>last stand; entrenching</i> himself about the <i>walls; strengthening</i> all his <i>redoubts</i> and <i>ramparts</i>; raising <i>castles, towers</i>, and <i>various</i> <i>engines</i> of defence and offence upon the walls; and neglecting nothing that might tend to render his <i>strong hold</i> impregnable. The army of God comes against the place and attacks it; the <i>strong</i> <i>holds</i> οχυροματα, all the <i>fortified places</i>, are carried. The <i>imaginations</i>, λογισμοι, <i>engines</i>, and whatever the <i>imagination</i> or <i>skill</i> of man could raise, are speedily taken and destroyed. Every <i>high thing</i>, παν υψωμα, <i>all</i> the <i>castles</i> and <i>towers</i> are <i>sapped, thrown down</i> and <i>demolished</i>; the <i>walls</i> are <i>battered</i> into <i>breaches</i>; and the besieging army, carrying every thing at the point of the sword, enter the city, storm and take the citadel. Every where defeated, the conquered submit, and are brought into <i>captivity</i>, αιχμαλωτιζοντες, <i>are led away captives</i>; and thus the whole government is destroyed.</p>
<p>It is easy to apply these things, as far as may be consistent with the apostle's design. The general <i>sense</i> I have given in the preceding notes.</p>
