Verse 2 Corinthians 10:6. And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience — I am ready, through this mighty armour of God, to punish those opposers of the doctrine of Christ, and the disobedience which has been produced by them.When your obedience is fulfilled. — When you have in the fullest manner, discountenanced those men, and separated yourselves from their communion. The apostle was not in haste to pull up the tares, lest he should pull up the wheat also.All the terms in these two verses are military. Allusion is made to a strongly fortifed city, where the enemy had made his last stand; entrenching himself about the walls; strengthening all his redoubts and ramparts; raising castles, towers, and various engines of defence and offence upon the walls; and neglecting nothing that might tend to render his strong hold impregnable. The army of God comes against the place and attacks it; the strong holds οχυροματα, all the fortified places, are carried. The imaginations, λογισμοι, engines, and whatever the imagination or skill of man could raise, are speedily taken and destroyed. Every high thing, παν υψωμα, all the castles and towers are sapped, thrown down and demolished; the walls are battered into breaches; and the besieging army, carrying every thing at the point of the sword, enter the city, storm and take the citadel. Every where defeated, the conquered submit, and are brought into captivity, αιχμαλωτιζοντες, are led away captives; and thus the whole government is destroyed.It is easy to apply these things, as far as may be consistent with the apostle's design. The general sense I have given in the preceding notes.
