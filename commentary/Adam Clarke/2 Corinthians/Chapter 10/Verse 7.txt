<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:7">2 Corinthians 10:7</span>. <i><b>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance?</b></i> — Do not be carried away with <i>appearances</i>; do not be satisfied with <i>show</i> and <i>parade</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's</b></i> — Here, as in several other places of this and the preceding epistle, the τις, <i>any</i> or <i>certain, person</i>, most evidently refers to the <i>false apostle</i> who made so much disturbance in the Church. And this man <i>trusted</i> <i>to himself</i>-assumed to himself that he was <i>Christ's</i> messenger: it would not do to attempt to <i>subvert</i> Christianity at once; it had got too strong a hold of Corinth to be easily dislodged; he therefore pretended to be on Christ's side, and to derive his authority from him.</p>
<p><i><b>Let him of himself</b></i> — Without any authority, certainly, from God; but, as he arrogates to himself the character of a minister of Christ, let him acknowledge that even so we are Christ's ministers; and that <i>I</i> have, by my preaching, and the miracles which I have wrought, given the fullest proof that <i>I</i> am especially commissioned by him.</p>
