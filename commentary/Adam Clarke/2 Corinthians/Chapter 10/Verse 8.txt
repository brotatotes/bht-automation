Verse 2 Corinthians 10:8. For, though I should boast, c.] I have a greater authority and spiritual power than I have yet shown, both to edify and to punish but I employ this for your edification in righteousness, and not for the destruction of any delinquent. "This," says Calmet, "is the rule which the pastors of the Church ever propose to themselves in the exercise of their authority; whether to enjoin or forbid, to dispense or to oblige, to bind or to loose. They should use this power only as Jesus Christ used it-for the salvation, and not for the destruction, of souls."
