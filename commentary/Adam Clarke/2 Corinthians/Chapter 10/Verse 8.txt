<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span>. <i><b>For, though I should boast</b></i>, c.] I have a greater authority and spiritual power than I have yet shown, both to <i>edify</i> and to <i>punish</i> but I employ this for your <i>edification in</i> <i>righteousness</i>, and not for the <i>destruction</i> of any delinquent. "This," says Calmet, "is the rule which the pastors of the Church ever propose to themselves in the exercise of their authority; whether to enjoin or forbid, to dispense or to oblige, to bind or to loose. They should use this power only as Jesus Christ used it-for the salvation, and not for the destruction, of souls."</p>
