<p>Nothing could mortify these persons more than to find that the apostle did take nothing, and was resolved to take nothing; while <i>they</i> were fleecing the people. It is certain that the passage is not to be understood as though the false apostles took nothing from the people, to whatever disinterestedness they might pretend, for the apostle is positive on the contrary; and he was determined to act so that his example should not authorize these deceivers, who had nothing but their <i>self-interest</i> in view, to exact contribution from the people; so that if they continued to boast, they must be <i>bound even as the apostle</i>, taking <i>nothing for their</i> <i>labours</i>; which could never comport with <i>their</i> views of gain and secular profit.</p>
