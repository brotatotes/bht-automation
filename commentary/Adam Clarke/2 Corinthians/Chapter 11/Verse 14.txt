<p>Verse 14. <i><b>And no marvel</b></i> — καιουθαυμαστον. And no wonder; it need not surprise you what the <i>disciples</i> do, when you consider the character of the <i>master</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</b></i> — As in <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span> the apostle had the history of the <i>temptation</i> and <i>fall of man</i> particularly in view, it is very likely that here he refers to the same thing. In what ever <i>form</i> Satan appeared to our first mother, his pretensions and professions gave him the appearance of a <i>good</i> angel; and by pretending that Eve should get a great increase of <i>light</i>, that is, <i>wisdom</i> and <i>understanding</i>, he <i>deceived</i> her, and led her to transgress. It is generally said that Satan has <i>three forms</i> under which he tempts men:</p>
<p>1. The <i>subtle serpent</i>.</p>
<p>2. The <i>roaring lion</i>.</p>
<p>3. The <i>angel of light</i>.</p>
<p>He often, as the <i>angel</i> <i>of light</i>, persuades men to do things under the <i>name of religion</i>, which are subversive of it. Hence all the <i>persecutions, faggots</i>, and <i>fires</i> of a certain Church, under pretence of keeping <i>heresy</i> out of the Church; and hence all the <i>horrors</i> and <i>infernalities</i> of the <i>inquisition</i>. In the form of heathen persecution, like a <i>lion</i> he has ravaged the heritage of the Lord. And by means of our <i>senses</i> and <i>passions</i>, as the <i>subtle serpent</i>, he is frequently deceiving us, so that often the <i>workings</i> of <i>corrupt nature</i> are mistaken for the <i>operations</i> of the <i>Spirit</i> of <i>God</i>.</p>
