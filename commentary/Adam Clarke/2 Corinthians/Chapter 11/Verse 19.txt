Verse 19. Ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. â€” A very fine irony. Ye are so profoundly wise as to be able to discern that I am a fool. Well, it would be dishonourable to you as wise men to fall out with a fool; you will therefore gladly bear with his impertinence and foolishness because of your own profound wisdom.
