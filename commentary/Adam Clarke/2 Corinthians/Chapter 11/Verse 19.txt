<p>Verse 19. <i><b>Ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye</b></i><b> yourselves </b><i><b>are</b></i><b> </b><i><b>wise.</b></i> â€” A very fine irony. Ye are so profoundly <i>wise</i> as to be able to discern that I am a <i>fool</i>. Well, it would be dishonourable to you as <i>wise men</i> to fall out with a <i>fool</i>; you will therefore gladly bear with his impertinence and foolishness because of your own profound wisdom.</p>
