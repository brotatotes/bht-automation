<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>. <i><b>I am jealous over you</b></i>, c.] The apostle evidently alludes either to the שושבינים <i>shoshabinim</i> or <i>paranymphs</i> among the Hebrews, whose office is largely explained in the notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>, and the observations at the end of that chapter <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span><i>"</i> or to the <i>harmosyni</i>, a sort of magistrates among the Lacedemonians who had the care of virgins, and whose business it was to see them well <i>educated</i>, kept <i>pure</i>, and properly <i>prepared</i> for married life.</p>
<p><i><b>That I may present</b></i><b> you as </b><i><b>a chaste virgin</b></i> — The allusion is still kept up; and there seems to be a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="le+21:14">Leviticus 21:14</span>, that the high priest must not marry any one that was not a <i>pure</i> <i>virgin</i>. Here, then, <i>Christ</i> is the high priest, the <i>spouse</i> or <i>husband</i>; the <i>Corinthian Church</i> the <i>pure virgin</i> to be espoused; the <i>apostle</i> and his helpers the <i>shoshabinim</i>, or <i>harmosyni</i>, who had <i>educated</i> and <i>prepared</i> this virgin for her husband, and espoused her to him. See the observations already referred to at the end of the <i>third chapter of John</i>. <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span><i>"</i></p>
