<p>Verse 20. <i><b>For ye suffer</b></i> — As you are so <i>meek</i> and <i>gentle</i> as to submit to be brought into <i>bondage</i>, to have your property <i>devoured</i>, your goods <i>taken</i> away, yourselves laid in the dust, so that others may <i>exalt</i> themselves over you, yea, and will bear from those the most degrading <i>indignity</i>; then of course, you will bear with <i>one</i> who has never <i>insulted, defrauded, devoured, taken</i> of you, <i>exalted</i> himself against you, or offered you any kind of indignity; and who only wishes you to bear his confident boasting, concerning matters which he can substantiate.</p>
<p>The expressions in this verse are some evidence that the false apostle was a <i>Judaizing</i> teacher. <i>You suffer</i>, says the apostle, <i>if</i> <i>a man</i>, καταδουλοι, <i>bring you into bondage</i>, probably meaning to the Jewish <i>rites</i> and <i>ceremonies</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>. <i>If he devour you</i>; as the Pharisees did the patrimony of the widows, and for a pretence made long prayers; <i>if a man take of</i> <i>you</i>, exact different contributions, pretendedly for the temple at Jerusalem, c. <i>If he exalt himself</i>, pretending to be of the seed of Abraham, infinitely higher in honour and dignity than all the families of the Gentiles <i>if he smite you on the face</i>-treat you with indignity, as the Jews did the Gentiles, considering them only as <i>dogs</i>, and not fit to be ranked with any of the descendants of Jacob.</p>
