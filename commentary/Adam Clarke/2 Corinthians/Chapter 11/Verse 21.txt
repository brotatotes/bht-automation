<p>Verse 21. <i><b>I speak as concerning reproach</b></i> â€” Dr. Whitby thus paraphrases this verse: "That which I said of <i>smiting you upon the</i> <i>face, I speak as concerning</i> the <i>reproach</i> they cast upon you as profane and uncircumcised, whereas <i>they</i> all profess to be a holy nation; <i>as though we had been weak</i>-inferior to them in these things, not able to ascribe to ourselves those advantages as well as they. <i>Howbeit, whereinsoever any is bold</i>, and can justly value himself on these advantages, <i>I am bold also</i>, and can claim the same distinctions, though <i>I speak foolishly</i> in setting any value on those things; but it is necessary that I should show that such men have not even one <i>natural good</i> that they can boast of beyond <i>me</i>."</p>
