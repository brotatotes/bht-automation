<p>Verse 22. <i><b>Are they Hebrews</b></i> — Speaking the <i>sacred language</i>, and <i>reading</i> in the congregation from the Hebrew Scriptures? the same is my own language.</p>
<p><i><b>Are they Israelites</b></i> — Regularly descended from <i>Jacob</i>, and not from <i>Esau</i>? I am also one.</p>
<p><i><b>Are they the seed of Abraham</b></i> — Circumcised, and in the bond of the covenant? <i>So am I</i>. I am no <i>proselyte</i>, but I am a <i>Hebrew of</i> <i>the Hebrews</i> both by father and mother; and can trace my genealogy, through the tribe of <i>Benjamin</i>, up to the father of the faithful.</p>
