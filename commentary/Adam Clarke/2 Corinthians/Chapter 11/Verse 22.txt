Verse 22. Are they Hebrews — Speaking the sacred language, and reading in the congregation from the Hebrew Scriptures? the same is my own language.Are they Israelites — Regularly descended from Jacob, and not from Esau? I am also one.Are they the seed of Abraham — Circumcised, and in the bond of the covenant? So am I. I am no proselyte, but I am a Hebrew of the Hebrews both by father and mother; and can trace my genealogy, through the tribe of Benjamin, up to the father of the faithful.
