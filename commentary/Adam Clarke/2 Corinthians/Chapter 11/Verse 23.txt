<p>Verse 23. <i><b>Are they ministers of Christ</b></i> — So we find that these were professors of Christianity; and that they were genuine <i>Jews</i>, and such as endeavoured to incorporate <i>both</i> systems, and, no doubt, to oblige those who had believed to be circumcised; and this appears to have been the <i>bondage</i> into which they had brought many of the believing Corinthians.</p>
<p><i><b>I</b></i><b> am </b><i><b>more</b></i> — More of a minister of Christ than they are, and have given fuller proofs of it. I have suffered persecution for the cross of Christ, and of the <i>Jews</i> too; and had I preached up the necessity of <i>circumcision</i>, I should have been as free from opposition as these are.</p>
<p><i><b>In labours more abundant</b></i> — Far from sitting down to take my ease in a Church already gathered into Christ; I travel incessantly, preach every where, and at all risks, in order to get the heathen brought from the empire of darkness into the kingdom of God's beloved Son.</p>
<p><i><b>In stripes above measure</b></i> — Being beaten by the <i>heathen</i>, who had no particular <i>rule</i> according to which they scourged criminals; and we find, from <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:22">Acts 16:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>, that they beat Paul <i>unmercifully</i> with <i>many stripes</i>. See the note on the above passage.</p>
<p><i><b>In prisons more frequent</b></i> — See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:11">Acts 21:11</span>, and the whole of the apostle's history; and his long imprisonment of at least <i>two years</i> at Rome, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:16">Acts 28:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:30">Acts 28:30</span>. It does not appear that there is any one instance of a false apostle having been imprisoned for the testimony of Christ; this was a badge of the true apostles.</p>
<p><i><b>In deaths oft.</b></i> — That is, in the most imminent dangers. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:31">1 Corinthians 15:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span>. And see the apostle's history in the Acts.</p>
