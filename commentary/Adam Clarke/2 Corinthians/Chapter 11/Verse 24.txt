<p>Verse 24. <i><b>Of the Jews five times received I forty</b></i><b> stripes </b><i><b>save</b></i><b> </b><i><b>one.</b></i> — That is, he was five times scourged by the Jews, whose law (<span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="de+25:3">Deuteronomy 25:3</span>) allowed forty stripes; but they, pretending to be lenient, and to act <i>within the letter</i> of the law, inflicted but thirty-nine.</p>
<p>To except <i>one</i> stripe from the <i>forty</i> was a very ancient canon among the Jews, as we learn from <i>Josephus</i>, Antiq. lib. iv. ch. viii. sec. 21, who mentions the same thing: πληγας μιας λειπουσης τεσσαπακοντα· <i>forty stripes, excepting one</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Mishna</i> gives this as a rule, MISH., <i>Maccoth</i>, fol. 22, 10: "How often shall he, the culprit, be smitten? Ans. ארבעים תמר אתר forty stripes, wanting one; i.e. with the number which is highest to forty."</p>
<p>Frequently a man was scourged according to his <i>ability</i> to bear the punishment; and it is a canon in the <i>Mishna</i>, "That he who cannot bear <i>forty</i> stripes should receive only <i>eighteen</i>, and yet be considered as having suffered the whole punishment."</p>
<p>They also thought it right to stop under <i>forty</i>, lest the person who counted should make a mistake, and the criminal get more than <i>forty</i> stripes, which would be injustice, as the law required only <i>forty</i>.</p>
<p>The manner in which this punishment was inflicted is described in the <i>Mishna</i>, fol. 22, 2: "The two hands of the criminal are bound to a post, and then the servant of the synagogue either pulls or tears off his clothes till he leaves his breast and shoulders bare. A stone or block is placed behind him on which the servant stands; he holds in his hands a scourge made of leather, divided into four tails. He who scourges lays one third on the criminal's <i>breast</i>, another third on his <i>right shoulder</i>, and another on his <i>left</i>. The man who receives the punishment is neither <i>sitting</i> nor <i>standing</i>, but all the while <i>stooping</i>; and the man smites with all his strength, with one hand." The severity of this punishment depends on the nature of the <i>scourge</i>, and the <i>strength</i> of the executioner.</p>
<p>It is also observed that the Jews did not <i>repeat</i> scourgings except for enormous offences. But they had scourged the apostle <i>five</i> times; for with those murderers no quarter would be given to the <i>disciples</i>, as none was given to the <i>Master</i>. See <i>Schoettgen</i>.</p>
