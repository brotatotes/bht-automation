<p>Verse 25. <i><b>Thrice was I beaten with rods</b></i> — This was under the Roman government, as their <i>lictors</i> beat criminals in this way. We hear of the apostle's being treated thus <i>once</i>, namely at Philippi, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:22">Acts 16:22</span>. See sec. 9 of the introduction.</p>
<p><i><b>Once was I stoned</b></i> — Namely, at <i>Lystra</i>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span>, c.</p>
<p><i><b>A night and a day I have been in the deep</b></i> — To what this refers we cannot tell it is generally supposed that in some shipwreck not on record the apostle had saved himself on a plank, and was a whole day and night on the sea, tossed about at the mercy of the waves. Others think that βυθος, the deep, signifies a <i>dungeon</i> of a terrible nature at <i>Cyzicum</i>, in the <i>Propontis</i>, into which Paul was cast as he passed from Troas. But this is not likely.</p>
