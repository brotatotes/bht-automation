<p>Verse 28. <i><b>Beside those things that are without</b></i> — Independently of all these outward things, I have innumerable troubles and mental oppressions.</p>
<p><i><b>Which cometh upon me</b></i> — Ἡ επισυατασις· <i>This continual press</i> of business; this <i>insurrection</i> of cases to be heard, solved, and determined, relative to the doctrine, discipline, state, persecution, and supply of all the Churches.</p>
<p>All his perils were little in comparison of what he felt relative to the peace, government, and establishment of all the Churches among the Gentiles; for as he was the apostle of the Gentiles, the government of all the Churches among these fell in some sort on him, whether they were of his own planting or of the planting of others. See <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>. None but a conscientious minister, who has at heart the salvation of souls, can enter into the apostle's feelings in this place.</p>
