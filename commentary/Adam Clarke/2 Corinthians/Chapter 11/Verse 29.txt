<p>Verse 29. <i><b>Who is weak</b></i> — What Church is there under persecution, with which I do not immediately sympathize? or who, from his <i>weakness</i> in the <i>faith</i>, and <i>scrupulousness</i> of conscience, is likely to be stumbled, or turned out of the way, to whom I do not condescend, and whose burden I do not bear?</p>
<p><i><b>Who is offended</b></i> — Or likely to be turned out of the way, <i>and I</i> <i>burn not</i> with zeal to restore and confirm him? This seems to be the sense of these different questions.</p>
