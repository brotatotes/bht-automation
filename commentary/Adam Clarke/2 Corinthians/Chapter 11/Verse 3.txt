<p>Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span>. <i><b>As the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty</b></i> — This is a strong reflection on the false apostle and his teaching: he was <i>subtle</i>, πανουργος and by his subtlety (πανουργια, from παν, <i>all</i>, and εργον, <i>work</i>; his <i>versatility</i> of character and conduct, his <i>capability</i> of <i>doing all work</i>, and accommodating himself to the caprices, prejudices, and evil propensities of those to whom he ministered) he was enabled to corrupt the minds of the people from the simplicity of the Gospel of Christ; or, to follow the <i>metaphor</i>, he had <i>seduced</i> the <i>pure, chaste, well</i> <i>educated virgin</i>, from her duty, affection, and allegiance to her one only true husband, the high priest, Jesus Christ. And here he seems to intimate that the serpent had seduced the mind of Eve from her affections and allegiance to Adam, her true husband; and certainly from God, her creator and governor. See at the end of the chapter. <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:33">2 Corinthians 11:33</span><i>"</i></p>
