<p>Verse 30. <i><b>I will glory - which concern mine infirmities.</b></i> — I will not boast of my <i>natural</i> or <i>acquired powers</i>; neither in what <i>God</i> has done by me; but rather in what I have <i>suffered</i> for <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>Many persons have understood by <i>infirmities</i> what they call <i>the</i> <i>indwelling sin</i> of the apostle, and say that "he gloried in this, because the grace of Christ was the more magnified in his being preserved from ruin, notwithstanding this indwelling adversary." And to support this most unholy interpretation, they quote those other words of the apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:9">2 Corinthians 12:9</span>: <i>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities</i>, my indwelling corruptions, <i>that the power of Christ</i>, in chaining the fierce lion, <i>may rest upon me</i>. But it would be difficult to produce a single passage in the whole New Testament where the word ασθενεια, which we translate <i>infirmity</i>, has the sense of <i>sin</i> or <i>moral corruption</i>. The verb ασθενεω signifies to be <i>weak, infirm,</i> <i>sick, poor, despicable</i> through <i>poverty</i>, c. And in a few places it is applied to <i>weakness in the faith</i>, to <i>young converts</i>, who are poor in religious knowledge, not yet fully instructed in the nature of the Gospel; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:19">Romans 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:2">Romans 14:2</span>. And it is applied to the works of the law, to point out their <i>inability</i> to <i>justify</i> a sinner, <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>. But to <i>inward sin</i>, and <i>inward corruption</i> it is never applied. I am afraid that what these persons call their <i>infirmities</i> may rather be called their <i>strengths</i>; the <i>prevailing</i> and <i>frequently</i> <i>ruling</i> power of pride, anger, ill-will, c. for how few think <i>evil tempers</i> to be <i>sins</i>! The gentle term <i>infirmity</i> softens down the iniquity; and as St. Paul, so great and so holy a man, say they, had his infirmities, how can they expect to be without theirs? These should know that they are in a dangerous error; that St. Paul means nothing of the kind; for he speaks of his <i>sufferings</i>, and of these alone. One word more: would not the <i>grace</i> and <i>power</i> of <i>Christ</i> appear more conspicuous in <i>slaying</i> <i>the lion</i> than in keeping him <i>chained</i>? in <i>destroying sin, root</i> and <i>branch</i>; and filling the soul with his own <i>holiness</i>, with <i>love</i> <i>to God and man</i>, with the <i>mind</i>-all the <i>holy heavenly tempers</i>, that were in <i>himself</i>; than in leaving these impure and unholy tempers, ever to <i>live</i> and <i>often</i> to <i>reign</i> in the heart? The doctrine is discreditable to the Gospel, and wholly antichristian.</p>
