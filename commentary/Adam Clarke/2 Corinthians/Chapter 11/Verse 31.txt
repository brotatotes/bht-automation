<p>Verse 31. <i><b>The God and Father of our Lord</b></i> â€” Here is a very solemn <i>asseveration</i>; an <i>appeal</i> to the <i>ever blessed God</i> for the truth of what he asserts. It is something similar to his <i>asseveration</i> or <i>oath</i> in ver. 10 of this chapter; <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10">2 Corinthians 11:10</span> see also <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:20">Galatians 1:20</span>. And from these and several other places we learn that the apostle thought it right thus to <i>confirm</i> his assertions on these particular occasions. But here is nothing to countenance profane swearing, or taking the name of God in vain, as many do in <i>exclamations</i>, when surprised, or on hearing something unexpected, c. and as others do who, conscious of their own <i>falsity</i>, endeavour to gain credit by appeals to God for the truth of what they say. St. Paul's <i>appeal to God</i> is in the same spirit as his most earnest <i>prayer</i>. This solemn appeal the apostle makes in reference to what he mentions in the following verses. This was a fact not yet generally known.</p>
