<p>Verse 32. <i><b>In Damascus the governor under Aretas</b></i> — For a description of Damascus see the note on <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:2">Acts 9:2</span><i>"</i>. And for the transaction to which the apostle refers see <span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:23">Acts 9:23</span>. As to King <i>Aretas</i>, there were three of this name. The <i>first</i> is mentioned <i>2 Maccab. v. 8</i>. The <i>second</i> by <i>Josephus</i>, Antiq. l. xiii. c. 15, sec. 2; and l. xvi. c. 1, sec. 4. The <i>third</i>, who is the person supposed to be referred to here, was the father-in-law of Herod Antipas, of whom see the notes, <i>"</i><span class="scriptRef" com="acc" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:23">Acts 9:23</span><i>"</i>, c.</p>
<p>But it is a question of some importance, How could Damascus, a city of <i>Syria</i>, be under the government of an Arabian king? It may be accounted for thus: Herod Antipas, who married the daughter of Aretas, divorced her, in order to marry Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. Aretas, on this indignity offered to his family, made war upon Herod. Herod applied to <i>Tiberius</i> for help, and the emperor sent <i>Vitellius</i> to reduce Aretas, and to bring him alive or dead to Rome. By some means or other Vitellius delayed his operations, and in the meantime Tiberius died and thus Aretas was snatched from ruin, Joseph., Antiq. lib. xviii. c. 5. What Aretas did in the interim is not known; but it is conjectured that he availed himself of the then favourable state of things, made an irruption into Syria, and seized on Damascus. See <i>Rosenmuller</i>; and see the introduction to this epistle, sec. ii.</p>
<p><i><b>The governor</b></i> — εθναρχης. Who this ethnarch was, we cannot tell. The word <i>ethnarch</i> signifies the governor of a province, under a king or emperor.</p>
<p><i><b>Desirous to apprehend me</b></i> — The enemies of the apostle might have represented him to the governor as a dangerous spy, employed by the <i>Romans</i>.</p>
